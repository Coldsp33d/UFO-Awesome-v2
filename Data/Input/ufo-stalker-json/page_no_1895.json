in the city, still no lights were visible. only radio towers and sometimes a house light in the far distance could be seen but very rarely did this ever happen. the radio tower was very close, so it's light was very high up in the sky. the house light was only visible when you were directly at the window, and looking south-east. it was fall/winter because leaves were not on the trees. my window faced the east, as did my bed. \r\ni was laying in bed one night, and looked out my window from across the room. i noticed something that was not normally there. it was a red light at about eye level with me. me being on the 2nd floor on my home i thought \"hmm, that's really odd..\" and didnt really think anything of it. but as i laid in bed, i began to wonder.. i looked back up and the circular light was still there. i sat and stared at it for a moment, and it began to slightly move. i thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me, so i looked harder. as i moved my head up and down to see if it was just me, the light stayed level with my eyes. at this point, i was pretty freaked out. i got out of bed to investigate, which is very uncharacteristic of me, because i am a scardy-cat. me being young, i thought that someone was in the tree recording me or something, but i wasnt scared in the least. it was almost as if it drew me towards it, and i was calm. as i stared harder into the pitch black woods, it seemed to fade away. i thought it was very strange and fell asleep. the next night it was visible again. and the next. after that, it would sometimes be there, sometimes not. about 2 weeks passed with no orbs in sight. one night that it appeared i was staring at it, and it split into two orbs that began revolving in a figure eight pattern. i again was \"drawn\" to the window. i just stared. i really did not know what it was. the two red orbs would almost \"chase\" each other, and then return to the one orb, still moving in a figure eight pattern. after another night of the two orbsi remember telliing my mom that i saw it and she just really disregarded it, as any skeptical mother would her child. i was never scared, just very interested, which sparked my intrest in shows like ufo files and ufo hunters. i loved it. 2 years ago we moved houses, and was home watching my favorite show ufo hunters. the episode was about orbs. i didnt think anything about it until it showed an artist's rendering of an orb, and the feelings that it caused in people. i froze. it was the exact type of thing that i saw 4(ish) years ago. i knew that what i saw was not ordinary or normal. i never got any bad feelings from staring at it, i was calm and curious. i am a freshman in college, intelligent, from a good family, high test scores, and otherwise honest. i am telling my story for the first time. thank you.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

my left in the sky and saw an object.1 then 2 objects shaped like two triangles the skin on the object was like a mirror or polished aluminum.They were moving or floating northwest.I have been in aviation as a mechanic and a flight crew member for 28 years at the time.I knew of england air force base 60 miles away but it had been closed for years.Then the sun's rays hit the skin of the object and it was blinding like a mirror,i thought maybe it was world war ii aircraft with polished aluminum but those are special and have to have a permitt from the faa to have that type skin.Then i looked for wings,there was no rotor blades,propellers,exhaust,ice crystals as if jet at high altitude,no noise just moving to our left silently.Then there was4 more shapes appeared just like the first 2 shapes.They were about 300ft.To 600ft.They were in a flight formation of one on top two underneath then 2 under that then one under that.I said to my wife what is that she said it looks like triangle polished aliminum shark fins.I replied yes that is what i see.I had a video camera in the back seat but i though if i stop they will be gone.Then they flew thru some light clouds then disappering by 2 then down to 1 then they were gone.I have searched the internet and found that shape in somebody else's photo.I stil;l question my wife what did u see she said polished flying shark fins,she don't

very big and a perfect triangle with a light in three places.  the other appears smaller but it is much higher up so i don't know. they just stayed there in the same place the whole time. what i do know is, the smaller one was an elongnated triangle and it was blinking red and blue. i watched it for over an hour.  my sons friend who is about 22-23 years old came over and he started showing me different star systems and named them by name. i pointed to the smaller triangle and asked him what was that?  he said, \"i don't know, it looks like a ship.\" we laughed a little, but we both just kept looking at it. i asked him if he thought what i was seeing as a perfect triangle looked like a ship and he said, \"it seems different than stars--maybe\". after a while he left and i starred for maybe a half hour trying to get a better mental picture of the big one and finally went into the house. i felt stange at the time and got a bit light headed looking up for so long. i don't have cameras that would have taken a good picture.\r\n\r\nnow, i am a school teacher and i just pay attention to things. this is not the first time i have seen something like this.  i saw a really big triangle one time just over the other side of the river, north of the town bridge this past fall. it just stayed there.  i kept looking for information as its hard for me to believe no one else saw this.  well, if they did, they didn't report it. i figured i should mind my own buisness so never said anything, but now, it seems odd to see it again and this time another one at that. i am going to talk to the tech person at my school and find out what kind of camera to buy to get a good shot for long distance and have it on the ready.  my cell phone would not have been able to pick this up so i didn't bother.  anyway, i just thought someone needed to say something and i'll keep my eyes open and get a camera.  if you have any advice, i'd like to hear it. its rather spooky because we are a small town of about 18,000 people stretched out all over a pretty big area. i cannot figure what the attraction would be, but i'm telling you i saw those two triangle whatever they

was sitting on my front porch steps, looking at a clump of telephone wires that had been tied off in a spidery looking shape. day-dreaming, resting. my eyes absent-mindedly followed one of the telephone lines over my sidewalk, to my right, and that is how i happened to notice a very distinct, yet almost unnoticeable (if i hadn't have looked almost exactly at it's spot accidently) silver-ish tiny 'dot'(a teensy bit bigger than a dot) just off the phone-line, to my perspective.  it was obviously miles away, to north, and quite high up. so i just kept staring at it, wondering what it could possibly be. this was broad daylight, but i could see the sunlight glinting off of it to 'its' west, the direction of the sun at that time. \r\n\r\none thing that struck me also, was that there's no way i would ever have noticed it, unless i looked almost exactly at its spot in the sky. but i wonder how it may have looked to anyone under it, or nearer to it.  \r\n\r\ni didn't dare take my eyes off of it, for fear i'd lose it.  so i sat there for a good 10 mins, thinking about the oddity of it. mainly that it\r\nkept it's exact position as i referenced it to the telephone line (as my marker). it wasn't moving in relation to me. after about 10 mins., i finally decided to run inside to see if my binoculars were somewhere easy to find. no, couldn't find them quickly so i went back outside and looked and it was still there, so i sat back down to keep watching it.  \r\n\r\nafter another minute (approx.) i saw it shoot to the west, slightly upward in a split second, and then it was gone.\r\n\r\ni think about it a lot, even these many years later. wish i could see it again. ;-d \r\n\r\np.S. i did try to figure out approx what area it was over, which i realized was hard to fathom exactly due to how high and i didn't really know how big/far it was.  but one thing in it's 'general' area, was the old trojan nuclear plant that used to be located just outside goble, oregon.  they destroyed it a few years ago.  but it still stood at the time i saw this silver, stationary dot in that direction.

friend and i were on route 7, driving back to fredericton from grand bay, when we saw something very strange.  i was in the passenger seat.  it was about 9:15 pm, and we were a few kilometres past the petersville hill exit on the highway.  we noticed two exceedingly bright, large lights  to our right, which were the colour of a camp fire.  we could see two plumes of what appeared to be smoke rising almost vertically from the lights.  we were traveling 110km/h, and the lights stayed with us for several kms, but the whole time the ���smoke��� continue to rise more or less vertically.  the whole time they were moving with us, they stayed roughly the same distance apart from each other, and were at a minimum 500��� altitude , probably closer to 1000���.  they stayed at basically the same altitude the whole time.  after about 10 minutes, they seemed to ���slow down��� so i had to turn and look out of the passenger side rear window to see them.  \r\n\r\njust as the first two became obscured by the trees along the highway, i turned toward the front of the car and immediately noticed another single light at about 2 o���clock, which just ���appeared���.   i looked back, and at this point there was only one of the original two back there, so it was as if one of them rushed to and/or ���appeared��� at the new position ahead of us.  this time, it didn���t keep pace, and i kept my eyes on it until we reached the junction with the trans-canada at oromocto.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the lights, i immediately thought they were flares, possibly being used for a night exercise at cfb

orbs.  i have seen those chinese paper lanterns that people send into the sky, but there is no possible way it was something like that.\r\n\r\nalthough i am fully convinced that et vehicles have and

santa ana, ca.  we concluded air operations at about 10:00 p.M.  this particular night it was my turn to take the trash down while the rest of the crew finished the days flight strips and straightened up for morning operations.  i was standing at the base of the tower in the dark, the airfield lights were off.  i was wondering what was taking my co-workers so long and looked up to see if the interior tower lights were off (which would indicate they were on their way down).  the lights were off.  as i was looking up, i observed what appeared to be a formation of high flying, extremely fast moving aircraft, traveling from the west to the east.  i couldn't hear any sound of jet engines (santa ana is in fairly close proximity to the el toro marine air base where a number of fighter squadrons are based).  i immediately concluded two things; one, they were too high to be jet aircraft (the individual craft appeared to be a little bit bigger than a satellite, but two, they were traveling about the speed of what i had seen on other occasions in the night sky and guessed the object to be a satellite.\r\n\r\nthe flight path west to east was observed for maybe three to four seconds, when abuptly they stopped almost directly over head.  i couldn't tell if they slowed, it didn't appear to me they did, but i am certain they stopped suddenly.  maybe, not more that a second or two, but then took off again, heading due south towards san diego.  their speed appeared to be the same as i initially observed on the easterly course.  just before they were to get out of my vision, (maybe three seconds) i observed them to stop again.  another short pause and i observed them track back east bound, where i lost sight of them.  \r\n\r\ni of course told my fellow controllers what i had seen and none of them took me serious.  i never really pursued the incident after that but whenever anyone talked about the possibility of ufo's i would always relate my incredulous observations of that night.\r\n\r\none night, i guess it was a year or so ago now, i was watching television.  it was a program on ufo's and this program in particular featured a gentleman who lived in england who had seen what he believed to be a ufo.  i don't recall the specifics of his sighting but he drew on a piece of paper for his interviewers what the formation he saw looked like.  it appeared to be very close to the same formation i had seen in 1973.  i say close because, i can't remember if the v- formation had three or four aircraft on one side.  what i mean to say is that the v-formation we often see in our own military aircraft fly-by's or even in birds was not the same length on each side.  it appeared that there was four or five craft on one side and two or three on the other.  i say craft per side because even at the height they were at, it didn't appear to me that the lights didn't appear to be evenly spaced.  i got the impression that each of the lights were separate craft.\r\n\r\nthe point is that this person saw the same thing i had seen probably twenty or so years earlier, (i assume his sighting was in the 1990's)  i had always wondered if anyone else had seen what i observed.  i did watch the paper and listen to the news to see if anyone wrote about the unusal sighting in 1973.  but i never saw anything.  i did report this years ago to some ufo site i had found on the web but nothing ever came of my report.  i don't even remember now what the site was called.  i saw your site listed on a television program the other day and decided to give it one more try for whatever it is worth. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nthank you              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

of the orange lights appearing, immediately 5 more lights appeared in succession forming a titled disc pattern in the sky.  once all of the 6 lights were present, all six lights faded in unison.  this
