350 feet long and im not really sure how thick it was but this accounts for all the times i have seen the ufo before having this dream or whatever it was.\r\n\r\nthe movement patterns of the ufo always flew from such a distance it was the size of the end of a pin to about  500 feet away and when it reached that point every time it would just stop hover (i always got the feeling of being watched when it stopped) and then 3-5 seconds later it would fly off.\r\n\r\nand this would happen most of the time on a clear night sometimes during a darker cloudy day but always within those conditions, the hight of the ufo was about 300 - 500 feet in the air and was at least 1000 feet or more away and  it was always the same shape, a triangular shape with a slight curve to the top of it and it was silver in color. now im not sure of the dates of when i have seen them but i have see them 6 times during the month of may starting at the 5th and 7 times during june starting on the 1st. \r\n\r\nevery night that happened i got scared and would stay up for hours with my pets in my room so i knew if they would be coming since i thought that well my dogs would get scared first before something happens and i would have at least some kind of warning.\r\n\r\nnow on to the dream, the night started like every other night and i had seen the ufo the one and only time on the night of the 15th of july i went 2 sleep around 11:30 and then the dream started well what seemed like a dream at least but anyway, the dream started out where i remember being in my room laying down on my bed watching tv when suddenly the cable shut of and i got the blue screen of no signal and 3 seconds of that and it shut off and my room was suddenly plunged into pitch black and i got up and tried to turn on my light but it would not work there was no power at all and when i tried to open the door to go check the fuse i had no strength in my legs to move and i could not lift my arms or hands in anyway to open the door yet i was in a calm state so i just went back to bed and what felt like 5 mins of lying there i suddenly felt like i was not alone in my room (by the way my room layout is my bed is under my window but takes up the space between the chimney in the middle of the room and the wall towards my bed on the other side of that chimney in the north east corner  that was blocked by vision by chimney) and i had this feeling that i was not alone and well i didn't really want to see it and im glad that it was pitch black cuz in my head i have always told my self that if they want to abduct me that they would at least do it in a way where i cant see them or they take the appearance if there grays as humans but they at least granted me that one wish so i get the sense that they where not benevolent beings.\r\n\r\nanyway the next thing i remember is blacking out and i remember the cold sensation of being on a metal or steel table with extreme bright lights my eyes where taking a very very to adjust and i remember looking to my left and seeing a metal door that slid open and a  robe that was being dragged against the ground like something was wearing it and the next thing i new i got the feeling in my head that i should look straight up and so i did when i did i saw to my fright four alien grays looking straight down at me each of there heads positioned at the four lines of my main sight and thats all i remember from my dream.\r\n\r\nnow for paranormal activity i have not noticed anything ufo/alien related besides the ufos before hand and sometimes but not as frequent as before that i do still see them.\r\n\r\nsometimes but not all the time do i feel like im being watched sometimes by someone in a van,truck, or car always seem to be watching me when that happens and its always a white or black vehicle nothing else and i have heard that might be something to do with the men in black im not sure it could be, i also feel that im being watched from the sky and when i go to look nothings there i dont really feel like im being watched at night time more then the day and it happens almost anywhere i am and could happen at anytime. now as for the symbols i have showed you i did find the part of the episode by ufo hunters aired on history channel *(link moved to additional evidence section--cms/sg)related the symbols are showed right in the middle of the video and the one thing i have and i cant get out of my head is i have a really haunting feeling in my head that i know what it means but its hard for me to get the info out. \r\n\r\nnow for the special ability's i have none that i know so far but i do feel like i am able to read symbols that are on anything else or on crafts how i can do that i do not know but i do feel like i can and one day if possible help from someone to bring that out and i am drawn to what i truly feel are real and not faked by man i seem to want to be drawn to the real thing. (just as i said that i had the hair on my entire stand up and drop in temperature if that means anything). and i have a fear of the dark if im alone and i feel that im being watched but for some reason my fear goes away as soon i turn on a light. i feel like i am being abducted from time to time because i get the feeling sometimes that i have not spent as much time i have in certain area that i am in for example i have only been in my room for 2 hours according to me but to my clock and everyone else i have been gone for 6 hours or more. one time i remember being watched by someone in a black vehicle no licence plate or anything just a plain truck and the next thing i know i look into the sky and see a black triangle object in the distance but close enough that i feel im being watched and most of the time the truck or van drives of and the ufo flys off at incredible speeds i have not one clue why that is happing but it happens some of the times.\r\n\r\nif you have any more questions or i missed some info that you would like to know email me back i also have a phone if your interested communicating by phone might be easier

different objects that caught my eye. the first was red & white blinking lights. i initially thought it was an airplane because that seemed like the most logical explanation. then i noticed the wasn't really any sort of pattern to the blinking of the lights. i was a crew chief for a cargo plane in the usaf so i know what planes in the night sky (should) look like. as it moved furher away i still thought \"this could be an airplane flying east\". i then noticed the object move right, left, up and down very quickly. it finally moved so far out of sight that i could no longer see it. while standing there contemplating what i just saw, i noticed a large bright star towards the right (higher than the 1st object). it was really bright and looked like a star. the star like object began to look more and more oval shaped. i assumed the research i had done on ufo's could be making my mind play tricks on me. i shrugged it off and looked towards a park that i live about a block away from. i noticed what i thought at first were birds flying in a triangular shape formation (as birds often do). as the \"birds\" got closer i realized none of them were flapping their wings and they stayed in a perfect boomerang like formation. not moving apart or together, up or down. they were just cruising along. i then thought maybe i'm misjudging distance and started really focusing on the objects. i then thought well maybe it's jets flying in formation since it's not uncommon here since i live somewhat close to a navy base. i watched as they got closer & closer and began to pass my house. as i watched i waited to hear the jet engines but heard nothing. this boomerang shaped object just cruised right along not moving higher, lower or side to side. it moved in a steady straight line like it had a specific destination it was aiming for. it then dissappeared out of sight. i almost forgot what i had seen about a half an hour later until  mentioned it to my friend. while talking with him on the phone i went back out to look at the odd \"star\" i had seen 30 minutes prior and it was gone. no stars at all where i had just seen this \"star\". he said he had seen something similar a few years ago and suggested i report it to this web site. so, here i am and this was my experience. think what you want, but i saw what i saw!

girlfriend and i crested a hill near my home which is located in the countryside of both cities.  on the downslope of the hill i was conversing with my girlfriend when i noticed a series of orange orbs over the treeline of my neighbors home.  they quickly flashed and disappeared.  i could not verify distance or size because it was so sudden.  at first i was shocked, and was not certain of what i had saw.  i thought perhaps it was reflection of a garage light or aircraft of known origin as we are about twenty miles from an airport.  regardless, my girlfriend did not notice the lights or the flash as she was intent on the road at the time.\r\n(8:45 p.M.) she pulled into my driveway, which is located on the corner of k and sand pit road. while entering my home, i turned to wave goodbye, and noticed a single orb over the field across the road.  i pointed and attempted to get the attention of my girlfriend, who put her car in park and turned just to see the orb collapse upon itself.  at this point i knew i was dealing with something out of the ordinary.  \r\n(8:50 p.M.) i walked back to the car, as my girlfriend exited the vehicle, and while staring into the distance to the point where the orb had finished (about a half mile west), a large, chandelier shaped object appeared less than a quarter mile away from us above the filed across the road.  it had several small orange orbs surrounding a large central ball of a darker orange hue. this object stayed lit for several seconds before collapsing upon itself.\r\n(9:00 p.M) at this point my girlfriend, who was shaken by the incident, returned home.  about a minute after she had left, i still remained outside staring in wonder at the night sky.  suddenly, a v shaped formation of orange lights hovered, flashed, and dimmed heading southwest.  these lights appeared once more and disappeared.  i entered my home to inform my family of the incident.  i noticed several cars parked alongside k which must have noticed the object too.  i grabbed a pair of keys and jumped into my father's car and took off down k toward the last spot i saw the lights.  two vehicles were parked alongside k between knot road and cty rd ff.  i turned down ff, heading south, and swung into my friend's home on the corner of ff and hwy 91.  i asked if anyone had seen anthing out of the ordinary.\r\n(9:45 p.M.) having shared texts with two friends who had seen the lights and explaining my story to those at my friend's house, i decided to go out for a cigarette.  while scanning the skies, the orange lights appeared as a single line above the tree lines south of hwy 91.  i scanned for several minutes before returning inside to grab my keys.\r\n(10:00 p.M.) i returned home without another sighting of the lights.  i contacted the oshkosh police department and informed them of my sighting.  an officer came to my home and took a police report on the lights.  he also informed me that the nearby airport and air traffic controllers did not claim to have any aircraft in the area at the time of the incident. he took the names of the other witnesses, and after telling me he gets reports in this area from time to time of similar lights and to not worry about it, he left.\r\n\r\n*these sightings persisted for several weeks, and months, to this day.  though not as frequently as they did for the last two weeks of november.  i've contacted several individuals who saw the lights on multiple occasions, and in different areas of the night sky, although mostly located in the area of k and sand pit road.  i have had three sightings myself since the original november sighting including a streaking light that reminded me of a roman candle styled firework, except each ball remained lit and collapsed in sequence.  generally speaking, the sightings are of single orbs, however, as described above, they do occasionally drift from that description.*\r\n\r\n(i do have sketches of the sightings, however, i do not have them uploaded to this computer yet. to date, several attempts to videotape the lights has failed. two photographs do exist, but the quality and lighting makes it impossible to determine what the object is.)","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

it flew towards us, we could hear a noise like that of an airplane, and it was descending fast although no airport nearby anywhere. as it came closer, there were 6-8 red blinking lights, and 4 giant bright white lights; 1 on each corner of the craft and one right in the middle. while flying over us the noise got louder and louder. continued to watch. well, it started to loop around to where it was on the other side of the northbound traffic to where there is a huge field. there was only one tree blocking our view of the field. it continued looping, and looping, until behind the tree. we

(september 7, 2010). i was traveling south on i-35 and turning east on 820 freeway in the fort worth area. it is an area where planes are frequently seen landing to the north into alliance airport. it was an overcast night so when i first saw the craft, the lights on the craft looked like bright landing lights and then it disappeared into the overcast.  when it came out of the overcast clouds the object was directly over my car (about 300-500 ft)and the landing lights were no longer there.  i just saw the glow from 12-15 windows. this was a large circular object with approximately 12-15 lights facing downward near the outer rim forming a round shape.\r\n\r\nthese windows were square, on the bottom and curved up onto the side of the craft.   every other light appeared either brighter or dimmer���that is���there were two levels of brightness in the lights���every other one having a different level of brightness. overcast was low but i still was able to observe a circular pattern and definitely was not a passenger plane. the lights were not as bright as landing lights would be���in fact they were quite dim by comparison and looked very much like large windows on a craft. \r\n\r\nthis object was not making the usual nw approach���instead it was traveling due west���not typical of craft in that area���not that is doesn���t happen but i just haven���t seen them do it. it doesn���t matter���the craft i witnessed looked nothing like an airliner. it was about the height of airliner on approach and also about the size of such. i have no logical explanation for what i saw. \r\n\r\n        \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:14","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":28030,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.730159,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02282011-0007","longitude":-97.3171596,"occurred":1283846400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1298947332000,"summary":"Sighting of a large circular craft in the ft. worth area, september 2010","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":174,"locationName":"Fort Worth, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:69478"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Houston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"To whom it may concern:\r\n \r\nin october 2009 while attending the houston airshow my girlfriend and i observed several small, silver disks hovering way above the show.  other people also observed them as well but because we could not definitively identify them we dismissed them as irrelevant, yet intriguing.  today (2/28/11) while i was going through old files on my computer i ran across a video from that airshow.  i was shocked at what i saw come flying into the shot between 0:00-0:04 seconds of the video; another unidentified flying object that at the time would have been too fast for the eye to catch.\r\n \r\ni am attaching photos of ufo���s in the sky, along with the video for your own analysis.\r\n\r\np.S. i did a search on the internet about this event and it looks like we were not the only ones that saw something that day.

always do but to my surprise i noticed something in the corner of my eye and upon further investigation it turned out to what look like a triangle shaped object directly above me about  the normal hight that a private air plane is allowed to fly at. the object was hovering motionless above me with no sound at all during a clear full moon light light, the object had no lights at all and seemed to be silver in color. and upon seeing this object i got the feeling i was being watched and i also had a feeling of fright so i ran the rest of the way home.\r\n\r\nnow upon that night i had a dream where all i can remember is lying in bed having the feeling of being watched through the darkenes of my attic room and all i can really remember after that is i was lying on a what felt like a cold steel table and i remember looking up and to my horror i remember seeing four alien greys all standing around my head examining my head.\r\n\r\never since that event i feel as tho i am being watched and like some people in this world i put allot of resurch into aliens and government cover ups and even the possibility that aliens might be living among us hiding. but whenever i feel im getting somewhere with all of this when i feel im geting close i get headaches painful ones and im not sure why. to this day i feel i am still being watched but i have no idea by who, weather it be aliens or
