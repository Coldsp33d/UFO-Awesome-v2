one went off to the east. they both disappeared about 7 seconds after the split. after the sighting i was pretty excited to have seen that but i was also disappointed with my self for not getting a video camera when i first saw it. i waited for about 20 minutes to see if it would reappear then went

east to west, followed by another rapid bright traveling white light and then a red light (exactly like the first two but red). if i were to discribe them, i would say they looked like bright laser lights. i felt like i was watching starwars in front of my house. i yelled upstairs at my husband to see if he was awake and told him i had just seen some very strange lights. when i looked back out, the roof of a neighboring home adjacent to ours lit up with a circular pattern above it. i then jumped up to run to the window and i asked my husband if he had seen anything. he had gotten up and pulled the blinds open but had not seen the lights. i didn't hear anything or see any motor vehicle lights; we had just received a snowfall which is rare in our area, so it was very quiet out. there could not have been any aircraft flying in this weather, nor was there any traffic going by. the entire time from when i first awoke til after these lights disappeared, the sky had an eerie hue to it. lights were reflecting off of the low lying clouds. my cat was acting strange and kept watching outside the window. i have never seen anything like this and wished i had felt better when i woke up so i could have focused more on what i was seeing. i am now obsessed with what i saw and wonder if anyone else in my area had seen any strange lights. i'd say i was scared more than curious at the time though.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

wetumpka highway.  while driving on brooks rd, during a warm summer night approx. 9:00 p.M., i notice some blinking lights in the south night sky. and i asked my brother what are those blinking lights in the sky? and his response was an airplane. and i told him that can't be a airplane with all of those different color lights, such as green, yellow, red and blue.  so still while driving, we came to a small bridge and i looked back up in the night sky, and still this object was still in the same place as if it was not moving.  but the lights were still blinking. about an 1/2 mile before entering highway 231, the object with the blinking lights was still up there as if it was up there amongst the stars.  and before appoarching highway 231, there was a house on the left side where a deep ditch runs in front of the home. and the ditch was about 6ft wide and approx. 2-3 ft deep.  and all of a sudden this light in the night sky came down and covered the car and all i saw was red. this happened all in a matter of seconds. since i was driving, my brother may i have witness more of what i seen.  my brother and i was so afraid that my brother opened his door-being the passenger door and tried to get out and i being afraid that my brother was going to leave me. i pulled him back into the car. and as me pulling him back into the car in an upright position, there was no more lights or anything as if it disappeared. during all that time the car was in the ditch.  i can not understand even to this day, how the car got out of that ditch.  and i asked my brother how did we get out the ditch, and he said they pulled us out of that ditch. after being back on that main road from out of that ditch. i was to scared to turn back and go the way we came from. so i proceeded to go on to highway 231 to go back home. i must have been driving 120-130 miles an hour to get back home. and my brother said to me you gonna get a ticket driving this fast. and i said to him, the police can give me a ticket but it wont be till i got home. when we got home the time was about 9:30 or 9:45, it seemed as if it happened so fast. we went straight into the house and told our mom about what we had seen. and she replied if yall dont get yall asses in bed, i'm gonna whip yall asses. as if we were crazy or something. every since that encounter i would not go out at night alone up until i left the state. whenever i go back to visit my family, my brother and i would somehow get on the subject of what happened that night. i still go back to that location only during the day. and what puzzles me, as i have gotten older, i ask myself why were there no one on that stretch of highway that night and the house that this happened in front of where normally people would be sitting out, there was no one. and on this busy interstate, there were no police present.  and here is something that is really astounding to me. i left home to come to mi and after being gone for several years. i got married and on the day that i gotten married. i called my mom to inform her that i had just gotten married, which she and no one back home knew that was the plan for me to be getting married. and she replied that your brother had just gotten married too on that same day. and this was the same brother that witness the ufo encounter with me. also my niece likes to hear of our encounter with the ufo.  and her and my mom have stated to me that they have also seen similar objects on a clear summer night.  and that they appear all the time.  i never missed a night of me gazing into night sky, wondering what is out there. i know what i saw that night, will come to the light of those who doesn't believe in ufo's. i also have on video of where the sighting occured along showing the deep ditch where the car was in at that time. trying to figure out how did the car get out of that ditch.","distance":"20 Feet or

we lived in central maine, but went 'downeast\" often to visit family, put flowers on the grave in town every memorial day, would go up to the old house where dad grew up, which was no longer habitable, and would stay with my aunt in town about 15 minutes away.\r\n\r\nduring one visit we had visited the old house and then were 'camping' out by sleeping in the car, and old rambler where the front seats folded down. we were parked on top of the hill by the cemetery and it was a clear night, stars were out, and not a soul around. centerville is ���out in the woods��� and a ways from anything, and at the time there were only a few families living in town. my uncle���s house was back down the road behind us, and some cousins down the hill in front of us.\r\n\r\nwe had been asleep a while and it had taken me a while to go to sleep as i was scared about the bears ��� lots of them in the area, but my mom and dad assured me we were safe.  i was also afraid of the dark, and while the stars were out, was a very dark night, so my mom laid next to me. the car was parked on the right side of the road facing what i think is east. i was laying on the left side of the car ��� driver���s side, closest to the pavement.\r\n\r\ni remember waking up and hearing a loud noise, a very loud and high-pitched whirring sound. not like a fan really, but i guess more like a blender, but smooth.\r\ni also remember it was very light in the car and i didn���t understand why. i could hear my parents talking and my mom asking my dad what is that, what is going, etc���\r\n\r\nmy dad opened the door on the right side of the car and said ���stay there.��� when he got out he just stood beside the door facing forward. my mom kept asking ���what is it, what���s wrong..��� he didn���t answer and her voice got more frantic as she kept asking. she was always calm so i started getting scared then.\r\n\r\nshe then climbed out behind my dad and i was not going to be left alone so i opened the driver���s side door and climbed out.\r\n\r\nwe were on top of a hill ��� lots of hills in the area ��� and when i got out i looked up and there in front of us ��� but out away from the hill and a little up, maybe 50 feet or so, was a very bright group of lights. i did not think of it as any sort of ���object��� as all i could see were lights. very bright, white light all around, which lit up the car, the road, the whole top of the hill. i could see the gate to the cemetery at the top of the stairs clearly to my left and my mom and dad on the right side of the car (the hill dropped off down to the right).\r\n\r\nthey were just standing there ��� my dad partly behind the right-side car door and my mom between him and the car. they were just staring up at the lights. not saying a word, not moving.\r\n\r\nso i looked back at the lights. the whirring sound was so loud and seemed to keep getting louder and louder. in amongst the white lights was colored lights. they were moving or blinking or something, but i don���t remember any sort of pattern, just the colors. i remember the blues ands the reds, may have been others, but those i remember clearly.\r\n\r\ni don���t know how long we stood there, i just remember looking at the lights and not moving. i didn���t feel afraid, and didn���t run to my mom or dad. i just stood there like they were.\r\n\r\nthe suddenly the sound got wicked loud and the lights just zoomed away from us ��� not all the far ��� but to above the top of the next big hill, maybe a mile or so. it stayed there 10 or seconds maybe and then went zoom to the right ��� almost parallel - and suddenly was over the trees a good ways to the right. must have been a couple miles i guess. suddenly it zoomed again and this time to the left and slightly away from us and was at least a few miles off, so went quite aways in an instant. the whirring never stopped and seemed just as loud.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i remember was that it was suddenly back in front of us, the whirring sound got so loud and it hurt and the light started to just go straight out away from us and up at the same time. this time it was not sudden and in a flash, just fast, and i watched it disappear into the stars.\r\n\r\nmy dad was then beside me pushing me into the car. i started to cry and scream asking what is going on. my dad said nothing, my mom had gotten into the passenger���s front seat and dad did turned on the car, and did a u-turn, and started driving. i kept crying and neither one of them said a word. my mom just started rubbing my arm as i was leaning over the front seat.\r\n\r\nhe drove to my aunt���s house about 15 minutes away and the whole way neither one said anything about what just happened. all my mom said was to my dad ���slow down, you���re going to fats ��� slow down!���\r\n\r\ni remember we woke my aunt up banging on the door. i was still crying and she was asking why we were there, what was wrong, why didn���t we stay up in centerville.  i don���t remember the rest of that night, but later when i tried to ask my mom and dad about the lights they just told me it was nothing and as i got older and would tell the story my dad refused to even acknowledge it happened. he would leave the room, just not say a word.\r\n\r\ni have no idea if it is related, but years later in 1996 i had an arterial rupture in my lower intestines and started bleeding. i had to have blood transfusions and they went in through my backside into my intestines to put in a medical clamp. after i came to the doctor asked me when did i have surgery down there. i told him i never had. he said yes i did. i had had some kind of surgery in my lower intestines/rectum. i asked my dad if something had happened i could not remember when i was a kid (i had my tonsil out i remembered) and he said no, nothing. i kept asking are you sure, the doctors said i did and he said no.\r\n\r\nafter we saw the lights i had several strange experiences at home, which i just chalked up to being a kid sensitive to paranormal things. there was the man floating in my closet, the glowing man kneeling beside my bed when i was awake and could not move and could hear my parents in their bedroom getting up. i also had a ���vision��� of seeing myself out side with my dog playing in the dark ��� i was afraid of the dark so made no sense ��� but the next morning when my mom woke me up my pajamas had mud on them, but the front door was still locked from the inside, so they used to talk about that wondering how i had gotten mud on me. another time i saw a strange face in the front door window looking in at me and it was not a man���s face.\r\n\r\ncould they be all related to the lights that night? i don���t know ��� could be something else, but i do know what we saw that night was not normal, was no plane or anything else as nothing moves like that.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":28012,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.7056318,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02262011-0022","longitude":-67.6788857,"occurred":142066800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1298780420000,"summary":"Object hovered over car -

conversing with each other and they slowly drifted away towards the area of my wifes mothers backyard. as we went to the backyard we saw them still doing the same thing they were doing ( floating around and moving extremely slow) as a few minutes past by my son went to go get binoculars and at the time me and my brother were laying on the floor outside looking upwords. he came back with the binoculars and we all looked through them and my family described it as looking kinda like a manta ray. then i pointed the binoculars towards one that was roughly 700 feet above me and it was close the the roof of the house far enough for it to look smaller than it appeared but it was still pretty close. as i pointed the binoculars towards it, it looked like it was spinning pretty fast( it kinda looked like a being painted it) with sun or gamma rays kind of deflecting of it so it made it look bright yellow ish. as it moved it started to look like it was changing shapes slowly or it was rotating. a few minutes past and they started going away and as they were out of sight a plane flew by( just a regular plane) and we could all tell the distinctive traits from what we just saw to a

it was making!!My girlfriend and i were driving north bound on rt 16 in nh in the area from dover to rochester nh it was around 7 pm as we were driving i noticed out my driverside window lights that apeared right over the tree tops and i noticed it was quite a large mass of lights configured in a sequenced way do to the glare from a light drizziling rain i rolled my window down and their it was i could see the metal type finish on the out side, it was traveling along at our speed in the sky above the trees approximately 60 mph it was gigantic with lots of lights going on and off some different in color all were square and at times it would use the lights to make it appear the the craft was a drifferent shape from time to time! i was scared to pull over so i kept driving  my girlfriend was next to me aand when she looked out she screamed what is it i said i think a ufo and i think it's following us! well 2 miles later she was yelling out the window franticly scared stop following us go away so at that point we were convinced it was! through out the whole time it followed us it dissapeared twice once it sholt off and upwards fatster than anything i ever wittnessed with a flash and dissapeared as  we kept driving looking around up in the sky through the windshield about 3 minutes later it rose up almost like from behind the trees to my left outside my drivers window again continuing to follow us it had a back in forth motion as it was staying right with us also dipping down a little and rising above the trees! as we approached a toll booth it went down behind the trees and dissapeared at the toll booth i pulled off the highway where i saw a state trooper and i jumped out and asked the trooper has anyone reported a ufo there was one just following us and dissapeared she looked at me like i had eight heads and said no! so i jumped back in my truck and kept going at the tree line was about to end and the sky opened up where theres a lowes it rose up from behind the trees again and followed us for a half mile as the tree line ended and we came around the corner where lowes came into sight it jumped higher in the sky and behind lowes further from us it then turned

(1000 ft?)\r\n\r\ni went outside on my deck to view it and get a better look.\r\nafter observing this thru the binoculars for several minutes the red and white lights separated into two distinct larger objects. one red and one white. these two objects flew around each other doing what seemed to be impossible maneuvering at an extremely high rate of speed over a very small area. almost like two huge laser beam points dancing in concert together. the red and white objects were traveling so rapidly in close proximity to each other that they appeared at times as one red and one white streak of light \"dancing\" together creating pretzel like shapes. i could tell that this was not created by me moving the binoculars because the whole time, the orange dot was observed steady and unmoving in the same filed of vision. the orange ball was not making any noticable movement but kept its relationship steady above the slow drifting red/white display going on below it. \r\n\r\nafter observing this for about 5 minutes all three objects slowly drifted below the horizon behind the tree tops. they either went lower or drifted further away past the horrizon. i continued to look in the direction with my binoculars for about an hour but saw nothing else out of the ordinary. \r\n\r\ni submitted a report to the nuforc website and to my amazement someone from redding reported seeing a double triangle shaped object with red and white lights fly low over their house on that same day. both reports were not posted on the nuforc website until the following day, so neither one of us could have known about the other until after both were submitted to nuforc.\r\n\r\nafter looking the next day during daylight at the point that this was observed on the horizon and compairing it to a map this puts the event at the following latitude and longitude - 41.264259,-73.39159. on tuesday febuary 22nd at 8pm local time.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":27994,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.403927,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08032011-0014","longitude":-73.4496711,"occurred":1298433600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Diamond,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312384817000,"summary":"Strange light display and manuvers - several hundred feet above tree tops","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":161,"locationName":"Danbury, Connecticut","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:69882"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Orange","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My name is *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg)and i was 17 years old at the time and i was down the street t my ffriends house standing outside having a chat. it time to be correct was 3:30pm in the afternoon in the city of orange in southern california. it was at this time when i was curbside and happened to look up in t the blue sky with no clouds in sight and noticed a super shiny disc object in the sky to the north. this object was a solid disc object that stood still in the sky for about 15 minutes and did not move. my friend thought it was a blimp or even some kite, but it was a solid disc shape and could not have been a blimp. it was like a silver solid rock was floating in the air. we stood and stared at this object and it seemed to change bright metallic colors and at that point we new were seeing something strange. i checked my watch at the time and it was now 4:00pm the object was still there in the sky with no sound or movement. at this time it began to slowly climb to a higher elevation and when i say this i mean very slow. it did this for about 10 minutes , but was still easily visiable to make out that it was a silver disc object somethng thati have never seen before!

( i like to try to find satellites) and these 2 stars started moving at the same time in a slow arc and eventually got so high/small into the sky that they disappeared.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":27991,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.7648829,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02262011-0001","longitude":-122.4853649,"occurred":1298633400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1298712471000,"summary":"Triangle with 3 white flahing lights","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Bellingham, Washington","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:69885"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1897}
