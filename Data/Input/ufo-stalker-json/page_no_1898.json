but fields and a lake. one night i went out for a walk and as i was walking i noticed that  a street light which was usually the only light to be found for a ways, had a second light floating above it, a single sort of vertical oval shaped light, maybe 5-6 feet above it, unmoving, a bright but hazy white/orange light, after watching it for about a minute i continued with my walk and shortly turned around and walked home and took notice that the light was still there. the next day in bright sunshine i walked down to the streetlight to check it out and there was nothing above the streetlight or in the vicinity that would create any kind of light.\r\n a few weeks later i went out for another late night walk ( as was my fashion)  as upon returning my eye was drawn to the open access point of the lake my house was on, i had barely  stepped near it when i saw very clearly 3 fairly large horizontal oval lights, 2 white, one orangish/red, spaced about 3 feet away from each other hovering above my lake just above the tree line, i stopped out of curiosity trying to listen for the sound of a plane  but heard only a very soft, very low whooshing-like pulsing, i tried to think of any and all possible explanations besides the one i am reporting now, but i didn't live near any towers, tall buildings, power stations or water towers, i heard no sound of planes or helicopters and the lights weren't moving, and they were very clearly just above my lake which has no means of supporting any kind of light.\r\nmy immediate thought was \" go inside and get the camera\" but i was mesmerized by its strangeness and also a little afraid, and i worried that the lights might disappear by the time i came back to the spot. i watched the lights for about 5 minutes, and they never seemed to move, and as i watched the light farthest on the right which was white and the middle light which was orange/red changed, and now the far right was orange/red and the middle was white. i dont know why but i was suddenly frightened, thinking of all the silly movies id seen, and i felt like the lights were watching me as well, i grew rather anxious and decided to quickly walk home, as i was doing so i kept looking behind me back at the lights, at which point i realized they had been moving because they were now higher above the treetops then they had been before, they had just been moving too slowly for me to notice. i reached home and firmly locked the door behind me and drew all the curtains to appease my own uneasiness. the next day i returned to the spot and saw no sign of the lights.\r\n","distance":"21-100

(he likens the altitude to about 10 feet above a nearby 40 foot tree.  male witness says there were rings on the underside of the object, and that as he looked up, the center ring projected/moved downward perhaps 10 feet under the object.  he specifies his position as under the northern edge of the center ring.  he says the ring opened and expelled some sort of balls the size of baseballs and/or softballs, with perhaps one or two the size of basketballs, which then landed on his hat, arms and legs (anc caused some sensation on his arm hair), and that these no-weight balls somehow caused him to have odd perceptions as he stood there.  for instance, it seemed that the balls caused him to feel himself standing a distance behind himself, watching himself standing at the gate.  he speaks as if there was a kind of bubble effect, but with no sheen to it, and when he looked at the bubble, it was as if the bubble projected images of the garage or himself, etc. but only projected images the size of the bubbles/balls themselves, not the actual size of the garage or himself, etc.  he says he wonders if it's like looking into another dimension.  following his experience with the balls,the craft expelled/formed a haze surrounding itself.  to the witness, it seemed as if all this was happening in a very brief few seconds or 2-3 minutes at the most, but when the balls stopped interacting with him, he thought to wonder if his wife had gotten the camera, and began walking west toward the backyard fence where she was positioned some 70 feet away.  as he walked, his perception was that the object, including the haze, began to float/move slowly to the west with him, and as he approached the backyard fence gate, he saw that his wife was taking pictur4es, which he thought were photographs with their digital camera.  however, from dialogue on a 2 minute, 20-second videotape of the ufo, discovered a couple weeks later when viewing a crop duster video taken in july, 2010, it appears that his wife was actually just finishing taping the ufo video.  (((as he approached his wife in the back yard, the dialogue heard in the last few seconds on the video is as follows:  as her husband is approaching, the wife calls out, \"i like that ring!  what is that?  some kind of a....\"  he interrupts and says, \"i don't know what it is.\"  and she finishes her sentence by saying, \"tornado?\"  then she adds, \"it looks like an alien ship.\"  investigator's note:  if a weather phenomenon had occurred, male witness would surely have recognized it as such, but instead, it appears to investigator trout that his comment, \"i don't know what it is.\" simply reflects puzzlement rather than recognition of ordinary clouds, as suggested later by a meteorologist.  at this point, male witness' perception is that the sighting event has taken perhaps only a few seconds, or 2-3 minutes.  (((please note:  when the digital photos and the video were later examined, the times recorded led an iowa investigator, greg andersen, to surmise that the apparent time difference shows at least 23 minutes between the videotape and the last of the photos taken by the wife witness.)))  male witness likens color of the disk to \"aluminum tinted by diesel smoke,\" and later he characterized the color as \"pewter.\"  he says the ship looked darker than the haze generated around it, and that the center of the rings looked darker than the ship, although the ring edges looked grayish-silver.  when the disk moved overhead, male witness could not see the eastern edge of the disk because of a treeline to his left (east) of his position.  (((apparent size of disk when hovered 1/2 mile away at 50 degrees yields size parameters of 1,405 to 2,054 feet..These size parameters are arrived at by using an apparent size of 20 degrees, and an apparent size of 30 degrees in a trigonometry program used by iowa mufon to arrive at an approximate size.)))  neither husband nor wife thought to look for the western edge of the object.  (this seems somewhat understandable, since they specify its great size as it hovered so low overhead.)  in the backyard, male witness took his eyes off the disk to look briefly north toward the house, and when he turned again to face south, the disk and the haze quickly dissolved/blinked out, and the object was gone.  see investigator notes for investigation conclusion.","distance":"21-100 Feet,

anything since my first sighting in 2009. now, one day after talking to your investigator, i have been visited up close and personal. i am not saying that one led to the other, but it is a very eerie coincidence. i was out on my deck tuesday night and i noticed a few \"flashing stars,\" not unlike what i had seen in my first report. it was 9 o'clock. these \"stars\" were then accompanied by these randomly flashing orbs that were descending to rooftop level. then i saw a bright red flashing object low to the ground. it was not a plane, and it disappeared after a minute or two. after that, the real chaos began. around 9:30, i noticed a huge streak of blue/white light flash across the sky, and after that, they were everywhere. little flashes of what looked like laser beams, but they were coming from all directions and not from one source in the sky. there was a bright hovering orb directly in front of my house, and these little flashes of light were surrounding me. one came within 5 feet of me. they were constant. i was quite scared. i ran inside and called my brother to let him know what was happening, when i heard a helicopter fly over my house so low that i was almost shouting to make myself heard on the phone. i was on the phone for about 10 minutes, and in that time i counted 3 more helicopters and 2 planes fly directly over my house. they must have been very low for me to hear them from inside my home while on the telephone. after i hung up, i went back out on to the deck. at this time, there were planes and helicopters everywhere, but the bright orb in the sky was still above me (about a block or two away and the height of the planes flying at it) but hovering, not flying. the flashes of light were still all around. some were in the distance, some were high in the sky, some were on the street, and some were in the alley directly in front of me. i began to feel strange. not ill, but my stomach began to feel very odd. it was uncomfortable.. almost an empty feeling as if i hadn't eaten in days. at this time i was getting really worried, and the helicopters kept coming. the flashing beam phenomenon was practically happening on my deck, so i quickly came back inside out of fear. i called around and found that some of my neighbors were also aware of the heavy air traffic. one had actually heard all the commotion while in the shower and had gotten dressed and gone outside to see if there was an air raid or something. none had witnessed the lasers or orbs, but these were so low and directly in front of my house... so unless you were in my backyard, they would have been obstructed by other houses and trees. the 10-20 planes in the sky at any given time were visible to everyone though. i am sure that others had to have seen what i witnessed last night. i watched all of this go on for about an hour total. i was home alone, so i was very disturbed, especially since the lights were coming so close to me. i came back inside and continued to hear planes and helicopters go by one after another until about 11:30. around that time, i went back outside and saw that the bright orb was moving away from my house toward the farms and fields beyond. i watched it move slowly away, still flashing beams of light in the distance. the planes were still flying by. i went back out at 12:30 and the orb was gone. in it's place there were two sets of three lights in the shape of triangles, with planes flying at them. by this time, my mind was exhausted, and i just couldn't comprehend anything else, so i came inside and tried to go to bed. wednesday morning i found out that my father had also seen strange orbs in the woods by the creek on his property earlier that night, around 8 o'clock. he said they looked like lanterns, but were sporadic and would disappear after a few seconds. i am not sure that they are related, but he lives about 25 minutes from me, and it is very odd that we both saw similar phenomenon on the same night after almost 2 years of not seeing anything else substantial. i am at a loss for words when it comes to describing just how unreal and amazing last night's events were. there must be someone else out there that witnessed that same thing. it left northumberland pa and headed toward danville pa around 11:30-12. anyone driving route 11 at that time must have noticed an unusual number of low flying planes if not the orb and flashes themselves.

(witness).\r\n\r\nat around 06:12 am in the morning, i was sitting in my vehicle at a worksite located at a new high school building that was being built in berryville, va, a few miles off route 7.  i was parked facing east as i was watching the sky change color from the sunrise.  then my attention was drawn to a bright, white light that appeared right above a dark elongated cloud. strangely, i also noticed that the light���s trajectory did not behave as to a plane���s takeoff light, the flight pattern was vertical.   the light soon disappeared behind the cloud ribbon but oddly enough, it did not emerge above it ��� [see a on diagram].   about a minute later, i saw what seems to be another white light moving upward but slightly to the left of the first sighting and it also vanished behind a cloud ��� [see b].   these lights were slightly larger and brighter in comparison to what i believe to be the planet venus that was positioned e/se above the horizon.  each sighting lasted about 5 to 6 seconds prior losing them behind cloud cover.\r\n \r\ninvestigator���s notes: airliners' white takeoff lights should have been turned off at that altitude and even if these planes were facing me (westerly flight-path) they would have eventually flown at an angle or over my area.  no other navigational strobes or beacons were detected. dulles international airport is approximately 30

minutes later and it seemed to be moving very slowly to the nw horizon because now it was closer to the outline of the huge tree that we have in our back yard. so i went back outside to look through the binoculars and i saw the strobe pattern change from circular to triangular, and then to an upright long triangular shape and i was trying hard not to move the binoculars by resting my elbows on

was two blocks east of 18th ave and cambie st in vancouver. i was going to my truck to get my jacket and looked west up in the sky (something i'm always doing i think in this case though i was looking up to see what the weather was like) it was clear skies for the most part. my gf's street is has a lot of trees on it so the spot i looked up was really one of the few openings i could see from where my truck was parked.  i could see planes flying off in the distance, but something different caught my attention. \r\n\r\nthere was a bright orange object in the sky. i would say a little larger and a little brighter than what a planet looks like in the sky only this was orange in color. it seemed pretty far away, i would say at least a few miles. that's what stuck out initially. i told my gf to look at it (she is very skeptical about this type of stuff) while i grabbed my jacket quick. she even made some comments that it didn't look like a plane or anything (you could see another plane north west of it with marker lights and everything). i stood there for another minute and watched it move. the orange object made kind of a clockwise circular movement and then at the 6oclock position it started to move in a straight line and then stopped. we now began to walk west towards cambie st hoping to get a better vantage point. i was even tripping a few times on the sidewalk as i was glued to the sky. once we got a better view i stopped because it started to get dimmer. my view was framed to the left by a large tree, the bottom by a house, and to the right was a smaller tree. the orange object was located i would say about a 45o angle of elevation. as it was fading (slowly) it wasn't moving it only flickered a few times. i paid attention to the fact that it wasn't moving over anything on the horizon. and then just like that it was gone. and i went on with my night. \r\n\r\nthe sighting was really fast, i only had my cell phone and don't think it would have showed that well. i think my drawings will better represent what we saw. my gf can verify everything we saw from the movement, it's brightness, and it fading to nothing while not moving.

the sky ahead of me. the lights were amber/orange in color. i watched for a moment and then pulled over to get a better look. the lights were traveling from south to north and passed just off my left side. i was parked at approximately: n38 42.558 w121 15.720. \r\nwhen i first spotted the lights, they were at an approximate heading of 170 degrees from my location at an elevation of approximately 25-30 degrees above the horizon. they were 3 independent lights and were traveling together, though not in a fixed formation. i estimate the visual magnitude of the lights to be at least -4 or brighter. their brightness varied and they seemed to occasionally change heading, but maintained a consistent south-to north track across the sky. during observation, they changed positions relative to each other. they sky was clear and i could see the star field between and behind the lights. i estimate the altitude of the objects to be between 500-1000 feet agl. i was able to capture video of the object movement on my mobile phone.\r\nbased on the speed and movement of the objects, i believe they were some sort of aircraft, but they did not move like a typical helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft. their behavior was more like an ultralight. i could not see any wingtip navigation (red/green) lights. i could occasionally glimpse some structure to one of the objects, but not clearly enough to identify it.\r\nwhen the lights were directly across from me (east of my location), their elevation was approximately 40-45 degrees above the horizon. they continued on a northerly track, roughly in the direction of the city of rocklin. i left the area when the objects were low to the horizon to the north, just above rooftop level from my view. total observation time was probably 5-10 minutes.\r\nthe attached video is 2 separate clips and has been processed to reduce file size. the original video is in 3gp format and is approximately 107mb in total size.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

camcorder with us filming the beach; just having fun in the morning. suddenly a orange sphere appear in the sky and we were able to film everything very clear. looks like the sphere know we were filming and begin to \"play\" with us. since that i have seen thousands of \"ufos\" videos and telling absolutely true you will never see \"something\" more clear that what we filmed that morning.  the sphere move next to a balcony of a building that was next to the beach and you can see clear that was about 12 feet round. look like that sphere was intelligent ??? no lights, no bright; just an orange sphere. im sure that this video is very important and could be useful to your organization and ufo research.\r\n\r\n\r\nregards\r\n","distance":"101-500

was a hoax balloon or something. it was orange, yellow and maybe red, and round like a sauser. but we all suddenly got a feeling that something was reading our minds and we all got scared. it took off suddenly to one end of the lake and turned as if putting on a show just for us and zoomed accross us up in to the sky to a pencil lead size in seconds. we got the boat started and ran to the shore where people were lined up looking up at it and it was on the radio that a ufo was over lake sylvan. lots of people saw it that

single luminous object which traveled from east to west then paired up with another luminous object which appeared to be almost stationary.  the second object was noticed only because i was tracking the first object.  also, because it was slightly behind me @ 1:00 position.\r\n\r\ndetailed version:\r\non a perfect clear day while relaxing in my hot tub at approximately  11:10am i noticed a luminous object traveling west to southwest. i didn���t see any wings on it or a trail behind it like an airplane, this caught my attention.  it was at a extreme altitude, and would of went un-noticed if i wasn���t wearing sunglasses. i tracked this object as it slowly started to change direction to northwest.  with binoculars i tracked it over head,and i couldn't hear any type of engine noise. this object had no wings, and a very bright white light on the bottom.This light did blink, but not in a regular constant on-off pattern.  as this object past overhead, and past the roof line i moved to get a better view.  i was now looking towards west @1:00 position.I called my 22 year old daughter outside of the house to witness what i was seeing. the first object i was tracking paired up with another luminous object that went un-noticed until up to this point.  the two objects i observed with binoculars seemed to be stationary with a short distance between them.  they appeared like two stars in the daytime sky for about 5 to 10 minutes.\r\nmy daughter and i watched these two objects until they slowly went out of view.","distance":"Over One

will try my best because i truly feel it is very important to keep track of these bad boys because its starting to look like there go's the neighborhood with are the unknowns<><><> i live in a wooded area off a dirt road and every other day in the early evening with just enough day light i go for my power walk. it was tuesday feb.22nd, the sky was quite clear so i got dressed an ready.. i step outside about around 6pm still a little sun light but not much.. i began my walk in the west bound direction from my home.. it was starting to get dark quickly an the stars were showing up so i get about 2 1/2 miles down the road on my route then i turned around an start heading back east bound by then its pretty much dark.. i could see stars every where an air craft as well.. now mind you i am believer in u.F.O's and i have seen strange things in the sky so yeah every time i step out im looking towards the heavens with an open mind.. anyways i got about a half a mile to go to get home and still looking at the stars as i walk when suddenly to the north of me in the sky above my head i spotted a flash of light an the color was strange like them black lights they sell at the store.. so its blinking an flashing how ever i could not make out the shape just a flash.. now this thing  was not moving so i stop walking dead on my tracks to study this flash when suddenly it stops for a minute or two then it starts to flash again an still holding its position an not moving or flying just there but then it stops again an i see nothing but the stars so i took my time looking for it an i even look around in different directions to see if it moved an nothing,nada,zip! an i must of stood their investigating 12 or 15 min.S but nothing it is gone gone, vanished what have you which was needless to say weird an strange so it was time to move on so i took off when not even a minute i look behind me to the west an i see a very bright star like but i know its not a star because its moving and towards my general direction but very very slow.. so i say to myself ok here we go again its time for code observation.. my position is a few miles west of mt. pleasant mi. middle of a back dirt road in the dark wooded area in stickville an approximately between 6:45 n 7:00 p.M.Ok so i waited patiently as it got closer but there is no sound whats so ever, nothing and the way that it flys nice n slow like a sail boat on a calm smooth ocean.. now its close enough to try n make out a detailed description.. yeah right.. it was low like no higher then a radio tower absolutely soundless and the shape a perfect circle sphere a very bright orb and size? no bigger then a full size van an no smaller then a ol german bug wagon and the way it made me feel like yeah a bit scared but very fascinated, very privileged, it was amazing it really was a mix of emotions .. i kept watching it till it faded away but the thing is when i first noticed it from the west it was about 3 miles away more or less and very bright but as it passed away not even a mile away it faded, diminish as though it went into another dimension and that's what it look like to me.. one other thing that i think is important, this is not the first time that i have seen sphere's orbs ..In this area alone in the last 2 years i have witness 6 or 7 and 1 in the early morning day light back in the fall and it was still a bright light orb with the sun up.. i do have a vid clip of 1 and its very bouncy in the frame being that i had no time to set the tripod and also it appears that it always begins from the west to the east, exactly the same path and exactly same altitude, another words it seems to begin and end with the same route.. i have been seeing these orbs since the mid 90's where i grew up in chesaning mich. which is 1-hour s.East of mt.Pleasant... keep your eye's open towards the heavens my unknowns with an open mind and patients an your bound to see an unknown....Peace &
