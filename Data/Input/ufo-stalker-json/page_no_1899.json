to be a star it was switching colors rapidly and seemed to be in our atmosphere. it strobed green, blue yellow and violet, and although it was difficult to see (due to distance) it seemed as if it was growing and shrinking slightly. it was definitely awe-inspiring. i have seen many ufo's and sometimes come off as strange when i discuss it with people so i calmly asked my roommates what they thought of it (i have never discussed ufo stuff with them). they at first wrote it off as a star, then began to stammer and finally concluded that it was a ufo. we watched it for 10 0 15 mintues to see if anything would happen (it stayed stationary the entire time), sadly we had to rush to the hospital to see our friend. it was beautiful to view not only for its display of colors but the undeniable fact that it was not something often seen.","distance":"Over One

all the stars by name but i know the dippers and orions belt and a few others. i dont know if its venus or the north star or what its called that orions belt points to. from that star up and to the left, a couple of hand lengths away there were two stars and i thought hmmmmm that is a really bright star and i dont remember a bright star being so close to another and in that location. i've lived in austin all my life and i know what the sky usually looks like. and yes when i was a kid chemtrails didn't exist and i noticed them first and now everyones talking about them. anyway... i've seen shooting stars one night with my father and we saw about 50 of them. they tend to have a slight bit of color to them. i watched the space shuttle with my father from one side of the horizon to the other and it took 3 min. like the papers said it would. all this from my backyard. that shuttle was hard to see and looked dim like other stars. this star was brighter than any other so i was puzzled that it only had white light with no sparkle or twinkle. this star was at a stand still. the two stars together were for several puffs of my cig. sitting together. the more i looked at it, it was as if it knew i was watching. then it moved. there was a brief instant of shock. i thought is it moving or is it the tree making it look as though it's moving. there is a big bare tree easily seen through in the middle of my yard. i put my hand up to make the texas long horn hookem high sign to get some degree of distance between them, to see if they were actually separating. over what felt like an 8 second time span my fingers grew wider until i could not spread my index and pinky any further apart. it moved about 6 to 8 inches in a straight line, the length of my fingers apart, while streached out pointing at the sky. then it slowly like a bulb or batteries going out in a flash light, went out. but it was moving up into space because it was no longer moving in any direction but away. i've seen enough planes to know if it should have still been in my vision from the size of the light to the distance and time it took to move like it did. this was nothing other than a ufo.. be it reversed enginered or other worldy life forms,don't know don't care. i'm not in shock or anything but i am amazed. you always want to see one but dont know how you will think about it after.

realized that it was moving much too quickly for any object i had ever seen in the sky and was moving too jerkily and quickly to be real. we watched it for a period of perhaps 5 or 6 minutes and then it took off across the whole horizen of the sky in the matter of 2 or 3 seconds and disappeared. we have never in our lives seen anything like this, and never expected to in our lives. we don't say this is alien or manmade but we saw it with our own eyes and are as amazed by it as anyone could be. our daughter only had her cell phone to get pictures of it and in the pictures it only looks like a

from the paxtonia area. it was early evening, but the sun wasn't down yet. as i approached the 81/83 split i noticed an odd triangular cloud high in the sky above and slightly to the left of me. i kept glancing up at it, because of it's regular shape and clean lines. i kept thinking, what a funny looking cloud it was. when i finally got a chance to stare at it for a few seconds i could see that it wasn't a cloud. it was an elongated triangle, sharply pointed at one end with three points at the other end. it was pointed straight up and moving that direction at what seemed to be a moderate pace. it appeared to be white in color except for an area just below the center where it was glowing yellow-orange. i could see what appeared to be condensation streaming down it's length starting about 1/4 of the way down from the pointed end. the condensation obscured any details of it's surface until it reached the glowing section. the condensation ended there, which i took to indicate that the glowing area was very hot. there was no con-trail left behind and no sound. no lights were visible. when i passed under the 83 overpass i lost sight of it for a few seconds. when i looked back up on the other side it was gone. nothing was left behind. i looked around and noticed passenger jets and other aircraft in the sky. it was at that moment that the ufo's size and speed became apparent. even though it hadn't appeared to be overly large it dwarfed everything else in the sky. i would have to say that it was many times the size of a 747 and was moving several times faster than the commercial airliners i could see. my thought at the time was that the ufo must have used some type of ftl drive to have vanished so quickly. if it had used some type of cloak or optical camouflage, why let us see it at all. initially, i wondered if it might be some new toy the military was playing with, but it's size was just too big. i can't imagine that we have ever built anything that large. then there was it's disappearing act. optical cammo, maybe, but why display it to the public right over the city. not likely.\r\n\r\ni continued driving south on 81 toward enola and looking in the sky for anything else that might be unusual. when i was about half-way to enola i noticed six cigar-shaped or cylindrical ufo's flying in a circular formation headed north-west. they were silver-gray in color and fairly low in the sky. they appeared to be much smaller than the other ufo, but were still larger than anything else i could see in the sky. some were oriented horizontally and some were rotated about 45 degrees from horizontal and they all appeared to be flying sideways, with their entire length pushing through the air. they left no con-trail and there was no sound that i could hear. no lights were visible. they were headed in the general direction of the allegheny national forest. i lost site of them as i approached the enola exit. they were headed away from where the larger ufo had been and judging by the size difference, my thought at the time was that the larger ufo brought these cigar-shaped ufo's here and dropped them off. the cigar-shaped ufo's could be landing craft. after searching on the internet i found a picture that matches the cigar-shaped ufo's that was taken in colorado close to the same date. my impression at the time was that whatever these were they were not built by us. if we had built them, they wouldn't fly that way.\r\n\r\nthese were my first ufo sightings. i would like to note that if curiosity hadn't made me take another look at that funny-looking cloud i wouldn't have noticed the first ufo and would have completely missed the 6 smaller ones. i was surprised that they made no effort that i could see to hide from us. it was like they didn't care if we saw them or not. it was not what i was expecting. i have included a rough drawing of the first ufo.

(she had texted me earlier that night, she told me there was alot of activity the night before and asked me to come over - i couldn't make it tonight - who would have though all this would happen over my house tonight).  finally at 11:45 pm she answered.  she'd been in her hot tub and didn't hear the phone.\r\ni frantically explained what i had been seeing.  they were still coming in groups.  she searched her skies but couldn't see anything from her location during the time on the phone (which was from that period onward).  she told me to grab a camera and try to get any pictures i could with a timed exposure if possible.  as we talked, 2 more big pyramid/diamond shaped ones went by, one was underneath the other.   i tried to take pictures, but they didn't turn out too well (best one attached).  she was thinking of trying to drive to catch them to film them, but the direction they were traveling wasn't conducive to doing so (the distance was too great and terrain is mountainous).  at the direction (nnw towards monroeville --see satellite map) and speed they were traveling, it would have made it very unlikely they could be caught on film with better equipment, we thought.  but then more of them kept coming.  even after midnight, they were still coming in clusters.  i don't know how long i was out there, it could have lasted until about 12:30 am or so on the 20th.  in my best estimate, i'd say that at least  800 to more than 1000 of the small spheres/orbs were seen, plus the 4 bigger crafts.  then it stopped.  my friend checked all of the available webcams around the area in direction of travel, but most don't show too much sky, unfortunately.  the pittsburgh skyline one doesn't have an archive view option either.  just to make sure it wasn't my mind messing with me, she even pulled up the online flightaware.Com screen which showed no commercial aircraft in my area at all.  i just needed confirmation that some sort of new aircrafts weren't flying around that i hadn't seen before.  i wish i had the right equipment to film them.  the only videos i could find that showed similar behavior, but a much smaller amount of them is the online video of \"ufo fleet guadalajara mexico\".  my friend had a video she shot of a similar craft flying by her in 2009 that has a similar shape (9/14/09), but different lights (attached small portion of her video).  she says they can morph shape and size and change lighting, so perhaps it was one of the same kind flying by her area that i saw.\r\n\r\nmy first real undeniable ufo sighting experience, and all i can say is wow.    i'm not sure how to take this.  i'm not sure what to do about this information -- that we are not only not alone in the universe, but that we are being visited on earth by some visitors who come here with a very large number of crafts.  the sad thing is that most don't even know they are here.    i hope that others who may have witnessed this amazing sighting will come forward.  i can't believe i could be the only one who saw them.  i am feeling extremely anxious now not knowing what will happen due to their presence.  the next time they show up, if my husband's sleeping, i'm going to bash him on the head to come and witness this with me.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27943,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4244098,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212011-0020","longitude":-79.7817724,"occurred":1298186100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,

close)what i saw off in a near distance was some kind of air craft..I couldn't see the shape,because it was dark outside, however there were lights under the aircraft. the main thing that caught my eye was the sparks or sparkles coming out of the bottom of the craft. the best way i can describe it, is the sparklers that kids have on the 4th of july.. it looked very similar to those, but several coming down and disappearing before they hit the ground. i was on my cell phone talking to my mother at the time...She told me to hang up and take a picture with my phone. when i tried, the craft was gone. i thought it may have been something the air force was doing, so i thought nothing of it. then the next day, was 9/11/2001. i've told my parents, husband, kids and some friends about what i seen, but didn't think much of it..Until i was just watching your show ufo's over earth bucks county flap...When the woman was talking about the glitter falling and the image was animated, i started

in front of my house, i got out and looked up at the stars.  i tend to do this every time i park because of odd things i have seen in front of my house in the past but i can't list because i don't remember the dates, just can recall the years of the other sightings. anyways, so when i exited the car that night, in the sky directly above me there were 3 orbs. one large and 2 smaller. they flew and hovered in a triangular motion.  i stood in the middle of the street and watched them for a few minutes and walked as i followed them. i tried to take photos with my iphone but the objects were much to high. they were very very high up, much to high to be a plane or helicopter or jet. they also flew much to slow to my knowledge to be something like a plane. i followed it down the block about 5 houses down.  there was some overcast so i kept my eyes on where i believed it was until the clouds moved and would follow it again.  the objects seemed to high they could be in space.  the largest moving orb would be slightly smaller than the north star in size, the others were maybe one to two sizes smaller than that.  after watching for a few minutes, i had called my neighbor to come out.  when he came, i asked to him to tell me i wasn't crazy and to tell me what he saw.  first he said that it was a plane or something like it and then once he saw how they moved he said he could not explain what it was.  they would hover at times, then move quickly then slow.  it never went straight for long it seemed as if it could move in whatever direction it wanted, go backwards ect. i felt very frightened at first when it was directly above me because i of course thought it would descend down. once it started moving i had kept my eyes and my feelings changed to curiosity. i just want to know what we saw and if anyone else observed it that night.  after 20 minutes had past, the overcast was much to heavy to see it any longer.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I would like to go over two separate items, both related in a way to the phoenix lights incident.  i lived in arizona from aug 2005 - aug 2008 in pinal county city of maricopa.  the city of maricopa is not in the  phoenix valley, it's actually 20 miles or so south of the valley. i used to work on 19th ave and 101 in north phoenix.  driving home i would exit the highway 10 onto the maricopa highway heading south.  this route would take me to the back side of south mountain and the estrella mountains.  regularly around 8pm once i was on the maricopa highway and my view was no longer blocked by south mountain, i would see orange balls of light suspended in the air in formations of 1 to 2 to up to 6 or 7.  these lights would appear and dissapear, and as i got closer to the city of maricopa the lights would end up being much further away than first though.  my take on these lights is that they are flares from military excercises near the barry goldwater bombing range.  since i lived south of the valley, we had a much better view of the southern sky which people in the valley are unable to clearly see due to south mountain and the estrella mountains.  i, including my brother and several other family members would see these lights on a regular basis, and the sightings continued the entire time i lived in arizona and probably still can be seen.  these are excactly like the lights reported in the phoenix lights incident, the only difference is that they are low enough so that people in the valley cannot see them because the mountains are in the way.  in my opinion i agree completely with the analysis on the show i was watching on tv which prompted me to report this. on the night of the phoenix lights incident the flares were dropped at a high enough elevation and they could be seen above the mountain.  what i can say that if someone starting today drove the maricopa highway on a nightly basis around 8pm they would observe the same lights. they look like orang balls of light floating over the city of maricopa, but as you drive closer you realize they are much further south.  \r\nafter rationalizing the lights to myself and feeling 100% confident i know what they are, this second part of my story is a little different.  on the night of the phoenix lights incident, there was also a triangular shaped object described floating near south mountain. i had previously heard the stories on this object but i was completely and utterly shocked when i actually encountered it.  as i mentioned earlier, i worked in north phoenix for the first 6 months i lived in arizona.  i would drive 55 miles each way to get from north phoenix to the city of maricopa.  i left work one evening in january- feb time frame around 7pm and started heading south on highway 51.  in the north the drive starts off at a higher elevation which allows a view clear across the valley.  off in the distance i noticed a traingle formation in the area of south mountain.  it was strange because it almost looked like it was in the flight patter of planes coming in from the west and landing at sky harbor, but these lights were not moving.  i was still very far north and eventually driving down the 51 the view is blocked due to the walls, bridges, ect.  my drive down the highway 51 to the highway 10 to the maricopa highway was about 30 mins, so eventually i forgot about what i saw.  when i got off the 10 and started heading south on maricopa highway, i looked towards the mountains and was completely shocked to see this giant traingle formation of lights suspended right behind south mountain.  this object at this time must have hovering in the same area for over 30 minutes. it was 5 lights in a triangle formation, and it was very large.  i could not believe what i was seeing, and i actually pulled over on the side of the highway with another car and we both got out and looked at the object.  eventually the object slowly moved from behind south mountain in a northwest direction between the estrella mountains and dissapeared from my sight behind the north face of the estrella mountains.  this object was silent, and large, and did not change shapes.  it remained a triangle.  i can't explain the traingle, and how it remained it the same location for such a long period of time without being contested in any way.  i know sky harbor airport must have been able to see this object, but i didn't hear anything on the news.  my best guess is jan-feb 2006 when i saw it because i only worked at that location from oct 2005- march 2006 before deciding the drive was too far. i am still in shock that i actually saw the traingle that has been described in previous sightings.  it was right in front of me and the size of it was what i was so taken back by because when i initially saw it i was about 30 miles away. i don't know what it was, but i sure would like to know.
