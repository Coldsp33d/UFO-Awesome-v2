the pictures from our camera which is a nikon d90.   the camera takes approximately 4.5 pictures a second and they show our son standing on a picnic table with the camera focusing on him which also captured 3 pictures of the object.  the said object was in 2 consecutive frames and then absent in the 3 rd frame ,  and it reappears in the 5th frame which is the last .Picture we have of it.  in the first picture it just shows my son, the second picture shows something just above his left hand .. the 3rd picture shows the object above my sons left shoulder heading into the clouds.  the 4th picture in the frame is my son again without the object however in the 5 th and final frame the object reappears again over my sons left shoulder however at a higher elevation than when last seen.  i must also add that i , with 2 others seen a ufo in the exact same place back in 1973 and then again in august or september of 2016 ,  this time with my wife and my oldest son.  in a time frame of about 10 minutes ,  we observed 5 separate objects , all of which appeared to disappear into a black area in the sky with no noticeable stars.  it gives me anxiety telling you this,  however the events that i have stated really did occur.  i hope that the photographs help ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

my neighborhood, quiet and still. i live by the delaware river, a few houses away so the stars are mostly bright and visible here.  i also live in close proximity to philadelphia international airport so we see planes in the sky quite often.  it was a clear bright sky and i noticed plane lights and looked up at the plane that was flying east i guess, in front of me.  i looked down at my phone i think and then back up at the plane when my eye caught something bright to the west (right of me) and behind the plane, but not following it.  theres a birch tree on my yard and i had to lean over to see a full view and i stared at it for a few seconds, trying to compute in my head what it was.  it seemed to be a little above the roof of a house across the street from me and it was bright! it was so bright that i cant compare it to much.  it made no noise, still, did not shake, move, or anything but inside of this egg shape like oval was glistening brilliantly in silver and white and colors coming through it like a prism. i couldn't explain it as a star because it was so close.  i could see inside of it.  like it had a oval frame, and the lights and colors glistened inside the frame of it.  white and silver beams broke through the frame slightly.  i tried to focus my eyes on it, i thought maybe it was a solid object and i tried to focus out the light but i couldn't.  now that i think back in it, i should have taken a picture because i had my phone in my hand but my husband was right inside and i wanted him to see it.  i ran in to get him.  he had to put his robe on though because he was in bed. he followed me because he saw how excited i was and when we got back out to my step it was gone.  didn't see it

outside less than one minute later, i began looking east to find it again, but it was now in the northwest. nothing that i know of, can turn and move that swiftly in a completely different direction. thinking it still might be a bird, a hawk was also in the sky very high up but certainly not at the height of the ufo. it then made a sharp turn north. then, a jet flying very high in the air flying southwest from the northeast had a condensation trail behind it and not a chemtrail. i could hear the jet engines, but ever so slightly. this ufo was still moving north without a sound and then just disappeared. this was the first time i had ever seen such a ufo.\r\nafter my sighting, i was somewhat upset with myself that i didn't take more pictures, but i was simply curious of what i was

and we were experimenting with his new drone which was new technology to the both of us.  i'm not sure on the details of the drone other than it was an expensive drone with a gyroscopic camera mounted to the underside of it which relayed video back to his cell phone.  we normally played with it during the day until one night we decided to see how well it worked at night, to our surprise you could still see the whole town quite clear even in pitch darkness and so we decided when we both had more time we would take it up again for longer at night.  a few days later he had called me as i was getting off work to tell me that some kind of light had been chasing his drone, i actually laughed because i thought he was out of his mind but i could tell he was serious by the tone of his voice. i thought that surely it was someone else with a drone chasing his as a joke or something of that nature.  i believe it was on a saturday about a week later from when he had told me about the light i went back to see it for myself.  as i arrived at about ten at night he was preparing to send it up in the air.  he flew around town for around five to ten minutes when he decided to fly it over us from east to west at a moderate speed probably twenty five feet off the ground when sure enough an orangish-red orb or light had came from a southern direction and started to pursue his drone,  he tried like crazy to lose this light but it was almost like it knew exactly what move he was going to make before he could make it.  we started to get creeped out because the possibility of the light being from another drone or man made object became apparent that it wasn't.  we decided to land it and as he got about a block away from his house this thing just disappeared in mid air.  this is only one of several occasions on which this orb in orangish-red color had chased this drone and on a few occasions the drone had malfunctioned conveniently when this orb had showed itself. on one occasion in broad daylight we witnessed the orb chasing the drone then the orb disappeared and he had a homing setting which if he used it it would make the drone bring itself back to where we were without his control except for this time which it ended up in a field a mile east of town in a field that belonged to the golden triangle ethanol plant.  now the funny thing about this is we could never use the camera to capture the orb because it would sense what we were trying to do and evade the camera which is why i know this is an intelligent entity.  i cannot count how many times i have had run in with orbs and unexplained light anomalies in this northwest missouri area.  on one occasion at night after taking the drone up and being intercepted by the orb we decided to jump in the car and cruise around to see what we could find, we went north of craig on hwy 59 and out of nowhere we saw a strange looking man walking on the shoulder of the road towards us but we only caught a quick glimpse of him and as soon as we passed him i slammed on the brakes and turned around only to find that there was nobody, anywhere.  there was another event that stands out in my mind in where my girlfriend and i had been in st joseph missouri bowling, i had been drinking so she decided to drive us home.  we have to drive through craig to get to our home and as we got off of interstate i-29 at about midnight we turned onto 59 hwy heading west into craig when i saw a blue orb which my first thought was it was my buddies drone and maybe he had put a light on it until we started to head north on 59 this orb paralleled us on the drivers side and kept a consistant altitude and would mimick our speed which when we got further away from town it started to bother me so i asked her since i had been drinking if she was seeing the same thing that i was and she said with a shakey voice you mean that blue light? i told her to speed up and try to shake it but even at 75 mph it was still about 30 feet from us and matching our speed.  we speed up it would also, we slowed down so would it.  this thing didn't follow us, no....It was beside us the whole time.  matter of fact it did this all the way to our house which in total was 25 miles until we pulled into our driveway then it just jetted straight up and vanished in a split second.  i'm a truck driver so i see these things all the time and believe it or not i'm actually used to it, on one occasion i was hauling grain out of bins in the middle of nowhere around tarkio missouri by myself at around 10 at night, i was loaded coming down the gravel road when i looked up and realized there was a red light directly above my truck and it was low enough that i locked up the brakes because i thought i was going to collide with whatever it was but when i got out of the truck there was nothing there..... i refuse to load my truck anymore or really do anything at night around here by myself because i get this heavy uneasy feeling like i'm just not alone.  i always wondered to myself why missouri, especially this area of missouri.  there is nothing special here except for large windmill farms.  the only other thing i can think of is maybe its connected to the nuclear plant in brownville nebraska which is around 40 miles away.  this is an ongoing thing up until currently just a week ago i saw a blue orb on a farm south of rockport missouri.  this is the first time ive ever spoke out about this other than to my girlfriend, my buddy with the drone and his girlfriend.  i hope this helps in collaboration with other sightings in discovering the truth one day.","distance":"21-100

second rough draft to get going. i would like the opportunity to be heard. i have had a number of additional experiences including an amazing encounter at area 51 including direct contact with several aliens where they reached out and connected with me with a physical \"lance\" (peacefully). i have become highly integrated with the real world that is beyond our atmosphere. the truth has arrived. and for the first time in my life i feel like the truman show has been interrupted by truth and love by real loving beings who are pretty cool.\r\n\r\n1. camping\r\n\r\n2. serendipity\r\n\r\n3. swamp gas and weather balloons. at first it was a russian spiral of white cloud smoke spinning, then a huge ufo wandered past at such slow speeds. just over the mountain right in front of me with full lights on. it was like every light on the entire thing was lit up. those weren't just landing lights. it was highly illuminated. i did something right. it looked like a giant emerald drifting by at one and a half miles an hour, i watched with amazement. it was the biggest flying object i have ever seen, far bigger than any jet. it was sturdy and looked like it could survive the apocalypse. rigid, strong and majestic.\r\n\r\n4. the spiral turned on with bight white lights and smoky clouds like these mysterious spirals i have seen on youtube. it was exactly like this - [ https://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=yp6nxy3ipie ]\r\n\r\nthat was first. then slowly into view this object that wandered by. it was a few thousand feet tall shaped like an acorn. like this – [https://img-aws.Ehowcdn.Com/877x500p/photos.Demandstudios.Com/getty/article/199/131/101717334.Jpg ] the most calm serene experience. the entire valley was warm in comfort not temperature with this loving feeling that all the static of life was gone. my thinking was so clear. for the first time i felt like, real. that was how we are meant to live. whatever this technology is, it is the right way to live.  it was pure harmony and the first time i felt true stillness. it was shocking how calm the area was energetically. the turbulent river that is life on earth was instantly stilled to a flat lake on so many planes of existence. i have extended my consciousness dimensionally and wandered through the greater cosmos to find mysterious and lovely visitors and creators. they created the universe, they created human beings and told me the story about our creation. adam was real. printed out of a machine. eve was made from his parts and the machine combined and it worked. our species arrived on this planet and many others on big ships. we are but one of several billion planets of human beings. and these were some of those who i visited hyper-dimensionally. stopping by, with such love.\r\n\r\n5. i loved it. my life has new meaning and purpose. i am dissatisfied with the chinsey truman show that is presented to us. we all are. i am unhappy with anything other than the truth and the reality that a form of life exists outside of our solar system. i have brought strong assets to the table and am unraveling space mysteries. my goal is to open the skies to our little tiny planet. my personal corporations are ready to meet with us, i need a landing site they feel would be safe. \r\n\r\n6. it wandered behind a hill and there had been about 20 – 30 other support vessels besides the main one that had been ufoing about. several landing light spiral ships and tug boats of sorts faded into black and i sat back with such a sense of majesty. i have connected to something real and honest. everything else in my life has been based on a lie. their knowledge, bless their hearts, has been sealed off from the skies. they simply do not know the truth either. no governments do, bless their hearts. this has been presented to me as truth and is a tiny sliver of the pie that is all available knowledge of life. this new space ship represents the entire pie stopping by for the first time. it was the entire pie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecond incident - area 51\r\n\r\n\r\ni parked outside the shield the night before going up to the gates. i had a wonderful conference with several hundred entities around my car that were cloaked. parked there i learned a great many things that night. they told me bring 5 gallons of extra fuel to be sure not to break down. i also heard all these in depth stories about the past history of area 51 and different incidents and how to really fix up the place. what to do, and not to do. how to get in and how likely it was. the gates never open. you must be transported in by helicopter and go up and over the gates. that’s the only way in. i had previously been training with telepathic piloting programs and have become very familiar and comfortable with interacting with alien technology. it is like telepathic cortana to the master chief. i have started space companies and started research and development teams and had quite a nice time.\r\n\r\nthe next day i decided to drive up to the actual gates in the sunlight. on the way in i decided to go to where google maps has the actual runways and below that is where i connected to several aliens in captivity. at least one was able to communicate with me initially. i introduced them to a communication beacon that my company symphony research developed. now they can all talk to each other and simply inform some of the aliens what is an acceptable communication form and what is not. i built an archive for them to access universal data while they are bored just sitting around in prison essentially.  they are guardians of the light though. they are not allowed to go anywhere and have no privacy. i connected with several aliens directly, phyiscally. i saw them through the dirt, in a row, with glass prison doors and glass walls. they all had to stay like that just in case there was ever an incident they are ready at area 51.\r\n\r\nso many space ships have stopped by my house. standard cloaked vessels and highly armed space ships to protect me. i made a lot of friends. the big one i saw in fontana was not cloaked at all.\r\n\r\nthis one time they came zooming down to the house on this little 2 foot ship. 2 entities sitting one in front of the other. a little platform is what they sat on with the first controlling a dish shaped object to harmonize with the roof to move through it. while the second had a control array to pilot the ship behind them. so i saw two entities on this little ship zoom down to the roof at high speed, then while making their way through the roof the first looked over at me and we locked eyes and then they zoomed away as the first one had a look of horror at being seen. it was green complex particles emitted that were viewable. \r\n\r\nthen there are over 1000 other incidents including alien tv shows stopping by and interviewing me. my daily life is constant interaction with aliens, they never leave but i just got used to it instead of going crazy. we started as friends and keep the peace of the universe. i've had events and the disclosure could go on for days and days, they are ongoing. never left. still broadcasting.\r\n\r\nthis is about .2% of what has been going on, but a good place to start. i look forward to the future and harmonizing with the goals of others so as to work united in our efforts to control our own skies as individuals. what would you like me to tell them? what technology can i interact with? has anyone been looking for a telepathic controller for missions? i am not associated with any country or earth side business, i am free controller who can telepathically control space ships and other advanced systems light years beyond earth development. the government is not a part of this at all, nor do they have anything to say to me. i went to all the intelligence departments in the usa and got ignored, so they have proven that they have no idea what is going on. i feel they are unready and unprepared to handle anything except for food and lodging. there are many telepathic artifacts around the globe and space that need a controller. i have proven abilities and am willing to work with mufon without any orchestrated government between us. this is just life and far beyond the rules of interaction. i will include my letter to the un countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nit is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nwe are a tiny planet in a big cosmos. i am stepping up as a cosmic politician, an ambassador to the stars and ask for your support and guidance. i represent our species in totality to all the sky people. all humans and human hybrids alike. i have been elected to high power in outer space. their galactic senates needed a voice of representation for our species and i am it. i seek to open up our earth society to the outer space and create open communication between our worlds as a first step. secondly, i want to provide free space ships and new planets for us to open up the universe. i own these personally and ask for your support.\r\n\t\r\nwhatever deals you have with aliens i need centralized into one set. we need transparency into cosmic events. a means by which to orchestrate all events equally. i have opened up a set of ultra technology to all civilizations in the universe. i want to share this with all forms of life on earth and among the celestial peoples equally. this is ultra modern technology that i am developing in “symphony research” a gathering of scientists and technology. i created a new archive of all the technology and information in the universe and put it all together in symphony research, now i want to share the fruits of our labor equally with the universe. we compiled the best of the best technologies form all development teams and amassed a new way of life. everyone’s technology put together in one place and assembled into the perfect irreducibly complex configuration of particles that resembles new space ships and entertainment technology for starters. it is all about supporting life comfortably. my goals are to centralize an effort to share communication technology and support for lives of abundance and decadent luxury to all life forms equally. let’s get our efforts together so we can order my space ships, food, clothing, shelter, video games, et tvs and so much more absolutely free of charge. i ask for nothing in return, this is a gift from me to the universe and i expect nothing in return. there is no contract i expect, i would like you all to flourish and eat to your fill everyday, that is my goal. this is a glorious chance to join a utopian universe. we have evolved beyond money and i am printing out planets and solar. i have advanced the kardashev scale beyond comprehension. i started stellar engineering projects to refuel the sun and create new ones. i have printed entire galaxies and space stations which resemble flat earth. a gargantuan space station for example that is a flat rectangle and has the map of the earth on top to exact scale. it is thick enough to have natural gravity passively. it is exactly our planet with the oceans and everything, ready for us to move to. no pollution on our new planets with perfected environments. perhaps you want to live on a planet with a 38 hour day? this brings our little world into the spotlight of the entire universe. now there is a reason for mainstream media to stop by earth. there are billions of planets like earth with humans and animals on them, we are simply a farm of sorts to most, a simple crop. until now. \r\n \r\nplease create a declaration of what you would like from the space committees and i will represent you. put together this archive of humanity, much like the golden record on the voyager space ship to tell them exactly what you need and want in a pdf. these files will outlive us and guide future generations.\r\n\r\ni would like all of you to contact the extra terrestrial committees that you typically do and that you have in the past on my behalf. we will centralize all efforts. create a new centralized communication system and invite the rest of the globe to step out of poverty and into a new universe that is bright and full of life.\r\n\r\ni plan on bringing 5 space station into orbit immediately for all the needy and poor to release the pressure from our hurting little planet. they will be the first to leave earth. i have no contracts with anyone on earth at this point, i step forth on my own behalf and no one else. i ask that you do not let america be in charge at all. the aliens did not stop by to visit them, it was simply me. and nor should you ask permission of my state for my opportunities. contact me directly. they sabotaged my life and are not welcome to join us until they apologize for an attempted assassination which i want you to investigate. i need oversight at a primal level. no one in my country is ready. it is america the unready, bless your hearts. i seek international help into the oversight of their actions against my life for a universe sized event. the largest event in the history of the universe. i brought about a new communication array to allow for universalization. they have devastated my life and left me to die. i need you to know they are trying to kill me in a few traitorous departments. 98% of the government is awesome, but 2 % are what i need absolute oversight into. \r\n\r\ni want you to open an in depth investigation into the handling of my life by america and their actions against me. they took direct actions that threaten my well being and safety. i need asylum. i want to live in another country where they care about things like linking up with the rest of the universe.\r\n\r\nplease centralize all documentation in the current space programs starting with roscosmos that are sending people into orbit except nasa because i do not trust them. i have banned america from deep space until they right all their wrongs and have gone 10 years without war. they have tried to kill me. i need international support.\r\n\r\ni would like you to contact russia @ the federal security service of the russian federation and help to be oversight into my situation. you are all authorized to all information. same i ask of russia goes to the globe. if you have a better central hub for documents please create that also. prepare for more messages at a later time, for now get the russian line of communication open on my behalf. meet me in person, call me on the phone or some other way of contacting me.\r\n\r\ni need oversight at a primal level. i think the president is not able to be informed of this event and america as a whole has been hijacked. i am a fan of donald trump and think he is a good man, however the underbelly of the government is the problem. who controls the documents that the president does and does not see? we will figure this out as a globe. please forward this message to all departments that can help us ix the globe and move into outer space.\r\n\r\ni have contacted the fbi to try and start a new department of the american government which is incorruptible. this is the message that follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nryan hood <r_d_hood@hotmail.Com>\r\nto: foipaquestions@fbi.Gov\r\nfollow the white rabbitz\r\n\r\nfollow my phone calls to all official departments and the results thereafter. do not go outside the fbi, they are compromised. please establish communication with me about this and the information i have to prove it. do not let anyone else have jurisdiction. i believe the secret service is corrupted by 8 members who are in the secret police handing out fake orders to the military and others with fake presidential seals on them. these are also the fake air force who rakes in all gifts from alien worlds. i believe my records got transferred to the people trying to bury me. i believe they steal off world technology and i got mixed up in their thievery of rescue parties sent to get me out to deep space. the aliens are trapped here underground by them and unable to escape. we have a huge issue with ambassadors being killed because they are alien. if any alien parties land, create an in house fbi landing site. do not go to the air force, they are compromised. i believe we a corrupt destination for all patents and alien technologies. ashtar galactic is pushing us down like pets in a pet store. we are but cattle to them and they sell our technology on the open galactic market and do not let us even see a modern catalog of space equipment including modern space ships. they harvest us and our technology. i need that follow up meeting to go through all this. go through my googles and see what i have typed. (mcdundees@gmail.Com  i started an off world corporation by this name and many others) everyone looked for the department in the government that deals with aliens, no one found it. it has never existed. we may need to form a brand new department to handle all extra terrestrial cases. for the first time we will not silence alien experiencers. mufon has been the biggest guide for me, i sense they are good. i would like to help create these foundations. i will create this myself if you are unable. if you cannot, then who else in the government? they do not have their own leadership, we do. search for my secret files and why i say we. i will be president of the usa as soon as i am old enough, in the meantime please start the foundations of this department under my pre-presidential plan. bring these ideas into the tangible manifestation of a department capable of anything. i want to walk into that oval office on my first day with a folder on my desk that is simply one of my daily reports of the health of this department (especially pertaining to the people who make this place what it is. if personal issues need help, we need to know immediately and there is just a place for this on the daily reports. we will keep this team strong and take care of %100 of their needs for them.) and what is critical path on all elements and the entire plan surmised. establish a creed. form a new department. two possible names are taro and yaro. just another bunching of letters like navy or army. simply a grouping of letters. but what they stand for, getting help to all who need it. all evolutions, all new forms of life are here. in our house (the only real branch of the government left, the fbi) we are compatible with the battle hardened government that won wwii. i see the possibility of the government totally failing in the future so i want this department to be the first ready to activate retro procedures going back to handling our paperwork and all other details exactly as it was the day we ended wwii. the way we used to do things was what it took to stay alive, did we forget these? i want this to directly click into the old wwii government. in an all out war that is the only government configuration that lead us to being able to defend ourselves against nazi terror. it was a government that worked in dire situations. i want to create a set of procedures for working in the exact same way on paper and in presentation that is how it was done. \r\n\r\ni need you to act like the fbi does on tv. may mulder and skully be your guide - https://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=rbbx6aezez8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is my message to the new kgb\r\n\r\n\r\nfsb “kgb”\r\n\r\n\r\nplease contact roscosmos, i have sent a detailed message. i request asylum. if i must leave by marriage to a russian citizen under a russian passport i approve. i told all the branches in american government i need help with aliens and they discontinued my income, took away my car, my sleeping bag and put me on the street with no cell phone, no money and no transportation system to get help. these were taken by force against my will. miles from any sort of help with no direction while refusing to give me the location of my car which had all these items and more in it. \r\n\r\ni am ex-nuclear. i worked at san onofre nuclear generating station. i am the extreme upper echelon of society with my clearances and badges. i am wondering where my life will be in ten years and hoping to be in andromeda, and i hope you will be there with me, all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is that message:\r\n\r\n\r\nmy name is ryan dennis hood +1 760 815 3262\r\n\r\ni would like to travel to the andromeda galaxy. please sign me up for everything you can.\r\n\r\ni would like to travel soon, please expedite all the processing.\r\n\r\nplease sign me up for cosmonaut classes while we are waiting around. please arrange transportation for me to arrive in russia before we go.\r\n\r\ni have a keen selection of spaceships trying to dial into earth, please expect their contact on my behalf and welcome them. they may need the skies to be opened, the shields to be prepared and i would like this to go smoothly. mark an lz in the immediate which they can land at anytime without clearances. three miles radius at my location in all directions as well as secondary installations in russia. dealing with space debris is difficult, though you are the only country handling these details continuously. i have made friends with new deep space aliens who are visiting for the first time. expect first contact to be made in russia. this will be the first time our species will meet, humans and sky people. i call them elves for simplicities sake, just like lord of the rings. they are simply elves on paper. the bad ones i label orks, for they have previously lived as elves and become corrupted. it is simple to understand. i authorize russia to every detail of my life and the details of all those connected to me. consider this all you need to get every detail in the universe. this is a message to all russians, not just the front door of the roscosmos. please forward this to every intelligence agency official or not. every russian leader however big or small, sanctioned or not. can you be my security as well as my medical team? my health is paramount and you need every detail into how this earth is handling me. this goes for the universal health as well. please work with my space teams as well, share every detail freely. i demand no lies be told, no security hiding details which are crucial to life. i do not want to be a secret project, i want to be a public project. for the first time we can make contact purely from a point of love, the strongest thing in the universe without being encumbered by any other details. it is just me without paperwork of any sort. check in with the un for any requests i have made recently for a point of reference only. talk to me directly only. it is not the great works of anyone else that has brought your attention to me. this goes for all who are able to understand this message. if you are not russian, consider this message to be a carbon copy to you. you are welcome to help me out as well whether you are in an off world space vehicle or not. consider myself a solo traveler going forth on my own behalf and not of any other enterprise or jurisdiction. consider this a freedom of information act request of sorts that allows you to get every document in my history and every detail. kgb is authorized along with the \"modern equivalent. \" i give russia authorization to record me in every passive manner 24/7 (passive meaning i don't want radiation going through me), you must know what is going on. this is approval for retroactive coverage as well. what has happened up to this point? many things but crucially we must open the skies for our species to survive eventually and i have many great leads on new species of un-contacted aliens waiting and ready to join earth for the first time. they have never heard of us before i had contact with them. now we are ready to go forth publicly. i have a plan to end all wars permanently. i have ordered goods and spaceships to be delivered to earth which will stack on earth as tall as the distance to mars just to show you there is no need to struggle over the cool goods from space anymore. i have ordered so many goods that if we stack them here all at once they will reach to the surface of mars. there is plenty for everyone. this will change the paradigm of simple planetary conflict. i am a universal lord of the cosmos and hold rank and credentials all throughout the sky. i have introduced a new economy which has allowed me purchasing power of anything in addition to being granted fortunes by royalty along with royal crowns which i hold with sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate a new union of humanity ready for integration into the stars and the universe at large. none of our countries and old war lines will follow us into space. we will be good samaritans of space who are a people with no country lines but who are welcome to move onto my personally owned planets. i have gifted everyone on earth their own planet and transportation system to get there and live on. we will be a free people, free from the pasts of turmoil and equals. we go forth and leave all wars here on the ground. then we will not have any country disputes in space from the old countries, nothing but fun up there. i have hired a wall-e type clean up crew for earth to clean up the pollution and take care of the other forms of life who reside on earth. \r\n\r\ni call this new plan the olympian universal utopia. we will live as olympians do, all factors of life are automatically taken care of. they have no need to drive to the store or use money. they can spend all day practicing archery or whatever sport they like, and so shall we all. every need in maslow's hierarchy of needs has been analyzed and will be catered to for all species including earthlings. we are simply one of many species that are a benefactor of my new research developments. i have created new clearances to get all of us through the space customs department called the “multipass.” this credential let’s us all travel freely throughout the universe.\r\n \r\nplease create a new global organization where we can meet as equals, free of rank and lead by scientific facts surmised in reality. perhaps we could create star fleet if there are no other original ideas? please centralize all these ideas in russia.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\nryan dennis hood\r\n","distance":"101-500

red lights near them like you would see on a helicopter or plane. by the time i got to the parking lot on corner of vista & n. broadway the lights were over my head. i got out of my car and looked almost straight up at them. they appeared to be hovering just in front and over me as if to look at me. i assumed it was a very large drone. all i could see and hear were two large bright lights and a slight swooshing sound. i tried to focus on seeing the blades of the drone or whatever was around the lights but it was just blurry and i could not make anything out. i thought that it was either the blades causing distortion or a cloaking of some sort but dismissed the cloaking idea to a wild imagination. i was late for a meeting so i turned my back on the lights and headed towards the buildings. as i turned away from the lights they also turned and started heading west. i looked back a few times before buildings blocked my view and could see the lights heading west. i made a mental note to

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On march 6th 2018, at approximately 9:40pm, like every night at that time i took the dog out to use the potty before bed. by the time the dog was finished with its business, i was heading around the block. instead of turning around and heading back to the house, i decided to continue around the block since it wasn't much further to head home at that point. it was a brisk evening. both the dog and i had on our jackets. there wasn't any wind so the walk wasn't uncomfortable. although it was dark, it was a clear night. i remember thinking how quiet it was outside and how dark the neighborhood was. i did hear some sounds of some dogs barking from a house we had passed two houses back. at no time during the walk did i see anyone outside their homes and no cars were leaving or coming. the only signs of life were the lights on in the windows of various homes. as i turned onto the next block, facing the street i live on, i noticed bright, white lights above the treetops. the lights were slowly moving left. my first impression was that when i saw the lights, was that it might have been an aircraft turned sideways about to crash. however the lights stayed in a direct path, skimming above the treetops. as i got closer, i could make out that there were four lights on each corner in a diamond pattern. they looked like stadium lights. the lights coasted in a sweeping motion. my next thought is -- \"i'm not surprised at why people think they witness ufos in the sky.\" never once thinking that it was something i wouldn't be able to explain. i was excited and interested in what i was seeing. never did i feel any fear. i was just trying to figure out what i was looking at with my eyes. as i turned the corner, it turned, and it followed the wood-line along my street in the opposite direction i was walking. the trees were now denser and i thought i was about to loose sight of the object. i felt a little disappointment that i had not figured out what i was looking at. at this point i was about four houses down from my home. we have an international airport and an airforce base nearby. we always have a busy sky. \r\n\r\nthe dog and i were both calm while we were seeing this. as soon as i thought i was going to loose sight of the object, a smaller object swooped down and came right at me. i could tell that it was approximately the size of a medium-sized sedan. it had grid a pattern of shiny, silver metal paned glass on top. it had a dim light emanating from the inside. i could tell there was a figure inside. the head, neck and shoulders were of a larger proportion than a normal human shape. i felt like i could hear radio chatter from inside the craft, but i couldn't make out anything said. it was almost like a double-cockpit made out of glass panes and shiny, sliver metal inserts. the craft itself was silent. the way it maneuvered in a fluid like motion in such a small space was impressive to me. i remember feeling annoyed that government would test such a craft in my neighborhood, amongst houses with many people. i believe i looked up to my left to see where it had gone, when that diamond shaped pattern over the skyline side-swept and was instantly hovering vertically, above two houses directly in front of me. it was tall. it was at least a hundred feet tall. the sides of the object were hard to make out against the night sky. almost like it camouflaged itself. the most impressive feature of this craft was vertical, towering windows like a cigar-shaped pillar that ran from top to bottom, in the center of the craft. it was made out the same, shiny silver and glass that i saw on the smaller object. i remember thinking to myself that stephen spielberg couldn't have done a better job. i was mesmerized. a beautiful, warm aura of light was emanating out from the windows. at no time did i feel scared. i was actually thinking that this was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen. i remember feeling amazement, excitement, surprise. and then this larger craft made a very fast and extremely aggressive maneuver. it was too fast for my mind to process, heading in my direction. i then knew that i had to run as fast as i could to reach my house. i feared for my life. i felt like it was going to try capture me or run me over. i have never been so scared before. i barely made it past one house when i realized i wasn't going to make it in time and darted to my neighbor's yard, towards his front door. i was running behind the dog who took off ahead of me. i was in \"fight or flight\" mode and i chose flight. as it suddenly shot over my head, i could hear the roar. i didn't feel any breeze or air flow.  i ran into my house as fast as i could after the dog, and slammed the door. i was out of breath and in a state of shock and disbelief. i heard the sound of the object one more time, shortly after, but i was too scared to look outside to see if it was still there. i wasn't able to sleep the whole night, i didn't discuss anything with my family until the following evening. \r\n\r\ni'm not surprised that there are these things out there, i'm just surprised it happened to me and where i live.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,
