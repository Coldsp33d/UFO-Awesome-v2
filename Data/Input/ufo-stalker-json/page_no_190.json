fireworks off in the distance.  we were about 4 miles away from crabtree and we could just see the fireworks above a ridge of trees.  it was a very clear night and we were admiring all the stars out.  suddenly, in another part of the sky and very, very high up, a flash of light caught our attention. my first thought was that it was a shooting star, but as it streaked westward across the sky, it made a slight pause, and then shot off and slightly upward and disappeared. it wasn't like it went out of sight, it just disappeared. this sounds strange, but it was so fast that my eyes literally had trouble keeping up with it.  it was definitely not a shooting star and i seriously doubt that any man-made object could go that fast. it reminded me a how a sparkler will momentarily leave a bright trail behind it. my husband describes it as a bright thin transparent object. the whole event lasted maybe 10 seconds.\r\n

was clear blue sky full on sun nearly directly over head.I was laying on my back in such away that the roof of the house just barely blocked the sun. that's when i saw it. at first glance i thought it was a sea gull, we do have them here. it only took me 5 or ten seconds to realise it was much too high to be a bird. seconds later a commercial plane passed underneath and i was able to get some perspective distancewise. it was pure white non metallic, stopped on a dime went left, then right i would guess hundreds of feet in but a moment. it also moved in a clockwise circle then counter clockwise. that's when i definitely realised i needed to get up. i did actually think i should take a photo or video, but in the back of my mind i knew that my phone wouldn't catch it with its proximity to the sun. i watched it for another 30 seconds as it rapidly move southish. then it finally vanished from sight, it didn't disappear, just got further and further till my eyes couldn't pick it out of the sky. as far as how i felt about it, still kinda processing but i guess the thing that surprised me is the lack of any feeling really. no fear,no excitement, no self doubt,maybe a sense of calm if anything.I guess i feel a responsibility to say something and would be curious if anyone else saw it. feel free to call or email me i'm not afraid of anyone calling me nuts. i know what i saw. best regards, hunter t","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

i realized then it wasn't a plane, when it landed it stayed in one area for about 15 minutes. it looked like a extremely green light was sitting in the woods next to my house. l felt terrified i felt

sky. i was sitting on my balcony in laguna woods talking to a friend facing east. while gazing at saddleback mountain i noticed a shimmering metal object in the sky & thought it was a plane at first. as i kept my eye on it i realized that it was too vertical looking to be a plane so i grabbed my binoculars to see what it was. while looking through the binoculars i saw a pulsating red light coming from within the center column of the object, couldn't see the red light without the binoculars so i decided to grab my dslr camera 16-270mm lens to take a few shots of it & look at it through my viewfinder. the object moved out of view before i could grab my tripod to get better shots. the consecutive shots shows that the object was changing in appearance & i believe rotating in circles while moving west in a straight line across the sky towards the ocean.","distance":"Over One
