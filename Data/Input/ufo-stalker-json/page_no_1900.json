contrails, when i noticed in the sky what appeared to be a spherical object that appeared to flash or reflect light as if it had large and small facets and slowly rotated, although no obvious exterior surface irregularities or distortions.  \r\n\r\ni observed the object hovering for approximately, less than one minute, in the north northwesterly direction approx. 30 deg.���s from the celestial median at which time i walked quickly to the nearby office (approx.60 ft. away) and retrieved a pair of 10x50 bushnell binoculars, returned to my previous position and continued to observe the object with the aid of the binoculars.\r\n\r\ni then obtained a clear visual acquisition of what appeared to be a uniformly spherical object, with a dull silver/aluminum alloy external appearance. there continued to be what appeared to be reflections emitted by the object. i was unable to see any uneven surface characteristics which would cause these reflections. \r\n\r\n   within the following one minute time frame the object began to proceed to the north northeasterly direction, with a wide turn to the north for 90 seconds until it was downrange sufficiently and no longer visible. the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 8000 ��� 10,000 ft., i make this assumption based on the presents of scattered cirrus clouds (estimated altitude of 23,000 - 25,000 ft.) as reference points as the object passed underneath these small clouds. \r\n\r\nthe object caught my attention because it did not appear to be visually consistent with any known aircraft or aircraft configurations that i typically observe. it did not appear to be a balloon as it clearly demonstrated controlled flight at a speed inconsistent with balloon operation with the current wind conditions at the time of the sighting. \r\n\r\n  this december 22nd incident was the second sighting within a little more than week���s time.\r\n i had very briefly viewed a similar object approximately one week to ten days prior to this sighting. it was during this time i decided to take the initiative to be more vigilant in my observation of the surrounding sky. it was also at this time i decided to bring a camera to work with me to record, if possible, any further unusual sightings thus giving credence to any report of a sighting. it is in my opinion that an unverified or unsubstantiated report does not always bare the same significance when compared to a report with photographic evidence. \r\n   \r\nat 18:44 january 3rd, 2011 while at work, i was observing and photographing aircraft that left persistent contrails when i observed an object similar to the object i had previously seen (a spherical metallic looking object that appeared to flash or reflect light as if it had large and small facets and slowly rotated). \r\nthe object was stationary and i observed the object for 10 seconds before training a camera in the direction and taking one photograph. i then relocated myself to a position approximately 10-15 feet away for an unobstructed view. i then took two more additional photographs within a four second time frame. total elapsed time frame for the three photographs was 50 seconds. there appeared to be no directional of the object. the object remained visible for one additional minute following my last photograph and as i redirected my attention to my camera for a readjustment, i looked back up into the sky and the object was no longer visible. \r\ni continued photographing distant aircraft with eight more photos taken of the adjacent area. no object(s) can be seen in any of these photos. my last photo was taken at 18:55:10, at which time i felt i had possibly captured on digital image what i had seen. within 25 minutes the sky in the vicinity of the objects was dark enough to allow the light from any possible celestial body to be displayed and there were no celestial bodies comparable to this size, in this area or below this area that could be seen. \r\nnow, please take note, the image that i have captured on digital imaging is not what the object actually appeared like as i watched it visually with my eye sight, as the object actually appeared to be dull metallic. when i returned home later that night, downloaded the images to my computer and examined them, i noticed the difference in their appearance and i then found another object, to the left and further in the distance which looks similar to the object that i captured on the digital images that i had originally seen.  \r\nthe camera i was using was an olympus d-545z, 4 megapixel ccd digital imaging.\r\ndetails of properties of photograph files;\r\nphoto p 1030269.Jpg  \r\ncreated:        monday, ���january ���03, ���2011, ������6:45:22 pm\r\ndimensions:

all ufo related. for a long time before any of that my mom would call to me at night from down below my balcony. she would always be talking about how a star up high was a ufo because it was not just white. i did not think one way about it or the other, because i had never witnessed anything like that. anybody in the world can give me a polygraph or hypnosis or whatever about anything that i have ever said that i witnessed, and i would pass because i have no doubts. those four times were the only times that i've ever witnessed any ufo activity, but since i was 7or8 years old, i've witnessed all sorts of paranormal things and haven't known who to tell that can really make sense as to why. anyway, here's the story.\r\n\r\none night about 2am back in 1996, i was sitting indian style on my balcony with my headphones on.I had the lights on out there, and felt like something was looking at me or something. i turned my head to the right and looked down. what i saw that night no words can describe. i immediately saw 4 white lights in equal distance apart, and i slowly stood up with the railing, and took off my headphones. there was a craft hovering the ground down beside my house. there was a semi-circle on top where it appeared someone or something could see me out of. as i stood there, my jaw dropped in fear and amazement. i was not about to make any sudden movements,because i don't know anything about them,and it did not either.That craft was longer and wider than my house,and slowly came up over the top of my balcony where i was,and the middle of it stopped and hovered silently above me.There were alot of very small white lights on the bottom;a lot of a little bit bigger neon green ones and in the center was one big red blinking one. as it did, white smoke came out of it. i was frozen with fear but in complete awe.It defied all logic and gravity. after a few minutes, it slowly went on passed, and went up into the east until i couldn't see it anymore.After that,one night i saw millions of moving red lights in the fence rows. another night, i saw 2 trianglar ufos,one behind the other flying high from east to west. i came home from a friend's at night and my mom,dad,aunt,and uncle were looking at a white circle at the top of trees with something flying through it every few seconds.\r\nabout a month after all of that happened, i was up with my dad in the kitchen getting ready to go to high school.We would listen to the trading post and drink coffee before hand. i had my hair in a ponytail and proceded to walk back to go get my books, when my dad shreaked,jumped, and said what's that?! i asked him what he was talking about and went to the bathroom to look and see. behind my left ear was a brown circle about the size of a dime.Dad was right in that it favor a ringworm but it wasn't. it favored one,because it was just a brown,lined circle with my skin color inside, but never any itching or burning.Over years of time, the mark would fade and get smaller. if it is completely gone now it has only been in the last year or so and i am 31 now. ive always been scared after that happened to come forward, but watching a ufo program on tv was the

gotton back from watching grease the movie at the local theater. we'd asked if we could sleep outside and had just made our bed in the back of an el comino in the front yard. we we're running around playing tag when i noticed it had gotton completly silent. as i looked into the sky i noticed something slowly emerging over the tree tops. i called for my sister and brother and two cousins to look at what i was seeing. we stood in a group and watched as the craft became one quarter visible to use. it was obvious it was huge as the portion we could see seemed to take up our entire corner of the property. \r\n\r\n   it was difficult to see againt the night sky, even though it was right over head. it appeared to have a rounded edge as this seemed to be the most \"solid\". yet still there were lights all around at different points. i remember really trying to figure out just how they were attached at it seemed that they were at the end of spike like protrutions or some cases anteneas. i think my mind was just trying to get a better picture by trying to fill in the blank, transparent, cloaked or just hard to see portions.  \r\n\r\n  at this point, as we stood together, my sister yelled to look at the side window. as i looked, my eyes adjusted to sight of rectangle windows on the visible edge of the ship. we could make out the image of one \"being\" in the window. then we realized that another being moved over to the right of the first figure. we were looking at a spaceship and aliens and we knew it. i ran to the house and stood in the doodway yelling for my uncle and grandfather to come outside and see that there was a spaceship over the house. they were watching johnny carson and told me it was a weather baloon. i ran back to the yard passing my cousin who was now going to the house to yell for them.   they never came outside.   \r\nat this point the craft moved over a field to a small air field across the street about a mile away. it hovered over the rotating airport light and got very, very bright. it then passed back over head. i got excited thinking it was coming back for us but, it passed and started following a fright trains main engine. the engine ran it's horn, \"i know there's an engineer out there somewhere who should be able to remember this\" the craft lit up again very bright as it followed the engine for a half mile or so before it slowly lifted away. the last thing it did was quickly move to the south, then up, and in a huge z patern, shot away so quickly i could make out the z shape for a split second. my brother can barely remember the event. my sister and i have the same memory but, we are the oldest. writting this account has made me want to get us all together and get hypnotized just to find out what (if anything) happend to us.

park.  we left our subdivision and headed north on 88th ave towards 191st. i looked to my right and saw several, very bright, white lights in the sky. my husband noticed them as well. we continued driving down 191st towards harlem and watched the lights the entire time. we couldn't figure out what we were looking at. when we turned onto harlem, heading north, our view became obstructed.  it was about that time i noticed two planes (i think they were planes...Could only see their lights) and it appeared to me they were flying low and very fast towards the lights. we had no clue what was going on but will never forget it.\r\n\r\nthe next night (2/19/2011) around the same time (6:15pm) my husband left the house to go to jewel to pick up things he needed for his nascar party the next day.  he called me from his truck to tell me he saw the lights again. instead of going to the store, he turned around and picked me up. i grabbed the camcorder and we headed down 191st again.  we drove down 191st and just past harlem ave, we pulled over.  i got out of the truck and start recording.  i have video footage of these lights. this time though, they were not white.  they were orange.  they appeared to be changing colors and were in a triangular formation. as i continued recording, the lights (all at the same time) suddenly blew up (i don't think they really blew up...I just don't have the words to describe what i recorded). the lights were gone for maybe a second or two and then reappeared.  they continued to do this (suddenly bursting and then reappearing again).  truly the oddest thing we've ever seen and i am hoping someone will be interested in my video.  it would be great if someone could explain what we saw because i sure can't.\r\n\r\ni can't email the video. i tried to

sky it caught my attention because it flashed a few times and kept changing in brightness then it started to move to my right and i watched it go up into the clouds  when i first noticed it i was stunned because the first thing i thought was oh my god thats a freakin ufo just based on its shape and the way it moved through the sky there was no stream like you would see from a jet and it manuevered to quickly to be a small plane. it began diving in and out of the clouds in a clockwise circular motion down towards the treeline. the storm cluds were gathering so i beleive that puts the object at around 2000 feet when i first saw it and i would have to guess its distance from my point of view was around five to ten miles away i was whitish silver and spherical or maybe circular it was hard to tell from that distance i watched it form a few minutes and i was mesmerised by it because i couldnt beleive what i was seeing in my own backyard figuratively speaking. i remember thinking that i had to document this or noone will beleive me so i ran inside to grab my camera its a sony cybershot with a 10 megapixel resolution but only a four times zoom when i came back outside the object had moved into the clouds and i lost sight of it i then regained sight of the object a few moments later and noticed it heading off to the northwest i tried my best to capture it on film but theres only so much you can do with a four times zoom i did get a video a little over a minute long and i must have watched it twenty times now and i cant pinpoint exactly where it is in the video.  the second time i lost sight of it moved off in a straight line into the clouds far out on the horizon if anyone wishes to view the video for themselves i have it on my computer and i made copies on discs however i think you are going to need some sort of video enhancing software to really dig through it and get some good hard evidence from it i apologize for the crappy quality and wish i could have got it sooner but i was pretty much dumbstruck by this thing. i also wanted to add that i was a physics major for a little over a year before i left college and this thing just behaved in a way that i found made me question wether or not i was actually seeing what i thought i was seeing it was just wierd... i alsoi called some of the small local airports in the area that night and left messages asking if there were any planes in the area saying that i saw something strange and as of today february 20 2011 i have gotten no

guy named irving and we went to the website and it turns out that once he was on a ship and another alien pushed him off the ship accidentally .And he landed in syria and irving bought him there and sold him to the dentists office and he made up a lie that if you have ever had mint gum then your tung is too big. x-avier278 told everyone that lie and he made up this thing called a y-ray wich is an x-ray for your mouth and a kid came in to the office and the dentist put a cream that made you have a rash around your mouth and then when the dental hygienist came in and every time she tried to do a y-ray he couldn't open his mouth because of the cream and then when the dental hygienist went to call the dentist the dentist put water on the kids mouth so to wash of the cream but then xavier278 was purpesly making the y-ray not fit in the kids mouth so the kid had to com back next time. when the kid was leaving he saw a line on floor so he followed it and it led him to the cream that the dentist put on his mouth. so he disabled it and broke it and the the dentist had to clean it up and threw it into the garbage.When the dentist was finished cleaning up the cream he went to one of the rooms and saw one of his robot friends from the ship his name was x-avier279 and he said that another robot pushed him off the ship by accedint and then he said the exact same story that the dentist said so

a point was directly under it,  it was not two separate parts it was plasma looking lights that were on a circular vehicle.  the object was moving toward the san gabriel mountains. as i proceeded toward downtown los angeles it was then on the right side of my car.  it had two separate panels of light, box in formation.  these lights lit randomly almost like something was broke or malfunctioning on the machine. the top had a pulsating red light but it didnt strobe like on an airplane it would stay on for a while then turn off.  im not sure how to say it but all of the outside of the vehicle was circulating left to right around the craft in a circle.  like the outside circle was connected but separated from the main body.  like the picture on this sight but a flat bottom and the whole thing was the same size equal in demention.  as i continued driving there was a police car that was ahead of me that pulled over one of the the officers got out and started watching it.  at this point the thing was maybe 3miles away and from what i saw the lights went out completely.  we just got done with an unusual sever storm 2-3hrs before the incident.  i was on the phone with my mother in madison wisconsin during the whole thing describing everything to her. it lasted probably 2-3mins if that.  while it was moving it was kind of a swooping motion it did pause at points but it moved very continuously forward no rapid changes of direction yet it was moving very fast.  i came home and drew a picture of what i saw.  went over the events with my mother again and my boyfriend. i was shaky and anxious.  i don't have any pictures but i have the drawing that i drew when i got

283 towards coleman, tx at night.  with my cruise control set, the radio tuned and near perfect driving conditions i was set for the long haul south to san antonio.  driving down the dark, desolate highway with hardly any traffic i remained focused on the highway searching for the one line backer deer to confront my three quarter ton truck.  in the course of driving i looked over to see a green sign telling me i had ten miles to coleman and my wife telling me to look over at the full moon that was on its way up like a homesick angel.  i gazed at the moon for several seconds and observed several airliners passing by along with a low flying airplane with distinguishable nav lights and anti-collision lights.  we continued driving when my wife said look at the satellite moving across the sky towards the moon.  with a clear sky i was able to locate the moving object and watched it travel from the south to the east and disappear as most satellites do.  i continued my drive down the highway when my wife pointed towards the moon and said look.  i looked and observed an orange light directly below the rising moon which appeared stationary for several seconds and then disappeared.  my first thought was dyess air force base was in nearby abilene and that the b-1b bombers were out playing and lighting the afterburners.  i continued to search for the orange light for several minutes with no sight.  finally we arrived in coleman, tx.  i located a pizza hut off the highway and pulled in for some gratification. as i exited my truck i looked towards the moon and saw the same color object, but smaller in size with no movement or noise.  usually if a bomber with a lit afterburner was near we would hear the rumble.  i told my wife, but she missed that sighting.  we walked in grabbed a few pizzas and sat down at a booth facing towards the direction of the moon so we could try to see anymore lights.  it was almost humorous to be eating pizza and the both of us focused on the outside.  eventually we look out the window and pointed at the mysterious light and about the same time an airplane flies near it, which then made me realize what we saw was not at all an airplane. the light in no way resembled an airplane.  the light remained on and eventually disappeared.  minutes later the same colored light comes on in which we both pointed to it in  excitement and then two more lights appeared spaced apart.  as before they remained on for several seconds and disappeared.  my wife and i thought what the hell.  the waitress comes by to fill our cups when i asked her if there have been people in the local area reporting lights or seeing strange objects.  the young girl said there have been reports online and in the coleman paper about people spotting mysterious lights.  even a&e did a report about ufo sightings in stephenville, tx.  we explained to her what we saw when she became excited and said, \"really?!\"  she started to look out the window and became excited as we were.  i told her now that the out of towners told a third person the mysterious lights will not light up the sky to only show us as being crazy.  i will tell you this, i have never seen anything like that before and my wife and i will say, what we saw that night was not an airplane, but most definately an unidentified flying object.  i truly believe we were visited by the outside.  take care and hopefully this helps.","distance":"Over One

the moon and stars weren't visible.  as i was driving along the two lane highway, off to the west i could see something glowing over a hill, much like a combine looks when it's harvesting at night in the fall, or even like the sun might look as it's coming up over the horizon in the east.  just a glow.  i drove for a mile or two, keeping an eye on the glow, wondering just what it was coming from.  i cleared a hill on the highway and could see around the hill, and as soon as i looked to see what was causing the glow, something shot from the ground to the sky, almost like a falling star would look, except going up instead of down.  it was so fast i didn't have time to make out a shape or any details, except that it seemed to have a greenish glow to the trail it left, which dissipated within seconds.  the whole thing, from time i saw the glow, til it disappeared into the sky, was maybe a minute, tops.  the flash of it disappearing into the sky was very quick.  i was searched the sky to try and see what it was, but couldn't see anything.  the glow had disappeared from over the horizon.  i was quite shaken by what i saw.  i've driven country roads by myself at night and in the dark ever since i was a teenager and nothing's ever made my skin crawl like seeing this did.  i didn't file any reports (what would i say?) and the only people i told were my brother and a friend who is also interested in ufos and unexplained events.  i still drive by that place in the field every morning when i go to work, but haven't seen anything since that day.  i do get an eerie feeling though, just remembering what i saw.

the right lane approaching the sangamon avenue stop light, yet still far enough away from the intersection coasting down from the railroad overpass.  i looked east and above the tree line was this motionless metal craft...I made my sister look and said i think that's a ufo but she didn't stop the car or pull it off into either one of two close restaurants on that side of n dirksen pkwy, being sonic and mcdonalds, she was approaching a stop light and i knew that the group of trees by the stop were closer to us and would block the view. even though it's winter and they're bare i still lost sight. so we were trying to think how far away it was.  it was farther east than the tree line, the tree line would be about 300+ feet from the road.  if i were to equate size and distance with my hand holding my arm out, it was the the width of my thumb. it's possible that would put it by highway 55. when the stop light changed, driving north past the trees, it was gone. i saw it for probably less than 30 seconds, it had a highly refective, smooth, slightly angled surface towards the front top (front i'd say facing north). back side wasn't as highlighted from the sun, bottom was shaded.  shape didn't appear disc, or oval because it had angles, bottom wasn't flat at the back it angled a distinct type of fin or area that dropped, bottom was more flat to the front, made the craft look uneven, unbalanced in it's form, but was hanging straight in the sky.  i felt i was looking at it from a side view but could see some of the bottom.  there are also two radio towers that stand among the tree line, it was far enough south of the towers that it couldn't be something attached to the top of the towers.  it was too big for a kite or baloon. i am a bad witness, because i didn't think of my cell phone to visually record it i'm sorry to say.  i'm hoping someone else did.  this probably has nothing to be associated...But within 5 mins we pulled into cullivers parking lot(east from dirksen further north of sangamon) we saw a hellicopter west from dirksen in the sky going north. flying above the buildings.  by the time we are on dirksen again 3 to 4 hours later southbound in the same area, i notice again, west of dirksen the helecopter has reversed direction, heading south...I remarked that the helecopter was a little late on the sceen(& too far north) from our sighting, but it was too weid to see it again around 5:30 heading back.\r\n","distance":"101-500
