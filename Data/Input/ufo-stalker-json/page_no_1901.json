street, which is normally full of kids and parents at that time but no one was visible anywhere (not that it has any bearing).  as i began driving up my street which is a slight incline i noticed this odd light in the sky to my left above the tree line (glowing oragne/yellow color light) not really moving - airpline traffic can get busy in this area.  initially i just thought it was some sort of manned aircraft but given its odd glowing color, no sound as it was maybe 500' in the air and given it was not moving i got out of my car to take a picture of it with my phone camera which is not very good.  i observed the object begin to move north to northwest of my position and i then telephoned a buddy to tell him what i was seeing.  after maybe 60 seconds a 2nd object appeared from behind the tree line; same color, etc...Everything was the same and it moved above the treeline at about 5:00 relative to the other object and they moved in unison maintaining the same distance.  maybe 15 seconds later a third one appeard moving slowly in the same direction - i was then starting to get an adrenaline rush talking to my buddy and then suddenly maybe 10 seconds later the fourth one appeared.  it too was positioned at 5:00 relative to the third one.  they all moved in unison very slowly towards the north to northwest.  the whole event lasted just less than four minutes as they moved further away from my postion disappearing in the clouds.  all the objects were glowing; there were no flashing lights light on an airplane or helicopter.  i just can't say how big they were.  i'm looking to see if anyone else saw this; no other cars drove by nor did anyone walk by my postion.  i was really hoping someone would drive up - i parked my car in the middle of street with my emergency flashers on because i really wanted someone else to see what i was looking at but to no avail.  i may walk the area this evening to see if anyone else walking in the area may have seen it.

time of encounter to be that of approx 1 hour but i would estimate that it was actually longer in retrospect. i was sitting in a fixed position behind a downed tree on the north side of 2 large fields and had a clear view or both, as well a corn silo and farm equipment directly across from me on top of a hill which was approx 500 yards from my location. at approx 4:00 pm i noticed a large thin object approaching the corn silo on the hill. it appeared at that point to be the size of a half dollar at arms length when held horizontally. at that time to me it appeared to be a large military plane heading north towards my location and my view was that of looking at an airplane heading towards me. i resumed my hunting looking for any deer in the area, then with some elapsed time i looked back towards the object,and it was still there and at that point made me somewhat curious because it did not appear to have not progressed towards my location at all. it was one of those moments that you just say hmmmm and i continued my hunting. i scanned the fields and noticed a farmer combining his field on the adjacent property approximately 600 to 700 yards away. i then looked back towards the silo and noticed the craft had advanced a little closer though and appeared to me to be now above the silo and larger then a silver dollar at arms length. i became more interested as being use to seeing aircraft fly by out towards kansas where roscrans air guard is located, i surmised that this was unusual because of the amount of time that had passed and the lack of ground it had covered. it had been approx 15 to 20 minutes at this point and any other aircraft would have flown past sometime ago. the object had my attention now but being the hunter that i am, i did another scan of the fields. when i returned my view to the location of the silo, the object no appeared to sitting in a 45 degree angle over the silo, the object now had my full attention and i did not look away from it again. it remained in this position for for about 15 to 20 minutes, it then slowly righted itself and appeared to go back to its original course and position in the air. i noticed now that it slowly moved away from the silo in a northwesterly direction at the speed of a very very slow moving helicopter. this entire time the object appeared to be as twice the size of a silver dollar held horizontally at arms length. withing approx 8 mins it had worked its way to the top tree line on the southern part of the field i was sitting which was no further then 160 yards, it still appeared as a thick line with no protrusions of any kind on it, as thick as pack of cigarettes held at arms length and very long maybe 100 yards long. it made no noise what so ever no movement of the trees, i took my eyes off it for a second to look over to see if the man on the combine was looking at it but he appeared to be oblivious to it or maybe unable to see it from his location. it continued to move ever so slowly across the tree line and seemed to me to cover approximately 10 to 12 full grown large oak trees at the tops. the object worked its way slowly until it passed right in front of me above the tree line, i still had no idea what it was until it reach my 1 o'clock position still less the 160 yards from me and right above the tree tops, it was gigantic. when it hit my 1 o'clock it rolled up with its belly turning flush towards the north, the only way to describe it was like it was riding up a wave and then going down the wave or like a piece of paper turning up and floating down changing its course to the south. i had an unobstructed up close view of the bottom of this object. it was a perfect long triangle like that of a slice of pizza, dull grey metal not shiny at all. on the bottom it was covered in evenly spaced symmetrical dull white globe lights that appeared to me to look like dull white halves of a globe but much much larger. i could not get an exact count of the lights because because i was in awe at what i was looking at so to speak. i would say around 9 lights that filled the whole bottom of the craft in uniformity. after turning its belly up to the north floated ever so slowly to the south and then west following the tops of the trees until it moved away from and appeared to move back behind the trees some ways off. i have never in my life seen anything like this before and have not seen anything like this since. i have since moved from missouri, but the owners of the property have told me they too have seen this craft a cpile different times during the night flying over the fields and at one time shinning a light like a beam onto the field. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

it seemed rather large and too bright as well as being seemingly close for a star. after viewing for approx. 5 min i finally seen some planes  in the distance to relate to this object, they were clearly airplanes  higher than the object further south with blinking red lights and they were moving unlike the object that was stationary in comparison.I went to my computer to see if i could find any news of this sighting 5 min later clouds had rolled in sky became daylight and nothing else to report other than my sighting was in the southeastern view from my vantage point,prior to looking out and viewing this object i had awaken and was watching television,i did'nt see movement or description other than bright light,i felt as if i was seeing something highly unusual and i could'nt help but

plane in the distance other than it was cloudy and it was flying very low the closer it got the more i realized it was not a plane or a helicopter and as it approached to fly directly over my house i saw two blue lights shot from both sides of the craft in opposite directions and disappeared then after i saw that and it was directly about my head i saw the shape in perfect detail that it was a dark or black color and was in a perfect sphere shape and the craft had an amber colored light (just one singular light and was not blinking it was a continuous light) the flight path from beginning of sighting to that last know direction was due south the changed coarse to south southeast then changed coarse back to directly south after its last coarse change to south it shot out of sight with extreme acceleration and speed. the feelings i had during the sighting was at first didn't think much of it then as i could make out that it was a normal plane or helicopter i started to feel excited at first then felt a feeling of fear because it was right above my house moving at a very slow rate of speed the whole time was watching it the feelings after the event i feel very confused and don't

before the rates get too high. just as we were winding up the conversation, i hear a pop to my left about 100 feet away. i thought someone had shot off a firecracker. as i looked, i saw something float up from behind some trees up the side of the building. it shimmered and my initial impression was that it was a dud firecracker. i'm continuing my conversation on the phone and this thing floats towards me over the roof of the building diagonally across the parking lot from me. i'm thinking \"how strange\" because there is no wind and it shimmers. i'm still on the phone but not really listening to the mortgage guy. as it gets over me, it looks just like a jelly fish with red blinking lights and a shimmering silver outline. it is tumbling end over end and the lights are on the inside of this thing. i think if it had been daylight with no lights i would not have seen it because it was so fragile looking. i don't know how big it was or how high because i am a poor judge of distance when it comes to looking up in the sky. i think it must have been relatively small and low but i'm not sure if that was just an optical illusion because after it floated over the roof i thought it was a clear plastic bag????  i don't know exactly what to call the thing except that it looked like a flying jelly fish or amoeba. i ball parked the experience as lasting maybe 10 minutes, i don't even think it was that long. this thing moved like it was rolling along the bottom of a creek, it followed a straight line, like you see some jellyfish do on the ocean floor when they are caught in a current and flip end over end. it flew over the cedar tree at the corner of my building then out towards the dam and river where it disappeared from my view. i didn't follow behind the buildings to see it since it is dark back there and it would have been out of sight by the time i got to the open bluff behind my condo to see it. it was going in a northeasterly direction. i wasn't frightened just kind of, \"i really don't want to be seeing this\". it was not nearly as dramatic as the incident we had out here on 09/26/2009, which i also reported to mufon, but i did get a good

matches i glanced up to the sky and was dumbfounded by three circular objects flying in a \"v\" formation moving to the ne.  the objects had the afternoon sun reflection so they appeared to be white.  i watched them curiously as they were travelling at a high rate of speed. they continued passing through the sky and suddenly one object moved directly north with the other two remaining in formation.  the objects soon became out of sight and i continued watching the match.  i was questioned by one of my friends as to what i was looking at and i told him.  he was unable to focus on them as the objects left my sight.  my only thought was that it was an odd occurance.  i immediately thought of the many things it could have been including baloons being caught in the wind however the tight formation couldnt explain that nor could the movement of one of the objects moving directly and abrubtly north keeping the high rate of speed.  i continued watching the match, glancing occassionaly upward.  approximately 30 seconds to a minute later one object perfectly matching the previous description travelled in the complete opposite direction at the same high rate of speed.  my theory of the wind carrying a baloon was immediately shot.  i attempted to point out the object to my friends but the speed was so great they had no idea what to look for.  that was it.  \r\n\r\ni realize there could be many explanations to this but to me it met the definition of unidentified flying object simply because i have no idea what it was. aircraft were flying in the sky the entire day but nothing

baldwin and bauer) with a passenger witness we observed from my vehicle, which i was driving, lights moving in a circular fashion.  the lights were slightly to the north and west of our location.  i would estimate them to be 3-500 feet in teh air.  the lights appeared to move in a manner similar to a multi light spotlight used to draw attention to a community event; as if the spotlights were on the underside of clouds.  however the evening was not cloudy.  at first i thought the lights were indeed a spotlight.  \r\n\r\nthe lights at first moved in a manner as if around the circumfrence of an oval or circle.  the lights then began to criss-cross within the circle.  the lights then then turned multicolored (i can not exactly recall teh colors, but my memory indicates they were blue, red/orange and green.  then 4-beams of light were pointed towards the ground as if to create a 4-sided upside down pyramid.  the lights then moved very rapidly around the circumfrance of the oval/circle again.  this shape lasted no more than 5 seconds.  the pyramid them inverted and stretched very high into the sky such that it appeared to be only one beam of light.  at this point i disticntly remember saying \"the colors of the rainbow\".  my passenger and i were then holding hands, my right and his left.  at some point during the process i commented with excitment to him.\r\n\r\nthe light apex of the pyramid stretched very high such that it now appeared to be only a single beam of light and appeared only as white light.  the light beam flashed and bent about 2/3 of the way up the light beam.  the bend in the light appeared to be about a 60-degree angle and moved to the north west sky and it was gone.\r\n\r\nthe event was sureal.  i travel to a party that was wrapping up near the college campus of grand valley state and my passenger and i told several persons.  i was so shocked i called the ottawa county sheriff.  the desk sargent laughed at me so i hung up.\r\n\r\ni have tried to estimate the height of the light beam and also the distance the actual pyramid was from out car.  i had difficulty with it at the time, but best estimate was that it originated about .25-.5 miles from our road of travel.  as for the total height of the light beam - it could have been several miles, i just could not tell.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

with my foot and looked to see what direction it was going i then ran in the house to get the camcorder. i went to the same spot that i made. it took a little bit to find but when i did and zoomed in it was clear that it was a black wing-boomerang shaped object. i watched it as it went in differnt directions and switched the camcorder in differant modes negative art ect. it also looks to have a glow around it.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

ambulance cleaned up. i stepped away to have a cigarette, and wandered away from where the ambulance was. i was smoking and looking up at the stars. the san leandro hills are the background with the sun getting ready to rise, the sky was begining to change colors. i though i noticed a star moving, i looked at another bright star in the general area and confirmed that it was in deed moving. it was moving at a slow pace i thought it was a satellite, then it changed direction from south to east which was odd. we finished up and were leaving the area, i took one last glance at it and it looked as if the object was descending behind the hills. there were two airplanes in the sky at the time both were headed southward behind where the object was located.

(i'm estimating) i'm going to keep up the same vigil tonight an again hopefully bring more light on the subject matter but its been the same routine except different part of the valley. jim, i do have video this time!
