been faster than any aircraft i would know. the only aircrafts which im concerned of , would be some like the black bird. but the black bird is black , and i would have heard it. \r\ni have one frame

back outside to collect our bikes to ride home.\r\n\r\nbefore heading off we were talking about plans for the weekend. while talking i noticed the moon in front of me. i was looking up at a 65 degree angle and marvelling at how bright it was. hold a tennis ball at arms length to get an idea the size it looked to me.\r\n\r\nit was around 20 minutes later when i told my friend to turn around and look at the moon. i said ���i can't believe how bright the moon is tonight; check it out\" he just kept looking at me with a smirk. i told him again and his reaction never changed. so i asked him ���what's the matter, why won't you take a look���. he laughed and said \"the moon is behind you, idiot\".\r\n\r\ni slowly turned around and there it was the moon. to say i was in shock is an understatement. even before i turned around to fiercely gaze at what i thought was the moon, a rush of thoughts when through me, like what the hell is that thing if not the moon?\r\n\r\ni turned around and yelled to my mate\" turn around now and have a look at this thing behind you. he thought i was playing games or something because he refused to take a look behind. i was absolutely frantic telling this guy to turn around and look at this thing. \r\n\r\ni closed the gap between us and grabbed his shoulder to force him to take a look. and just like good old murphy���s law the object blinked out just as he was turning to look.\r\n\r\nthe object blinked out but it didn't just disappear. it was still there blended almost entirely with the darkness. the sky was black, no clouds and full of stars. this object which i now know was an orb was exactly where it was before the light blinked out. after staring at it for 15 seconds the orb began to move laterally across the sky. heading north at about 15 knots before i eventually lost sight of it.  because i am partially deaf i rely more on my eyes and naturally see more details because of my deafness. if i didn't look so hard for it after blinking out i would have simply thought it had just disappeared.\r\n\r\nsome facts-\r\n1. i would say the orb was about 100ft from my position looking up at a 65 degree angle. \r\n2. the orb's colour when lit up was the purest white i have ever seen.\r\n3. the orb appeared to be a very dark grey when the light blinked out. \r\n4. the only way to describe its appearance at this time, it looked like a rock in the sky. it didn't look as though it was floating but more of a fixture. and it moved at such a perfect lateral angle that one would think it was on a railway track\r\n5. there was definitely no sound coming from its area of position - stationary or when moving.\r\n\r\ni told my friend that i just witnessed a ufo and he laughed at me. to my satisfaction dozens of people reported seeing a ufo that morning. this made it in the local newspaper, but only a small article.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen i realized the object was not the moon, my first thought was it had to be a ufo. i know it wasn't a plane, helicopter, blimp, meteor, venus, swamp gas, weather phenomena or mass hallucination. this was something so out of the ordinary for me that the only way to describe the feeling would be to see k9 walk up on stage and start singing elvis presley songs. it really blew me away and opened my mind to the possibilities of reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27852,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-28.0011707,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-02162011-0007","longitude":153.4283167,"occurred":907668000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Queensland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1297885407000,"summary":"Chatting

my house at the time and took a deailed description of the event. the only detail i cannot fully recall is the exact time of summer during which this occurred. i never heard back from mufon as to what might have been done in terms of an investigation, nor any findings that may have been uncovered.\r\n\r\nas i sit here nearly twenty years after the fact, this event took place on a cool summer night, about 1:30 in the morning, returning from a visit with a cousin and her family's home. i had taken no alcohol, drugs, prescribed, illegal, or over-the-counter.\r\n\r\ni was nearly home, out in the countryside amongst the dairy farms and a small cluster of homes, on the approach to the road on which my house lay. the road was a mildly steep, longish right-hand curving road, leveling out at the bottom. i was traveling in a southerly direction on sr 54/horner church rd. at the bottom of the hill, on the right was the turn-off to my road, mcvicker rd. the intersection of the two roads lay at the bottom of this long arcing road, with an old county home standing back about 150 feet from the sr 54, with a long row of older pines fronting the property. where the trees stopped, the long, steep, unpaved road(mcvicker) began on the right. on the opposite side of the country home was another smaller home fronted by a few trees and tallish brush, about 75-85 ft from the road side. \r\n\r\non the left, just past mcvicker stood a working milking parlor. directly opposite it, on the far side of mcvicker, about one hundred feet up that road, stood another home. as the entrance to mcvicker came upon one with little visibility, it was necessary to decelerate to a near stop in order to make a safe turn onto the deeply rutted road was mcvicker. it was at the point of deceleration when i first became aware of this light. it did not belong there and seemed to be hovering directly over the last-mentioned home. at its dimmest, it was bright, white, and pulsed, or throbbed to a much brighter intensity. as it pulsed, its size appeared to grow. i stopped my car, looking from house to house to try and notice any activity from any of the other homes. not seeing anyone, i rolled down the window completely, trying to hear any prop or engine noise. failing that, i put the car in park, timidly exiting the vehicle, still looking around for others who might be witnessing the same activity. i still heard no noise; mechanical, engine, animal or insect. at this point the light began to slowly move in straight line paths,stop and hover briefly, never ceasing to pulsate. its general direction was toward the barn, then beyond it, up and over the hillside and treeline at the top. yet it did not move in a seemingly natural manner. instead of moving in a direct pathway, it would slowly move in straight line paths, come to a complete stop, hover a bit,abruptly alter its direction, but continue roughly toward the east, southeast; never ceasing the pulsating light. i stood, transfixed during the entire duration of maybe twenty minutes until it was out of view.\r\n\r\nquite suddenly it dawned on me that i was standing there, alone and unprotected. so, i dashed the yards back to my vehicle, rolled up the windows, locked the doors, and made the right up mcvicker, traveling at a much too quick pace for the rutted road condition. my house was at the first flat of he hill, on the right, with the only neighbors over three hundred feet away, not visible through the trees separating us. i quickly made the right into my drive, up the hundred or more feet, and opened my door to get out. as i had to retrieve a bag of groceries from the back seat, i needed to turn around. in so doing, there was the light(or a different light but looking and acting the same) directly across the road, hovering in the clearing that was at one time an old saw mill.\r\n\r\nat this point i became absolutely terrified, and quickly extracted my groceries, made certain my dog and cat came indoors and abruptly ran around the house closing doors and windows, pulling down blinds, tacking up sheets-doing whatever i could to make it as closed to visibility from the outside as i was able. i turned out all lights and went upstairs, gathering my animals with me, heading for the windowless walk-in closet upstairs. there were several windows placed where i could do nothing to cover them. i had a distinct impression that i, once the observer, was now the observed,and that unsettled me to the point of writing a leer about what had happened and placing it somewhere safe, yet out of view. \r\n\r\nafter what seemed hours(yet was less than thirty minutes), i went out to the bed to grab a pillow and blanket, and saw the light traveling in the same manner, up beyond the next tree line, near the top of the hill bordering the mennonite farmhouse beyond. the light was now moving toward the east, and it was far enough away that i felt safe enough to watch as it moved over the hillside, out of view. i did, however spend the rest of the night in the closet, doing my best to sleep.\r\n\r\nseveral days later, i contacted a cousin of mine in the eastern part of the state who put me in touch with mufon. i don't recall the name of the gentleman who came to take the report, but do recall he was new and i believe was making his very first field report. i never heard back from them, yet it has since been on my mind\r\n\r\n ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

were house sitting for my boyfriend's sister. her home is isolated and sits atop a mountain outside northumberland, pa. it is surrounded by trees which frame an outstandingly clear view of the sky. we were inside the house, chatting and finishing dinner (about 9 or 10 0'clock) when we heard a very strange sound, a low roar that lasted no more than a few seconds, but was quickly followed by what we thought was an earthquake. the house is huge by anyone's standards, 3 floors, 5 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, and built solid. it would take quite a natural force to shake the whole thing. the vibration was enough to rattle items on shelves, but it lasted only a second or two. we were startled because the weather was beautiful, no clouds or rain or wind. it was a perfect summer night. we didn't know what to make of it, so we went about our business, clearing dishes and then stepping out onto the upstairs patio to enjoy the night. we hadn't been outside for long when i noticed a strange \"star\" in the sky. i thought i had seen it move, so i watched it. it began turning different colors - red, green, white, blue- so i quickly pointed it out to the others. they picked it out of the sky right away and the four of us watched as it moved, ever so slightly, as if it were hovering in place. the lights came and went, and almost looked like they were rotating, as if the object they were attached to were spinning. we were all pretty convinced that this was not a star that we were looking at, when it started darting in short spurts. it would hover, then dart to the right, then up, then back to it's starting position. it didn't travel far in these spurts, but it was moving in ways that no plane could. we were utterly convinced that this was something none of us had seen before. we watched, in awe, for about half an hour - all of us staring at the sky, unable to explain what we were seeing, when all of a sudden, it disappeared. just like that. all the rest of the stars in the sky were visible, it wasn't a cloud. it just...Vanished. we all kind of gasped and cursed and got excited when it suddenly reappeared in a completely different region of the sky. we didn't witness it traveling to that spot - but we should have. it was inexplicable. it hovered and darted in that spot for about a minute when all of a sudden it flashed a bright light and began coming toward us! i know this sounds unreal, and maybe that's why i've kept our story between the four of us and a few close friends for 2 years, but i swear to you that this next experience has changed all of our lives forever. we cannot explain what we saw. we saw the bright light, and then we saw this giant, black mass coming right at us. i will never know how it traveled from a distance relative to stars to the rooftop so quickly. it was literally seconds. we all kind of screamed, watching the light get closer, but never taking our eyes off of it. it came so close that we thought it would begin to knock over treetops or crash into the house. the object we saw was enormous. it dwarfed the house and the property and was the blackest black, with no details visible except for a few orangish white lights on the bottom. it was shaped like a guitar pick and it seemed as if these dull lights were placed in the corners of the triangle. it was traveling fast and made no sound. it is impossible for something so gigantic to fly. it is even more impossible for it to do so silently. as it flew directly over the house, i ran inside, through the house and out a door on the opposite side to catch the rest of it's descent. i saw the mass, but it was so low that i lost it to the trees as soon as it passed. we were hysterical. my father and i were yelling, excited and scared at the same time, recounting what we has just seen. my boyfriend was quiet, stunned, not sure how to react. my brother solemnly whispered \"holy f*&#, that was the starship enterprise\", not trying to be funny, but in a reflective, shocked manner. we all went over the sequence of events a hundred times that night, and probably hundreds since then. we assumed no one outside the house would take us seriously, so we kept it to ourselves. the family and close friends we did tell gave us pitying looks and offered up explanations like 'planes' and 'search lights.' that is not even close to what we saw. we are all level headed, educated people, and we were the first to try and debunk what we were seeing, but we could not. this experience has changed our lives, and i think that we are finally ready for real answers and real input. was the strange sound/shaking of the house related to what we saw? why did it come so close to us? where did it go? did it land? how could it have been so big? what was it?? it has taken me a year and a half to share my story, but i have thought about this every day. i live not even 2 miles from where this sighting took place, and have since witnessed other ufo activity which i would happily share with anyone who is interested or willing to offer answers, but what happened on that night is the most haunting experience of my life. i need to know what we saw. \r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

i saw some lights and thought someone had invaded my home i grabbed a bat and went to check it out. i saw a upright being in the back yard. it was standing it beckoned up to the sky and two more thuds followed. i walked out the back door and saw that the intruders had large gun like objects attached to what appeared to be there suit they had helmets that were round. i spoke they said nothing. then they grabbed me by the arms and the next thing i new i was flying threw the air and i landed on a ship the people tried to make contact with me. the one that was no doubt the leader made contact with me via prerecorded conversations and playing them and replaying them. it told me that they would let me go back to my house to pack my things if they did not find it harmful. i went back and got my laptop and a few other things. they stopped and looked at my laptop and said that it was not harmful. i am writing this from my laptop the only connection i have with the rest of the world as we know

was just out driving my friend home who lives down the street from my house. as i turned onto my street something caught my eye. i looked up and saw what looked like a frisbee in the air and i didn't really think anything of it. then i realized it was maybe a hundred or two hundred feet up and keeping a steady height. so instead of going home i followed it and saw that it was a red disc almost like one of those automated vacuum robots. it was completely silent, i rolled down my window to hear it and it was pretty close over my head. it was probably only a few feet in diameter and it was traveling horizontally, not vertically meaning it was not a balloon. it also didn't shake in the wind, it moved flawlessly but it wobbled as it flew, almost like when frisbee or disc is wabbling on the ground. what also caught my attention is that it was flying literally over the same streets and area as the only other ufo i've ever seen.\r\n\r\ni am completely baffled at this one because when i saw it i figured it had to be fake but i ruled out every possible option as i was following it. there didn't seem to be any features on it. it was close enough so that i could tell it had a smooth red surface. i'm going to search red wabbling disc videos and pictures that look like it so i can give you guys an idea of what i'm talking about.\r\n\r\ni lost it after about 45-60 seconds when i got to the bottom of the street because it was a dead end. i turned right to go to my friends house as i was calling him so it was behind me and when i stopped and got out to look for it i couldn't see it anymore but it would make sense because of it's size.\r\n\r\nyes i did think of taking pictures but no i didn't get any. that was actually the first thing i thought of and i was about to run home first to get my moms good camera but i didn't want to lose it so the only camera i had was my lg rumor camera which is absolutely terrible and is actually the same camera took the terrible pictures in thread i linked to. although the disc was close enough and big enough in the sky so that it would have captured it but my memory was full and my battery was about to die so it unfortunately wouldn't let me take pictures...\r\n\r\njust a side note, when i called my friend as this was happening, the phones kept cutting out and lost signal multiple times.\r\n\r\ni attached a picture of an irobot

approximately four minutes. at that point the object simply vanished from sight in an instant. almost like someone blew out a candle. being so close to the airport you learn the incoming and outgoing

all night i stayed up watching them, trying to understand them. the one that was closest to me (approx 1/2 mile) had the disc shaped craft as from what i could see was supervising the orb's to do its command? as i could see the craft darting all over the skyline an from what i could tell, communicating with the orb's. heres where it gets strange. i'm a witness to a historical event! as i stated, it got strange, i heard a voice in my head stating, \"do not be afraid!\" and i communicated a thought back to them,it,whatever! \"i'm not afraid!\" i will not harm you! just, please, do not go away! an i'm not sure if that communication was rec'd back? but i was so sure this \"voice\" was close to me, that after i had time to consider the mental implication's of what happened i actually started to think that the voice had to of been sent from behind me as i am backed up to the black mountain's i think the \"voice\" came from secret pass, which is behind my position an to my left.Yet it was inside my head! i am part abenaki indian an something inside of me tells me these are ancient being's? i also wish to add that the feeling of wanting to defend them if nessessary also went thru my mind? an last night at approx 9:21 pm i had the feeling i was looking directly at the \"leader's\" craft, as it was gold toned and of course the flashing light's were very apparant almost like how our military leader's where their medal's an ampulets on their attire was the distinct way this craft looked an acted. all biz! an as they were all over the sky's, so to was this craft! an it appear's as they begin their upward accent this is done slowly as if their \"collecting\" something. we mere human's only at best get to see the bottom of the craft's an automatically assume, ah, its just a star. a very clever camoflauge! an the extraordinary thing is these craft never ever made a sound! until i thought to get out my native flute an strike a few cords to see if i could get any possible flashing directed back to me, but uh nope, sure didnt, i got a weird sound directed back to me, as if to say, \"this is what i listen too!\" from them. i truly hope my new found friend's are coming back tonite because i have slept lil since they burst onto my view! \r\n  my scottish blood that love's machine's, is so badly wanting to learn their engineering way's! also, i am not completely sure that the ufo's have to be near a military operation, a ancient site, and also some other parameter to be seen? i think these \"being's\" are capable of going anywhere! but the fact is kingman used to be a army base for testing stuff, missle's etc. an for the fact that behind my position here at the shack there is in the black mountain's, an old indian burial cite. are they gathering some \"energy\" from the ground? are they getting energy's from where the missile testing was done? is there something they collect from the power station's? also, i noticed two (every night) thus far, of the disc shaped craft's sit in the sky an simply hover between the opening of the valley on the kingman side an are possible sentinel's? while the \"other's do their \"mining\"? an thats the rationale i gave it from being able to view the operation. an at first, from the beginning a part of me felt as though they were looking for something. from where they would hover, but then i changed my opinion in it after viewing the entire 5 night affair, that they are working, gathering something. whichever the case, this is definately extrordinary an am grateful to bear witness to it! i see that i'm out of space to type, an so much more!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Patterned Surface,  Insignia,  Appendage(s),  Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":27832,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.2233311,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02152011-0012","longitude":-114.2230108,"occurred":1297756800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone,   Circle,   Disc,   Egg,   Oval,   Sphere,   Square,   Rectagular,   Star-like,   Triangle,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1297802257000,"summary":"Seemed to be 3 different styles of ufo's an orb's up to 134","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Golden Valley, Arizona","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:71209"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Scottville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was looking in the north sky over mason county, and noticed a triangle formation that i thought was three airplanes, the front one was a solid white lite with a blinking red , and the back two were blinking a reddish orange light.  they were heading west and once they got above lake michigan the front one curved south, and the two in the back disappeared.  when the front object was going to the south it was just a star like appearance without the red blink.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27831,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.9547284,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02152011-0011","longitude":-86.2800787,"occurred":1297749600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1297801677000,"summary":"Triangle formation, two disappeared one turned south over lake michigan.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Scottville, Michigan","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:71210"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed, Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Golden Valley,Kingman,Yuc","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"An incredible event which started last thurs at 1am i noticed a trapazoidal shaped object over whats called castle rock, estimate is 50 ft at its widest point hovering above the mtn top, flashing white,red,blue,yellow,green lights.I watched closely thru my spotting scope from my front yard at the base of the black mtn foothills on the other side of the valley, slowly the craft started unfolding itself into an hourglassed shape outlined in blue an the what i would term the body a beautiful lavender color. the shape ended up looking like a pyramid top touching a pyramid top but flat.(i also have a witness to this event)seemed to swirl around the air an flutter over the mountaintop to what appeared to be the middle of the valley approx 3500ft in the air over the maverick store where it cont'd in its hourglass shape, after 20 minutes it went an reconstructed itself back into its trapazoidal shape craft an began its upward climb very slowly an from my vantage point i was able to focus in on it an as it went overhead i saw a white light an this was i considered a great camoflauge accent because you are not able to see the lavender an blue coloration of flashing lights as it appears to look like a everyday run o the mill star. day 2 - began with 2 flashing orbs located somewhat near kingman,az an again i watched them closely thru my spotter scope an as i watched them i at that time realized there was many more of these orb's in different areas so i strained my scope an sure enough started noticing many orb's!

just to take in the view of the stars when i saw an object that was flying directly over the house. it had 4 bright lights at the bottom of it which gave me a visual of the outline of this object. it was moving in an easterly to westerly direction and was not making a sound which was peculiar..Looking at this object which was probably about 2000-3000 ft.High i could tell it was not like anything i've ever seen fly over the house. if you was to take a half-a-dozen battleship carriers and put them side by side and twice that many in length then you would get a pretty good idea of the size and width of this thing..I did not have my camera on me at the time and was afraid to go inside the house and get it for fear that it would be gone by the time i got back outdoors. the night was crystal clear, not a cloud in the sky. it took prbably less than a minute and a half to disappear from sight..Alls i could do was shake my head and wonder if i was seeing things. i told my wife about it and described it to her and she said that she had seen something of a familiar shape back in the early 60's hovering over a graveyard that was behind their house. i posted what i saw on facebook and asked if anyone else in rome had seen it..Naturally the answer was no, and the people asked me was i sure i was smoking a cigg. and not something else.Hahaha..I know what i saw that evening. i live in a wooded area on the outskirts of rome in the woods. the direction it was going would have taken it almost over the city of rome..If anyone has seen something similar they can contact me at *(wit's

have about a 2 mile drive home. we live about 1/2 mile away from lake michigan, and 1/3rd mile away from a hospital, so we see airplanes and hellicopters all the time. i noticed a bright star out my car window.I thought my window was making a weird glare on the top part of the \"star\". i rolled the window down a bit to check and the arc of light was still there. at first i thought it might be the atmosphere making a halo on the star. i watched it get brighter and bigger. i started to think it was a plane getting closer,but then i realized the color wasn't right.Maybe a hellocopter. as it got closer i could see it blinking blue,green,white,and red(kinda orange}.By now it looked like two stars on top of each other with a multi-colored,fainter,wider,band of lights inbetween them.By now i didn't think this was a regular occurence.It was about a mile away and was travelling south about the same speed as a plane.I was thinking \"naw couldn't be.....But i see it \".At that moment i saw another object about 1/2 mile behind it.It looked the same as the first one but it was diferent shades of orange in color.It was heading east and then south behind the first object.I was really excited by now and kept telling my wife,\"i can't wait to get home to look at it better\". i was hoping we could still see it by then.\r\n       we pulled into the driveway and i lept out of the car to see.I hoped i wasn't just nutts.I wasn't. \r\n       i saw both objects slow down.The first traveled slowly s.E.About another mile.The orange one ascended about twice it's distace from the ground.They seemed to have stopped.I looked around and saw a total of 5 objects appered to be spread out from east to west in the sky.I had to do a reallity check.I really started to think i might be losing my marbles.These objects looked like doubble stacked stars but were brighter,with faint bands of colors inbetween.3 were like the first one ,and the other two were orangish.To anyone who was just glancing they wouldn't even notice. i wouldn't even believe it if i didn't see them flying so close.All of them seemed to be stationary....At first look.I could see small maneuvers side to side and up and down .I still couldn't beleive myself,\"i must be loosin it,there just stars,....But icould see them flying,...I thought they were planes,.Are they stars?,stars dont travel and change direction,..No,...I know i saw these things \".I was in awe at what i witnessed but i know if i ever tell anyone they will tottaly think i'm crazy.\r\n      i kept going ouside to verify to myself that it is real. the orange one stayed put.I could see the regular stars had moved.The first object  drifted to about 10 mi. s.E in 8 min(about 4 in.To my point of veiw).All others stayed put exept for small maneuvers.Stratus clouds were blowing in and i could see the first object was still visible below the clouds very clearly.\r\n      i probably would've never reported this but my curiosity got the best of me .I wondered if anyone else saw something too today.When i looked up your site i saw a report close to the day,same state,and it looked to be very simmaler in description.May be

at lake giles in orlando, fl.  i did try to video tape it but it wasn't that great of a video to post.  there is orlando international airport about 10 mins. south of me and i see planes and ect. all the time.  this light was much differnt as i sat out on the dock with my dog i always look up at the sky and that night just before christmas i saw a light in the sky slowly pulsating from white to red...It wasnt like any plane light i've seen many times.  it was exciting for me enough to take a video of it now im not saying it was from another planet but i do believe that its crazy to not leave that open.  when i was a kid around 1990 i live in illinios and went out to watch the northern lights and saw 3 ufos that i tried to get my parents to go out and see them too but they just sat in front of the tv laughing at me...Then a few years later when i was in high school i was with a bunch of friends one night and one of them started talking about the ufos she saw the night of the northern lights a few years back and i felt so much better that she saw the same thing i did and she was also very excited because she was made fun of and the 2 friends she was with when they told people.  now the ones i saw over 20 years ago were more convincing becauce they were closer to the ground in seemed and were triangle with a slow pulsating red light in the middle.  they also moved allot fast then stopped and turned more 90 degrees..Which i was only a kid back then but i knew better that that and how all other planes i saw fly.  again though it could be a secret government plane, but i dont rule out that its from \"somewere else\".  if anyone else saw that same \"ufo\" over orlando, fl it would be nice not to be

although i could make out a bizarre torch-like figure in the moonlight). the ufo caught my attention as i entered onto the i-80 freeway because the red light emanating off the object was too strong and steady to be normal. the light didn't flicker or change from its red, which usually happens with planes. so i kept my gaze as i drove (not a safe thing to do). had a feeling this craft wasn't normal so i pulled to the side of the freeway and began recording it through my opened window. now the coolest part, and maybe the most mysterious part of the video is, the ufo just disappears. this happens after you see it come next to the moon. now what i saw, and which the video does not show, is the ufo's red light slowly dimming or getting smaller as if it is turning it off or it rose in elevation fast enough to alter the size of the light to a significant degree. the object eventually disappeared. in the video, you can see that i got out my car to get a better angle of the object but nothing can be seen. i could see it with the naked eye still so that is why the video phone was still positioned at a particular place. the ufo was definitely not a typical craft nor was it a saucer
