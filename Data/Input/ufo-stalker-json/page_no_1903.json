(explained earlier in the encounter) thinking nothing of the noise, i went back inside with my laptop, charged it, put some popcorn in the microwave, and sat down to have a drink. our friends were drinking light beer, and we were drinking malt liquor, because we feel like it is a better deal than the 12 pack of beer, though the 12 pack of beer is a little more convenient in case you do not want to drink it all, because, you know, then you don't have to open the whole thing and have it go to waste if you can't finish it. but we were reasonably confident that we would be able to finish it, because it was just one bottle of malt liquor. just then, we heard some banging noises coming from the other room, and it was echoing throughout the house. my friend got really freaked out by it, but i knew that it was just the popcorn. (he's a really jumpy person.) so we get back into watching the movie, and i'm eating cookie cake because my birthday was a few days earlier and my mom sent me a cookie cake. which, i know you're thinking, \"hey, you're in college, why is your mom sending you a cookie cake?\" well it was a nice gesture on her part, and my friends and i enjoyed it over a beer. it was actually a decent cookie cake too, it was reasonably thick, and was fresh. it was easily the best cookie cake i had ever eaten. just then, about half an hour into the movie, there was a knock at the door, and the guy delivering the wings came and delivered the wings. while i was at the door, there were bright red lights coming from over the trees. they seemed to be in a distinctive pattern, but i was mainly focused on the wings, so i ignored them. and we went back to see the vanishing, and at the end of the movie, jeff bridges tells kiefer sutherland that he has to drink some drugged coffee to see what happened to his old girlfriend. he says, \"drink this,\" and at that point, every time he says that, we were supposed to drink. i won't ruin the ending of the movie for you, but our friend matt was reasonably drunk. he had opened a bunch of beers, and then went for his first bottle of malt liquor, which is weird because he's kind of described himself as a connoisseur of beer, wine, and spirits. but whatever. after the movie was over, people were passed out on the ground, and others were going to a bar. the whole place was a mess. i started to clean up, and i opened the blinds of the window, and i saw a chevron shaped object hovering over the soccer fields next to my friends apartment. then i came up with this plan where we would pretend that the vanishing had disappeared in the mail, so we could keep it, and not send it back to netflix. so we'll see how that plan works out. but it was definitely chevron shaped.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27819,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.8012249,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02142011-0015","longitude":-77.8558112,"occurred":1297745040000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1297751318000,"summary":"Chevron

aviation.  i���ve held a pilots license since 1973.  in addition, during my career i have had extensive experience working with nasa.\r\n \r\n06:15 sept 29,2010\r\n\r\ni saw a very bright light in the direction from which the sun would rise.  06:15 am on sept 29 is 45 mins before sunrise.  the predawn sky at that point was just starting to show the faintest hint of light.  \r\n \r\nmy first thought was that the iss was in line with the sun and i was seeing reflection from it.  however the light was traveling from northeast to southwest, opposite of the iss orbit.  \r\n\r\nthen as the object moved out of alignment with the sun���s angle, the light abruptly went out.  what the hell, i thought.  it didn���t make sense.  at that point the terminator between night and day was still in the atlanta area and if something was high enough to reflect the sun��� \r\n\r\na. the reflection would be constant, and \r\nb. the object would have to be at orbital altitudes.   i was puzzled.      the quick math did not add up.\r\n \r\nas my eyes followed the path that the light had taken, i saw it.  no if ands or buts.  i saw it and it was real.\r\n \r\nit was a huge and i mean huge.  \r\n \r\nagain, as i followed the path of the light, (after it went out) i saw a huge crescent shaped object flying very high.   it was metallic in color, and the edges were rounded.  it appeared to be much higher than the 767 i had just seen.  it was blocking out stars as it passed overhead.  the hint of light defined the front edge very plainly.  the rear edge appeared to be a crescent shape as well.  and lo and behold, a second one was flying right behind it.\r\n \r\nok, now determining altitude is often difficult.  what lead me to believe that this was higher, much higher than the airline was the ���softness��� of the image due to pre-dawn humidity which on a clear day indicates very high altitude.  i could see the distinct outline of the earlier 767 and the humidity softness wasn���t apparent at 30,000 or so feet. the object was definitely was not lower than the airliner.\r\n \r\neach object was approximately 15 to 20 degrees arc in width.  at 45000 feet, it would make it approximately the width of an aircraft carrier or greater. they had to be several hundred feet at the minimum and 1/8-1/4 mile wide at the most.  the speed appeared to be greater than 600-700mph.\r\nno noise, no sonic boom.\r\n \r\ni viewed the objects for a minute or so before they traveled out of sight.\r\none last thing, and i think it���s very important.   i always thought that if i were every lucky enough to see a ufo that i would be elated with joy because the question would be settled in my mind.\r\n \r\nas i watched these objects an extreme feeling of dread fell over me.  my thoughts were, ���this is not good.  this is bad, very bad.���   \r\n \r\nit was overpowering and for several days i wrestled with two things.  the first being that my understanding of the world changed drastically during that one minute or so.   the second was that ���this is definitely not good!���   as if something sinister was at work.   \r\n \r\nas an experienced pilot and engineer i know for a fact that i did not see a stealth, an aurora, a ���wave rider��� hypersonic aircraft, the supposed triangle lighter than air craft, or any super military advanced technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

to my sister who was in another part of the county also delivering. i approached a 4 way intersection that is in the middle of some large fields(farms).  i saw a light at the horizon that was too big to be a star and was smaller than the moon(3/4 or so tonight)and besides, the moon was behind me.  \r\n\r\ni told my sister that i thought, at first, that it was an aircraft and that it was going to

followed along side my car at roughly 200yards.  it was approximately 75 yards high and the light was making a sweeping motion back and forth (from the front of my vehicle to the rear).  \r\n\r\nat this point i was quite alarmed and drove into a snow bank as i couldnt bring myself to take my eyes off of it.  i managed to pull out of the snow bank and came to the end of the field.  at this point the object was slightly behind me.  i stopped the car and watched as the object rapidly headed off to the northwest and over the treeline. \r\n\r\ni was in the military for several years in air defense and i can say without a doubt that this was no aircraft i've ever seen.  as the object turned and the light quit shining on me, i could see that the object looked disc-shaped with a domed top and what i can only describe as fins on the back with red lights along them.  they were not visible as it approached me.  the fins were large and if you picture the craft on your logo above with 2 large, rounded fins on the right hand side(think tailfins on an old car), that is the view i had as it left.  \r\n\r\ni was quite frightened and my sister was panicked on the phone because the whole time the object was near me i was describing it and apparently i was quite loud.  she said after it was over she believed me because she could hear the panic and fear in my voice. it took a while to calm down and as soon as i was done with my route, i decided to report the incident to your websight.  as i write this, i feel anxious and still have that surreal feeling.  i figured if anyone was going to believe me, it would be you.

second story window of my house in bartlett, illinois. living here for 19 years, and knowing that o'hare airport is in that direction, i thought nothing of it. i thought they were probably just planes or helicopters. it was strange, as i had not seen anything like this before, though. that's what stuck out at me. these objects stayed in one relative spot. they moved, but not erratically. just slightly around each other. i noticed they would stay in patterns. either these objects would form a triangular configuration, or take a linear configuration. i thought this was something pretty strange if they were conventional aircraft. i also noticed that they don't blink. they glow, and slightly flicker. these objects would appear out of nowhere starting around 6 pm cst, and they would stay for hours, usually ending around 9 pm cst. i have never seen these objects during the day. on february 14, 2010, i decided to try to record them (for a second time), as they appeared at dusk instead of the usual night time, and it would be easier for my camera to capture them. after recording the video, i uploaded it to my computer. i took a screenshot of a scene in the video, put it into photoshop, and used the \"emboss\" effect to see exactly what shape these objects took. what i saw really surprised me. they were showing up as spheres. six of them, in a triangular pattern with three smaller ones in the middle. when my sightings first started, there were only 3 of these lights visible. as time has progressed, these sightings have become more and more frequent, with more objects. now almost nightly, i can see at least 5 of them, and usually no more than 8. as i have stated, these objects will stay for hours on end. i have watched these objects closely hoping to catch them doing some crazy ufo-like behavior, like zooming back up into space, but all they do is kind of \"fade out,\" and i lose sight of them. this does not happen every night, but close to it now. seeing these objects make me more confused than anything. if they are planes, how are they visible for so long? why don't the lights get bigger as they get closer, or smaller as they get farther? if they are helicopters, why do they glow instead of blink or flash? why do they show up in the exact same spot so frequently, and hover for so long? why don't i ever see them move anywhere, except around each other in a relative manner? i will attach the original screen shot taken from my video, the embossed version of the screen shot, and the video itself so you can decide. you can also check out the link at the end of this to see my discussion with other people, who have confirmed the lights are not a radio tower or something of the like. what they are remains a mystery to me.\r\n\r\n*(link moved to

irony of that, so here goes. i was dropping my dog off at the kennel a little after 3:00 pm. i had gotten out of my car and just happened to look up. the sky was mostly clear with a few patches of cirrus type clouds. the object was in a clear area of the sky but close enough to a bank of clouds to tell that it was at a lower altitude. the object looked like a bright white dash (just like this: - ) with slightly rounded ends. it was so bright it almost appeared to be glowing. from my perspective, it would have been a little less than 1/2 an inch long. there was no contrail, no sound, no wings, tail or markings. it was not moving quickly, so i watched, trying to figure out what it might be. after a minute or two, it simply faded out of sight. it did not move behind clouds, or leave my field of vision, it faded out. i instantly recalled an incident from the summer of 1978 when i saw exactly the same thing. i was laying in the grass staring up at the sky. oddly enough it would have been around 3:00 pm then as well. i saw a bright white cigar shaped object moving through a perfectly blue, cloudless sky. it would have been very close to the same size and shape and moving at roughly the same rate of speed. i watched it cross the sky until it went behind some hills and out of my field of vision. i had the same thoughts as a girl that i had this time, just trying to figure out what i was looking at, curious and a little bewildered. i assumed it was probably a plane. i am assuming there is a man-made answer this time as well. i have seen some pictures on this site that resemble what i saw. (sorry, no pics--i didn't have a camera at hand.) you guys are the experts, and i am sure that if it is something normal you have already seen it enough times to have figured that out. i would appreciate you letting me know. feel free to contact me via e-mail as i am harder to catch by phone. and my heartfelt thanks for the work you do!

child, this happened many times.  i believe that i have been abducted at least thre times, one time a needle was put inti my navel it was painful, another time one was put into my temple, and another time i don't rembember or don't want to remember what was done.  i remember when i was around 16 yrs of age, something must have been placed in my right ankle, and i remember that whenever i would brush against it electrical shock would go up my leg, i could feel it and i knew it was there but i did not know what it was. **(name deleted--cms/sg)  incident happened in the spring of 2010

the corner of my eye in the sky. that movment is what really brought the object into my attention and then veiw. what i saw is like nothing i have ever seen before. i have watched ufo videos of bouncing lights and disc's. this was not something out of a bad syfy movie or some grainy home made movie. this was real. \r\n\r\nit was flying low in the sky but moving fast. not like 1000's of mph fast but more like 200-300mph. it was also huge, it must have been 60-80 feet wide or more. as a visual que it went right between the treeline and my home. it did not glow, flash or even radiate light. how do i explain this???\r\n\r\nit seemed like 6-8 dim stars moving through the night sky(bigger/brighter in the center and then smaller or fading out towards the ends), in a shape like the stealth bommer(b-2). not the f117 but the big one. a very soft angled triangle shape. the starlike lights almost seemed to bend the light around the craft. the light was faint almost ghost like.  also when i was looking at the ???? whatever it was. the back half of the structure beyond the lights, it was like looking at a rippling water triangled shape in the sky. honestly this really almost looked like it was a stealth bommer cloaked, but it made almost no noise. just a light rumble if that.\r\n\r\ni have seen all the small jets, large comm airlines and milatary jets fly over and they make quite a bit of noise but this was not like those. even when they are flying high in the sky they make it known that they are flying over once they have pasted you.\r\n\r\ni don't know what it is but i do believe that it did not think it would be seen. \r\n\r\nthe object kept a striaght and level flight path. no bouncing or turning. it just kept moving steady in a north north west direction keeping parelle with the mountains and on the outside of the city. it just kept moving until it vanished from sight.\r\n\r\ni was shocked when i spotted this. at first i was like no way it's got to be my eyes. then i had to look harder and then i could see this thing in the sky. after it was gone. i went in side to tell my wife but she was asleep and did'nt want to get up to talk about this. she told me to draw it out and then turned over to fall asleep again. i am not artist but i tried. then i told my teenage daughter that i saw something. she thought i was joking but then she realized i wasn't when i told her to get off the computer so i could report this.\r\n\r\ni feel emotionally confuzed, amazed and fearful right now. i am still trying to process this right now. i know i saw this but it does not match anything i have ever seen before. this is something that i have not seen reported on before. i know this is simalar to the arizona lights or where ever that happend, this was not a bright set twinkling lights. there was no color to it. it was like the starlight was reflecting off the frontedge of this craft.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     ","distance":"20 Feet or

the funny thing was at first i didn't see anything, but i did notice it was unusually dark, then i noticed a very dim light, i suddenly realized that the reason it was so dark was that there was a huge craft right over our driveway. it was at tree top level and was moving north at a very slow pace, \"approximately a slow walking speed\". there was a very distinct humming, exactly like a large transformers hums,but you could feel the sound the resonance was so low. there was a very dull light in the middle and as it traveled down or driveway i made out a row of windows around the craft, the windows looked very large. i remember walking down the driveway with my son, then the next thing i remember is standing out in the field north of my house still looking at the ufo, when suddenly it went from approximately 90 or 100 ft straight up in the sky to where it was a pinpoint of light. it just looked like another star. this happened in under a second. we continued to watch it for quite awhile when it took off in a northwesterly direction like a meteor and was gone in a second. there are allot of things i can describe if your interested, but this is the basic part.\r\ni don't feel like i was abducted, but i honestly do not remember how i got from my driveway and then in the field. i ask my son about it and he remembers things the way i do, but what i find unusual is that 1. i didn't really focus on it that much after the initial day it happened until a few years ago. 2. my son doesn't seem as interested as i am, even though he is a very intelligent guy. i was a flight simulator instructor in the air force and i have allot of knowledge regarding aircraft. this will always go down as the most bizarre day in my life. by the way, it seemed like i was being watched by someone in the window, but it was like you could only make out a shadow. i am now fascinated by ufo's and i know that there out there. please, if you have any more questions feel free to ask. almont is about 20 se of brown city. i have never seen another unusual craft. this was defiantly a ufo, there is no other explanation for it, i am the type of guy that checks his facts, there is nothing on our planet that i am aware of that could do what i saw! the pilots would be dead just from the g forces. it surprises me that there have been so many incidences in that area and i never heard about it. from my house to the field was approximately 1000 feet, \" you would think that with what was going on, i would remember that sort of distance\". i am not really concerned weather anyone believes me or not, unless it is someone that is suppose to investigate this sort of thing. they really need to have an open mind and check the facts. the last few years i have gotten increasingly interested in this subject and there have only been a few incidences that i have read about where people have been as close as i was. i guess i am just intrigued. it really fascinates me!\r\ni was so close, 90 ft. the funny thing about it was i didn't feel threatened, in a weird way i felt like it was something from our future, as bizarre as that sounds. i feel that we need to have confidence in our instincts, i felt like i was on display and really being watched. one thing i didn't mention and to this day i am not sure why i didn't act, is that i am a professional photographer. what a dummy! the shot of a life time and i didn't even think about it. this is another thing i cant explain, i take my cameras everywhere with me. the first ten years, i would occasionally ask my son if he remembered everything about that night and he would say yes, but not really want to talk about it. it seemed like more of a dream. why? neither my son or i am the type of person not to act on something so significant, an event of a life time. another factor about that night was the route the craft was traveling, right down my driveway. my power lines go right down the drive and sometime that winter i had to call edison out, they told me that the wires were completely bare\" no insulation at all\", and had to replace them, including the transformer. i am not sure if it relates, but i have read stories about these craft using power lines.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":27792,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.9205842,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02122011-0013","longitude":-83.0449347,"occurred":656046000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1297579268000,"summary":"Almont/romeo michigan,  huge craft right over our driveway - humming sound","tags":["sound"],"timeZone":"America/Detroit","timeZoneName":"America/Detroit","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/27792_submitter_file1__myufophotofall1990.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/27792_submitter_file2__Fall1990sideview.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7425,"locationName":"Almont, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:71276"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Marble Hill","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This cigar shaped [i would say as big jet fusealoge] came just south of our home at a very low level[less than a 1000 feet] and at a distance at the closet spot of less than a 1/8 mile.It was silver,no windows,no noise in a north east direction and it flew in a straight line we were very excited when we saw it and we couldn't believe our eyes after it went by and discussed it for a long while afterwards. it didn't seem to be going at a exburant rate of speed as i have been very close to fighter jets and i know what they can do. my wife seen it first while getting clothes off of the line in back yard and hollered at me while i was in the shop working on something and when i saw it i rushed over to my son's home [which is 200 ft past the shop]and hollered at them to come and look and my daughter-in-law,granddaughter,and grandson also saw it.My granddaughter run in to get a camera but it was to far away to really get a picture by then. in this area there have been a lot of strange things one night behind our house in the woods there was a bright lite shining down into the woods with no noise moving real slow and just disappeared as well as several other strange things i have seen in my life as we live near the piedmont,mo area that was the ufo hotspot of the seventys's.I have been told stories by my family back two generations of there experencies with ufo's and i don't think they would lie about it as they keep it to there selves for years before they would even talk about it. if you are interested in knowing any of there sighting i would gladly tell you. what i have told is as truthful as i can.
