about the magnitude of venus when it's at it's brightest but there are no green stars and i am quite interested in astronomy and sure that was no planet. i stopped and stared at the thing thinking what in the world is that, the color made me think of the northern lights. about 2-3 seconds it stood perfectly still in the sky, just like a star and then it shot away to the south west leaving nothing but a green line for a split second. i walked the rest of the way home looking at the sky trying to see something more, but that was all. \r\n\r\ni'll attach an illustration of approximately where in sky these objects were. the moon that appeared to the north-east was suppose to be setting in the north-west far below the treelike at this time, and the moon doesn't just disappear. there

called my wife out and she seen the same thing.  the front was not pointed like a typical airplane.  there were no wings. my wife said to her it appeared that there was a depression on the rear of the cylinder and behind that a small tail or rudder pointing upward. there were no markings, lights, landing gears, windows or other features that we could see. there was no contrail, vapor or noise. \r\n right after my wife came outside a second, identical object became visible a bit south and behind the first in a \"wing man\" position.  this one was closer to us and only at a slight angle from where we stood so we could see underneath it to confirm there were no visible features on the underside.\r\n the two objects continued flying east by north east until they were out of site.\r\n i called the sheriff's office to ask if other people had reported anything odd in the area. dispatch said no but they would send someone out to take a report. \r\n the sheriff that came out suggested it might be a drone and it's spotter plane, since we live near a flight testing area for general atomics.   we do not feel that the objects we seen were anything close to the test vehicles we have seen out here in

house, my son came in and asked me to go to the backyard to see something unrelated to the event. as i followed him out, along the side of our house heading to the back i casually glanced at the sky.\r\n as i looked up i noticed a black triangular object of considerable size moving from roughly southwest to northeast, i can't give a good estimate of its size as there was no frame of reference. the object had a white circular light at each corner and was moving very slowly, its edges were clearly distinguishable against the darkening sky. i watched it cross over the trees for a moment, then resumed going to the back, then it struck me that the object was close, that it made no sound at all, and that a/c lights have a completely different pattern. i stopped in shock and looked back up just in time to watch it become obscured behind the trees. i was a flight deck fueler, then jet mechanic in the navy in the 80's and early 90's and this was unlike any aircraft i've ever seen. i was struck by the, for lack of a better term, wrongness of it. its flight path was straight and level but far too low for a fixed wing aircraft, a helo that low would have made a considerable amount of noise and it was clearly travelling against the wind(at least the wind at ground level) and was moving much quicker than the wind as this was a still evening.\r\n my first instinct was to dismiss what i had seen, it was just too strange. i tried to convince myself that i must have imagined it, or that it was a normal but misidentified object. it didn't work. i'm a pretty observant person, and not given to flights of fancy. i saw this object and it wasn't a standard type of aircraft, it was clearly under powered flight. i went back and found my son in the yard and looked at whatever he wanted me to see, then we went back inside. i at first decided to keep this to myself but quickly changed my mind and told my wife about it,and shortly thereafter i also confided in my best friend.\r\n about a week later, again walking to the back yard,on the opposite side of the house this time, i saw another object(i had gotten in the habit of scanning the sky at this point), the same shape, but larger. it was around the same time of day, the object was higher in the sky but approximately the same apparent size as before(therefore it must, because of the relative perspective have been larger). it was farther to the west than the previous object and moving at approximately the same speed.The second object had the same white lights at the corners, and a fourth in the center, and like the first made no sound at all.This time being slightly less shocked i sprinted to my friends door and yelled for him to come outside and see it, but by the time he got out it was already occluded by the trees.\r\n shortly thereafter i happened across a show about ufo's and realized that the object i saw looked like the objects seen in the spate of sightings in belgium a few years previously.I was, until these events, not really a believer.While i could consider intellectually that ufo's might exist i knew how odd perfectly ordinary objects could look in the sky. i had seen many cases of what i knew to be ordinary aircraft look remarkably different. i am absolutely certain what i saw was not any ordinary craft.I can't imagine that someone would test experimental craft over a major population center, both for security and safety reasons. i tried to find a more mundane explanation for what i saw, but i couldn't.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet

question i was eating lunch and a local friend stop bye to say that he had saw some hunters sneaking on to the property, i told him that i would let them get settled down and after my lunch i would go out and round them up. so i finished lunch got my gun and started walking down the fence row my plan was to cut into the woods and sneak up on them. i had been out there around 45 mins to an hour and as i was making my way though the woods suddenly something step out from behind a tree. i yelled friend or foe and point my gun at it. i couldn't believe my eyes there standing in front of me and my gun was a 3 and 1/2 foot tall gray being, suddenly i had the thought that it was talking to me though my mind, i had the felling that it was a young female and it was scared and telling me it was going to run up a little knoll, just then it took off running up that knoll. i followed it with my gun barrel as it reach the top of the hill there was a flash of light and a door way opened up out of no where. it was about 4 ft wide and probably 8 ft tall it was brightly light inside and i could see the little being standing in it, now it looked like it was wearing a tight black suit of some sort. suddenly out of the corner of my left eye, i see what looked like something was running toward me i wheeled around and right in front of me was a lizard like man about 5 to 6 ft tall and he was holding a long staff like thing in one hand, his face was more insect looking to me though, and it had dark blue eyes. again i caught the feeling that it was the little females father, or guard. okay i know this sound weird but just then to my right there was a 7ft or 8 ft brown hairy bigfoot creature just standing there. i didn't hear him speak but i did hear in my mind no! don't hurt him. just then the lizard looking one, looked right at me and his eyes changed right in front of me to a yellowish gold. i turn to run and when i did. i was just standing there in the dark in the woods, yes it was night time. i stood there in shock for a moment trying to collect myself. i looked around and i was alone. i started my walk out of there. back to the farm house, when i got back there was another farm hand that said where have you been we thought you got lost. i didn't say a thing. i come forth now, because i have tried to live with this for years, but recently i was watching tv the history channel show ancient aliens and saw something that looked like the lizard man on the tv.\r\nit brought back memories of that day and i started having dreams again and thinking strange thoughts like, could that have be a portal i saw the little one go into? are they interdenominational? or time travelers?, is this why no one finds bigfoot bones? and so on, also i'm having dreams about our future. i need to know what happened to me, out there that day. so i come to you for help. \r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or

ways out of lampases, from the passenger seat, dad says \"there's a ufo\"...I laughed and just kept driving.  a little while later, i spotted 2 bright yellowish/orange lights (like about the size of a headlight from a mile or two away) in the night sky ahead of us and off to the north towards stephenville or comanche.  i jokingly said \"there's your ufo's\".  after a few seconds of us watching them just hang there at about a 45 degree angle from us in the sky, they were gone!  like a light being turned out.  i said \"whoa, that was weird!\" and kept searching the sky while trying to keep the vehicle on the road.\r\n\r\n    by this time, mom was asking from the back seat what we were talking about because she couldn't see anything from back there.  as i kept driving,(maybe 5-10 min later) the lights appeared again, except this time there were more of them that i could see.  i saw a couple in front of me, and as i leaned in towards the stearing wheel, i could see 4 or 5 more off to the right (north).  dad and i were watching in amazement and pointing at them as mom tried to move around in the back seat so she could see.  a few seconds later, they were gone again, just like before.  this happened one more time, that i saw, before we got to brownwood.  if i wouldn't have been driving, i might have seen more.  dad, who had a better view from his side, kept saying he was seeing little blinking lights way up there moving around in the same area.  they were probably jet planes looking for whatever we were seeing in the sky.\r\n\r\n    when we got to brownwood at about 8:00 p.M., we headed west on 67 towards san angelo.  another couple pulled up next to us at a stop light and rolled down their window and asked if we had seen the lights too.  (they said they wanted to make sure they weren't going crazy)  as we got halfway through town, we saw the lights again off to the nw towards abilene.  this time mom got a better view because they were lower, at about a 30 deg. angle.  it started out as what looked like one big light and then all of a sudden, as i said \"hey look!\", it just split off into about 7-10 slightly smaller ones that were aligned in a perfectly horizontal row and evenly spaced apart.  a few seconds later, they just vanished again like a light being turned off and that's the last time we saw them.  i mean i have seen lights in the sky before, but that was the craziest thing i've ever seen.  if i wouldn't have been driving, i would have tried to capture the images with my iphone.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"Over

the sun began to set & the clouds took over & i lost sight until night fell. i noticed the ball of light. it stayed in the sky for approx half an hour before i saw these planes (about 8) coming from every direction. the ufo never moved. i was able to see the ball of light & the light from these encircling aircrafts within close vacinity of each other. suddenly i didn't see the ufo ball of light anymore & then the other aircraft simply left in the same direction from which they came. the 2nd time i saw it, it was just simply there...Hovering. no chaser planes this time. on feb 10th, 2011...I saw it again. thank goodness my husband was outside with me at the time. he doesn't believe in ufos or any type of conspiracy theories. i told him to look to our west. he said it was a plane. i told him about the 1st experience i had in the same location. he said it looked like it was moving. i told him that we should come back in a half hour & that it would still be there. he looked at me like i was crazy. anyways, right before we went inside, the object disappeared. we never took our eyes off it. he looked at me in an unsettling manner & said that maybe they turned the lights off & turned his back towards me. we both began to laugh. he was spooked & i knew it. i was so excited that he was able to see it with his own eyes & that he had proof that i wasn't crazy. there is something

were to draw a line between the two mountain peaks the lights would be in the middle, but about 5 miles to the east.  the lights typically hover above the forest for a couple minutes, slowly drift up for about 5 seconds and then fade away in about half a second.  from my house i can see these lights and using google earth estimate them to be about 40 miles away in wasco county.  the lights seem to be about 500-1000ft above the forest floor.  when they rise they probably reach an altitude of about 2000-3000ft before disappearing.  once i saw two of the lights at the same time and they were

the site i have my videos on the internet.  and before i downloaded the pictures to view them, i wrote this account first without seeing the pictures first.\r\n\r\n  on february 10, 2011 in mesa, az around 2:30pm, i went outside onto my porch to watch the sky for a little bit.  i seen the normal things flying such as jets, birds, etc. then after a little while, i decided to lite a cigarette.  as i glanced towards the sky that was directly in front of me with just my eyes only and while liting the cigarette, i thought i seen what i thought was a small and bright ball of light high in the sky hovering and  less than half a mile from location which that sighting lasted just a few moments.  i quickly looked through the camera's telescopic lens to see if i could locate it thinking that maybe it was just a speck of dust or something that just briefly appear and disappeared.  i could not locate that ball of light, but i did take a few pictures of the general area of the sky anyways for me to later closely examine.\r\n\r\n  then about 30 seconds to a minute later, i spotted a small and bright, white colored ufo that almost appeared similar to a small and brilliant star.  with 1 arm extended outward holding something to compare the size of the light or ufo, i would have to say the ufo was slightly smaller than a pea; or about the same size of a commercial jet seen flying at a 5 mile distant.  the area in the sky where i spotted this ufo was the same distant and same height of the first spotted object, but now this ufo was in a different part of the sky.  the first object was spotted at a compass bearing of 240 degrees.  the second sighting, the ufo was first seen  at a compass bearing of 200 degrees which is to my left side location.  from my perspectives, the ufo moved  a distant possibly 200 or 300 feet. the object was moving very slowly and flashing bright light from one side of the object slowly like a slow pulsating light that brighten and dim in irregular pattern.  the side that was lighting up was not facing the direction of the sun but north in direction.  when i first seen the 2nd ufo, it was moving to a distant of 100 feet like it was flying away from me at an angle heading south.  then the ufo changed its direction,  and it was then coming towards my location like a long curved course.  as it was coming towards my location, it appeared to become slightly larger, and it was then looking bright orange/yellow in color, and flashing very rapidly, yet  it also appeared like it was changing colors of orange and yellow somewhat similar to an old rotating/striped barber sign that was somewhat round or oval in shape.  after i had taken some pictures, i decided to change the camera exposure which when i did that, i temporary lost sight of the object when i tried locating it again.  i eventually located the object, only it had moved more to the right of my location a distant of 50 feet and much closer to my location.  i was actually thinking i was going to get some really good close up pictures of  this ufo if it  continued coming closer to my location. while taking some pictures of the ufo, i decided to use the auto-focus once which i had no problem using,  and i auto-focused onto the ufo; however, i didn't want to waste any time or chances using the auto-focus more than once.  i then decide later to switch back to my regular exposure which again i lost sight of the ufo temporarily which i eventually was able to locate the object again.  at that time, it was moving away from me like in an erratic flying pattern similar to moving up, down, and sideways jerking-like motion but at a slow speed.  after taking some pictures, i then decided to change the camera exposure setting again; however, after i did that, i could not locate the ufo in the sky.  beyond a doubt, it was a ufo of some sort,  and the ufo is absolutely not a balloon, plane, bird, star, etc;  100 percent plus ufo guarantee.\r\n\r\n  while i continued to watch the sky in the general area where i once saw the ufo, 2 to 5 minutes later a small plane quickly flew passed my location very near me from the east at a low altitude and from behind my location.  the plane appeared to be at the same altitude i seen the ufo. the plane circled the general area once where i had previously seen the ufo.  after the plane circled the area just once, it headed then in a n or nw direction.  i also took lots of pictures of that plane.  when that plane circled around the general area of where i once spotted the ufo, it's circling the area indicated to me that the pilot must have seen the ufo too from a far distant, and he/she came to the area to check out the bright light.  i never seen a plane do a circle in the sky in my neighborhood, and the general area where the ufo was seen is also in the general section or  main flight path of commercial jets and small planes.\r\n\r\n  the sky was blue, no clouds, crystal clear day, and mild sunrays. the wind seem to be blowing from the north very gently. the temperature was somewhere around 70 degrees.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

tonight, and i did.  i was making a loop around the lake going south on ranch rd 2461 (i was at the southeast corner of the lake).  i was making the bend right before the road meets up with ranch rd 2214.  while taking that bend i saw the orange lights.  they were in the southern sky, were quite low in altitude and quite close.  there was a string of 4 or 5 orange lights in a row with two \"stray\" orange lights above and out to the sides of the main row.  the lights came on slowly, burned brightly then dimmed out.  the lights were in the same formation and behaved in exactly the same way as the lights i reported over eastland cemetery in november of 2008.  after the lights had disappeared i noticed a large swarm of military jets in the area.  their white strobes covered the sky, and they seemed to sweep the area farther south after the sighting towards de leon and eventually seemed to split up into pairs and sweep north.  immediately after the sighting, i stopped the car at the intersection of 2461 and 2214 and texted some friends who had seen the same type of ufo with me 11 months earlier over the nearby town of cisco.  one of my friends texted me back and said he was on his way to the nearby town of ranger (northeast of where i was). i told him to keep his eyes peeled.  a few minutes later at 7:50pm, he texted me and said he just saw two ufos.  a few minutes later at 7:52 he texted me again and said he saw the ufo again.  i texted him and told him that what i had seen was a row of orange lights like the ones we saw over cisco last year and asked if he was seeing the same thing.  he texted me back and said \"yes\" he was seeing the rows of orange lights like we had seen together over cisco.  later at 8:27pm he texted me stating he was seeing jets everywhere.  i have seen these same orange lights in eastland county for several years.  i'm curious about them but can never deduce anything about them except that they are arbitrary lights in the sky.  the lights always appear disembodied--no visible craft they appeared attached to, but seeing the lights in the similar rows of 4 or 5 with a few extra above makes me wonder if they aren't actually attached to a fixed-shaped craft that happens to be \"cloaked\" in some way.  the lights seem to hover or creep along at a snail's pace and are totally silent.  military jets always accompany the sightings.  one more thing.  i also have noticed that the sightings tend to occur when the moon is in its quarter phase (tonight is first quarter--this is what gave me my \"hunch\" that i would see something).  sorry, no footage.  again, event happens within a matter of seconds with no time to grab a camera.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at the sphere and it disappeared, then a second one appeared just left of the where the first one disappeared. it glowed for about 5 to 10 seconds then it disappeared as well.\r\nafter it disappeared then i notice 5 or 6 of what i think are military jets right in the same area all in a very small area just where the spheres were.  within 30 seconds or so the jets (i can tell by their flashing lights) started dispersing in all different directions. then they all generally moved to the west for 30 to 60 seconds, then the all turned around and headed back east, all 5 seemed to group up again in a smaller area and all were traveling east. i watched another minute or two and never saw anything else except the jets, so i went on.\r\n\r\nabout 8 weeks ago my wife and i both saw 3 of these same gold/bronze spheres in the same exact locations.  they flashed on a off several times with up to 2 on at the same time. each time one would disappear then another, or the same one would reappear in a different location a couple of sphere widths to the side.  this lasted 30 seconds or so, after they quit then we saw the jets again but not in as a close pattern this time, more just searching.\r\n\r\napproximately 1 year ago, i, my wife,my son and his wife all saw 3 or 4 of these same gold/bronze spheres in the s/w sky but we were at the west side of stephenville at the time.
