satellites and helicopters and planes and know the difference between stars and planes.. but there is one star in particular, that begins moving, it will shoot up, then back down, then go in circles.. and the star i usually use as a reference point for it, moves with it sometimes as well. \r\nthis star is very bright, a bright cobalt blue with a very bright shinning white.. and yet sometimes it looks like there are little rotating flashes of red and green. it gets brighter and brighter sometimes and looks like its spotlighting you or something. \r\ni see this every night i go outside.. there is also a red star that will move around as well. these stars appear every night over my house.. and i know that stars flicker and get brighter, and things throughout the night, but this is different. this night was different because the bright star would flash, and then a star to it's right would flash and then another to the left like they were in order, responding to each other.\r\n\r\ni feel crazy, describing it to my friends, even now, but it happens every night.. sometimes it feels like they are trying to communicate with me, but i realize how selfish and crazy that sounds. but do other people see moving stars? \r\n\r\ni know it sounds odd, but i feel like they are trying to get my attention.. i feel like they have revealed themselves to me, and i don't know what else to do. i see them every night! and i can point them out every night, i know where they are at all hours with the rotation of the earth. i just dont know what the point of showing me is. what am i supposed to do with this? im saving to buy a better video camera that can record these dancing stars, so i can show my friends i'm not nuts. but i wanted to step up and ask some people who are pros on the subject o ufo's..\r\ni'd really appreciate any kind of help or explanation, i feel like im going crazy.. but i know what i have seen, i just dont know what it is :) thank you for your

daughter and i were sitting in the living room reading and watching television early evening when my daughter said ,dad have you noticed the  ceiling light is getting dimmer and dimmer.I said i have noticed it for about the last twenty minutes .Thinking it may be faulty i turned the light off from the switch on the wall.Later my wife daughter and myself retired for the night and said our goodnights to each other.I awoke from my sleep i think about one or two o,clock the next morning and noticed that my wife had gone to the lounge room to get some sleep because of my snoaring.When i was walking down the hallway i noticed the light was on again in the lounge room ,my fist thought was that it had still had some life in it and went to turn it off but remembered i,d turned it off earlier that night, thinking my wife may have turned it on  i went to turn it off again but to my surprise it was still in the off  position.I walked over to my wife to ask her if she wanted to return back to the bedroom with me but as i went to touch her a small flash of light flashed in front of my face that startled me,not knowing what it was i turn my head slightly to my left when it flashed in front of me again.I thought it might have been lightening so as i went to look outside the house it flashed again in front of me .It was  the size of a golf ball and left a shock wave as it flashed.I went out door to see if it could\r\n be from an approaching storm but there was not a cloud in sight. i decided to leave my wife where she lay on the lounge and returned to bed ,where i layed thinking what was it was that i had just seen.About one hour had passed when my entire bedroom flashed a light so bright i did not think possible .Now i am starting to become concerned as to what is happening in the house.Then twenty to thirty minutes later it flashed again but stayed on for about three seconds, it was so bright i could not see any furniture, windows ,wall prints  not anything not even the door or ceiling cornice, for a short time i felt frozen but not with fear but with amazement at what i was wittnesing.I lept from my bed and went out to check on my wife and daugher i went to my wife first and told her to get up and wait there for me but she went straight to the bedroom in her awoken slumber i then went to my daughters bedroom and woke her also and took her to my bedroom with me and my wife.The next morning i told my wife what had happened that early morning and she the had remembed that she had also seen flashing lights in our walk in robe and thought it was me turning the lights on and off  but then remembed that i was in my daughters room waking her.My daughter noticed us talking and wanted to know what it was that we were dicussing, when i told her she replied that she had seen the same flashing lights but thought i was me or my wife just playing with the lights in the hallway out side her room  but it was not us. i have been confused as to what these  lights were untill one night sitting in the yard i saw the same flash of light in the night sky it had the same shock wave as it disappead i truely believe that this light had a great deal of intelegence as it was able to manipulate our living room light.I have seen four other  ufo,s with

you just never know what you might see. i had gone outside my house to smoke a cigarette and just sit and stare up at the sky.  then, i heard the distant sound of approaching military jets. this was not unusual because we're not too far from the willow grove naval air station. well, i looked up and saw the two fighter jets, possibly f-117's but that was not what caught my attention. between the two military jets and a little above them, there was a triangular craft just like a lot of the sketches i see reports of people seeing. actually, it looked almost exactly like the triangular craft from the famous blurry photograph taken over belgium in the 1980's i believe. what struck me was that i could hear the distinct sound of the two jets which sounded like they were coasting into the willow grove naval air station. i heard no other sounds. i assumed it was a military craft because it was being escorted by the jets making every movement with them. \r\n\r\nalso, i could tell the triangular craft had lights at the corners and one round one right in the center of the bottom. the thing was, the lights weren't shining. they did look like they were on but it was like they were shifted a bit out of our spectrum. i had a very clear view of the craft but it seemed to be \"grayed out\" or something. the lights seemed on but they weren't shining like a regular light source. i was a little excited at the time i didn't think much of it because i just figured it was a military black project. but, now i'm seeing more and more things about people seeing this thinking it's from outer space. i believe it to be a military aircraft and completely terrestrial. i wanted to report my sighting to you to give you another point of view from someone who has also seen this object. it came to mind tonight while i watched a program on tv about the ufo flap in the summer of 2008. unfortunately, i didn't take any pictures because for one, it was in the middle of the night and i didn't

window and asked what it was..So i went in the back yard and saw a giant green light and i think at least 2 large red lights flashing, i didnt see a shape, it looked like a cluster of pulsating lights slow moving west. my daughter came outand says she thought it had a outline of oval and or boomerag shape. we  both tried to take a picture and video with our cell phones and we couldnt, it wouldnt come out on the camera.  i tried so many times for like 15 min., i didnot hear any noise from the object, but my daughter thought it was like a swooshing water sound. it moved slowly towards the coast near malibu it looked like and then it seemed to go over a hill and then there was a flashing red light that stayed there all night. i have  looked outside last night and noticed that the small flashing red light on the hill is always there, must be like a coast guard light. we have seen some white lights on january 24, 2011 up here in a triangular shape, but that seems to be very common on these sites. this was very different, it was huge...Something i have never seen before. i did check out to see if maybe it could be one of those military planes, but it moved so slowly , almost stationary...So i dont think it was anything from this planet..I noticed today that other people may have seen what i saw in my area, in los angeles...I would love to compare notes...My email is

front of house per car time, 7:36pm. after getting out of the car i looked up at the sky as i normally do, it was a very clear night sky with stars and normal air traffic. however, what caught my eye was this...I parked the car on the northside of the street directly in front of our home, car facing west. we have a completely large field of view of the sky full 360 with almost no obstruction from tall trees during the winter. anyway, i reached the sidewalk and looked up facing west and noticed just past a tall street tree, 2 red lights (not flashing) but 1 one each end of a straight invisible line, appear, move and turn slightly toward my direction but then as if banking a u turn, shift its angle and hovered for a moment then at a very slow and steady speed, begin to move forward going south (heading toward the queen mary area, dwntwn long beach) down the path of the 710 s fwy. cross frwys 91/710 main streets long beach blvd/artesiablvd.\r\n\r\ni have to say this. it has been known that the military has increased their activities in the area off the coast and flight patterns from long beach/ san pedro areas straight towards or past burbank/pasadena with military battle copters to jets f15s etc. tonight, this object made no sound. it was low flying less than 1000 feet just like the.Police/military helicopters have been flying over our homes...It's wingspan equaled to that of a football/track field but the length/distance of the two lights expanded further away from each other at a point 3 blocks from me, then just barely missing a small plane just leaving the long beach airport due nw, changed its altitude just in time to fly over the plane. i remember seeing atleast 3 planes flying around just after this object appeared. then the air traffic picked up with a helicopter coming. i did try to videotape with my android epic phone. the object would not pickup on camera except for the small plane. i called for my eldest son, 19, to come out to see this. he did...But by this time, apprx 7min passed the object had picked up speed and the two lights had shifted and moved around and came closure together in tbe distance mimicking that of a vehicles two red brake lights with the exception that they were blinking red at a much faster rate. i was hesitant to post this info. i hope that some one else saw this too. i have witnessed other ufo sightings since i was a kid. this was amazing as it had just appeared to show itself to me. example. i though i was viewing 2 large stars that were very far apart from each other in the sky, near orion's belt. that's when it moved.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

had several sightings within the past year and the very first one pushed me into making ufo chasing a hobby. tonight i wasn't even looking really. tonight's purpose was to console my best friend who is going through a rough time at the moment. we did some back country driving and venting and out of the corner of my eye i spotted it (a small gold colored orb) . i pointed it out to my friend (who is also interested in this hobby) and she was amazed. it hovered still as if it might be observing. i flashed my brights at it and then it took off with great speed. it was gone. no where to be seen. so out of curiosity i decided to go in the direction where it went. it appeared again as a bright star and the closer we got to it, it drifted away but still remained the same size and shape but it still seemed like one of them \"door at the end of the tunnel\" situations. once we reached an intersection we finally caught up to it. it sat stationary over a large field with no trees or houses. at this point we noticed that it had a pulsating bright red light along with the white light. it did not blink like and air plane would. very lovely. i decided to take a right down another road because i could not go straight toward it since the road cut off at the intersection. i turned around on a whim and noticed that the object was now following us!!! gleee!!! i found a driveway and turned around to face it and then it started going back in the other direction. i was a little upset by this and then out of curiosity i turned my brights off. after that it stopped and sat there. i get the feeling that whatever it was wasnt very fond of bright lights. this ufo friend hung around for the majority of the night...Like a watcher. very interesting and fun indeed. \r\n\r\nsecond sighting of the evening: this one stands out the most to me and is also very important to me because this is a new style of sighting and one of the most interesting that i've seen. after playing tag with the first one we noticed 3 dim orbs off in the distance that slowly inched toward each other. they were horizontal in the horizon and resembled a formation that of orions belt. the second orb and the third orb came together with the first orb and created one very large and very very bright orb! the orb would grow dim and very bright....Dim and very bright....And than disappeared completely. \r\n\r\nafter this we stopped at a gas station and then decided to head back home. on the way home we were followed by two of these orbs up until about a few miles from home.\r\n\r\nfolks of southern wisco....Someone had to have seen this too..At least id hope so...People seem to take the sky for granted these days and tend to keep their head down but never upward toward the possibilities....But there are a handful of you out there with an open mind...Don't be afraid to come forward if you've seen anything tonight as well.

triangle craft right over my house this past monday, i was excited! it was around eightish at night and i was getting ready to get inside and put the dogs in. my wife was causally watching t.V. inside the house as usual. i like to stay outside and watch the stars on a daily basis, almost like a hobby. reason being is, because in the past i've seen many odd unkown objects in the sky and always wanted to know more. so, on this evening i was recalling upon my expierence when i was camping with my family at kern river. at kern river is where i first expierenced the triangles.\r\n\r\nanyways, back to my house as i was standing up watching the stars i was thinking to myself. man, would be great to see those traingle crafts again!! i was thinking i might never get to see them again, but at least i got to see them once. as, i walked to my door to go in i looked up one more time just in case. right, then and there i saw it again!!!! i was really excited and really looked at the triangle craft as best and as long as i could. the traingle craft was really low to ground and was completly silent. the craft was about as high up in the sky as a typical airplane would be flying. as, i was looking at the craft i yelled out to my wife. come outside, come outside it's here.... loook!!! my wife, was scared and decided not to get up because she didnt want to freak out. i ran to front of my house and followed it in the sky for as long as i could, i have a neighbor who's also open to u.F.O.'s. i screamed to her and said look up there here, see!! she was preoccupied at the time because she was on the phone and ended up missing it. the triangle craft was very large, to me it seems like a mothership type or commander type craft, because of it's size. i would say it's as large as football field or bigger. the size was so big i knew it wasn't from this world. the thing about these crafts is there also, nearly invisible. it's like the craft has a invisible cloaking device. it looked like a solid triangle object but, at the same time you could see through it. on both end tips of the triangle craft there was bright red flashing light's. the light's seemed to have a sequence to it, an example would be the red lights flickered in a wierd pattern, then switched back to a simple on/off mode. as, i was still standing in the middle of the street  with my neighbor the craft vanished into the dark sky headed towards palos verdes, ca. this was a exciting night hope it helps out and thanks for reading!\r\ni computerized a triangle craft so everyone can get a feel of the real deal.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

hoping to have a ufo experience of his own. but, i tell you the truth when i say this, from what i've been reading about these things, they are not good. they are not what they seem. the fruits of their actions only reveal bad intention. i would like to think that i did not see what i saw, that this story isn't true. but it is.\r\n\r\nmy roommate and i just got back from the humane society where we picked up a dog and i went to the back porch to smoke a cigarette. i had remembered that earlier i had seen a rainbow, so i looked around in the clouds to see if it was still visible. it was not.\r\n\r\ninstead, i saw an orb of light moving around. it seemed about the size of a small or distant plane flying, but it contained itself to a single area and maneuvered too quickly around to be a planethe event was occurring just above a line of trees, so i watched to see if it was a kite or something, but then i noticed another circle. and in another few seconds another and another. soon (within 20 seconds of the first sighting) there were 7+ orbs flying around in that area. none of them were rising from the ground, but gathering together from other parts of the sky. all of them were flying around each other. if these were kites, surely the strings would have tangled together and i would have seen them crashing to the ground. they did not.\r\n\r\ni have been reading different books about ufo's recently (communion by streiber, redfern's final events, and a few books by l.A. marzulli) so i'm not surprised that my first interpretation of the event was \"ufos.\" but, because the very name indicates ignorance, i kept watching to see whether these orbs would begin showing behavior typical of some explainable object. they did not.\r\n\r\nthey continued their dance in the sky and i continued to watch them. i had no other camera on me but my phone camera, which would not have been able to zoom in close enough to capture an image of these orbs. after 8-9 minutes, i went inside and called for my roommate to \"come, see this!\" i had hoped for another eye-witness to this event. i went back outside and turned my attention back to the sky, but to my dismay, all but one had disappeared and just as my roommate stepped back onto the porch, that one flew into the cover of the clouds and could no longer be seen. the rainbow was again visible, however.\r\n\r\nwe went back inside where i told him the story of what happened and he told me that it sounded like something that he saw years back.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

was nine years old at the time of the event. it happened in mid summer, and in broad daylight. there were two witnesses to the sighting, myself, and a friend that i will refer to as willy.\r\n\r\nat the time, i lived very near one of the largest hills in haverhill, mass. we called the hill, tilton's tower, because at one time there had stood a large, brick viewing tower atop the hill. the tower was long gone by 1962, and in its place was a large (200 ft. +/-) radio transmission tower, which was used to broadcast our local am radio station. if it was used for anything else, i know not. the entire hill was otherwise devoid of any houses or buildings. it was a great place for us neighborhood kids to play and explore.\r\n\r\non a bright, sunny, august day, my friend willy and me decided to hike up to the top of the hill. we had made our own bows and arrows, by bending a branch for a bow, and using the straightest sticks we could find, as arrows. \"come on, let's go to the top of tilton's tower,\" i said, \"maybe we can shoot a rabbit.\" willy and i climbed to the top where the grass was nearly waist high. we walked through the tall grass hoping to flush out a rabbit, but alas, the only thing jumping were grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nso that we might make some use of our bows and arrows, i got the idea that we could shoot our arrows straight up into the sky, and see whose arrow would go the farthest.\r\n\r\n\"okay!\", said willy, \"i'll bet mine'll go higher than yours!\" we both drew back on our bows and pointing our arrows straight up. \"reday\", i said, \"aim... fire!\" \"they went about the same height\", willy said. \"okay, let's try it again\", i said. so, again we pulled back as hard as we could on our bow strings, pointed our arrows up toward the sky and.... \"hey!\" i yelled, \"what's that?\" i lowered my bow, but kept my gaze straight up, for there in the bright blue sky, was a silvery, shiny disk darting this way and that. \"hey! do you see that?\" \"yes\", willie replied.\r\n\r\nthe disk was bright silver, perfectly round, and moving in a zig zag pattern, that gave me the impression of the movement of a gyroscope, or the wobble of a top. it tipped slightly, banked, moved forward and side to side. the speed was rapid in its zig zag movements, and it was totally noiseless. the sun was nearly directly overhead (in fact, i recall putting our hand above our eyes to aid in seeing), and it almost seemed to be playing tag with the sun. we stood and watched it for a minute or two. the size was about what a dime would be at arms length.\r\n\r\n\"what is it?\", i said. \"i don't know... a flying saucer.\", said willie. suddenly, the first one was joined by a second. \"hey look! now there's two of them!!\" i shouted. the two disks moved close to one another at the same altitude. while their movements were quite erratic, and while they crossed paths with each other, they didn't collide. they both remained pretty much overhead during the entire sighting period. then... in an instant... they were gone! \"they're gone!\" said willy. \"yeah, where did they go?\", i asked. we scanned the sky, but the two disks were no where to be seen.\r\n\r\nneedless to say, we hurriedly made our way down the hill. i've never forgotten that day. it is something that i haven't discussed much to anyone, although i have asked willy, and he too remembers the incident quite well. there is no doubt in my mind that the two disks that we both saw were real. beyond a doubt, these were solid, controlled, flying objects, and could not have been anything else. i consider myself very fortunate to have had this experience.","distance":"101-500

the summer of 1966, i was spending a couple of weeks at my grandmother���s house in mashhad, iran.  one day, over breakfast, my grandmother told me of a light she had seen the night before. she had gotten up in the middle of the night and saw a ball of light descend and stop on top of the dome of imam reza shrine.  she added that the light had lingered motionless over the dome for a period of time and then descended into the dome.  she had watched for a while and then had gone back to bed.\r\n\r\nwhen i asked her what she thought it was, she said ���it must have been angel gabriel coming to visit the imam.���\r\n\r\nto my recollection, my grandmother was not given to any particular religious sentiment and would have no reason to make such a story up.  i believe she was simply using the only description that would make any sense based on the culture that she was in.  if anything, she was very pragmatic and well focused on the business of day-to-day life.\r\n\r\ni have been
