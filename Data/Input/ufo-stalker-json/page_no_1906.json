were bunching up just above the tree line an there where some small clouds that looked like a mist they were small and thin wen they moved i noticed this small silver metallic looking ball just like a dot in the sky it was still cuz the clouds where moving past it an what gave it away was the way the angle of the sun reflected off of it it looked like it was invisible wen the light hit the object it showed its appearance now i stood there and stared at this thing fer a good 4 minutes before i had to run all the way upstairs into my room to get my camera an ran as fast as i could back outside an managed to capture 3-5 seconds of footage before this object started to dance around the sky an out of nowhere this larger what appear to be a silverish almost invisible (it looked kinda like if u had a clear lavalamp with silver metallic effect in the shape of a sphere streak across the sky and disappeared behind a cloud it appeard like it went into onota lake witch is just up the street form where i filmed this from my fathers driveway just as i was trying to focus the camera and get steady. upon review of the footage i noticed that wen slowed down that you can see it many times and you can see how it maneuvers in differnt directions i will attach the video i took that day this is the original footage it is mp4 format shot on a sony webbie hd camerathis footage was uploaded on july 9th 2010 but it was filmed a day the week before i cant remember. also want to report 7-8 dark orange spheres on dec 24 2010 over pittsfield airport seen these objects for about a minute while driving home an then watched them for about 30 seconds from my front yard unfortunately my camera doesn't record at night but they slowly drifted to the east from the south west part of the city before the orange glow they had each started fading one by one now i know that other people seen this because it was directly in front of bosquet ski area  and they were in the sky just above and in front of the slopes. and on several occasions i have seen these red orang lights streak across the sky usually u just barely catch em out the corner of your eye cuz of thier speed. i would like to share this

an air plane, where i live this is not an unusual sight as there are two airports in the city, what struck me as strange was the speed the object was going, way too fast to be a plane and i actually remember saying in my head 'woaw that planes going really fast', i kept watching the object as it paced across the sky just above the roof lines, when it stopped dead. at this point my eyes were glued to the object, i was still walking down my street when i got to my front door, eyes still on the object, i knocked on the door and my fiance came out and she also saw the object. she brushed it off as an airplane and went back inside. i stayed out to watch completely confused at the pulsating light, stationary in the sky.  after a few minutes from behind me over my roof, very high in the shy another two lights shot across the sky in the direction of the red pulsating light, these two lights however were solid and very bright, almost white with a slight yellow tinge. as they aproached the pulsating light they abruptly turned right and disapeared into the sky, a few moments later the red pulsating light started to drift slowly away until i could no longer see them behind the roof tops.

estimate the duration of the sighting as 1, not more than 2 seconds. there were no lights on the object, it was completely black against the slightly orange cast of the sky. the edges seemed very sharp while it was directly in front of me, but it was more vague as it approached and departed. there were numerous airliners and general aviation aircraft visible at the time which were clearly audible. i heard no sound that could be attributed to the passing of the object. i estimate the object was considerably lower than the airliners i could see which were on final approach to orange

theses incidents....Believe it or not! i do not not remember the exact date of this incident, but i clearly remember what i/we saw. it was summer time and me, my ex girlfriend, and her cousin were horse playing around at her aunts house in the driveway. it was late in the evening when the sun had almost set. i always liked to look up at the sky, and up until that day i'd never seen anything unusual other than comets. as i looked up west in the sky i could see some of the stars that were becoming visible because night was about to fall, but there was was an odd one sitting there shining a bright reddish-orange color. i pointed it out to my ex girlfriend (girlfriend at the time) and her cousin. they thought it was odd as well. then her cousin came up with the assumption that it was one of the planets in our solar system that could be seen with the naked eye  that time of year. that theory of his was quickly destroyed when that object started to move to the right (north). we were all awe struck! it was a very big coincidence to me that i remembered that her cousin had a telescope that he had never used before. i was very excited and anxious to see up close what this thing was, so i told him to hurry and run inside to get his telescope. he did and meanwhile my ex was very excited and scared. she ran inside also to tell here aunt about it. by the time my ex, her aunt, and her cousin came back out (3min) the view of the object was ubstruckted by several big pine trees. my first instinct was to have all three of them to jump in my car. we did and the closest and biggest open space i could think of is this middle school that had a track in the back of it about less than a quarter mile away. when we got there we still saw the object in the sky. i quickly set up the telescope and i was extremely amazed of what i saw. this thing was shaped almost like a diamond with four similar diamond like objects that were spinning independently while at the same time all four of the smaller objects were rotating around the bigger object and they were not connected to anything(all had a fiery glow)! i'll also remind you that my ex, her aunt, and her cousin also looked into the telescope and saw what i saw. there was a 5th witness to. this guy was running around that track with his wife that evening. he was curious about what we were looking at. we were so amazed by what we were looking at that we just told the guy to look for himself. when he did he became frantic and was yelling for his wife to come take a look. by the time she made it to us, the object sped away like nothing i'd ever seen......In a blink of an eye going north! i hear people talking all of the about secret military experiments. i know for a fact that what we saw that evening wasn't any type of military experiment. the human body isn't built to take on that type of speed! i may not have any kind of video or photos to back my claims up, but i know what i and the others saw was very real and not of this planet! i urge everyone to use a telescope or binoculars so you can get a detailed view of the strange lights that are seen in our skies!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27703,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6562244,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02062011-0011","longitude":-82.3154562,"occurred":975571200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,

night, we heard some strange high pitched whirring noises. the air was cold, and it was a long walk until the party, but we did not think anything of it, so we kept our heads down, and our minds on the party. it was going to be an awesome party, and it turned out it was. it was a communist themed party, and it was a three dollar cover, unless we dressed as communists. we were not informed of this detail beforehand, so we ended up paying the three dollar cover, which was low considering the amount of live bands they had. as we got onto the street of the party, the whirring noise came back, and was louder, but nothing was going to deter us from going inside of the party, so we went into the party. music was blaring from the basement, and there were tons of hipsters and cool people there. if you were wondering what a hipster is, it is a person who wears black rimmed glasses and likes offbeat stuff. so we made our way into the kitchen, and i met my friend **(name deleted--cms/sg) and she was really quiet. she wasn't really into the party, and i get it, that type of party is not many people's scene. but we were trying to enjoy the party, so all of us went downstairs into the basement, and listened to some really cool bands. after about half an hour, we were looking for a drink, and we noticed that the party was bring your own beer, so we all ventured out of the house to the nearest liquor store. on the way back from the liquor store with boxes of beer and some 40 ounce alcohol containers, we heard the whirring noise, and what sounded like an engine from overhead. but we had so much alcohol on us, that we completely ignored it and went back inside of the party. after listening to some more bands, and drinking some more beer, our friends band was on, and they were great. they played a cover of the who's, \"baba o'riley,\" which i mistakenly thought was called teenage wasteland. my friend quickly corrected me, saying that it was baba o'riley, and i had an epiphany, and was like, \"oh, yeah, you're right.\" it was really hot, so me and my friend **(name deleted--cms/sg) went outside for some cigarettes. while standing on the porch, we saw a flash of light moving really fast over the trees, and **(name deleted--cms/sg)said to me, \"that was really strange,\" to which i agreed. then, we went back inside of the party, because it was a really great party. so then, there was some sort of dance off going on in the basement, and everyone was banging on the walls and ceilings, and our friend, redacted, came in 5th place, which was a lot of fun and there are pictures of it on facebook if you want to see. afterwards, we decided that we would leave the party, and go back to my place to have a drink. so all of us were walking on the street, when a

my two children just in time to see a red light fly over directly over our house with a helicopter close behind. they continued east until they both disappeared. the helicopter was very loud and didn't sound like a medical helicopter. it sounded more like a military helicopter because of it's size and sound. the helicopter had blinking white lights on it. the red light was just a red light. nothing more. i have no idea what it was.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

very high up in the sky. if it were dark i would say it looked like saturn. it was still very much daylight so i started to fell like it was not something normal. it was as high as a commercial jet or higher. it traveled exactly south to north. it did not change altitude that i could notice. from my location i would estimate it was flying between i 95 and the ocean approximately  15 degrees off of straight up. it traveled north for at least 5-10 minutes before i lost it in a cloud and was never able to reacquire. it was witnessed by my self and my wife. it did not leave contrails. it had no flashing lights. there was no sound. my first real thought was maybe the iss or some other satellite or the space shuttle. no photos!","distance":"20 Feet or
