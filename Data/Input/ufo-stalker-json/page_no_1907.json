used to see alot of things that was unexplained. on september of last year, i started seeing strange lights every single day. you see i love working out and hiking so i go jogging everyday at 7 o'clock with my dog and the next hour by myself. but everyday i saw these lights that were just amazing and so beautiful and they hung high and sometimes low in the sky. some are flashing lights and some flash but will be still in the sky, way different than helicopter lights and plane lights. to ensure myself that i wasn't seeing things, one night when i was out jogging with my dog i called my friend and told her to step outside to see one of the lights this one was this huge white light it was kind of steady but it still flashed on and off. when i called her and she stepped out side as soon as i asked her if she saw it the light went in another direction! she saw it too and was amazed! also i had two other people see it and they too were shocked and amazed sometimes there will be dozens of these lights spread out in the sky. a couple of weeks after i started seeing the lights, i saw a beautiful memorizing craft. again i was out walking my dog, and everytime i go walking or jogging i listen to music. well this night was a dark night and everything was so still and calm and i didn't notice this at the time but there was barely any cars going by in my neighborhood at all. so every house in my neighborhood have trees in the yards, and the houses are really tall and wide. so i'm walking and i see this white light coming from behind this house and one of the trees and it was very low so i freaked out because i thought a plane or something was about to crash (that's how low it was). so i took a couple of steps back and as it came across this craft was so long and the front was like no other i've ever seen before and the side was almost like a very distinctive check mark and the lights were these pretty blue lights and it was flying soooooo low, and barely made a sound, also the window of the front was very dark so i couldn't see inside. i wanted to get my phone out and take a video but something wouldn't let me do it. on down the road trying to get home i ran into my friend going in his house from practice and i asked if he could walk me home soo he did. but we ended up going jogging for a mile after we dropped off my dog and way off in the distance i saw the craft again! and he did too but it was far off in the distance. til this day i still see the lights off and on. i have a great nikon camera but it sucks cause it doesn't have night vision the guy from national ufo center wanted me to seen a video. but every sense then i had some strange dreams about what i saw and about people after me. about two weeks ago, woke up to this terrible back ache and i was just soo sick it was just so random for it to happen and then next day i was fine. i really don't know what to make of this at all. i really need help. this has just happen but in the past two nights not counting yesterday i saw three shooting stars. a couple of days ago my friend and eye wanted to go start gazing and see if we could catch something in the woods, and he too saw the strange lights and not only that but this small light appeared to drop out the sky and into the woods that i can not explain. \r\nagain i still til this day see strange lights and things in the sky, i'm being honest and truthful i just need help, please. thank you.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned

headlights seemed to be chasing elusive shadows cast against the desert sage as i drove through the dark moonless night towards congress, arizona.  retired now, a gold prospector with the time to fulfill my quest for the big nugget, my thoughts then were of gold and only gold���that was about to change.  just about midnight and just south of the middle of nowhere, i had stopped and pulled off the road to relieve myself and take a break from driving, and it was at this moment that i first saw what i thought to be a helicopter with a bright searchlight circling the area southwest of me.  having served with the u.S.A.F., i have seen many types of aircraft, but this was something i had never seen before. it was a red light intermittently beaming a brilliant, focused white light down to the ground as if to be looking for someone or something, and i thought what or who would be way out there, and why there were no strobe i.D. lights on the helicopter.  i didn���t give it much more thought and got back in the car and grabbed a cigarette, lit up and gazed back towards the southwest. the chopper was now circling closer to me and although my window was down, there was no noise���and i thought that was really strange.  suddenly, what i thought was a helicopter flying at 500 feet was much smaller and much closer; in fact, it was now just on the other side of the road and was about 10 feet off the ground, hovering. i flicked the cigarette out the window.  i rubbed my eyes in disbelief. am i hallucinating?\r\n     ���what the ____ is that?��� my heart beating fast and my mind spinning, i watched as the object as it moved through the sparse vegetation, stopping now and then to illuminate the ground beneath with its powerful beam of white light, and then it appeared to morph into two tiny red lights, like twin led���s (light emitting diodes) and started to cross the road towards me.  now as it approached my car, it suddenly morphed back into its former shape:  a spherical orb about the size of a softball, bright red (dot emergency red, like a tail-light).  was this military?  is this a living organism? perhaps an alien probe?  it was now six feet in front of my car, four feet off the ground, just hovering. what the ____is this thing???  somehow, i don���t think it���s military���no stars, insignia or guns���(chuckle)\r\ni noticed that although the red light emitted from this thing was very bright to my eyes, it wasn���t casting shadows and did not reflect from the surrounding bushes or from the polished surface of my hood.  i could see the surface of this thing seemed to be fluid-   like, and composed of what appeared to be millions of tiny dots of light swirling around very fast and was very hard for my eyes to focus on it.  the perimeter seemed to fuzz out at the edges, like an aura or halo.  the light seemed to be luminous rather than projected, and was not radiating any heat that i could feel. \r\n     it���s amazing what goes through your head when confronted with an un-known like this��� a memory of dr. xxxxxxx of  s.E.T.I. explaining that most ufo sightings are mostly swamp gas or weather balloons���hey doc!  here���s one that will fit right up your telescope!\r\n     at this moment, i was toying with the idea of getting out of my car to approach the orb and try to communicate with it.  \r\nsuddenly, the orb started to move a little closer to me, and my curiosity was overcome by fear��� i felt panic consume me and simultaneously engaged the engine and hit the lights.  the orb reacted by backing away slightly.  illuminated by my headlights, i could plainly see that there were no mechanical parts or structure. i slammed the gearshift into drive, and floored it.  i wanted to put as much distance between that thing and me as fast as possible.  i warily glanced in the rear-view mirror and was horrified to realize that it was pursuing me down the road at 90 mph.\r\ni grabbed my cell phone and hurriedly called 911.  no service.  i started laughing out loud.  who the hell would believe me if i reported being chased by a hovering, glowing red softball?  they would think i was drunk or stoned out of mind! \r\n     the little town of congress had already rolled up the sidewalks and turned off the lights, and not a soul stirring���well, it was 1:00 a.M. arizona time.  i decided to park in a vacant lot near the fire station right off the main highway. \r\n     for the next two or three hours, i watched odd lights moving through the dark moonless night.  i found that my eyesight had been affected by looking at the orb, and i could not focus on any bright light source. whatever i tried looking at seemed to move away into periphery. needless to say, i stayed parked there and tried my best to go to sleep and forget about what i had seen.\r\n     later, when i arrived home in california a couple of days later, i also noticed that my eyesight had not only been temporarily affected, but it had improved to some extent, and now can read small print without the use of my reading glasses.\r\n     i have shared this story with a few friends, but i notice that their eyes glaze over and i realize that they don���t believe what i saw.  if someone told me this story, i don���t think that i would believe it myself.  all said, i swear that this report is absolutely true and accurate to

i've worked third shift since 1984. my dad is a pilot, ive flown many hours with him in ga aircraft & have many airline miles under my belt. i'm an a&p mechanic & have worked on everything from light aircraft to business jets apart from my full time job at sikorsky. at sikorsky i work on all the hawk series (army & navy), s76, s92, ch53e, mh53e. ive been in aviation all my life & i know how aircraft look & sound in flight. \r\n one night on the way to work going down rt 25 thru trumbull & monroe there is a section of road that changes from a two lane to a divided highway & also crosses rt 111. there is a stoplight there before you get on to the highway part of rt 25 heading south. as i was stopped at the light heading south i noticed in the distance bright white lights. initially i thought it was an airliner low & slow which at the time would be very unusual. it was big. after proceeding thru the light the highway bends to the right a bit & as i rounded the curve i saw several cars pulled over & people out of their cars. it took me a couple of seconds to realize they were watching this object i thought was an airliner. as i was slowing down trying to watch this object in the sky & watch where i was going, i realized this was not any kind of normal aircraft. i pulled over & got out & as i watched closely i saw seven clusters of lights. red green & white in a chevron or boomerang pattern. at this time (late 80's) there had been rumors of ultralights flying at night trying to look like ufos & spook people. i thought maybe thats what it was since i realized it was flying too slow to be any kind of large aircraft. as it got closer i kept waiting to hear noise, jet noise, recip noise, wind thru the wires type of noise. nothing, totally silent. as it passed overhead ( approx 1000 ft) i would say the span was approx 200 -300 ft. thats when i really got scared. the weather was hot & humid at the time but you could see the stars. as the object passed overhead (still totally silent) it blocked out the stars & you could see a solid shape. this was not any formation flight of ultralights or small airplanes, this was big & silent. i think thats the only time in my life when i felt the hair on the back of my neck go up. it was moving a little faster than the northbound traffic on the other side of the highway maybe 70 -90 mph. as we watched it just slowly continued north until it was out of sight. i want to say some people had called in to the local radio station (wicc bridgeport) but i dont remember for sure. well, thats what i saw & thats the only one ive ever seen. i always thought it would be fantastic to meet et's or whatever but this experience scared me. it was a very strange thought provoking experience...

business and i went with him to deliver an order to 13000 farmington rd. livonia mi.  he attached the package to the front door and we left heading westbound on industrial rd.  at the corner we turned right and headed northbound on farmington rd.\r\n\r\ni was looking out the passenger door glass and from behind moving in a north-northwest direction some bright lights caught my eye and before it registered in my brain of what i was actually seeing, i blurted out to my father, \"dad, that plane is so low, i can see in the windows!!!\"  then i noticed the windows were slowly rotating around what appeared to be a disc shaped craft and i was totally confused.  another thing that had stuck in my mind was that each pane of glass had a blue tint near the frame and the color reminded me of a flourescent tube light bulb.  the craft remained to the right of our car, but it was moving faster and within a couple seconds my father could see it through the front windshield.  all excited he yelled, \"thats no plane, it's a flying saucer!  we stopped at the next corner which was schoolcraft rd and we watched it for about a 20 seconds. it crossed our path and changed direction and began to head west.\r\n\r\nmy dad had to go to the post office, so he turned eastbound on schoolcraft rd. out the back window, my eyes stayed glued to the object and i noticed the craft began circling back around and was heading east-southeast.  so i told my dad it's coming back and he accelerated the car to about 70mph but the craft was gaining ground on us fast.  we reached merriman rd and my dad turned right (southbound) and he tried to intercept the craft for a second time.  we weren't able to catch it so he stopped the car a couple hundred feet north of the c&o railroad crossing and we just watched it for about 5 minutes.  it circled the wonderland shopping center at middlebelt and plymouth rds, then proceeded toward downtown detroit.  another car had also stopped, but we did not talk to him, i wish we did.\r\n\r\nthe sky was very clear that night.  other then the windows, you could not make out any other features.  (i'm thinking back and maybe it was a new moon, and that's why i couldn't see anything but the windows).  i would estimate the speed at about 300 mph.  there was no sound.  i would estimate the size similar to a 707 airliner or maybe a little larger, although the windows were much bigger then on a typical airliner.  if you held a ruler at arms length, it would have measured about 4-1/2 inches across when it passed near the car.  it was not marsh gases either!\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object it was about 1000 feet off of my 4 o'clock position and about a 1000 feet high.  the upward viewing angle was close to 45 degrees.  by the time my dad saw it through the front windshield, it was about 500 feet off my 2 0'clock position and still flying at the same altitude.  at that time our upward viewing angle was about 60 degrees and it eventually crossed our path, maybe an 1/8 mile up the road.\r\n\r\nwhen the craft circled wonderland center the altitude was probably closer to 2500 to 3000 feet.\r\n\r\nit did not fly irratically.  it was very smooth.\r\n\r\nmy feelings were mixed, for as cool as it was, i was scared s***less.  i didn't have nightmares, but i was always watching my back for several years after.\r\n\r\nat school i remember telling my close friend ron a. about what occurred the night before.  he didn't believe me, but i guess that was expected.\r\n\r\ni'm a former graphic artist so i enclosed a map of livonia michigan which shows the ufo's flight path.  the story begins at the yellow circle and star.  the colors correspond to where the car was in relation to where the ufo was.  i also enclosed a computer generated illustration of the ufo.  if you size the ufo drawing on your monitor to 4-1/2 inches wide, that's about how big it appeared in the sky.  it was huge!\r\n\r\nif you have any information related to this ufo incident, or if the description is similar to another sighting, please let me know.\r\n\r\nthank you.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":27676,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.37413,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02052011-0008","longitude":-83.3454097,"occurred":-102634200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296911621000,"summary":"Low flying and slow moving ufo,  you could clearly see the windows rotate slowly around the disc shape.

to months and it's important to report it because you never know when it's going to be gone. that inspired me to make this report. \r\n  my wife came to me the begining of jan. this year. she works the graveyard shift at a world class hotel. she was telling me about this light she keeps seeing when she gets home in the morning. she gets home around 4:30 am. it's still very dark out. the sun has not yet begun to come up. we have had a sighting together before so when she came to me, i took her very serious. on one of her nights off about three weeks ago, we stayed up real late together and deciceded to go take a look. sure enough, it was there. at first glance it looks like a star. a bright star sitting exceptionally low in the sky. almost as if it's a light on the mountain line in the backround but, it's not. it's above the mountain line. when i saw it i thought, \"after what we've seen in the past why would she be so adimant about this?\" i went in the house and got my bionoculars. got it lined up and realized this thing was changing shape and color. it was moving really slow. the thing that got me was when we went in the house to get the bionoculars by the time we got back it had jumped in the sky an unreal distance. we were inside for mabey 3 min and had come back out to find that it had moved so far to the south and had raised up. gotten much higher. it was incredible. i don't have anything to see this thing up close. my bionoculars aren't the best but this has to be some kind of oddity. it's not there every night. it's not in the same spot every night. it's always in the same area but never the same spot so i know it's not a star. i know it's not a backround light. i can't identify this thing and would like your help figuring this out.\r\n  i didn't believe in this stuff until about a year and a half ago. my wife and were leaving a friends house at ten o'clock pm here in las vegas. we had our children and put them in the car to go home. as i was getting in the car we saw these ufo's coming over the hilltop. looked like something out of independence day film. they were so low to the mountain i couldn't believe my eyes. yhey started about 50 yards to my left, coming over the hill at maybey 15mph. not fast at all. i quickly grabbed my flashlight and started flashing them. one by one they came over the hill and the more that came over, the closer they got. by that i mean the 50 yards to the left was getting smaller and smaller. they were lining up with us. by the time they were inline with us one of them stopped over my car. it shined the scarriest, brightest light over our car. it was undescribeable. i just don't have the words. they were all completely silent. not a sound. absoloutely nothing. the ufo slowly took off after shutting the light off. i decided to follow it. we followed these things for about 20 miles into a residential area near henderson nv. i know what i'm saying sounds crazy but because of this, i'm a believer. my wife can confirm everything that i have said. she was with me for both these \"events\". i know i'm not crazy and i know these things are here. i just need your help to prove it. i appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you guys. thank you.","distance":"Over One

van for a moment and where just saying good night. we noticed a extremely brite light low in the sky and initially thought it mite be a star low on the horizon but realized it was to close to be a star but it was so brite. we just sat there watchging and discussing what it mite be because there was no sound and my friend used to work at an airport by a army depot that had planes, jets fly out of. he knew what kind of things that was flying at that time. after a long period of time 10-15 minutes the objet tilted up and the sun was just coming up. when this thing tilted we both could see the whole object and it shot right out there and flew around the moon in a matter of a second or two. this sighting happened when 3 mile island accident happened, that same day they or the gov't. finally found out the reactor was not going to blow. i feel this thing was checking on the nuclear accident and mite have had something to do with stopping an accident from happening. these sight seem to happen around nuclear site and mite have just been watching also. \r\n  it would be nice to know if any other people saw what my friend and i saw. i can draw a picture of this object if really need too. when the object tilted it traveled in the same way. the disc had a raised area in the middle of the upper part of the disc and in the center of this raised area there was a black round area. plus there where rectangular windows on the side of the raised area. my friend still does not want to talk about it. i finally got him to talk about it this past summer of 2010 and this happened back in 1979 and every body ws scared from 3 mile island. but it was really odd that 3 mile island was over that same day.\r\nthank you, *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg).","distance":"Over One

sights about this over the years.Me and my wife were on out way to louisiana to see our daughter in the early 90's.Somewhere between live oak  and talehassee fl we saw the ufo.We topped a hill on interstate 10.It was a long stretch going down hill.Off to our right and about a mile away i noticed these green lights moving from our right and angling toward us a little but moving to our left.They were over the tree line and like we were above them as we were higher up at top of this hill.Not a huge hill but for fl this was pretty high and very long.Think the road curved to the right at bottom.As i was driving down this long stretch i watched the craft until i could not see it because i was nearing the bottom of the hill and now the trees block it off.Suddenly there it was coming accross the road in front of us.I drove under it just as it entered the tree line on my left.I had my head tilted trying to see it better out the side window.Just as i was about to see the other side it disapeared as it moved above the trees on my left.It had what i remember as 6 green lights.They were green like the light on a key board.Not bright like a light bulb but just like on a keyboard.I zeroed in on one of the lights and see it was recessed and could see a rim and the lens was recessed in it.These lights where on the side that on aircraft has red lights.It made no sound and was so close to the tops of the trees it looked like it was almost hitting them.It moved at about the speed of a helicopter but it was so dark that night and i tried real hard to make out the shape of the object but could not make it out.The lights were 2 sets of three lights with both in the same pattern but the one to the right the same but a little higher.Kind of like a triangle with one light a little further apart and slightly cocked or tilted. three to the left and three to the right.Made me wonder at the time if it was two seperate objects or one object.It would probably be about the size of plane and bigger than a helicopter.I have seen lights just like this on ufo shows but always seem to be of another color than what we saw.I was so wraped up in what i was seeing that i never noticed that my wife was seeing it too.Just as it was out of sight my wife. suddenly said \"that was weird\".I told her baby we just saw a ufo.It surprised me that she noticed how unusal it was because she is not the type to reflect on stuff like that.We lived in loxahatchee fla and our house was directly under the landing pathway to the wpb airport.Always planes flying over our home constantly and we lived there 22 years and seeing planes dayly was a routine thing around our home.I was in the military transportations and was the coxswaine on a  mic 8 landing craft.I was always around planes and boats and ships.I know that planes and boats have port and starboad lights with one blinking or statinary white light.Red is on the left and green is on the right.To this day i still am up set that i did not see the lights on the other side.Will always wonder what color they would have been. i know what i saw and not sure if it was some military secret craft or something from who knows where.Just know it was definitly a ufo. i did not take notice of the day, year or month this happened.Just talked about it over the years with people.Just remember my grandson was maybe 2 or 3 years old and he is 21 now and in the air force.It was probably on a friday because we were on vacation.This actually happened and i know that these things exsist.Always wondered about this stuff and thought people were probably mistaking stuff.Now i know these things are real.0","distance":"21-100

(the mountain ridge that divides all of south bay area from the ocean)to back home from redwood city,ca.Wher we worked.\r\n\r\naround palo alto county on top of the mountain one can see both the bay area lit up at night (on the left side driving south) and the beach and ocean on the right. very few people if any comuted that far from the bay area at that time.\r\n\r\naround 1:00am on the ridge, we saw a large amber ball of light that came out of the pacific ocean at pescadero beach, ca north of santa cruz. it was a very clear night and could see the beach and waves (about 10 miles west from the road which is about 1,200' above sea level)\r\n\r\ni told my partner to pull over in a turn out (he was scared), and he would not. so i reached over and took the keys out of the ignition to turn off the engine, and so he had to pulled over, and we stopped with the front lights on.\r\n\r\ni jumped out of the car (1972 toyota landcruiser with a large spot light on top of the roof) excitedly waving my arms and jumping up and down to see what would happen as it moved closer to us and got larger and larger. my partner would not get out of the car and wanted to continue to go home.  \r\n\r\nthe amber large ball of light stopped in front of us with no sound (about 1,400-1,600' above see level and about 100 yards from us on the west side of the ridge (ocean side). i went to the car and jokingly ask my partner if we wanted to invite them for dinner. he said \"let's go home\". i decided to use the spot light on top of the roof and signal the object with an sos code ...---... of light.  at a complete stand still in front of us it responded by moving up and down, side to side, diagonally then came back to the same position (with no sound whatsoever) i repeated the signal many

sight.\r\n\r\nthat mourning i called the san jose mercury to ask some questions to a \"betty barnicle\" that would do reports of these things.  i asked her if anything happened that night, and she said there was a sighting and descibed the same strange object (large amber ball of light) aound the same time (i never told or described what we saw).  she said the report of this same object was in pheonix, ar. my question is what is in the ocean at pescadero beach that is incompasse by the deep monterey bay.  i have a couple more incidences happening that same month if you would like to contact me. most people i have written to say that is too old of a story or don't answer me.\r\n\r\ni flew every night in vietnam in a ov-1 mohawk for a year, and i know air craft, because i was stationed at hollowman air force base and would track us experimental air craft and could not reveal that until 10 years later.  i also knew the flight patterns of commercial air craft would go to san jose and sf airports.  this is a true but brief statements.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27669,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.9804271,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02052011-0001","longitude":-122.0247063,"occurred":206525400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296892864000,"summary":"Amber

was in florence, italy doing support missions for the bosnian war efforts.  two other wives and i had decided to join our husbands for a short visit, but first we were going to tour rome for four days prior to taking a train to where our husbands were.  i had decided to hire a young college student to housesit for me while out of the country and was in the process of \"interviewing\" her the evening of this particular sighting.  i had concluded our interview and was walking her to her car that was parked in my driveway.  it was a nice spring evening, lots of stars and lots of lights in the nearby distance of moreno valley which was about 7 miles from my home.  i should also mention here that this location is approximately 5 miles from march air force base in southern california.  anyway, as we were saying our goodbyes, movement in the sky to my left caught the corner of my eye and what i saw took my breath away....What i saw was an object enormous in size (the size of a football field)in the shape of a triangle with three red steady lights one at each point, moving very slowly and making no sound that i could detect at first....As it moved overhead, i could detect a \"humming\" sound.  this was nothing remotely close to anything we have aviation wise on this planet.  \r\n\r\ni was completely mesermized, as was this young gal.  we both saw it and kept our eyes on it as it seemingly \"floated\" over my home towards the hills and mountain range behind my home.  it literally blocked out the evening sky and stars as it went over the house.  i said to the student, \"you saw that right?\"  she confirmed that she did and seemed as unsettled as i was about this sighting.  \r\n\r\nlater when i related this story to my husband, his tendancy was to blow it off as a \"blimp\", a stealth fighter...Etc.  there was no convincing him otherwise. i eventually gave up trying to convince anyone that this was a real ufo and let it fade into memory.  but let me tell you, i was born and raised in the air force and have had a love affair with aviation all my life, so when this happened, i knew it was out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nin the past few years there has been more and more sightings of unusual objects with a lot of media attention paid to these stories instead of being reported as hoaxes.  on more than one of these programs other people have witnessed the same type of craft i am describing here.  i finally don't feel so alone in this....\r\n\r\ni wish i could remember the name of the student i hired to housesit for me, but she did such a horrible job of taking care of my animals and home that i wanted to put her out of mind as soon as possible.  \r\n\r\nthis has been cleansing...Thank you for providing a means for venting.

turned and went inside and refused to come out until it was gone. i was at a loss because i know what it resembled but it was dark and i could not make out the edges clearly because the color was either black or reflective and it reflected the night sky giving it a black appearance. but i could tell that it was triangular in shape because i saw its rear and it had four huge lights that glowed orange kind of like a jet turban. i had seen pictures of an aircraft that is rather large known as the stealth blimp. at the same time though this craft was a good deal larger than the descriptions i have read about the stealth blimp but i do not dismiss the idea that it was not. the object moved slow enough to be a blimp and seemed to be just cruising. i watched it for about three to four minutes when i lost site of it due to obstructions in town. it appeared to be as large as a super center parking lot and maybe four stories in height. my feelings on the subject was and still is indifferent, i know what i saw but i could not say with out conviction that it was absolutely not of this world. i had no camera except for my telephone and it was useless at night. my only witness to the event refused to stay and witness it. i know not if it was observed by anyone else but i did see a couple of car that was diving down walnut continue driving like nothing was there and passed right underneath it. this was also a way to get a reference of its size. when the whole craft came into view and a car drove under it at the speed limit of 35 mph it too a couple of seconds to be clear of it, i counted 2 and almost 3 seconds and at 52 feet a second i gathered it to be approximately 300 feet long give or take a few.

window just hovering but now i know what i saw was an alien.  at the time i saw a skelital head with big eyes, but after the years and knowing what i know and have seen it had to be alien.  i was 7 at the time (i am now 61) and was so scared i woke my brother and we ran to my parrents room.  when dad went to check our room it was gone.  being on the 3rd floor of the building has always bothered me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27658,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3774099,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-02042011-0019","longitude":-71.1000028,"occurred":-416419200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296886329000,"summary":"Saw

beautiful sunset on my way home. through the trees the magnitude of brightness the sun was producing struck me as odd, i thought to myself \"wow the sun is big tonight\". as i rounded the corner the sun came into center view. it looked like it was on fire. i rubbed my eyes a bit and tried to focus, to make sure i was really seeing the sun that way, grabbed my glasses and realized i wasn���t seeing things, the sun really did look like a ball of fire. so i pulled my car over and began taking pictures with my iphone from my car window. i remembered i had my camera in my bag so i got out of the car and stood on the guardrail and snapped away with my cannon power shot. after several minutes i got in my car and drove a bit farther down the road to get a different angle on the picture and began to shoot again. i was so proud of my sunset pictures; i had never seen anything like that before. i showed friends, everyone amazed by the sun. today i was uploading to my computer, and began inspecting the pictures more carefully and came to find several objects or smudges in the images. you can see all the photos taken at *(link moved to additional evidence section -- cms/sg).I hope someone analyzes these pictures, because i really do not know what i captured, but there is something there. \r\ni have lived within flight patterns for both bwi and national my entire life, i can pick the planes out in the pictures, and it is the other objects i am unsure of.\r\n
