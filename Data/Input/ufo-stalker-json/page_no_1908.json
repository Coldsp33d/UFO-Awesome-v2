southwest between west chester pa and marshalltown pa on route 162 around10 pm on our way to a party in downingtown pa.About a mile outside west chester while coming over a crest of a hill i could see approximately 1/2 half mile away what looked like 3 small red lights in the sky they caught my eye immediately because i could tell that they were hovering in one spot.I pointed the lights out to *(name deleted--cms/sg)and she seen them immediately because from our initial viewpoint they were almost directly in front of us. i knew immediately that something was  because in my early twenties i had taken a proximately 5 airplane flight lessons in small planes and knew a small plane cannot stay stationary .*(name deleted--cms/sg) and i continued driving and got closer to where the lights were we could distinguish that  the three lights seem to be a black triangle with the three red lights at each edge.We rode to a spot approximately 400 yards to the right of the object,we stopped the car 50 feet right before a little bridge that runs over  a part of the brandywine creek.The object was also directly over the brandywine creek and tree line a place i had known  and fished  at  maybe 100 times since my childhood.*(name deleted--cms/sg)and exited my car and stood on route 162 for about 5 minutes watching the object.After about 5 minutes the three lights rotated very slowly clockwise and started moving to about 200 yards to our left and about 100 yards in the air.Kim and i both said we thought we seen a black triangle with three red lights,the sky was clear and beautiful that night.The craft slowly headed back toward west chester flying over farm fields along route 162.We got back in the car and turned the car back going east north-east on route162 back toward west chester pa.We could clearly see the object we heard no noise from it the whole time,it was moving very  stable and smooth very controlled it seemed.We rode for the 3/4 mile until we had to climb the small hill that from where we had first viewed the object but coming from the opposite direction    when we crested the hill the object had completely disappeared before flying directly over my hometown of west chester.We were baffled more because we were right behind the craft and thought we would be able to see it fly over the town  but it now had completely disappeared from the sky.We continued on to the party in downingtown pa,reaching there by 11pm.When we got to the party we told several people and they all laughed.I was a little more   perplexed by the event and  at approximately   11-30 pm called from sister of my girlfriend  the pa state police barrack in embreville pa. which is on the same route 162 about 3 miles from where we seen the object.I was surprised to hear from the state police dispatcher     that they had received about twenty calls before mine of mysteriously lights in peoples backyards in the area that night.Later that night after *(name deleted--cms/sg)and i had returned home and were in bed *(name deleted--cms/sg)told to me that she was scarred because from the time of her life from 8-15 she had seen small creatures come to her window and had seen bright lights in her yard many times.This is really strange because *(name deleted--cms/sg)grew up in a house that was 5 miles away on the same route 162 we had just witnessed the object on. at the the time of the incident i was working  in new castle delaware as an investment banker.My office was in the same complex as newcastle airport  .I had cultivated a young aircraft engineer that worked in an office across the complex from mine as an investor and we became friends.My investor had told me previously that he was helping to develop the military's top secret silent helicopters and that some prototypes of their technology were actually at new castle airport.I related to the engineer my story,the engineer told me that at the distance that i had experienced the object that if it were his helicopter that we would have heard it,yet we experienced no sound even while outside the car and no atmospheric disturbance at all

through my curtains. i have seen this flash since, but this was the first time it had happened, consequently i looked out of my window after hastily lifting up the curtain. my eyes were immediately drawn to directly above the opposite houses beyond the garden and end of my road. \r\nthere seemed to be a bright white light that looked as if it was climbing up in the air, making me originally think it was a plane because they often fly over my house and there can be more than one at any time. i wasn't alerted by it at this point because i was thinking it was a plane, until i realised that i should be hearing the engine noise at that time. i became interested and watched it carefully.\r\nit didn't do anything dramatic and it acted very much like a plane. then another light lit up directly behind it,(there was a gap between them).\r\nit was then that i also noticed a plane coming in from my left and i realised the first object's flight path crossed over the plane's. the first object passed right in front of the plane but i'm not sure if they were at the same altitude. once past the plane, the light went out and i came to the conclusion that it wasn't plane due to the fact i could easily see the outline of the plane from the left and i couldn't see an outline from the light.\r\nthe second bright light passed just behind the plane before also going out suddenly. during all this i was incredibly intrigued and once they had both gone out i was left with a shock. i haven't seen anything like this before or since. i told a couple family members but they said others would have seen something like that, but i doubt many people would be awake and looking at the skies at 7 in the morning.","distance":"101-500

was a heavy cloud cover, so knew that no stars or moon would be visible.  i could hear the sound of a helicopter, but these objects did not appear to be helicopters at first sight.  i was looking through binoculars. as i scanned the sky to see what was going on, off to my right, among the trees, i saw a disc shaped, dull gray craft - totally silent and stationary, no lights, no sound, with circles of the same color running around the edge. i couldn't tell if the circles were windows or some sort of marking as nothing was lit up.  i called my son, who is 49 years old and lives with me, to see if he could verify what i was seeing.  i called 911 to report this and told them i just wanted to let them know what i was seeing in case any other calls came in. i was totally surprised by my reaction and the emotional state i was in.  i'm a rational, clear thinking person and make any judgements based on facts as i see them.  i work for the federal government and with an office full of attorneys, so i deal with facts all day long. i fell apart and could hardly talk to the 911 operator. all i could say was, \"oh, god, oh god, oh god!\" i managed to convey what i was looking at and the 911 operator was kind and made sure i stayed on the line. i knew, however, that i was being humored. they wanted to send the police to my home, but i asked them not to because i didn't want to alarm the neighbors. of course, the police came anyway.  they stated that there had been a bad traffic accident and the two bright lights in the sky were police helicopters.  i told them, however, that did not explain the disc shaped object in the trees.\r\n\r\nthis sighting happened in only a matter of five minutes or so. when i moved the binoculars from the disc back to the helicopters and back to the disc again - the disc had disappeard.  i discounted the fact that what i was seeing might have been some of the lenticular clouds the area around mt. rainier is famous for as the cloud cover was moving rather quickly to the northeast and the object i was observing was absolutely still and not moving at all. \r\n\r\nmy lingering question is was the disc observing the helicopters?  were the helicopters aware of the disc?  did the disc cause the accident?  i guess i'll never know.  i feel that i need to further explain myself to the local police so they won't discount me as some unbalanced person, but i'm afraid that if i do that, it will only make matters worse.  how does a person defend themselves in this kind of situation?  why do i feel that i have to defend myself?  i know what i saw.

tractor was kept in large quansit barn 80' wide x 200' long, and 25 ' tall. i went inside opened the large rollup door on the north side, drove tractor through the door turned east then south driving alongside the barn, when i reached the southeast corner and could see across the 40 acre field, i saw somthing across the field in the southwest corner and it was below the treeline trees in that area along the boundry of the field are approx 40 -50 ft. tall.\r\n\r\ni began reacting very irrationally fearful, angry, and began shaking my fists and shouting at what i was seeing while the tractor was still moving forward, i think about that time i put it in neutral as i rember wanting to jump off of the tractor,(i dont think i did though,\r\n\r\nthe thing is i could not put a name to what i was seeing, what i am trying to relate to you here is there was no picture in my mind that could relate to understand what i was seeing,(very freaky)\r\n\r\nanyway while all of this was going on in my mind, i kept my eye on it.\r\n\r\nbtw i remember that it was large, i mean this is a forty acre field and this thing was big. well next thing that happend is that the craft began coming up as though it was a plane coming out of a stall, it begsn to rotate with the cockpit facing me and i actually have a picture in my head of the pilots helmet that i could see through the canopy.\r\n\r\ntime kinda stood still in a way for a moment there as i looked at him and i felt that he was looking at me (eye to eye, contact) weird didn't feel right, i dont remember watching it fly off i just kind of lost contact with the pilot, maybe that's when i jumped off of the tractor and went back inside to calm down.\r\n\r\nat the time i called my pop and told him that a military jet must have almost crashed doing some kind of a stall maneuver over one of our fields,\r\nbut was able to pull itself out of the stall and had not crashed.\r\n\r\nso now 27 years have passed and i began to re think about this event again i now have a few questions.\r\n\r\nwhy could i not recognzse that it was a plane even if it was upside down?\r\ncould a plane really survive a stall that low to the ground,(it was below the treeline i mentioned above) and if it could why dont i remember any large amount of energy being expended to lift itself out of the stall?\r\n\r\none of the questions that really freaks me out is, what are the odds that exactly at the time i saw it was it at that perfect position in the stall that it appeared to me as it was motionless, i.E. hovering,\r\nwhy did that pilot canopy and his helmet be so clear to me i mean what about the rest of the plane why cant i rember anything about that, the wings jet engines etc.I do seem to rember everything being black though.\r\n\r\nas far as hearing it, well i have written that off because of the building i went into to get the tractor and then the noise of the tractor engine.\r\n\r\ni have looked for other stories similar to this one but can't find any maybe you guys have and that's one of the reasons for wrighting this, maybe someone else has had an experience similar to this.\r\n\r\nbtw the area i was in at that time is very sparsley populated, the next closest home is a couple of miles away and i believe that they were thinking that no one would be around as i got the feeling at that time that they were just as supprised to see me as i was to see them.\r\n\r\nhope to hear back from someone on this.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\njd","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

in a circular motion. and go back to the same spot. then it would move up in the sky and move down in the sky. then it would go right back to the same spot it was. it was kind of hard to tell exactly what shape it was. but the best discription is that i can give is that it was like a circle, but a star-like with some type of redish greenish color to it. when i saw this object i went to get my brother inlaw to show him. but at first he thought i was joking and didn't want to come and see. so i went back to see if it was still there and it was. i then again went and got him and covinced him to take a look. he saw the exact same thing i was looking at and told me to get the video camera. and he filmed it. it looks kinda small on the video but it looked pretty far off in the distnace too. we stopped flming it. it disapeard over the appartment out of our site. so i came to the computer to see how to report a ufo siting. and here i am telling you my story. when i first seen the object i really wasn't shocked or anything like that. i just thought i was going crazy and thought i was seeing things until my brother inlaw saw exactly what i was seeing. after that i was kinda excited. the only thing that i would like out of this whole expeiance is to find out what i was actually looking at. i did not have time yet to down load the video yet. if you would like to see the video i will send it when asked for it. thank you for your time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:22:14","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

as i am only a few miles away from phoenix sky harbor international airport. i see planes come and go all day, as they tend to fly right over me. therefore, when this object caught my eye, my initial reaction was to coordinate the visible object to a plane. or at least convince myself it was just a very bright street lamp-  i also have a lovely view of a freeway. however, it just didn���t look the same. it stood out. i knew in my heart it was neither a light nor a plane, which is why i couldn���t keep my eye off that ���thing��� in the sky. \r\n\r\nit was stationary at first and about the same height as the freeway lights- but something made me keep staring. it then descended, which made me alert. i could still barely see it underneath the bridge of the highway. because it descended in the direction of the airport, i told myself it was a plane. yet for some reason, i still couldn���t peel my eyes away from the sky. i went to get my cell phone, and when i looked back up- the object was back up in the air! it was then i ran and got my camera- a canon powershot  sx20. \r\n\r\ni zoomed in as much as possible. i noticed it gradually going down to the ground again, only this time it was heading (my left) of the airport. almost as though it knew i was taking pictures so it went to hide, because it was stationary until my photoshoot began. it was then i fully realized this was no plane- for planes cant fly like that! they cant go down, then back up, and then down to the side! furthermore, it was extremely quiet- too quiet. i only got a few good pictures because my camera couldn���t keep good focus��� but the ones i did get��� wow. unlike anything i have ever witnessed. this was real. \r\n","distance":"Over One

1945 hrs, i noticed that from the nw a orange/red/white orb was approaching with no flashing lights at low altitude. it was moving to quickly to observe through the telescope, and too slow to be anything else so i just watched it. as it was heading towards the santa cruz mountains it turned and started moving south as if it was following the highway 85 path. i then noticed that another one that looked the same was approaching it from the south. when the second reached close proximity to the first it turned around and they both headed south. maybe 10-15 seconds later, a third appeared over the same area as last night (near the quarry close to cupertino). it came from the nw (same direction the first one came from). it didn't stop and hover, it just kept on it's path and moved towards the santa cruz mountains and disappeared. at this point, all three were out of my sight. i informed my hubby of what i was seeing, but he hurt his knee at work, so he just stayed inside tonight.\r\n\r\n(now, after i filed a report with mufon last night, i went back out and noticed that the triangle had reappeared over the mountains and just hovered there. it kinda moved a bit to the west, but generally stayed in that area.)\r\n\r\nat about 2030 hrs tonight, i went back outside and noticed that two lights appeared in the same area of the santa cruz mountains as the one did last night at 2230 hrs. i watched these two lights and noticed that they were moving a bit also but just as before, generally stayed in the same area. just now, (2145 hrs) i was watching the two lights, and suddenly a third appeared and a few seconds later, a fourth also appeared to the naked eye. they were all lined up next to each other in a row, but not equally spaced. i went inside to get my telescope again and when i came back out i saw the lights go off on two of them. i set up and was able to see that the two left each had two white lights like headlights on a vehicle. this was from my advantage point though so people from another viewpoint might have a better description of them.\r\n\r\nthe two left didn't seem to be moving too much so i gave up and came back in. as usual i wasn't scared of them, just curious and hoping they would do something so i would have a better view. since sundown, there have been so many planes and helicopters in the affected areas. before all this started, there were planes and such flying in the area, but never like this. i wonder if this is a \"cat and mouse\" game the objects are playing now with the military. if so, it's kinda funny. i think this weekend, i will camp outside and have video & digital cameras set up as well as my tele. i'll keep everyone informed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

over to another friends car.For some unknown reason i was told to look up,i was by myself,no one close to me.What ever it was,it said,look up we are real.When i looked up,i saw two bright dots,brighter than the back ground stars.One was higher than the other and the other was down and to the back of the other.They where going very fast.They went straight.I did not have time to ask my friends did you see them.It seems they came in the same line as from the airport,bwi now.I have been at the same spot for many years.Just to see if it was a plane or planes,with running lights.After years of watching,i have not seen the lights like i saw.As a kid i loved watching planes go by.They did not twinkel.It was a steady light.Did not shift colors.I have told people about this,they all said it was a plane.After seeing them my thoughts about other peoples from other planets just might be true.I still get a good feeling about what happened to me.I broke my back some years ago,had a lot of time to think about things.I have some memories of something happened as a kid of about 6 years old.I was sleeping with my father,this id not happen offen.I woke up in the middle of the night,it was warm,look out of the window,i saw a bright light of many colors going up out of our back yard.I swear it looked like  across.I woke my father up and told him something just flew up out of the yard.He got up on one arm and looked out the window,but it was gone.I told him it was there.He told me to go back to sleep,it was just the goodyear blimp.This was about 1951,1952.This was late at night,and i think it was before the blimp.I have heard many storys from people over the years,of what they have seen.I feel better telling you my story.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27629,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.2977448,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032011-0010","longitude":-76.6025993,"occurred":-109616400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296767327000,"summary":"It

everyone's attention was on obamas state of the union speech that very night so here i go.\r\n  \r\ni saw this  object for two hours the same exact time president��������� barack obama was giving his state of the union speech ..I heard choppers and jets fly��������� right over my house but couldn't see them. this object stayed in the same position about a 1/2 hour, and then moved over the same area of maryland dc and va.. the lights red and green turquoise where very foreign to that air space and where pulsating around almost like a circle shape. thats the only way i could describe them.. . the lights seemed to moved around this object then stop to one solid light and then pulsate again to this green turquoise light that glowed a emerald green that was beautiful. every plane that moved towards it double back around the same direction it came from. it seemed to stop the flow of air traffic/space movement..\r\n\r\ni watched out the same window for 13 years and have monitored the flow of air traffic to and from the ronald reagan airport. i have also have worked fueling planes for that same airport and sort of know the light patterns of planes at night..These light where something very different indeed. i was so excited and nervous at the same time i called up my kids 7-19 years of age to verify what i thought or was a ufo. their reaction was the same as mine. i gave them no suggestive thought but only to look out the window and describe what the saw. their response was immediate \"what in the heck is that\". my 14 year old son was the one that noticed how the planes seemed to be turning around in the same direction they where coming from almost-waiting for permission to cross that quarantined air space. \r\n\r\nafter around two hrs i went to answer a call and when i returned the strange light where gone. the air traffic eventually returned to normal and i retired for the night. the next morning i check the web to see if any other have seen these light but got no hits..Later that day my son called me and said \" dad someone else have recorded what we have seen and posted it on you-tube\". my reaction was immediately searching for that video, which i found and this person described the same-thing i saw that night to the letter..The quality of the camera was not that great but i was happy someone else saw and verified.\r\n\r\nyou can check out the video and comments by others in that area who left their account on what happened that night of the obama sate of the union speech..\r\n\r\ni have posted the youtube link below check it out for

haunts us. i will do the best that i can to describe it.  1978,sierra vista-ft. huachuca; we were watching tv in the late evening when a very loud machine(not an engine not a motor)hovered directly over our house. it's so hard to describe a sound that you have never heard before or since. there were two different sounds. one was a constant hum, low in tone and loud; but soft not deafening like a e-a6b. the other was rotating counter-clockwise higher in pitch. the closest thing i can associate it with is a hula hoop; but, it wasn't a steal ball (or bearing) rolling.  more like a metal scrapping.  we looked at each other, jumped up ran to the door and it was gone!  the neighbors ran outside too. there was nothing out there. no traces of sound, light, vehicle--nothing. the whole thing lasted 10-12 seconds.  the most disturbing thing about it was that we had this sensation (not quite a vibration, closer to fuzzy) feeling. and we new some how they were watching us. i've read a lot of stories. everyone describes lights and no sound. there was no light.  it was dark outside. if there was a light we would have seen it. i read about this one women that thought she had been scanned. i believe that.  it's the only thing that makes sense. i have lived next to military bases all my life(50years). for the last 30 years, i have lived under the flight path. i can sometimes wave to these pilots they are so close. nothing like this! and there is nothing that appears and disappears that fast.
