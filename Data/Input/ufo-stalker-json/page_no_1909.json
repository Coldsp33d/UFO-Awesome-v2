(these photos will be emailed to a mufon investigator when i get them later today.) meanwhile, about 5-10 minutes into our drive towards the wawa in charlotte hall, we observed three of the same orbs in a triangular formation about halfway up the size of a cell phone tower like this one *(link moved to additional evidence section--cms/sg) in the sky. these objects then exhibited the odd behavior of producing smaller red lights that, then floated up into the sky. after this, the objects dissapeared one after another. (another friend in another place in the county was observing the same object and reported them to dissapear at the same time i saw my glowboys dissapear.) at least 5 people witnessed this event from different locations. when we returned to my house, we proceeded in photographing the inital object we saw. i did not lose sight of the object, as last time, and ended up just going to bed a few hours later. i can provide names and contact information of the other witnesses, as they would be glad to validate this claim.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

was very clear and the stars were very bright. one star looked extra bright so i got the binoculars and looked at the star. it started to change shape and color. \r\nthree distinct shapes it made are:\r\n1.\tjellyfish with long dangling tentacles reaching earthward.\r\n2.\ta large round shaped diamond with red lights around the perimeter and over the top surface of the diamond.\r\n3.\ta face with eyes and a mouth that moved as if speaking and the expression seemed stern.\r\nthe star object continued to change shape and moved further away and came closer to earth. it seemed to move with the earth���s rotation in a westward direction. \r\nthere was a second star in the west out over our marsh area and it was much closer to the earth and had a dimmer light shining from it than the first star described here. it also appeared to change its shape when viewed through binoculars. this object moved closer to the first star in a south east direction.\r\nmy mom, dad and sister viewed the stars and i called into the marinette sheriff���s department. they sent an officer over to investigate. he thought it was something but could not determine what it was.\r\nat times the object looked web like or faceted like a diamond with a hole in the center. it would change into a disk like figure and tip to the side so that one would see the edge as if looking at the edge of a coin.  it had white and blue and red lights around its perimeter that moved and changed.\r\ni have not heard of any weather satellites that change colors and shapes.\r\nlast summer, 2010 my mother and i viewed a ufo hovering just above the tree tops over our pond and marsh area. there are no houses in that area for miles and no one ever goes into the marsh. it is to the west of our home. it was oval shaped and had white lights all around the edge. it danced and tipped itself on edge and the lights changed colors of white, red and blue. it shot a white beam of light just over my head as i was standing outside viewing it. i noticed it at about the same time and for the same length of time.  it had numerous claw-like feet around the edge of the oval shape that looked like landing feet. they were not sharp but flat and shaped like a gold bar with a half gold bar size and shape for the under joint foot pad part. it seemed to be white in color or silver white.\r\nthe odd thing is that our satellite tv and internet were not working. it was a clear night and there should not have been any disturbances from the

over my house. (mufon report #27109) since then, i have been watching the sky hoping to see it again, and to have a witness this time.\r\n\r\nmonday night at 2110 hrs i was on my front porch having a cigarette and spotted this white light in the area that appeared to be above cupertino, ca about 5-7 miles away. i noticed that this was in no way a plane, chopper, or star and just watched it. i looked away for about two minutes, and when i looked back, it was gone.\r\n\r\nlast night, i went out front again at the same time, and there it was again. this time, it looked to be in the same area, but about 1/2 mile south from first location. this time i wanted to know for sure what it was and was going to get my telescope out and check. right then this strange guy came walking through my complex and started checking out cars, so out of safety i focused on him and alerted my husband. we were concentrating on this guy for about four minutes and when i remembered about the light i looked back up and it was gone.\r\n\r\nthat brings us to tonight. at about 1800 hrs i was on my back patio and noticed alot of military choppers flying around. i wondered if my friend was back, but blew it off. \r\n\r\ni went out front at 2050 hrs and you got it... there it was again. this time i was not going to let it get away. i got my telescope out right away and focused on it. i couldn't believe it. i was looking at a triangle/\"v\" with red and white lights on it. i called *(name removed--cms/sg) (my hubby) to look at it and be my witness and verify that i am not turing into some kind of ufo junky. he couldn't believe what he was seeing. he said that he was also seeing the triangle/\"v\" with the red, and white lights. he said he also saw amber lights on it. we are 100% sure of what we saw. i kept it on the scope and we just kept taking turns looking at it. he tried taking pictures of it on his camera, but with the low battery and trying to get it through the tele, he doesn't believe he captured it, just a blur. (he will check pics 2/3/11) both *(name removed--cms/sg and i are able to draw detailed pictures, scan them, and email them if mufon is interested. it didn't seem to be moving at all, just hovering about the cupertino area. during all this, helicopters seemed to be flying over it, right by it, and just staying near the object.\r\n\r\nat 2109 hrs the lights turned off and was not viewable with the naked eye. however, i was still able to see it clearly through the tele. i watched it until about 2115 hrs when i gave up because it seemed to be moving toward the south (ocean) and was only a blurry blob on the tele.\r\n\r\ni came back in and saw that [name removed cms/dr] was already sketching what he saw onto paper. i then sketched what i saw right underneath it. after that i kept looking out the window to see if i could get lucky twice in the same night. at 2130 hrs i noticed two helicopters flying fast overhead from the santa cruz mountains towards moffit field. i heard them and within a second of each other they turned their lights on. why did they have their lights off before this point of flight? they were making a mad dash back to the base. were they chasing the object? i found that interesting. i watched for another minute or two when two more choppers came out of nowhere and went to the area where the object was hanging out. i think the military was chasing it and investigating whatever it was. \r\n\r\nsince this was the third night in a row, is it going to come back tomorrow? i hope so! i will have the batteries charged for the camera, and my video camera. i will keep you all posted. for any of you who are curious, i live near good samaritan hosp, so from that area, start looking at around 8:45 pm towards cupertino. i am hoping to see it appear as i have missed it's great entrance for the third time in a row.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":27620,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.296637,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032011-0001","longitude":-121.9393793,"occurred":1296633600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296724612000,"summary":"3rd night of triangle sighting, same location & time","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"San Jose, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:73375"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Amboy","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was helping guide a motorcycle trip and taking photos of the riders, shortly before amboy ca, which is a pretty sparsely populated area. i took a bunch of pictures, and was viewing them to add to our website today. this is the first time i noticed the anomaly in the upper right hand corner.\r\n\r\ni have a raw version of this photo, quite large and unaltered in any way. this is the only photo where the object appears and i thought it interesting as it has motion blur and is in the distance. i did not see it at the time as i was focused on the subject, but it looks an awful lot to me like a moving oval object off in the distance - an airplane would not blur this way.\r\n\r\ni am a professional photographer.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":27619,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.5604521,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02022011-0015","longitude":-115.7382111,"occurred":1279436400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296715576000,"summary":"Took this photograph and did not look at it closely until today. check out the upper right hand corner.

of us.. all 5 of us. we were going faster down the channel when it came to a halt- the craft.. there were small aliens standing next to like a small cave where a small channel of water went down. they were motioning us to go in. i remember them trying to pull me in. evidently everyone else was pulled in but they were trying to pull me. i remember them talking to me in my mind and i remember them being really strong and taking a hold of me thrusting me back. i gave it all i had by fighting and i was making them mad. i felt lifeless as they just pulled me in. i know they knew everyone of my thoughts. big headed and ugly but had quite a sense of humor about them they were letting us know that they were waiting for us.\r\nmy husband told me that after writing this he calmed back down and tried to fall asleep. he got up early that morning finding my 10 year old son telling him that he saw a big oval shaped light in our back field around 6am. my son told my husband that it was bright

keeping the lights in frame as they were also quite low, and view was often obstructed by trees. so i got my ladder and went on my roof to film. i sat in awe watching and filming the amber/orange colored orbs for next 17 minutes until they began to change shape, almost appearing like a helicopter before flying away one by one. i uploaded my video to youtube right away that same night.\r\naround 30 minutes after the last orb vanished into the night, two helicopters (i assume police) began to sweep the area in the direction they were headed as they disappeared. this sweep

five minutes when my call was disconected suddendly. i stood up to put my cig. out when i noticed a bright light up in the sky. i stared at it to see if it was moving or questioning if it was just a street light. then i noticed this very bright light was moving rather slow. as it got closer i was then trying to figure out if it was an airplane but it wasn't an airplane at all. the lights were too bright to be an airplane and it was flying too low. i thought an airplane wouldn't be flying that low. as it passed by me appox. (the same height as an airplane) it passed slow but it took about  a minute to pass before the building obstructed my view. it had greenish blueish white lights on the front shaped like a v but appeared to also be circular on the sides. it passed slow and the sound coming from it was a humming sound. only way i know how to discribe it. when i first noticed it i thought it cant be a street light because it's too high and it cant be a plane because it's too low and lights are too bright. my feelings were omg it's a ufo spaceship & i reached for my cell phone to take a picture of it but it wasn't on me i was using the land line. then i realized that may have been the reason my call was disconnected (my calls have never been disconected like this before) i went inside the condo to wake my adult daughter & let her know what i had seen and wanted her to see it from her bedroom window. by the time she saw it, it was already up higher in the sky hovering over one area & it appeared to be north from me. i decided to call 911 to find out if there were other reports made about this and the dispatcher said no one else had called to report anything about this. i thought it irather strange that no one else would call to inquire about it because the lightss were so bright and (it is my assumption that it was flying too low to be an airplane) finelly around 2:am we lost sight of it and no longer hovering in the sky. wow this was trippy. i didn't feel scared or nervous but felt more of a sense of disbelief of what i was seeing. when i called 911 it was then (as i was discribing it) that i began to feel more shook up. i am so glad my daughter found this web site. i needed confirmation of what i saw by reading other reports here about the same object with the same lights was real and true  by knowing someone else saw it did set my mind at ease knowing i wasn't immagining this.

approaching with a steady motion along a straight line in my general direction. when it got to about a 45 degree angle above the horizon, it continued to move slowly but changed course moving to my left. at the same time the light slowly went out while maintaing the same intensity.  it was like i was looking at a bright fuzzy surface that maintained it's intensity and the amount of surface i was watching slowly went to zero.  at this point i could just make out a faint small oval shape that continued moving to the left. after traveling a total distance of about 20 degrees to the left, it changed course again and continued slowly moving away from me.  it finally was obscured by the  roof of a building about 100 yards to my east. there are really tall mountains to the east that go way above the roof of this building, so it had to be betwwen me and the mountains. total duration was about 5 minutes.  my wife has seen military flares and was certain this was not a flare.  she said flares don't make u-turns.  the head lights and running lights of airplanes are usually not orange. the intensity was greater than any airplane headlights i have observed and there was no discernable aircraft engine noise. there must have been other witnesses. i could hear a lot of neighberhood fireworks.  maybe the occupants wanted a better view of the fireworks :-) i regret not thinking to

decade of having coffee without artificial lighting so we can enjoy the stars when possible or perhaps an occasional owl.  we sit typically for about 20-30 minutes around 5:30am before getting ready for work. we sit at a window overlooking a man-made pond and greenbelt beyond that. we know what to expect to see of our wintertime north-facing sky and terrain.\r\n\r\nthis morning we saw a very bright, planet-like, light in the northwest sky which reflected in the pond. it had a periodic reddish/orange light and what seemed to be an occasional faint aqua-colored light. we assumed it was a plane enroute to seatac airport, but it never moved. we also considered that perhaps it was a plane moving away from us on a direct bearing towards the northwest.  what made no sense to us was why we would be able to detect a red light at such a distance for so long a time.  either it should fade away as it left or land at seatac, but a red light could not possibly stay the same; it would have been enormous at such a long distance had it been moving away from us, and unlike any planes we've ever seen with their running lights. \r\n\r\nwe drank two cups of coffee and still it seemed not to have moved.  by about 5:50ish we realized that it had dropped a little towards the horizon and was positioned more centrally north.  we were able to look at it through binoculars the whole time, but never saw a solid object, only the lights.\r\n\r\ni wished that i could have stayed with it to watch it as the sun came up, but we had to get ready for work. by the time i left today at 6:20am, it was still there. my husband has an engineering background and did not want to talk about it and, in fact, seemed a little irritated, i think because there was no logical explanation for what we were looking at. for us, it certainly was an unidentified moving \"object\" just not sure if it were flying or not.\r\n\r\nas a small epilogue to this narrative, while driving to work, it was still very dark, the sky brilliant and the air cold and dry.  to the south over tiger mountain, i could see an unusually bright planet, probably saturn or jupiter? not sure, but it's about the right location where we would see those planets.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

colored lights: blue, reddish-pink, green and a yellow.  the lights were so bright they immediately caught my attention and were very easy to follow in the night.  \r\n \r\ni was driving north on i-5 about to exit arena blvd.  at first, i mistook them for a weird air show off to my right over sacramento's arco arena, just south of the sacramento intl. airport, but when the objects wandered from the very large parking lot and followed a road across an empty field from me i realized they were not kites, remote controlled planes, nor any other plane for that matter.  they were a block away and at one point flew under the lights of the empty street. the ships apeared to be black under the orange street lights. i thought they were only v shaped, but at times they appeared triangular, but as though they had slightly extended rear sides.  \r\n \r\nit looked as if the ���drivers��� were having fun, travelling slowly along the road, twirling, rising up, stopping and hovering, and sometimes rolling in another direction (blatantly defying the laws of physics).  they stayed between nearly touching ground and 100ft in the air.  i live near an airport, i know how planes move, and these were not planes.  i can best describe their movement as a mix of that of a kite and a stunt bi-plane. one of them flew under a red light in an empty intersection, while the other flew over.  in relation to the size of the traffic light pole, they were between 20-30ft wide and 3-4 ft tall. \r\n\r\ni was never affraid of them, rather jealous that they seemed to be so much fun to fly.\r\n \r\nthey were traveling south toward the convergence of two freeways, i-5 and i-80, the busy truxel shopping center, and on toward downtown sacramento.  i know they must have been seen by other people as well. being so unexplainable, i was surprised they were so blatantly visible. \r\n\r\nsince i was exiting the freeway, i had slowed as much as i could while constantly looking to my right, but as they travelled further behind me i could no longer safely watch them unless i pulled over.  not having a camera on me and with a hungry child in the back seat unfortuantly i could not pull over to watch

it travels around 17,000 mph. at that altitude, this ufo had to have been going at least 6-10 times the speed of the iss. i first saw it while looking at the normal constellations i see. i am looking basically straight up, and i see movement. i focus on the movement, and realize how fast it is going first. its very dim, and looks very large, almost as if i have an out of focus view on a star; but traveling at amazing speeds. i would say it would cross from horizon to horizon (maintained at an average speed) in less than 4 minutes. i've never seen any ufo travel so fast, and making it difficult to see makes me believe it's extra-terrestrial instead of government craft. this occurred for about 15 seconds, at which point it went dim and i could no longer see it (i have 20/20 vision and am far sighted, so i see these better than a lot of my friends). it seemed to have maneuvered to the south, but just barely. a small correction of flight trajectory, if you will. i had no emotions other than excitement and amazement that i was able to see this. my friend from inside heard me as i said in awe things along the lines of \"what is that?\" and \"i've never seen any ufo do that\" and came
