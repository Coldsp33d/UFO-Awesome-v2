really different. then this cloud slowly started to basically suck into this light. the oppisite of what a rocket booster would do. once the cloud was completely sucked in the light became just a

encontraba en la sala de mi casa en el barrio sesenta casas de la ciudad de armenia,quindio,en colombia,me encontraba haciendo algunas grabaciones del firmamento usando una table a la cual le modifique la lente de la camara trasera a infrarrojo y eso explica la coloracion tono rosa o rojiza en las tomas de las fotografias y del video.Era una tarde calorosa y despejada,deje la camara de la table grabando enfocando el cielo hacia arriba entre la copa de un arbol y un poste de energia o suministro de electricidad.La idea era que en horas de la noche revisaria uno a uno cada uno de los video logrados.Estuve por unas 2 horas detras de la camara observando pero a simple vista no pude apreciar nada raro ni extraño,pero en horas de la noche mientras revisaba algunos de los videos me sorprendi al ver que en uno de ello la camara definitivamente habia logrado captar objetos algunos traslucidos y otros muy definidos desplazandosen a gran velocidad y descendiendo o aparesiendo al pareser de un bortise o circulo traslucido que se aprecia en el video en la parte alta del cielo arriba de la copa del arbol entre la pequeña nube en lo alto del firmamento,eso paresia ser aquello que algunos cientificos han llamado agujeros de gusano y de alli aparesian y descendian estas esferas luminosas los cuales en su descenso cambian bruscamente de direccion emitiendo a su ves un haz o destello de luz como si esta misma energia luminica produjera su increible propulsion.Por alguna extraña razon estas esferas solo fueron visibles con la lente modificada a infrarroja adaptada en la camara trasera de la tablet.Declaro y doy fe que todo lo que he escrito es cierto y sucedio tal cual lo han leido,tengo pruebas en fotografias y archivos originales de video los cuales subire para que sean de conocimiento publico y de estudio cientifico.Asi mismo he subido el video a youtube con el titulo: ovnis,en armenia,quindio,colombia para que todo aquel que desee verlo lo haga,solo deben seguir los tiempos de pausa dentro de la reproduccion del video para poder visualizar los dos objetos o esferas descendiendo y cambiando bruscamente de direccion.,los tiempos para ver el primer objeto en el video son: minutos 3:08 ,3:09 ,3:10 ,3:11 ,3:12 deben empezar a pausar el video desde el minuto 3:08 y enfocar su atencion en la parte alta del cielo hacia la izquierda entre la copa del arbol y el poste de enegia de suministro de electricidad alla arriba en la pequeña nube que se ve a lo alto.,y para ver el segundo extraño onjeto o esfera los tiempos son minutos: 3:51 ,3:52 ,3:53 ,3:54 deben

omg! this is awesome! finally i get to see a real good one this time! the object was straight above me coming from the west & quietly \"floating\" directly towards the east. it was hard to determine the elevation & the size of the craft (dark outside...). possible height of 12k feet, possible size of 200' per side. i live near 2 airports & see planes all the time. i also live near a hospital & see helicopters all the time. it was definitely neither! the duration lasted for about 45 seconds & i saw it slowly travel for about 12 miles. i have no witnesses or photos. my daughter believes me. guys at work don't. i know what i saw. it was way-cool! whenever i go out to look at stars & satellites i always hope to see it again  (wishful thinking :)\r\ni thought about calling the main airport and let them know what i saw because it looked like it was passed right above them. the craft looked to be the size of of a boeing 757.\r\ni thought about calling the cops but thought what the hell can they do about it. anyway it was an awesome sighting! i am a believer!\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

ubicada en el barrio sesenta casas de la ciudad de armenia,quindio,colombia tratando de captar algunas imagenes y videos del firmamento entre las 13:25 pm o 1:25 pm y 17:00pm o 5 pm hora local,usaba una tablet con lente de la camara trasera modificada a infrarrojo y enfoque la lente de la camara de la tablet hacia el cielo a eso de las 15 o 16 horas es decir a eso de las 3 o 4 pm la deje grabando por intervalos de cada 10 a 15 minutos aproximadamente para horas mas tarde pasar a revisar cada uno de los videos.,mientras realise las grabaciones no note nada raro ni fuera de lo comun ni visualise nada en el cielo,el clima era caloroso con cielo despejado en ese momento.Al modificar la lente de la camara trasera de la tablet a infrarrojo esta torna capta el paisaje con una coloracion rojiza o rosada claro lo cual es normal producido por el espectro de luz infrarroja persibida o captada por la camara con la modificacion en la lente.En horas de la noche me dispuse a revisar uno a uno cada uno de los videos,los revise pausandolos y en todos note extraños objectos y esferas luminosas asi mismo como apariciones de hazes de luz y destellos muy raros que aparecian y desaparesian de las tomas.Es entonces asi que en uno de esos videos logre notar que la camara infrarroja habia logrado captar con claridad dos extraños objetos descendiendo de lo alto del cielo en la toma o enfoque de la camara hacia la parte alta del cielo entre la copa de un arbol y un poste de suministro de energia o electricidad y cambiando bruscamente de direccion a gran velocidad y emitiendo un destello o pulsacion luminica muy extraña en diferentes tiempos dentro de la grabacion,en un comienzo pense que era algun defecto de grabacion o algo lo cual por simple curiosidad me impulso a revisar una y otra ves dicho video ,pausandolo en su reproducion hasta lograr llegar a la conclusion que definitivamente habian quedado grabados extraños objetos translucidos como esferas y que luego descendian a gran velocidad emitiendo alpareser una especie de energia luminica de impulsion pues aunque se ulimanaban por momentos en su rapido descenso tambien destellaban solo al cambiar bruscamente de direccion.Los tiempos para visualizar o ver al primer objeto son entre los minutos 3:08 ,3:09 ,3:10, y 3:11 empezando a pausar desde el minuto 3:08 ., y para ver al segundo y mas claro objeto los tiempos son entre los minutos 3:50, 3:51, 3:52, 3:53, y 3:54 empezando a pausar desde el minuto 3:50 y pongan mucha atencion entre los minutos 3:52, 3:53 y 3:54 aun mucho mas extraño es la aparcion en lo alto del cielo entre una pequeña nube aparese una especie de circulo trasnlucido que solo logre apreciar analizando detenidamente la grabacion,lo que pareser ser aquello que muchos cientificos han llamado agujeros de gusano, en el video en lo alto arriba entre la copa del arbol y el poste de electricidad en el cielo se puede observar dicho bortise trasnlucido del cual al pareser surgen estoas extrañas esferas u objetos inicialmente tambien trasnlucidos y que luego en su rapido descenso y cambio brusco de direccion se hacen un poco mas visibles solo a la lente infrarroja pues a simple vista no son visibles al ojo humano,extraño verdad.Doy fe que todo lo que he escrito y compartido con ustedes es verdad,es real y sucedio tal cual lo he escrito y contado.Tengo pruebas fotograficas y de video las cuales he subido a este medio para que sean publicas y de conocimiento cientifico y publico..,asi mismo he subido aca el archivo original en su tiempo de reproduccion original .,y otro video del mismo archivo pero ralentizado en su tiempo de reproduccion para que sea mas visible la observacion de los objetos.Asi mismo los he subido o colgado a youtube con el titulo de: ovnis en armenia,quindio,colombia ,para que todo aquel que quiera y desee verlos lo pueda hacer.Tank you","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path
