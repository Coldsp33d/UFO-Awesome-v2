memory of any abduction.  here is what happened:\r\n\r\nseveral nights in a row within one week in january 2011 i had the feeling of someone grabbing my ankles in bed.  some of the times when i was clearly awake.  one night when this happened i looked out my large bedroom wall window to see about 5 fast flashes of light and then i experienced a loud multi-tonal ring in my ears for about 30 seconds.  \r\n\r\ni have seen what i thought was craft 3 times in my life.  in childhood there was a time i went for a walk in the woods with a friend (we were 12) and were scared and ran back home to be reprimanded for being gone so long.  we thought we were away from home only a short period of time.\r\n\r\ni am curious to hear your input.  since the last experience happened this month i have had a heightened sixth sense (more than normal), and a sudden obsession with ets.  when i see certain photos of aliens i feel unexplainable deep compassion mixed with some fear.  there are also 2 windows in my home that i won't walk by at night by myself, just those 2, i am afraid of, no others.  also, suddenly, i feel like i am part of something large going on.  i feel a strong sense of duty.  \r\n\r\nif so inclined, your input would be appreciated.","distance":"21-100

2008 i was on vacation in florida on the gulf coast,  i love to go for walks on the beach at nights.  one night i was sitting on the beach it was a wierd night no lights were on in the houses so the sky was clear, as i sat on the beach there was no clouds in the sky. a few minutes passed when i heard a strange humming sound, i thought nothing of it, then i see a really random cloud flying really low towards the beach i kept looking at it because the humming was getting louder and this cloud was really big, then it stopped but the wind was really blowing steadly. as i stood there i then see a light shoot down from the cloud into the water so bright you could see to the bottom, it made a sound like someone turned on a light switch too.  then i started getting nervous so i backed up but i was strangle courous so i stayed and watched it hover to the dunes where it went down near some trees and then a spiral of lights appeared for a brief few seconds.\r\n\r\nthat following sunday i was back home, my wife and i decided to go for a walk as we were walking down the street i felt the need to look up and on the right of me was three objects in the air hovering, they looked like oddly shapped orbs alot like the movie flight of the navigator ship.  i also noticed there was no air traffic in a heavy traveling area.  i stood there staring when one just vanished, the other one turned around and poined its nose downward and flew off really fast, the other went another direction,  a few minutes later air traffic started again.  \r\n\r\nanother one was in 2010 when i was driving to work i noticed something shinny in the air near the toll roads, and there was another object just hoving there and then dissapeared.\r\n\r\nthe most recient one was on halloween of 2010, i was having a very small get together we were all on the pourch when my wife asked me to put the strob light near the tree, as i walked onto the lawn i looked up and saw a triangle shapped object flying very low heading perfectly south, i noticed it because it had an orange light on in the center, i felt good because i got my wife and her two friends to witness this too.  im not sure why i am seeing all these things but i would like some answers, these are all real sighting.  thanks","distance":"20 Feet or

was at work taking a moment to make tea, as i had just started for the morning. i saw a colleague in the lunch room and chatted to her as i made my tea, but was drawn to a brilliant ball of light outside the window.\r\ni had to have a closer look and went right up to the window to see if it was a reflection. it was a very hot day and the sun was bright so i thought this the most likely explanation.\r\nhowever, i could not tell for certain that the light was on a building in the distance or on a hill, as i tried to move perspective and i couldn't say for sure that it was 'attached' to anything.\r\ni asked my colleague her opinion and she was a little taken aback but was sure that it must have been reflecting off something.\r\ni took a photo with my phone, so it is a terrible quality but allowed me to get a reference shot.\r\ni went back to work, planning to check on it in a little bit to see if i could get a clearer impression.\r\nprobably not even half an hour later, another friend invited me to take a break as he was going out for a cigarette and i told him about it. from the ground outside (the office is on the 16th floor) it was impossible to see anything. after we went back up i went straight to the lunch room to see if the view was any clearer. i lined my view up with the picture i had taken and couldn't even see a tiny reflection. i had wondered if maybe the sun had moved dramatically and so the 'reflection' was gone. however, i knew from being outside that the sun was pretty high overhead so i can't imagine it could've changed the sight so dramatically.\r\ni've decided to wait another day and see if the spectacle repeats itself tomorrow morning. if so, then it is definitely some kind of 'trick reflection' - though i have been checking google maps all day to try and figure out what kind of building could be there to cause such an amazing sight. there is absolutely nothing in the air between the two points i used as reference (a building and a church spire). i've been reading too much of this stuff, so i'm busy convincing myself it was nothing.\r\nhowever, i came onto this site and noticed that someone else in melbourne has seen the same thing a few days ago and so did someone in japan, by the sound of it, so i'm waiting to see what tomorrow brings, evidence-wise.\r\ni can be contacted for further questions or whatever.

last bit of darkness behind those buildings, sorta caught up in my own thoughts at the time, but directly in my vision up above, light moving catches my attention. (and bear in mind that on this nite it is very clear weather)well, not even light, just movement in the sky above my head. there are no sounds other than the roar of the highway(interstate 30), but as i stopped, every sense in me turned to whatever the hell it was i was seeing. oddly enough i can't say they were airplanes as there was an airplane going directly above and forward of me, crossing perpendicular to the path of these things i was seeing... the most absolute definition of perfect spheres. absolutely perfect spheres. they were streaming past at no particular interval, and very low. much lower than the one airplane i could see above these spheres. and this is the only reason i decided to put this story somewhere, because they were so low that i could with just my eyes see them from underneath as they streamed past. a direct view. most all of them were just white spheres. but disturbingly there's definitely a \"leader\" amongst these things, cause when i fully stopped and my brain clicked that i wasn't seeing random stuff or airplanes, i saw one that appeared green-ish with two tinier(or super-faster)orbs zinging around, infront, behind, thru it. like \"leader of the pack\" style travel, all of these things. so not shooting stars, for sure. i watched these things come from behind me, directly overtop me, then infront of me, absorbing as much as i could in that time. i know after about 30 seconds this is the first time in my life i have seen something unexplained. the speed of these things weren't natural. the shape. and the other detail that also has me telling this tale, is that being they were so low, and one in particular that much lower, i can describe(as best i can) what it looked like. one i most remember, as it slowed down like it was looking at me(could be paranoia in my head at this point but whatever). this perfect sphere like all the others, was golden-yellowish....If ufos and all that are ships or craft...How the hell can i still see thru it? they are transparent, these things, when viewed closely. if i could draw this one here, i would. these are not spotlights. not craft, but yet fly about like they are. yet something is inside them. this one, i followed with my eyes and already i'm on my knees at this point, from behind me to infront....But looking directly at it...I get the feeling i am not seeing what is really there. these things make no sound in passing, just to add a note. i fully believe even if i was in a countryside away from human sounds, these things are silent as a grave. i've got enough of a military mind to recognize some details. these spheres didn't even disturb the air about them, yet are traveling around. i've been made aware of these sightings of such a specific formation. a news camera picked these things up in broad daylight. i never gave it a thought. but i have become more aware after that, of massive sightings of these things. so i put out there i have foreknowledge of them. i'm a drinker. i don't do drugs. i had 1/2 of a bud ice 40oz. when i went for a walk out to ez mart for tampons and i still stand by the fact i didn't imagine it. i do know i took time to decide to walk, as i dont like walking, it hurts my legs. but something put me out there at an intersection of time and events to see these damn things. and whoever reads this, that airplane that crossed at that same time at this location...There's no f'ing way that they didnt see what i did, being above the spheres flying across their path. if you were on that flight, speak out. if you were the pilot, speak out. there's no way a plane full of people didn't see what i saw, though strangely i was closer to them. i encourage anyone to speak of these spheres, cause even i have now seen them and they are showing up in day and nite, fully public view with many witnesses.\r\ni am 29 years old. i have been a huge fan of the x-files, sci-fi stuff, a geek in general, even admired mufon due to the x-files show, cause i respect everything \"outside the norm\". one thing i never have done is say i've seen/experienced anything. infact the opposite. i always wanted to. now i am feeling i regret that, cause i am scared beyond belief. are these alien? or are they angels? demons? something metaphysical? i'm just plum scared after its happened, especially when i felt one slowed to \"look\" at me. and it's sad when i was on the ground looking up....A white expedition passed me by, never wondering what i was looking up at. or the other scattering of people i saw after i got off the ground to finish my walk to the store(in tears, freaked out)...No one even payed mind. these things are appearing for a reason, and in massive sightings. damn. i'm only on this site cause i watched a television show ffs. otherwise i feel very alone with what i saw and who to tell. if you are like me, never seen anything odd in your life in the sky but know full well you didn't hallucinate....Speak. whatever these particular spheres are about...We need the pros of this area to have knowledge of their whereabouts and hope they see a pattern we can't. i'll leave my story in the hands of mufon and whoever else they deem necessary.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27580,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.9312336,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01302011-0007","longitude":-96.4597089,"occurred":1296361200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296455541000,"summary":"Long line of orbs flying really low over my head","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Rockwall, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:73797"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Ebina","country":"Japan","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving on the tomei expressway. i just got off the expressway on exit #5 to atsugi/ebina. ebina is the newly built exit. i took the ebina exit. i was driving on the long straight away, when i noticed a bright starlike light in the sky. the sky was very dark. night time. a few other stars were visible. this light was brighter than them all. i guessed it was a helicopter because stars are not that bright. also, there is a navy aviation base close by. i used to work there, and i know they have helicopters. my wife was with me in the car. i told her to take a look at it and tell me what she think it is. she said \"i dont know, it could be a star.\" i was coming close the the point where the straight away ends. about 5 seconds before i have to follow a curve on the road, the light disappears from the sky. my wife and i were both watching at the time and we were amazed. there were no clouds in the sky for the light to hide behind. helicopters do not turn off their lights during flight. the whole time the light did not move from the position it was in. when the light disappeared, i told my wife to check the time because i want to report this as a ufo, because we couldnt explain what it could be. we didnt bother to try to take photos or video because we see lights in the sky all the time. we watch the sky regularly. we have a telescope, binoculars, cameras, tripods, and we are fairly familiar with stars and planets. we often see airplanes fly around in the sky. once in a while we see a helicopter fly by. ive even seen a satellite move straight and smooth along the sky. this light was like a bright star or a motionless helicopter, up until the point when the light went out. from there, i have no idea what it could be.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":27579,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.4464459,"location":null,"logNumber":"JP-01302011-0006","longitude":139.3908031,"occurred":1296270600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kanagawa Prefecture","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296448372000,"summary":"Bright as a car headlight. brighter than a star. look like a star or helicopter.

to the jrb.  i noticed a very unusual object due east and at a higher elevation of the airplane.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared as two translucent balls attached with a short rod.  by appearance, it was like two silver-colored soap bubbles.  each sphere had a light that appeared to change colors, finally appearing about the color and intensity of aircraft landing lights.  the object appeared stationary at the time.\r\n\r\nat first glance, the object had a milky translucent, almost silver appearance.  the lights seem to move from right to left, constantly changing colors.  i observed several colors.  greens and reds made the most impression.  the object then appeared a more solid silver color, like mylar, and that is when the bright white lights appeared. \r\n\r\nif there was any noise associated with the object, it was masked by the jet noise.\r\n\r\ni didn���t notice any evident interaction between the object and the jet.\r\n\r\nthe whole observation lasted approximately 5-6 seconds.\r\n\r\ni grabbed my camera and ran outside to take a picture.  as the camera booted up and the f-16 passed overhead, i looked up to aim the camera.  i could not see the object any more.\r\n\r\ni kept monitoring the sky in all directions to see if i could see anything.  after about five minutes of not seeing the object again, i gave up and went back inside.\r\n\r\nfrom my observation point, i could deduce that the object was probably at an altitude of 1500-2000 ft. over the benbrook lake.\r\n\r\nthe object end to end, appeared about as large as the fighter.  assuming it was about the same distance away as the jet was to me, i would guess each sphere must have been about 15 feet in diameter.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27578,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.677568,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01302011-0005","longitude":-97.4575959,"occurred":1296257280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296445887000,"summary":"Spheres

attending her buddist meeting while my grandfather watched me until she came home. during this time period,i was nine years old, i was in the fourth grade and was in a private school. on the night of the event, i had been home from school for about two hours. i hadn't changed out of my uniform. i was working on my math homework. as i was trying to work out a math problem in my head, i had looked up at a raw, white, crystal quartz that was on top of the fireplace mantle. i then turned my head to the right to look out of the french doors located behind me. i saw hugh blinking lights flying slantedly over the hillside heading towards my house. my first thought was that maybe it was an airplane that was about to crash. i immediately put down my math book, paper and pencil, and stood up and walked over to the french doors, that lead to the side of the house, which over looked the city. my grandfather was in the kitchen at this time washing the dishes. i quickly walked past him without saying a word and made my way outside to the driveway. once out side it was as though time seemed to slow down and everything seemed to move in slow motion. the craft was slowly gliding while at the same time it was spinning in a circular motion. i yelled to my grandfather, \"granddad, come out here quick!\" \"there is something flying in the sky!\" my grandfather quickly came out to investigate. he looked up at the craft. the craft was as high up in the sky a helicopter. my grandfather said to me, \"it could be an airplane\", i said, \"no, airplanes don't hover.\" he then said, \"maybe it's a helicopter.\" i said, \"no, helicopters have four windows, two in the front and one on each side of it.\" this craft has at least 24 light blinking on and off and it has a hugh red glowing ball on top of it and it looks like the ball is floating above it.\" i said, \"helicopters don't look like that and besides, helicopters and airplanes make a noise. he said, \"maybe it is the goodyear blimp.\" i said, with little frustration,\"granddad, it is not the goodyear blimp, because even the goodyear blimp has a humming sound to it.\" i said, whatever it is this thing has no sound to it at all.\" my grandfather said, \"stay here i am going to get a flash light.\" i stayed outside watching this craft still gliding and at the same time spinning in a circular motion and what it had appeared to still be approaching our house. like i said before, everything seem to be going in slow motion. my grandfather came back with his flash light and flicked the flash light on and off several times. when he did this, the craft suddenly stopped gliding and was now hovering almost over our house. i felt my heart racing, because i didn't know what was going to come next. the craft continued to hover for approximately ten minutes before it started gliding back to in the same direction from which it came. i ran back into the house to where the french doors were, just to see it glide back over the hillside. once it was gone out of sight, my grandfather and i resumed back to what we were doing, never discussing any further what we had saw. when my mother came home, my grandfather and i told her that we saw a craft in the sky that was not a helicopter, airplane or the goodyear blimp. that waa all we said to her and did not discuss the matter anymore. she told me later that night that it would be best to not tell everyone what i thought to be a ufo, because not everyone understands that. through the years i drew pictures of the craft that i had saw that night in 1979. i sketched one recently free hand style the way in which i saw the craft that night. unfortunately, i am having trouble uploading the sketch of the craft to my e-mail to then transfer to this

the beings that i have talked to have conveyed to me that our time is at hand. your conflicts with the planet can no longer be tolerated. they have already begun to make the changes neccessary to introduce several new species that will be more in balance with this planet. those of you whose d.N.A. have been collected  and accepted, will be allowed to continue to exist as long as you find balance with your needs and the needs of this planet. i was asked if i would like to travel with them. as crazy as that may sound and as hard as it is to say, it ist true. after initially stating that i would, i grew scared and thought about all that could happen to me and recanted. i then realized that what i was being asked was if i wanted to survive beyond the point of mankinds dimise. i had no such desire. i decided to stay because i believe that we as a species can do better. i realize that we are slow to learn, but those of us who will survive the correction will be able to change. i believe that we are already starting to do just that. the craft that i saw that night was one of many that i have seen over the course of three years. i do have the photos and videos of a number of them but i will no longer submit them for the sake of what appears to be entertainment value. befor making this decision i did however post two videos on you tube to give credence to my statments. they are posted under *(youtube information moved to additional evidence section--cms/sg) that is however not the only proof i can provide. i will submit any and all videos i have to anyone who is seriously willing to investigate this issue. i cannot say this with enough importantance. take what i have said seriously. do what you can to change you lives. to love every sacred thing on this planet and realize that the needs of the many  do outweigh the needs of the few! i don't know if we even have enough time to try to make the correction, but i hope with all of my being that we do! although these beings are not gods, or have not revealed themselvs as such, they do however seem to be responsible for this planet and will remove whatever threats present themselves. i do not speak for them, but they do speak through me and by numerous others they have contacted. the people that they have given this message to are young and old, rich and poor, all races and nationalities. some or which are afraid to come forward because of the stigma associated with this subject. i was one of those people. but i am no longer. if a little embarrassment will help to save a species (our species) then so be it. you can choose to not take this seriously, or you can choose to change your fate.  they will be waiting for your answers.

my boyfriend saw this. i remember feeling an overwhelming sense of happiness and love. i was not scared just very excited!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27565,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.945341,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01292011-0010","longitude":-82.2802347,"occurred":1296201600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,   Star-like,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1296340777000,"summary":"Witnessed two sperate ufo. one being blimp(?) shaped with red and green pulsing lights and the other being triangle(?) shaped with white strobe that turned into steady red light.","tags":["triangle","ufo","lights","pulsing"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Brandon, Florida","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:73811"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Portsmouth","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" 1 .On holiday on the isle of wight uk . august 20th 2009. i was taking digital photos of a perfect sunset over the solent towards southampton/portsmouth. 2. the what i can describe , metallic ball object was only noticed by me at my holiday home thorness bay isle of wight the same evening as i transfered the pictures from my digital camera to my laptop. i noticed the strange object straight away , however had not seen it with my naked eye at the time the picture was taken.3. at first my family who were with me said it was proberbly a  hot air balloon, but i personally had to dismiss this because surely there would have been the shape of the basket below it.Perhaps it is something to do with the suns rays in the photo? but ive seen many other photos of similar objects on the internet and on you tube sightings. 4 . a ball shaped metallic object .No witness of its motions due to it only behing descovered when veiwed on my laptop pc.5.I have very strongs feelings about any unexplained sighting of anything ufo related or supernatural . i think the fact of not having a rational explination of what is seen with the human eye feels me with facination and curiosity. i have kept this picture close to my personal feelings since my holiday in august 2009 and only my children , parents , and partner have seen this photo and i seem to be the only person who has strong feelings towards this subject. i now have for some reason  a strong facination for the unexplained and or especially ufo sightings.6. only noticed when photo was first veiwed, therefore can not answer point 6.
