i shouted  out \"omg, what was that\"?, and excitedly told the others what i had seen. as i was pointing to the part of the sky where i had seen it , it happened again, exactly as before. this time my friends saw it too (there were four of us standing there)and we all became very exited.We were shouting the usual \"what in the #@*% is that?\", and got the attention of the neighbors who live in the apartment below us.As i was telling these people what we were yelling about, and they came up the stairs, it happened again and they saw it too. everyone was trying to frame it up in their cell phone cameras, but it was just too far away for cell cameras to capture it. none of us had a better camera, or any binoculars, at the time. in the time that we were watching, the same exact thing happened 7 times! each time it there about 2-3 minutes between when it first \"popped on\" looking like a faint star, and grew larger and brighter and turned to a vivid glowing orange,and blinked out again. the duration of it's \"on\" time was about 15 -20 seconds, and always the same. during our sighting we also noticed that the object appeared to be moving very slowly to the south, but the movement was barely discernable. there was no sound, but  it was was so high in the sky, and so far out, that even had it been a jet, we would never have heard it. altogether were 8 people on the balcony who all saw it. \r\n\r\nmy friend dawn and i decided to get on the road and head back home, as we thought we might get a better view of it from out on the open highway. it took another (very tense) 15 or 20 minutes to say our goodbyes, as our friends did not want us to leave. there are alot of bends in the highway between yreka and weed, but we were basically heading in the the same direction as what we had seen. but unfortunately,  there was too much traffic on the highway (i-5) and too many other lights, to have a good view of the sky.\r\nwhen we got home we stayed outside for some time , in hopes that we would see it again, but we did not.\r\ni know it was not a plane, or any other conventional craft. i once worked at l.A.X. for over 6 years, and also worked at beale afb for almost seven years, and i know what airlpanes look like-coming and  going.\r\ni know i should have reported this as soon as i got in the house last night, but i kept thinking that since i had no photos or footage, my report would not be worth much.But i cannot get it off my mind, and was hoping their might be other report to corroborate with mine.

i were visiting my mom and dad. i went to my dad���s shop in the back yard  and as i was walking back to the house i looked up and saw the described crafts almost directly overhead playing a game of ���tag���. i watched for a few minutes and then went into the house before the crafts left. with the kind of motion i was observing, these were not crafts that i had seen before and they moved unlike any othere aircraft i had ever observed.\r\n\r\ndescription of vehicles\r\n\r\nno identifiable structures attached to either craft so i could only guess at the altitude and the size of the vehicles. my parent's house was about 5 miles west of the fresno air terminal (now fresno  yosemite international airport, which includes an air national guard base (144th fighter squadron) and a commercial airline terminal). i���m guessing at the sizes of the crafts and the altitude:  as long and as wide as a 747 airliner but there were no wings and the body was not tapered; at an altitude of approx. 30,000 feet. they were nearly overhead so i have no idea of the their height. they seemed to be playing a kind of ���tag��� where one craft would dart forward of the other by about 3 lengths  and then stop whereupon the other craft would dart forward to catch up to the first craft and then stop next to the other craft. acceleration and deceleration of each craft was instantaneous. on one side of each craft there appeared to be a ���cargo���-type of door at the middle of the craft (see drawing). no other  doors or windows were evident; neither was a form of propulsion evident (no contrail or other exhaust gases). during my observation, the two crafts may have changed altitude (but i don't believe they did)and they travelled in a straight line path north to south (no right angle turns, in fact, no turns).\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27557,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.8276577,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01292011-0002","longitude":-119.7018594,"occurred":336852000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was working for the u.S. forest service and i was camped out at the panther flat campground just east of gasquet,ca along hwy 199. the date was in middle august of 2000 just before starting my final semester of college.\r\nthe time was around 9:45 pm and there was still twilight but no moonlight. myself and my co-worker decided to get in our sleeping bags so we could get a good night sleep. my co-worker decided to sleep under a tree with his dog while i decided to sleep out in a small meadow area with my dog. we didn't use tents and i wanted to be able to see the stars. this time at night and the incredible clear skies made it possible to see lots of satellites flying overhead. it also helps being so far away from any towns or cities that have lights that would interfere. \r\n\r\ni was lying down with my head propped on my pillow so i could have a westerly view down canyon. behind me trees blocked my view, and off to both sides(north and south) there are tall ridges rising about 2000 ft. i estimate that i only have about 35 degrees of view to either side. i was astounded how many satellites i was able to see at that time. they were single satellites and they came from every direction moving across the sky. there seemed to be about 2 to 4 satellites in view at any time.\r\n\r\ni had been watching for about 15 to 20 minutes when i saw a satellite come from directly behind my head. it was moving west. it was followed by two more, moving the same direction. the formation these three made was an equilateral triangle. there was separation between them and the three objects were independent, not attached in anyway. the separation between the objects was about the length of an adult males forefinger from tip to knuckle. these objects moved together at the same speed without any break in the formation. they looked just like all the other satellites in size and white color.  i was in awe because i had never seen three objects moving together like this. \r\n\r\nthen suddenly, the three objects changed direction at a 45 degree angle toward the southwest. they all moved together and in an instant!!! no rounded corners or anything. no changing speed. the direction change had the two objects now leading the formation with one trailing. i watched as they disappeared over the southern ridge line toward the southwest, which confirmed that i didn't imagine their direction change. if they didn't change direction they would have disappeared on the horizon at my feet.\r\n\r\ni yelled out to my co-worker telling him what i saw and if he was looking up at the sky. he said it was my imagination and that he had his eyes closed so he didn't see anything. i felt uncomfortable the rest of the night and felt vulnerable and exposed out in the meadow, but felt comforted by my dog and that soon after a law enforcement ranger drove by on patrol. i never told anyone about this incident except my wife who i met and started dating 2 years later. \r\n\r\nbut.... it gets more interesting and this is why i want to have this investigated. in 2003 i started a new job with the national park service. i worked with the same co-workers for 3 years. in the summer of 2004 and also in august, one of my co-workers (jules) went camping with her husband and several friends to a wilderness area in northern california called the marble mountains. they were at the top of the mountains near some lakes and in a meadow at about 7000 ft. in elevation. there aren't many trees at this elevation so they decided to watch to stars before going to bed. she said they saw lots of satellites but the strangest thing of all was to see 3 satellites in an equilateral triangular formation fly from east to west. what is also interesting is the area that they camped was about 40 miles ese of where i saw my sighting on a very similar flight path.\r\n\r\ni also fell out of my chair and i told her that i saw 3 similar objects. then i asked her questions about the objects and they were exactly like the ones i saw. the only thing she said is that they continued on a straight line from horizon to horizon without changing directions, but the 3 objects never broke formation, traveled at the same speed and direction towards the west, and were definitely independent objects.  \r\n\r\nthis really helped to confirm what i saw and puzzled the both of us more since we have never seen anything like this formation before and didn't think satellites could be aligned to move like this. but i definitely saw them change direction without changing speed and that will stick with me forever.

my little sister to go down to the lake and we were going to try to catch some fish. we got the canoe out and it started to get dark very quickly. we rowed the boat out into the lake towards baked bean island. the water depth at this point is about 50 to 60 feet deep. i started to row towards a north direction when i looked over at the other side of the shore. i saw some type of airborne vehicle in the air with lights that were similar to car lights. they were moving around looking in the deep woods for something. on damaracotta lake at that time were very few houses. the craft moved and stopped with its lights moving as though it  was a crime scene. i told my little brother about what i saw he looked at it and was concerned. the i got a good look at the top of the craft. the milky way stars lit the sky up where i could see that there was no blades or it was no airplane because it moved and stopped. i rowed the canoe closer in the direction of it when my 6 year old sister and my brother started to cry and get upset. the craft came out over the waters edge and what i saw underneath was the most beautiful machine i ever saw. the canoe was rocking back and forth i knew i had to leave soon. the bottom of the ufo had a center, which had 6 to 8 rings which turned in syncopation to each other. the outer rim was lined with red and blue and white small oval lights with small light blue beams which made a comple circle on there own. i started back with the canoe, looking back the whole ship tilted sligtly and went at a 45 degree angle into the milky way, no sound, no smoke. the only thing we felt was our eaqrs popping. we took the boat back, quickly, and ran back to the house, getting to the house our family was back and we could not speak for a half hour because we were so excited. we finally told our story and it was collabrated by reports from the police and some locals in the area.","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live across the street from the bullhead/laughlin arizona airport.  it is a small air port limited to small craft and a daily single line jumbo jets service which normally has about three landings and departures daily. listening, i noticed that the jets had stopped landing that morning and only silence filled the normally noisey morning air.  i turned on my police scanner to see if there had been a red alert or some other government action that might cease air traffic and listened to the airport frequency.  the frequency had an issued alert that normal traffic would  be suspended but did not specify why, it gave wind direction and other pertinent information for craft to land however.  mid morning, jets, i believed to be stealth bombers arrived.  i did not see how many until the last day they were here, others, former military men who live here as well, claimed that while they had not see that particular jet, it resembled b-16.  they began a series of sorties over the surrounding desert regions.  mid morning, just shortly after they arrived, two men, one elder (early fifties to early sixties), and one younger man (mid 20's) arrived.  they took up residence in the room beside my own which has an unobstructed view of the airport.  but for all appearances sake, they rested from their trip for the rest of the daylight hours.  since the motel i live in is gay friendly, in all honesty i thought they were lovers and didn't question their true intent.  that night, at around 9: p.M. i went to walk my dog, they were unloading their small blue truck of their personal belongings and i happened, (because i am a nosey person) to glace back over my shoulder and noticed what looked like a pup tent errected over one of the double beds in their room.  i thought this was weird and noticed a bunch of wires and what nots but basically reminded myself to mind my own business and walked the dog.  that night, i heard many different electronic sounds coming from their room. the next morning the entire airport was dominated by the fighter jets and their sorties.  the noise was unbelievable and they took off and landed on a regular basis.  out of curiosity i asked the motel management, (whom i am friends with), if they knew what was going on over there and they said they didn't have a clue.  i also asked about the two men whom were next to me and again, the management drew blanks, just that their truck bore wyoming plates and they were probably gay.  again, that night i heard electronic nosies and noticed they had obstructed the nosey view of any onlooking eye by placing a sleeping bag over their window but since i was at a dead end and their affiars were their own, i tried to ignore them.  the next morning the older man began what would become a daily habit, he would leave early in the morning and appear to be going to laughlin to gamble or what not leaving the younger man alone in the room, he'd honk twice as he was leaving but the younger man never left with him.  the jets continued to fly sorties all day and at night, a host of helicopters would begin to take flight as the jets appeared to settle down for the night and the helicopters which appeared as search and rescue craft being red and white in color, would fly in circular patterns all night long over the airport.  i continued to hear the electronic sounds coming from the room next door and as i was passing the room, noticed the younger man had left to retrieve something from their truck.  when he noticed that i observed him from the balcony he kind of acted like he was overcome with himself, not knowing what to do and almost froze supended half way inside the truck until my dog and i passed him on our way to the field behind the motel.  as the days passed, not frequently but now and then we'd sight the younger man just standing, gazing from the end of the balcony into the barren desert.  he never smiled, never spoke and i assumed was mentally challenged and began to believe maybe the elder guy was his father rather than his lover and maybe the elder guy went gambling every day, since he left in that direction but then one morning as the jets took flight, i noticed the elder man drove towards the right hand lane, which would have taken him to the bullhead parkway and hence to the airport.  my son, who has a room two doors down from mine began to make it his business to find out what was wrong with the younger man, (mostly out of concern for his welfare since the older man left him alone everyday and if he was incompacitated in any way, we or at least he might offer to be there for him if needed), and my son attempted several times to speak with him but it appeared, either i was correct, and he was mentally challenged or something else was wrong with him as he had no normal human responses.  again, i mentioned to the management that i continued to hear electronic nosies come from their room all night long and asked if they knew anything more about those two, but the office appeared to believe my original thought, that they were gay lovers and maybe they were playing video games all throughout the night on the t.V.  now, i would have stopped here and as everyone else just thought that it was normal for air traffic to be interrupted in a tourist town that depends heavily upon all tourist and that maybe these two mysterious men who arrived the same day as the jets, in fact had nothing to do with the jets, with one exception.  everyone had a different theory who these jets were and why they had come to this remote town, essentially seized the local air port and were flying sorties above the desert but the night before they all left, a larger craft arrived under the cloak of darkness.  we saw it quite by accident since it arrived about the same time we were walking the dog.  from the balcony we could see the entire runway even though it was in pitch dark except for the tower as you could see apartment and house lights on either side of the airport.  the craft was huge, (huge meaning it blocked completel view of the southeastern horizon line which would have been dotted with lights from homes and streets),it was triangular and it was black, (assumed color), or as dark as the night, it had three lights around it and as this huge thing descended onto the airport it made absolutely no sound as it apparently landed.  no jet engine nosies, nothing.  i was obviously delighted to see this triangular black craft as i had never seen one before and was squealing and didn't realize we were right in front of the mens room.  the younger one came out of the room and we both turned around to apologize for making so much noise and again, he froze, staring at the craft and back to us.  so i said \"hi\" hoping we didn't disturb him too much and he quickly shut the door on the both of us.  by the time we looked back, the craft had apparently landed as we just didn't see it anymore.  my son was trying to convince me that this craft was something identifiable as i was trying to convince him it was the same triangular black craft many arizonians have sighted over the years for it made no sound and appeared to glide to the earth or use some gravitational field to land.  the next morning as i took the dog outdoors there were three jets which took off side by side and flew north.  by the time i arrived back at the motel the two men were packing up and leaving also.  while i went to my room, i did secret watching them from behind my curtain to see what they brought out of that room and was amazed to watch them openly bring electronic scopes, wires and bags of stuff out and down the steps but the last thing i watched the younger of the two bring out and begin to drop down to the older man below, was silver insulated wall panels, (silver covering in a quilted pattern over a foam center, about 4' x 6' rectangular shaped), which i have heard some people use to block out signals from entering their homes.  he dropped them down to the old man, who now appeared energetically charged, and i counted eight panels which they folded up, packed into the small camper shelled pick up truck and then as mysterously as they appeared, they too, with the jets left bullhead and by mid day, the tourist jets were landing at our airport as though nothing had happened.  normal air traffic resumed and honestly no one i have spoken to appears to know exactly what happened here except some story that was going around that these jets came from canada and the canadians had permission to use the airport for their task, what ever that was, i was also told that the helicopters must have been canadian as well since they were red and white but i haven't spoken to anyone who knows for certain about any of this stuff.  all in all, they were here about one full week. i haven't spoken to anyone who also saw the black craft, it could be few people actually saw it as it was very cold that night and you'd have to have a reason to be outdoors, but we never saw it leave, i just doubt it was on the runway when normal traffic resumed as tourist would have wondered what it was.  it must have left during the early morning hours. honestly there is no reason to contact me over the sighting since i really don't have any conclusions or answers and i understand only too well that in most of these cases there are cover stories which the public is expected to accept without question, i am certain that everything that went on here with the exception of the triangular black craft, will have a cover story but it makes no sense for canadians to fly all the way down to a tiny little town to begin manuevers that equate to test flying jets which i am certain nellis or any other northernly military air field could accomadate with a lot less attention and then end by a legendary black craft landing on the field and dissapearing overnight, along with two very strange men whom said less than a few sentences the entire time they were here.  i did take phone camera photographs of the jets and from the land below, it is verifiable that they are flying over bullhead/laughin airport but i have not been able to identify the jets.  sorry i don't have more.

these . i was six or seven years old and was playing out in our unfenced yard which was bordered by two other lots. the skies were clear and the weather was oppressively warm as is common in south texas. our backyard didn't consist of much but a junkedout rusted 50's era pick up and a ten yard pile of construction bricks piled about six feet high . lots a junk for a little boy to get into.  i didn't much care for the old pickup as it was a hotbed for all sorts of unsavory critters . i have to say i have a considerable phobia of insects which if on me will make me scream like a little girl , ha but i digress . i was playing solo that day as my playmates were elsewhere and my grandma who supervises me was inside relaxing . i was out playing in the dirt driveway when i got this sensation of someone spying on me . it's a lot like that feeling you get when you're about to get caught doing something you're not supposed to by your mother . so i glanced around and didn't notice anyone else playing in the two other lots. i casually looked up , skyward , and noticed a stationary object floating some 300 ft or less directly above me . i stared for a few seconds then panicked . there was no where for me to take cover , except for one place ..... i forgot my phobia for that brief instance and dove under the junkedout pickup , happy to share my space with all kinds of six legged nasties . i remember two things clearly: the object was round and it was red . i also hear other witnesses say they spin . this thing didn't move or spin it just stayed motionless like it was observing . after about 30 min i came out from under the truck and it appeared to be gone although i hear they can become invisible . i would give anything to go back and see that dumb look on my face . i told my mom and grandma everything but it wasn't well received . some years later my grand mother told me of her experience which happened only blocks from mine . true story and i still get goose bumps

pulled out heading south on the road heading towards the store i noticed quite a large light in what appeared to be a star in the sky to the south and real low.   being interested in astronomy i immediately wanted to investigate what this 'planet' was or what 'star' it was that was flickering so brilliantly, so upon arrival at the corner store i pulled out my handy little smartphone and opened an app that locates stars and such.  as i'm looking between my phone and this object it kept getting brighter and brighter, twinkling more and more violently between red, white and sometimes even an almost orangish color.  i immediately note that they are no cosmic entities located in the sky to the south, such as planets or brightly lit stars and i thought perhaps i was still just seeing a star low shining across the atmosphere, something like how the moon looks elongated horizontally and holds almost a reddish orange hue when it peeks up over the horizon.  at no point in time did i think i was witnessing a u.F.O. even though i've seen and heard of a couple strange flying craft/lights in the skies over houston as of late.   as i became increasingly frustrated with being unable to identify what this astronomical object was i noticed it was beginning to move.  it began to move east and immediately the 'flickering' dimmed as it transitioned from hovering to moving eastbound very slowly.   \r\n     at this point i had become so intrigued with what i was witnessing that i started up my truck again, neglecting the task of getting smokes and began to drive out of the parking lot.  simply because within the 24 hours before this sighting i had witnessed 2 magnificent 'shooting stars' within 12 hours of each other.  this being the reason i was looking to the sky in the first place, this object had peaked my interest a great deal.  as i began to drive out of the parking lot i lost sight for a split second behind an apartment building.  as my line of sight was cleared of the obstruction i immediately picked up on the orb/star/whatever the hell it was again and noticed it was beginning to move more rapidly still flickering from red to white only it appeared as if the red light was towards the back end of the orb and it transitioned to white light to the front of the 'craft'.  as i pulled up to a stop sign and the object was moving more rapidly, in what appeared to be in a south easterly direction now, it vanished.   the thing is it was beyond clear in the evening not a cloud in sight, you could see the stars surprisingly well for being in the polluted houston area.  so there is absolutely no way it 'vanished' into clouds.  after it disappeared, i was almost certain i had witnessed yet another ufo phenomena and immediately felt 'chilled to the bone.'  i didn't want to tell anyone mainly because the reaction i have received when i have talked of other things i've seen in the sky, but decided to report it in hopes that if anybody else saw this would be researching it, and know that someone else witnessed it... hopefully in turn making them feel like less of a kook than i do right now.","distance":"Over One

to be oval shaped and a little hazy but certainly a solid object. \r\nit floated slowly over head toward the horizon then stopped and appeared to 'drip' a fire like object. it then shot of at a right angle to the left, before stopping dead in its tracks to 'drip' again. my wife then tugged my jumper and said 'there is another one' and true enough another appeared in the spot the first one was when we saw it. this too, followed the same path as the first, stopped 'dripped' then shot of upward, closely followed by the first object. this whole event lasted for an hour or so, just floating and shooting away. \r\nthis was also wittnesed by another person who contacted me (a friend who knows i am interested in ufos) to tell me what she saw at the same time as myself and my wife. her account
