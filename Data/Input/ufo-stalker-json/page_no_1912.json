looked at him to see if he was looking toward the sky and noticed the object. he didn't. by the time i got home, i forgot to tell my husband. i remembered a few days later. have not seen anything like

ready to take a photo i waited till it was just over the tree rows close to the house and snapped the photo, i was going to take another photo but my phone mysteriously lost power and i couldn't get it to power back up. then all the lights in the house flickered on and off like we where going to lose power. i could now see this thing was moving right in front of our house and could now see it was a triangle craft with bright greenish glowing solid lights at each of the points of the triangle. i could also see a very faint florescent greenish line that looked lit coming from the front light going to the middle or center of the triangle and then it y'ed off to each of the rear lights on the triangle (kinda like a peace sign)i couldn't see any thing else it looked to be a dark black smooth

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It took place in 1977, at the time i was working as a teller at at bank.  it occurred in my parnet's home in monterey park, california.  monterey park is a city about eight or nine miles east of downtown los angels.\r\n\r\non the night of my experience the house was, has it usually is, quite and dark.  i laid awake in bed with my eyes open, thinking about things and waiting to bo back to sleep.  i'm sure i'd laid there for at least 30 minutes before my episode began.  here's what happened:\r\n\r\nwhile laying there i was startled by a point of a white light that suddenly appeared in the hall.  it was passing in front of the bedroom door, moving very slowly.  my first thoughts were it was my dad with a flashlight.  i've known my dad to do repair work late at night, like a just discovered (to him) leaking faucet.  buy realizing my dad would just turn on a light, i suddenly found myself in terrible fear, thinking it was an intruder with a flashlight.  someone broke into the house!  being helpless in bed i thought the best thing to do was to lay still and watch.  but has my eyes adjusted to the light, i could see no one there; it was light floating in the air!\r\n\r\nthis light moved until it got halfway passed the door, and then it paused for a moment.  it then made a 90 degree tune and came into the bedroom.  moving very slowly, it traveled into the room a foot or so. it then made another 90 degree turn.  it moved of to my right.  although i was experiencing shear terror, i watchted it.  it appeared to be an orb about the same size diameter has a quarter.  it moved until it paused a second time.  when it moved again it made another turn at 90 degrees.  now it was moving parallel to my bed.  i watch with great terror and disbelief of what i was seeing.  my mind was racing with the thoughts of telling myself that i was indeed awake, and i assuring myself what i was seeing was really there.\r\n\r\nthis orb then traveled to a point that was even with the end of the bed.  i could still see it in the corner of my eyes.  here, the orb paused again and stood there for a few moments.  it then made another 90 degree turn and came toward me!  in a second or two, i sensed it was directly over my head.\r\n\r\nterrified, i decided to jump out of bed and turn around to look at it.  but when i tried to do so i found out that i could not move!  i felt this enormous crushing force holding me down, as if the earth's gravitation pull increased ten fold over my bed.  i could feel my muscles were working, trying to obey my command to jump out of bed, but i could not move!  with this force pushing down on me, i had trouble inflating my lungs.  i could only take in small gasp of air.  has the seconds passed, i became aware of a pain growing in my stomach.  it felf much like muscle ache as if i was trying to do hundreds of sit-ups.  i don't remember seeing anything when this was going on, my eyes must have been closed.  this seizing force seemed like it lasted for about one to two minuets. what stands out in my memory was how hard i was pushing my arms down on the bed to try to lift myself up, the growing pain in my stomach and the gasping for air.  i was in a panic for air. \r\n\r\nas i struggled to get away i could rememer having the thought i was very close to breaking free.  with what enerby i had left i tried even harder to excape.  then all of a sudden i jolted up, to a \"sit-up\" position, believing i over came the force that was holding me down (or \"it\" let go).  when this happed i must have open my eyes because i clearly and distinctly remember getting a glimpse of the orb shooting out of the bedroom with great speed.  it traveled directly over my body and headed for the bedroom door.  once in was in the hall it made a 90 degree turn without stopping and disappeared out of view.  it was gone in an instant.\r\n\r\nonce the orb was gone, i laid back into the bed.  i remember thinking: \"what ever it was, it's gone now and i could go back to sleep\"  i quickly fell asleep.  looking back at this behavior, it seems ver odd.\r\n\r\nwhat felt like a few minuets later i awoke at the usual time.  everything seem to be so normal.  the sun was shining throught the window and i could hear my mom and dad talking in the kitchen.  i sould smell coffee.  the first thing i thought of was the orb that came into the bedroom.  i wonder about it for a moment till i realized something very odd about myself, something i never experience before or since; under the blankets, i was soaked wet with perspiration!  pulling the blankets off, i examined my t-shiret and pajamas, they were sticking to me in some places.  when i got out of bed i felt the cooling effect it had on me.  i went to take my morning shower.  while taking off my clothes i was very astonished of how sweating i was.  my t-shirt and pajamas came off with a peel.\r\n\r\nafter the shower, i got dressed for work and went into the kitchen for coffee.  i then went into the living room.  there, my mom was drinking coffee.  i sat across the room from her.  still thinking about the orb, i almost came out and told her about the experience.  but for some reason, i'd stopped.  it would be years before i would have told anyone.\r\n\r\ntoday i believe an orb did come into the bedroom and i was held down by some force.  but what happened when this was going on?  it dawned on me later that my body probably did not produce that much perspiration wetness in bed in two minutes.  so was there missing time?  was i told to keep my eyes closed?  did they tell me to \"go back to sleep?\"  was i told not to tell anyone?\r\n\r\ni wonder about the orb.  did it know i was awake when it entered the room?  it seeemed to cautiously go round me.  did it pause to see my response to its presents and then proceed after i had no reaction?  the memory of seeing the orb shoot out of the room immediately after i \"jolted up\" makes me wonder too.  did it try to get out of the room before i saw it or did i suddenly startle and frighten it after i sat up in bed?  it seems to have taken off in a panic.\r\n\r\nwhen this encounter was taking place it was certainly terrify, i hope it never happens again.  ever since, however, till today, i never look back at this experience with fear or dread, but with curiosity and wonderment.  i could also add a feeling of nonchalance.  i always thought of it as if it was no big deal, not workth memtioning.  after reading about other people's experience, however, i now feel it was quite extraordinary event.  it has been about 33 years or so now, and my life has been totally uneventful as far as orbs or ufo's are concern.  not a peep, unless they did a return visit while i was sleeping.","distance":"20 Feet or

july 4th...As the day time activities drew to an end...A few hundred people in attendance started to get situated for the evenings fire works display.  a friend of mine pointed up to the sky and i saw a orange object that looked like a flame of a lighter, horizontal to the ground traveling east at what appeared to be an amazing rate of speed, at a very high altitude.  weather conditions were very clear, aside from a few white clouds in the sky.  several people took notice and talked briefly about it.  i would like to say that i am positive that it was not a firework, a chinese lantern...Just for the record.  as the object flew over head, it looked like it was headed higher and higher...But not flying straight up...More like how a plane increases altitude.  after it passed everyone kind of was just quite.  kind of like \"sh*t\" that was neat, weird, or \"cool\".  all of us as a group even discussed the craziness of reporting a ufo sighting on july 4th!  once the fireworks ended everyone started to make their way to their cars, only to wait in traffic for 45 minutes.  my friend that originally spotted the orange ufo had gotten out of the traffic about 15 minutes before i did, called me and said he saw \"it\" again headed in the same direction...I however was unable to see it.  about ten minutes after that brief conversation, my girlfriend noticed \"it\" flying at what looked like the same altitude, but this time south west of where we are.  i would like to note that i am award of many colorful things in the sky on july 4th and that i am very very well aware of the one major and one small airport in cleveland...This, however was something different, and i feel very fortunate to be able to say i saw

all of the neighborhood dogs were barking. i realized i was hearing a fairly loud metallic scraping and ripping sound; very high pitched coming from the top of the closest hill. i could not see anythin, but the sound persisted for approx. 30-45 seconds. at times the sound reached high pitch range close to a siren. it was very unidentifiable, eiry, and definitely bothering the dogs. when it stopped it was suddenly very quiet. i thought it was strange, but none the less got in my car, left my home, and began driving on a local hwy towards town ~40mph. within five minutes of leaving home i saw a slow moving triangular shaped craft with three bluish white lights located on each of the apex points flying at tree top level across the highway. i appeared to moving very smoothly, almost gliding across the valley. the area in which it was seen is a commercial strip with multi-story residential buildings and fairly populated with college students. i was completely enthralled by the ufo, and began to track its movement. i followed it and ended up driving into a hayfield off the highway, stopped my car and got out. i watched it go behind a stand a tress near to the multi story housing area. it was probably 300' away from me when it began to disappear. it was completely silent and appeared to surveying the area. it was on a straight line trajectory flying perpendicular to the ground. it was not a helicopter because it would have made a loud noise; it was absolutely silent. i got back in my car, started it up and began to pull around back towards the highway when a light lit up my car from above. it was not a bright white spotlight one would expect from helicopters. it was a soft light and it encompassed my vehicle for approximately 3-5 seconds. i stopped again got out and saw nothing. i feel as if i had been scanned by this light beam. not sure why, but i do believe this to be the case. later that evening i played the best music i have ever been able to play amazing my fellow musicians. perhaps, the light interacted with my energic field and was able to raise my aural energies?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27509,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.225235,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01252011-0007","longitude":-81.6707917,"occurred":1295928900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Today i left my house to take our son to school at hardin valley elementary in knoxville tennessee. after i turned right off lovell road to hardin valley road, i noticed something i thought was  a helicopter going parallel to hardin valley road. it was traveling slightly faster than traffic which was flowing about 45 mph since i could not keep up. i noticed right after i turned (about where the shell rocky top gas station is at and the new mc donalds. it was on the right of the cars and following the traffic. there was a whole file of cars in front of me and they were slowing down to look. i could not stop since the traffic was heavy and it is a 2 lane road. i had my camera in my hand since i never leave home without it. here is where i am trying to describe the object to the best of my ability. it was triangular. it passed me and the underside looked like a typical plane shape from underneath but it was dark.  the only thing with that is it was hovering> i know planes can't fly so low next to traffic by power lines and just hover, they fly . i noticed lights blinking: red, blue, white on the tips and underneath. the lights were a lot brighter than helicopter lights, like those super bright led lights they have now, except a thousand of those put together.The lights blinked in a similar pattern as those of a plane: 1-2, 1-2, 1-2-3 and repeat but the intervals were uneven. \r\n\r\nas i pulled in to the drop off line at the school, i made a right off hardin valley and was able to grab my camera and start it up. at this time the object was over the food city grocery store by the school and hovering over the parking lot. it was triangular, blinking and hovering. i could not see or hear chopper blades. the lights were too bright when they blinked to make out anything on the craft.. it was moving back and forth, not like a plane but like a fast helicopter, fluidly. it then zoomed off to the mountain ridge right by cambpell station road and beyond. i followed it with my eyes and it was a the top of a mountain just hovering. then i lost it with my eyes. \r\ni had to cut the camera off when i dropped off my son and then i lost the flying craft by the time i pulled out onto the main street.\r\n\r\ni downloaded the video and since it was night, i was disapointed to see that all it showed was lights and not the triangle shape that i saw. it was still partly dark out at 7:20 am and my camera is not super. what i saw was way more than was the movie shows. i think i messed up by zooming in.\r\n\r\nthe bottom line is: i have seen lots of helicopters and when they search, they have their spotlights on. this is the only reason a chopper would be in a residential area. it certainly would not fly as low as power lines and street lights, when school is in.\r\n\r\ni called the knox county dispatch and asked if there might have been a call in the area for a knox county sheriff helicopter to be dispatched to a call. she asked me to hold on as she was checking on the calls from 7 am to 7 :30 in the hardin valley area and hardin valley school area. she came back on the phone and told me that no, they were not called for emergency or anything else.\r\n\r\ni then asked her is the county helicopters got brighter lights. she said not, the only time the lights are bright is when the spotlight is on. she said they would not do training in that area at that time of day. they don't usually go there to train anyhow. she said she will look into if a private citizen has a helicopter and was flying it because he should not have been flying it that low and in that area. she asked for my phone number and told me if anything else arises she will call. i said so there were no helicopters there? she said to me: not ours.\r\n\r\nthere is not an airport in the area. the nearest one is maryville. the craft did not have the usual search light had it been searching for a suspect. i just wish the video had been taken when it was following the cars on the main road, i was staring at the craft and could have gotten a better shot of it (maybe). it is just so hard to film anything at night it seems.\r\n\r\nthe film is what i got on camera.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

saw the 2 big orange balls of light. i knew immediately it wasn't a plane. i kept saying to myself what is that? i never in my life thought i would post here or see a real ufo. well it was 2 big orange balls of light, not like a craft. it wasn't a balloon as it was light. it wasn't being projected from the ground. they were huge solid lights, not blinking so it wasn't an airplane which those lights in the sky are small. these huge orange balls of light were like the size as if you saw a hot air balloon in the sky at a close distance. i had a camera in my purse but it had a dead battery. i kept trying to turn it on (cursing) because i wanted to take a good digital photo. my other phone i had left at work which would of been a poor camera quality as its a cheapie free phone. i immediately called my sister's cellphone to tell her what i had seen but got her voicemail. i left a voicemail. the objects where 1 right below the other. verticle and just \"floating\" stationary in the air. that's the thing they weren't moving they just stood still for a few minutes and never pulsated, just solid orange globes. when the cloud cover went by, they were covered up and then they were gone. i had called my sister because she lives near by and i wanted her to go outside as she lives further north and might see them. its funny but i always watch movies where people stare at ufos and i think idiot run in case something might beam you up or get you but there i stood, just staring. i couldn't look away from it because i guess my mind was trying to process or figure out what it was. there have been some other reports earlier in this month in the same county of similar description. honestly i was excited when i pulled in the garage and went to jump out to continue looking at it but at the same time scared it could of been threatening. if i had to give you an area of where it was, over northeast coral springs, fl or by parkland, fl.","distance":"Over One

children were on the trampoline. we had been out all morning since the sun was out. i take photos of nature and enjoy taking pictures of the clouds and the likes. i took several pictures this morning. when i saw this weird shaped clouds in the sky. i had never seen these forms in a clouds in nature. to sum it up, it looked like a spacecraft with windows on the side. it looked like it was invisible spacecraft in the clouds but somehow, passing through the sun and going through a cloud made it visible. \r\n\r\ni am a skeptic and really don't believe in this stuff but this was beyond belief. it looked like those crafts that people always talk about: flat, sphere like with windows on the sides that go all the way around the craft. this photo shows it as if it is just one side visible passing through but it looked like a circular craft. it passed very slowly in front of the sun and just moved along as a cloud would.\r\n\r\ni felt freaked out and did not tell the family what i was seing.\r\n\r\ni have heard stories of people saying ufo's have an invisible shield and that is why they hide in the clouds and we can't ever seen them. i don't know but these shapes were nothing a

on highway 90 near boutte, la. please search the data base here under the date march 2, 2007 for more information about this case. (louisiana) \r\n \r\ntonight i watched the movie phoenix lights and i discoverd something that \r\nshocked me. i noticed that the large ufo's that were witnessed there by \r\nthousands of people have the same shape as the ufo(s) in the sky above the animal i captured the picture of in 2007. it is a large v shape and it looks exactly like what they describe and show in the movie. it gives me the chills when i think about it! this makes me believe that what i thought was 3 ufo's in the sky over the animal could be one large ufo like the ones over phoenix years ago. that means these particular aliens could be the same ones that flew over phoenix and areas of arizona years ago. \r\n \r\ni have studied the image of the car and animal many hours going back to 2007. i will add some more information that i have noticed by studying the images and include it in this post. \r\n \r\nthe huge animal on the road that appears to be made up of numerous types of animals is bloated. bloating usually occurs many days after an animal is dead. highway 90 where i captured this image is a major road with traffic so there is no way possible that this animal could have sat there for days! it had to have been dropped or set there by these ufo(s). note the animal, glass, large pool of blood from animal, car, etc had all vanished when i went back to this area about 8 hours later! there is no way that the blood from the animal could have been cleaned up to show no stains on the highway 8 hours after the accident. \r\n \r\nalso note that several faces appear on the animals body. when i witnessed this event it felt like time stood still and there was a quiet like i have never experienced before! there is also a circluar pattern near the animal that looks like something like a ufo might have landed on the highway. it also looks like part of the animal might have been sugically opened on parts of it's body by someone or something.  \r\n \r\nthe other image i captured that night is of a mustang car. it appears to be the vehicle that struck the animal. but like many people say the damage to it would be much greater if it actually struck this animal. there were two men on the scene that night but the police have no record of this occurring. i spoke with all police departments in that area including state police. i actually spoke with an officer that was patrolling the exact highway and time of occurence and he saw nothing. i believe they are all telling the truth. was the image of the police officer, the other well dressed man, and the car created to make it look like a car accident? could this be because the animal was accidently dropped from the alien craft? i really do not know but i do have my own beliefs about the representation of this event.  \r\n \r\nthe car from that night has an image of what looks like an alien on the side drivers door. i have a zoomed in image saved of this. i have studied this image and it is obvious that the alien is holding something in it's hand. it is blurry and hard to tell what it is. to me it looks like someone with blue clothes on and a blue cone shaped hat on their head. this person seems to be hugging a little girl. are they trying to send us a message with this image? but why? what does it mean? \r\n \r\ni am certain that this event was not from this earth! 100 percent certain!! this is why i want other's that are experts with photography, aliens, ufo's, etc to help me learn more about what occurred. i am just as curious about aliens, ufo's etc as many other people are! i know that what i captured is significant and unusual evidence that can help us to discover what we seek to know! \r\n \r\ni also know like most all of us know that the gov't is also very interested in learning more about aliens and ufo's. i believe they want to learn more about alien craft for air national defense advantages. i am all for national security i just wish they would give public disclosure and admit what they know. lately gov't vehicles have been watching me when i travel to the area of my vision from 2007. for those that don't know marked and un marked gov't vehicles are almost always either black or white in color with solid black tinted windows. i saw many of these vehicle here 2 weeks post katrina the largest disaster in u.S. history. \r\n\r\n \r\ni am including a new video i posted on youtube in this post here. this video is of the picture i captured of the animal form that night. it is lite up better so you can see more detail. i will also include the zoomed in image that looks like the alien is holding something in the air. this image appears on the drivers side door of the strange car. i will also include my facebook and youtube url for those that want to know more about my beliefs and info in regards to this event. i hope that together we can help to both prove that aliens exist and also learn from them and solve the mysteries we seek answers to! \r\n\r\n[links moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg]\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27494,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.9109984,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01232011-0009","longitude":-90.3867169,"occurred":1172831400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,   Disc,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1295824924000,"summary":"Unidentifiable animal and strange car with ufo's present","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/27494_submitter_file1__Animalfrom3-2-2007001.MOD","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/27494_submitter_file2__UnknownObject006-1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/27494_submitter_file3__charlessphotocar.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1423,"locationName":"Boutte, Louisiana","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:75002"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1912}
