night sky over the east coast of cape breton last night at 9:15. the light was quite large and was very different from the usual things spotted in our very dark sky's, such as stars, planes etc. it was traveling pretty fast on a scale of one to ten in speed, it was about a seven. it was traveling from north to south and before it was out of sight it seemed to blink off and disappeared. when he returned home there were messages on his answering machine from some family and friends, saying that they had seen something very odd in the sky. after speaking with them it was determined that they too had seen the same glowing object in the sky. \r\n\r\ni was contacted by my uncle, due to my knowledge and understanding of these phenomenons. i have spent the last 9 years researching and examining sightings.  \r\n\r\ni have never made this story public but feel now is the time.\r\n\r\njuly 2001. sydney nova scotia.\r\n\r\n2:30 in the morning. my best friend and i had just walked outside for a cigarette. we sat side by side on the curb and chatted for a few minutes, when we noticed a flash in the sky. we both looked up and seen something that to this day neither of us could explain. a massive ufo that span at least a mile in width. it was from my estimation, only 1000 feet off the ground and it lit up the sky. there were five massive lights on the object. each light approximately the size of a school bus. the lights flashed from both ends to the center. the light almost looked like a glowing fluid that moved in waves. we were shocked! it hoovered in one spot for at least 5 minutes. during this time my friend and i were trying to come up with an explanation for what we were seeing. there was only one explanation, a ufo. suddenly.... the object flew straight up into, what had to be space and hooked off in a westerly direction and disappeared into behind the star. we were both speechless. only after it was gone, did we realize that it had made no noise what so ever. to this day i feel haunted by what we seen and have become increasingly obsessed with finding the proof, that........... we are not alone.\r\n\r\n*(wit's name deleted -- cms/sg).\r\n

matched my shot were possible ufo's, not fighter jets.  since i didnt notice the object while i was outside i have no detailed info on its movements. one thing i found interesting was a purplish arc

be about a few thousand feet in the air and hundred to a few hundred feet apart. four made a sort of square configuration and 1 was trailing behind. they did not seem connected. they were headed from the northeast towards the southwest. it was partly cloudy and the clouds were moving generally to the east. as the lights moved overhead i noticed an additional 3 trailing behind by a couple of hundred feet and separated a couple of hundred feet. i watched for about 5 minutes until they disappeared into the clouds. at there rate of speed it would take about 1 minute to cover ~90 degrees of sky. i then went inside for about 5 minutes and then back outside to see if there were more lights. there were 2 more lights, separated by about the same distance apart, and they also appeared to be coming from the northeast. at this point, i climbed to my roof to see if i could see any more approaching from the horizon. i could see a red light traveling above the rio grand river, ~ 5-10 miles away, but heading south. after watching for ~ 2min and this light disappearing, i waited for another 5 minutes and didn't see any more lights. i teach an astronomy lab at the university, so i am familiar with celestial objects and what conventional aircraft look like at night. these objects were silent, small, and very bright. the center of the light was a bright white - red, and seemed to glow solid red. i've never seen anything like it. i'm curios if anyone happened to video tape the objects or get a picture. please contact me if you have any questions","distance":"Over One

 at the same time i saw a single engine plane to the ese of me, but in front of another mountain, at roughly the same distance, flying in front of the other mountain.  an analogie for how slow the objects were moving to the plane in front of the mountain, would be to compare 3 people walking in slow motion to a person running.  i watched them for 10 minutes and they disappeared behind the mountain.  i was in the navy, and i'm aware san diego has a lot of military activity, but these were something i couldn't explain.  after i left the area, i was traveling west on highway 8 when to the north i noticed what looked like an f-18 moving extremley fast at about 2,000 ft altitude, in the direction i saw the objects.  that was about 10-15 minutes after i had left the parking lot watching the objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":27466,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.8026331,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01202011-0008","longitude":-116.9557369,"occurred":1295551440000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Oval,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1295588940000,"summary":"3 balls moving very slowly,  no change in direction or speed.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Tijuana","timeZoneName":"America/Tijuana","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"El Cajon, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:75413"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Wichita","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am seeing a blue light from my bedroom window a blue light flashing realy fast. for the last 45 to 50 minuts. and its over the air bass in wichita ks, ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":27465,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.6946961,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01202011-0007","longitude":-97.3360848,"occurred":1295578320000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1295582743000,"summary":"A blue light flashing realy fast over the air bass.","tags":["flash","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Wichita, Kansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:75414"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"West Jordan","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I remember it was a sunny, summer day. blue skies and warm. it was a saturday, and myself, my husband and 13yr old son were running errands, and i think we ate lunch prior to this also. we were stopped at the intersection on redwood road and 9800 south at the stop light. the all of a sudden we heard a loud boom in the car!! our windows were rolled up, and we don't think it was a car backfire at all. it sounded like a shotgun went off inside of the car. i started shaking and tried to turn to see if my son was ok in the back seat. i was disoriented, so were they. my husband was checking himself for blod on his shirt and so was my son. i looked down at myself also, but i was frieghtened that i would see blood. it was like a jolt hit us or something. i finally said \"is everyone ok?\" my son replied, \" yea mom i'm ok\". we were all ok. the light turned green and we started to go finally. no one around us was affected, by that i mean others in cars around us. we were all saying what the heck was that? it was very strange and weird. my son felt like maybe we were hit by a time warp and got put back or something. it took me an hour to calm down from shaking and being scared. i still won't drive around that area at all. we have had other sightings and strange things happen to us. but that day still frightens me a lot!! the lady from idaho's comments from today made me remeber this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27464,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.6124098,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01202011-0006","longitude":-111.9341731,"occurred":1249023600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1295576702000,"summary":"Heard a loud boom, then possible time warp?","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":538,"locationName":"West Jordan, Utah","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:75415"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Francisco","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was going to get something downstairs and as i passed the window i saw a blue orb.  didnt think much of it till i saw it move.  it was also the color that made me notice it as it was a dim blue.  i couldnt understand why a flying aircraft wouldn't have a brighter light on it. i thought this was strange so i went to my room and grabbed my camera and then proceeded to my deck to record it on film. it went back and forth then descended.  it could be a helicopter in movement but there was no sound.  helicopters fly around all the time but you hear them quite clearly and this object was only 40 blocks from me. i would like to know what it was even if its just something explainable.  do helicoptors all have blinking strobs so that other craft can see it?
