was utilizing a canon rebel xti tripod mounted.  i spent about thirty minutes taking pictures.  the shutter speed was varied between 1/40\" and 25\".  i took about thirty pictures.  the variation in shutter speed was intended to assist in capturing the clouds and ring around the moon.\r\n\r\nthe tripod was set in three different positions during this entire shoot.  there were only two pictures that have a multi-color object.  i have assumed this might have been created by a reflection of light on the lens but there was no light other than the moon.  what i find interesting is the picture where the object is sphere shaped and stacked is how the clouds appear to be effected by the object.  it also appears there are shadows on the spheres.  these images are exactly as shot and have not

it seems like it's just a reflection of light on the lens; but it's not uniform in how it appears.  in the two photos it looks like something flying into the picture and then hovering over the moon.

(like everywhere else in the united states...This has been a rough winter world wide so far.)\r\n\r\ni immediately noticed something irregular up there.  i saw this unusual flashing, sparkling and pulsating light.  it is important to note...This thing was not in the spot that venus usually aligns in the morning.  this thing was lower than venus normally is and it was drifting back and forth.  i grabbed my camcorder and filmed it with a mini tripod to keep it steady.  i did the best i could for just waking up.  sure you can say it is venus...Until i zoom in.  i tried to zoom in and out to give the object some background and some points of reference as the sun was just starting to come up.  i tried to keep quiet too, but lost it a few times, so i am sorry for the language.  (disclaimer for the youngsters)\r\n\r\nright click and select \"open with\" and select \"windows images and fax viewer\" then zoom in...Use the little zoom icon to zoom in...And point it to the right of the white object you will then see 2 objects.  i saw only 2...The white one (the disk) and red one (mars maybe?) (i say that later on in the footage you will get later), but then there is also a blue object below it. you can see the white object is leaning downward is is clearly a disk shaped object.  you can also see the rotation and motion in the footage and the photo.  at some points in the video you can clearly see it is a silver disk with an electromagnetic glow around it.  the red object could be mars, but i swear...As i was filming...I did see the red object moving too. video footage to come later.\r\n\r\nwhen i upload my camera footage...There are few doubts left over after you watch the whole thing, but i took 2 photos and this is one of them.\r\n\r\nplus...When i zoom in and it goes nuts...There is without a doubt some type of rotation.  the object made absolutely no noise and it is camouflaged as a star. that has been my theory and they are always up there...At night and it is top secret because there is nothing we can do about it. if that is not a security threat, then what is?\r\n\r\nto the avid sky watcher...Dig in...Take your camera and zoom in on any large shining object and eventually we will all expose them by simply zooming in our cameras...And you will see for yourself that my camouflage theory has always been correct. uncover the truth...They are up there for you to see if you make the effort. \r\n\r\ni have seen one seriously close...You will not be able to see the details on the craft until it comes close, but then you will run and no freaking way you will worry about proving it was real and you will not be interested in filming it.  trust me on this...Your curiosity will be satisfied and you will know within one second that is not from earth.\r\n\r\nyou will know what it is and you will run.\r\n\r\nmost people are not even close to being ready to film and hoaxes ruin all credibility for the real sightings and that is a damn shame.\r\n\r\nwas i filming different stages of an abduction?  were they observing or exploring?  why did this thing show up near chicago 2 times in a one month period?  who knows?  anyway...I filmed from a 2nd floor (open) window, then i moved outside to get another angle in the 15 degree weather here in park ridge, il.  you can see the object move slowly.\r\n\r\ni totally admit i am an insignificant person. i am not a doctor, scientist, or anyone even remotely important...I am a complete and total nobody, so for what it is worth...Here is my opinion...And advice...(which i know it is not worth much of anything..And you are reading this saying who the hell is this clown and who the hell cares about his opinion?)\r\n\r\ni am here to tell you...You see something...Zoom in on it...Not all stars are stars...But i advise you...Do not get close...If it comes near you...Get the hell away from it.  \r\n\r\nthey know full well venus sits in the southeast sky in chicago right now...And most people will explain it away.  yes...It is in the southeast, but not where venus usually is.  it was much lower and it was moving and changing shape...And something was coming off the object several times.  the video...You can see what i mean, but here is one of the 2 photos i took.\r\n\r\ni have nothing to prove.  i already know aliens are real and i just have this feeling that many of you out there will have your own experience and i have no doubt what i have seen up close before this event...Was extraterrestrial and not of this earth.  within one second...All my questions were answered.\r\n\r\nno one has to tell me. if the cia were to tell me they are not for real and scientists or skeptics that are smarter than i am...Their opinions would only matter to me if they saw the object up close too.\r\n\r\notherwise...They are wasting their breath and time.\r\n\r\ncome talk to me when you have been close...And a beam comes down at you. once you can explain that away...After experiencing that...You can have your own opinion, but you will never be able to change my opinion.\r\n\r\nyou want to see a ufo?\r\n\r\nyou have to be active about it and put some effort into seeing one.  in nice weather...Take a glance up in the sky at night.  summer time...Take an hour per night and watch...I bet you will eventually see it.  \r\n\r\nsearch youtube for: \"ufo in hd\" there are multiple videos uploading now.\r\n \r\nkeywords or tags:\r\nufo ufos orb orbs alien aliens extraterrestrial experimental aircraft mufon real close details disk unidentified flying object unexplained lights chicago il illinois sighting sightings spotted spots footage ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"01:34:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":27452,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8867536,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01192011-0002","longitude":-87.6226882,"occurred":1295183460000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,   Disc,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1295453529000,"summary":"Electromagnetic camouflage over silver disk","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/27452_submitter_file1__DrakeDietrickStudio016.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Chicago, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:75815"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"St George","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was traveling alone on i-15 from los angeles on my way to davenport, ia during september 1978.

or early january 1992.  i was in my bedroom with the lights off listening to a casette tape and looking out the window to the north.  there was a very bright star that held my attention as i sang along to sanitarium by metallica.  suddenly the light changed and the star began moving to the west.  as it did so, another \"star\" came from the east to replace the star in the north.  once it got to the relative location of the first craft it stopped moving and just hovered there, looking like a very bright star.  i was astounded and kept watching.\r\n\r\nafter approximately 15 minutes, the craft in the north moved off to the location in the west, another craft from the east took its location in the north.  at this point i donned a coat and went outside to get a view of the entire sky.  sure enough, the original craft was now in the south hovering with one in the west, one in the north, and another in the east.\r\n\r\nwhen they changed positions again, the craft in the south continued on to the east over the missouri bluffs, leaving 3: north, west, south.  there they hovered.  after another 15 minutes or so, they changed positions again with the southern craft continuing on toward the east.  \r\n\r\nthis time i saw the lights on the underside of the craft and could make out a silhouette against the moon.  the lights on the underside formed a chevron (as opposed to a full triangle).  i can't remember how many lights there were but i've drawn an approximation on the attached image. i remember no sound.  against the moon, it appeared the craft had wings like a standard military jet except the wings angled up from the body of the craft.  i'm pretty sure there was a stabilizer, too.  \r\n\r\none by one, the objects would hover silently like stars for a period

him calling me was odd in and of it's self, as i was the one that called him usually. his voice seemed different, tense, then out of the blue he said he had some thing to tell me, i got rather conserned as there was an urgency in his voice that i had \" never \" heard before. he proceeded to tell me about an event that took place near pike lake sask. can. at my grandparents place. he and his brother paul were sitting around the kitchen table just talking passing time, killing the after noon together when they desided they would head outside and putts around in the yard, as they headed out the back door my uncle paul in the lead and my father close behind, paul stepped into a \"bright \" light that was coming from above and my father was frozen in the door way, literaly. he said he tried to move but was unable to, he stood there and watched as his brother carried on a conversation with what ever was up there as his gaze was fixed up at the source of the light. dad said he was not speaking in any language that he could recognize. he (dad) had no idea how long they were there for. when the light left he fell forward through the doorway, and asked his brother \"what the hell just happened, and who the hell were you talking too\"? his brother just turned around looking at him like 'he' was crazy as he didn't know what he was talking about. his brother had no memory of what had just happened, and left my father with the heavy burden of keeping the secret because who would beleive him. he followed that up with another event that took place on that same property but to my grandfather some years before that. after he was done i could hear the relief in his voice, and we never talked about it again. i myself am sure i saw what i would call ufo's back in the 70's, so i didn't write my dad off as a nut. i have great respect for my father, and only known him to be a man of his word. i happen to be channel serfing and caught an episode of mufon on the id channel, and

i've ever seen.  also, it was more spherical than blimp-like.  soon other identical lights came into view, passing from behind tall buildings on the west side of 2nd avenue.  i pulled onto the next street i could, 119th street, and immediately hopped out and started filming on my cell phone.  total i would say there were 7 lights that were in the sky, but i was only able to capture 4 on my phone.  three seemed to fly together in a pyramid formation before the 4th came flying into view.  they didn't fly in consistent patterns either, sometimes changing directions distinctly.  at the end of this experience, which lasted about 4 or 5 minutes, each light seemed to climb higher into the clouds until they were no longer visible.  if they were balloons, they were definitely producing light and massive in size.  i didn't see any smoke trails or quick, random movements to make me think they were flairs.  the flight patterns, while they did change directions, didn't alter in velocity, from

than never (i hope).\r\n\r\ntime: it was around 1989-1990, so i was about 13 or 14. it was around 4:30\r\nor 5:00 am.\r\n\r\nplace: just outside of cottage grove, oregon (right next door to the delight\r\nvalley elementary school). \r\n\r\nbasic background info: mom was a single parent, & to make ends meet she had\r\na rural paper route. i was \"lucky\" enough to get to help before school.\r\nshe'd drive, pull up to the boxes, & i'd stuff the papers in the boxes. so\r\nthat's why we were both out there so early in the morning. \r\n\r\nwe had stopped to get some more paper-bundles from the back of the truck. in\r\nfront of us, against the night sky we saw 3 lights in an\r\nequilateral-triangular pattern. the thing just hovered in the sky. there was\r\nno sound. after a few moments (a minute, perhaps) it went from \"not moving\"\r\nto \"moving blindingly fast\" and zig-zagging in an apparently random\r\npattern....Then it would stop, & stop instantly. \r\n\r\nafter the \"zig-zagging\", it zoomed away. at the instant it disappeared, i\r\nsaw a bright flash that filled up the entire sky for a fraction of a second.\r\nthis next part is very difficult to describe, but i'll try my best....\r\n\r\nat the instant it disappeared, during the moment it flashed, the flash was\r\naccompanied by something i can only describe the following way:\r\n\r\ny'know how in the opening credits of star trek: the next generation, the\r\nenterprise zips into \"warp drive\", & at the instant it does there's that\r\ndiamond-shaped flash? it was kind of like that, except the flash wasn't\r\ndiamond-shaped. it was sort of like a tangled-web of lightning-bolts (the apparent size of my hand at arms-length), but only visible for the tiniest fraction of a second. i'm not sure if this was\r\na real effect of the object, or if it was some kind of effect the flash had on my eyes, like when someone turns on a light when you're not ready for it, & you have that afterimage in your vision for a moment...I only saw the \"lightning effect\" for the briefest of moments, & there was no afterimage so it was probably real, but i'm not sure. my mother didn't notice the \"lightning effect\", or if she did, she doesn't remember. \r\n\r\nafter the \"big flash\" it was gone....For a minute or two. then we saw it (or\r\nwas it another, separate object of the same kind?) drift over the hills to\r\nour left. then it drifted back over the hills & was gone.  \r\n\r\nhere's where the plot thickens:\r\n\r\nmom & i have talked about this many times & she would occasionally reference\r\nthe metallic appearance of the thing. i never understood how she could\r\ndiscern the appearance of the surface because even though it was close, it\r\nwas still far enough away that all i could see was 3 lights in a triangle\r\npattern. i would tell her this. she would always respond with, \"but it was\r\nright over us!\". i would think, \"ummm.....Nooo....It was off in the distance\r\nin front of us just above the hills\". it turns out that, at some point mom\r\nlooked out of her window & looked up...And it was directly over the truck.\r\nshe said it was \"maybe 2 or 3 tree-lengths\" above us, & so big she couldn't\r\nsee the sky. that's when she started the truck & drove off (fast!). i don't\r\nremember this happening...Probably because this thing could travel huge\r\ndistances virtually instantaneously without making any noise, so perhaps it\r\nwas only above us for a second or two, & i just didn't notice.  \r\n\r\nyears later, i found out that others have seen similar triangular objects\r\n(like the one sighted over belgium) \r\n\r\nsome other points (i'm sure you've heard this stuff before...I certainly\r\nhave, but regardless here it is)\r\n\r\n-it could go from \"not moving\" to \"moving blindingly fast\" instantly\r\n\r\n-it could turn on sharp angles without slowing down\r\n\r\n-it could stop without decelerating\r\n\r\n-it could go in any direction at any time without changing its orientation\r\nrelative to its direction (ie, it didn't have to \"face\" the direction it was\r\ntraveling)\r\n\r\n-it didn't make any noise\r\n\r\n-it didn't have any apparent exhaust or contrail\r\n\r\n-it was obviously a piece of manufactured hardware, & not an amorphous blob\r\nof light or comet or meteor or any sort of natural meteorological\r\nphenomenon. \r\n\r\n\r\nso there you have it. i'm sure you've all heard this stuff before, but now\r\nyou've got one more account.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

above the south san francisco area (i think).  it was hard to pinpoint its exact location as the fog was steadily increasing and gradually obstructing my view, but it was located not too far from the coast.  if i had to guess, i���d say it was flying/hovering about 200-400 feet from the ground.  since it was hard to tell where the light/orb was coming from, it was hard to judge its speed as it moved from side to side and up and down in a somewhat erratic fashion.  it didn���t seem to be moving at a tremendous speed, but if it was indeed above south san francisco, i���d guess it was moving at varied speeds, crossing a mile or two in about 5-10 seconds (again, very difficult to judge).   it would move one direction, slow down, and move the other direction in no apparent pattern, sometimes gaining some altitude, sometimes descending.  there was never a sudden jolt in speed.  there didn���t seem to be any other lights and i didn���t notice a spotlight coming from it.  i���m not aviation expert, but it didn���t seem to behave like a helicopter.  i watched it for about 5 minutes then it seemed to descend and disappear.  i went back inside and looked out my window with the same viewpoint and about 10 minutes later saw it emerge again.  i then went back out on my roof and watched it for another 5 minutes until the fog became heavy enough to completely block my view of it.  i don���t believe it was blinking, but its luminosity seemed to vary - but i attributed this to the fog.  very weird.","distance":"Over One

wide and was about 150' to 200' in the air.  it was about 200 yards from us.  it seemed to be flying at about 10-20mph. i thought it was a small plane, but then noticed the triangular formation which caught my attention.  i rolled down my window as we were passing it in the opposite direction and could not hear a sound over the \"driving wind\".  my wife saw it, but she was driving and we didn't really discuss it, nor did i reveal to her how peculiar i thought it was.  if i were driving by myself, i would have pulled over, but i was only able to watch it for a little less than 2 minutes until houses eventually blocked my view of it.\r\n\r\ni don't mind mufon contacting me by email if my event is of interest. i would like to know if anyone else in the area reported similar occurrences.\r\n\r\nplease don't post my name online.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
