space center visitor center museum.  we got there about 5:15 pm and left and headed back towards cocoa beach, florida shortly thereafter because the visitor center was about to close.  about twenty minutes later we arrived just in front of the ron john surf shop and stopped at a red light when we noticed two very bright flashes that looked like lightning to the front of the vehichle, even though it wasn't storming and was hardly overcast.\r\n\r\nwe arrived at doubletree hotel in cocoa beach a few minutes later and tried to open our hotel room door with our key cards.  i had one in my wallet, my fiance had one in her purse.  neither card would open our door.  we went to the front desk and told the clerk so she recharged the cards so they would open the door.  both had been cleared of their magnetic signature.  the clerk told us that could happen if the card got exposed to magnetic charges or too close to a cell phone.  both cards were stored in seperate places in the vehichle, however.  which means the vehichle must have encountered a magnetic field of some sort that erased both cards.\r\n\r\nwe also had a strange interference with our gps on the way back.  we turned it on as soon as we left the visitor center and it contininuously blurted out \" you are exceeding the speed limit\" even when we came to almost a complete stop at a stop sign.\r\n\r\nso, i looked on the internet, because i immediately thought it might have to do with the space port area and immediately found blogs about florida's space port  having its own magnetic field, and also about some sort of magnetisphere devise that recently arrived at the port for deployment to space in february of 2011.  only a few weeks away.\r\n\r\ni immediately became concerned about my debit card's magnetic signature being affected, so i went to the atm and checked it out.  it appeared intact.  so whatever it was, it was strong enough to wipe out my hotel key card and my gps but not my atm card.\r\n\r\nprobably not a ufo, but definetly something very strange proven to be happening with the magnetic fields around nasa's space port located just north of cocoa beach.

back porch smoking a cigarette. i was staring at the stars, when i noticed an unusually bright sphere. it appeared to be a bright star at first, but upon closer inspection it observed odd behavior. the object would glide about in figure-8 motions or from side to side. other times the object would fly noticeably further away from its previous position, going towards my direction. at times the object seemed to flicker or glow at different intensities. my friend denied at first that the object was anything other then a star, but upon closer inspection order by myself, he began to realize that this was not an ordinary light in the sky. when close enough, the object's body was slightly illuminated by the bright light. it appeared to be either a triangle, disk, or combination of both. (was hard to see, it is dark outside.) after seeing this, my friend was overcome with a fear i have never seen in him before, as he is a very intelligent, stolid, and skeptical individual. i felt a sense of unrest, as if something was wrong. after retreating indoors for a while, we decided to return outside to see if the object was still there, but before we could get to the door we both heard a very strange, disturbing sound. it sounded as if a cricket was chirping (think signs,but different), but with tones that were easily definable. (it sounded as if two individuals were speaking in our direct vicinity.) it is winter, and no crickets or similar insects are about that this time. after going back into my room following this, we both shared extreme feelings of dread. eventually, we gained enough courage to leave my room and inspect our surroundings. (finding nothing.) the ufo was still present when i went to sleep that night, but in a much different location in the sky. i, and other friends and family have seen this object many nights in a row, including last night.

11-12 th in 1985 the geminid metor shower was going to take place, but it was going to be at 11pm-3am before you could see it well so i went to bed at 2:00pm that afternoon and my father promised to wake me to see it at 11pm.  at 11pm or right after johnny carson went off, my dad came and woke me and i took my telescope outside.  i was super excited to watch \"falling stars\" for the first time and we watched for a while.  about 12 or later, my dad gave up and went inside.  i was standing on a huge back porch that was about 1000 square feet.  in the back we had a pasture and a barn to the left so there was pleany of open room for viewing.  all of a sudden, from behind me going west to east was a huge form in the sky.  it was flat on the bottom and the size of at least 3 football fields as it took up most of the viewing sky.  i saw a ton of small lights that were weird white color and now know they were led type color.  my first thought was that it looked like a flying battle ship or aircraft carrier.  i remember feeling intrigued and not scared, but still get emotional and teary when i think on it.  i was thinking how suprised of its size and how low it was flying.  couldnt have been more than 1000 feet in the air if that.  since it was dark, i could not make out any defining features. but it was moving slow..And was going west to east.  then what happened next was strange, i had lost time.  i was looking at the object and the whole time could not have been more than 30 seconds before it happened.  i heard my dad call my name and say it was cold, 2am..And i needed to get my butt back inside.  i was looking at the sky still and the ufo was gone.  i was confused but not lightheaded or anything.  i didnt tell him as i knew he would make fun of me or think i was lying..And my father was not forgiving with lying or pranks.  there is no doubt in my mind this happened and i saw it.  i have been in military intelligence and had a top seceret clearance.  i am a very reliable witness and doing research and reporting myself i tell you you can take out fatique, dosing off, or any other explaination of this other than i saw it.

to say they were human) moving around inside. i could not see the shape of the craft, only the windows. almost immediately, after checking the road (as i was driving), i saw a rear view mirror full of little dancing lights that were dancing in place. an instant later the little lights were no longer visible, but a blue area was visible with a little light adjacent to the opening. i thought the little light was the first star i saw that night, because it was the darkest night i had ever seen.A foggy haze had enveloped the little light just before i saw two more lights, about the same size as the first light,come into the opening as if they had come from behind a curtain (which was the black night sky). they passed through the opening and joined the first light. the opening disappered and the three lights, being in a random formation, came up behind the car as fast as you could blink your eyes. they were so still, they looked as though they were glued to the rear window. they made no sound. they were about five feet above the gold road, about three feet apart, and about five inches in diameter. after some time, two of the lights moved as if to pass on my right side, then they disapered,one light stayed with us just before we were going to cross hover dam. the light would not come into the lighted area with us. the light disapered just before the lighted area. during all the events taking place, i was trying decide if these lights were motor cycles, a big truck, a bus or a car. i did not consider at the time that these lights might be out of this world. how can a hole appear in the night sky and lights pass through it? how is that possible? i was not under the influence of anything! i was not even too tired to be driving! i was on the gold road to los vegas. just checking the rear view mirror. i thought the first object was a bus or train. my feelings were normal, i was not stressed, worried, or afraid. i know what i saw was real,i just dont know for sure what they were. i have not experienced anything like this since 1983.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

the army national guard for the past two years and three months. i served in the army national guard for twenty one years. my rank was staff sergeant. i have been deployed twice in my military carrier. my first deployment was desert shield and desert storm in 1990-1991. my second deployment was the iraq war in 2003-2004. in my twenty one years i have been trained to be observant, objective, and to be aware of my surroundings at all times. to include other types of training and to identify many types of enemy vehicles and aircraft at a distance, up close and by just their silhouette. during peace time training and war time deployments, i have seen aircraft ranging from spy drones, helicopters, fighter jets, stealth fighters, stealth bombers, large attack, cargo, and bomber aircraft. i have seen all these up close and afar. i have witnessed them fly by day, night and in adverse weather. i have witnessed some of these use their after burners in all of the for mentioned conditions. \r\n\r\nwhat i saw on 27 november 2010 was nothing i have ever seen before. i received my call to go to work at 0530 hrs. on 27 november 2010. i was scheduled to get on an empty coal train headed west to fremont, nebraska. my on duty time, as a conductor, was for 0700 hrs. me and my engineer, whom shall remain anonymous, got on board our train and departed at approximately 0800 hrs. and headed west. our arrival time at fremont, nebraska was approximately 1455 hrs. approximately 1500 hrs., we had stopped our train and were waiting for the out bound crew to arrive so they could relieve us from our train. it was a partly cloudy day with blue skies. i believe it was either cirrostratus or cirrocumulus type cloud cover that afternoon. as i looked into the sky, i witnessed an eastbound aircraft flying erratically. just like several of the other aircraft in the sky, i had believed this also to be a commercial or military aircraft due to the fact it was leaving a contrail behind it. it was flying at approximately the same altitude as some of the others. except this was making radical coarse changes. i observed it flying in an s pattern and the contrail actually ended up shaped like the letter s. it was now flying in a slight north easterly direction. i asked my engineer if he had seen what i had observed and he had no idea what i was talking about. i pointed to the sky in the direction of the aircraft and he said ���huh, it looks like an s���. he didn���t seem interested and continued to do his own thing. i continued to watch to see if it would make any other coarse changes. then i observed a grayish, dark looking void directly in front of the aircraft. this void was approximately four to five hundred yards long. the void appeared to be exactly the same width of the aircraft. then a weird thing happened. this void started to slightly curve to my left, (it���s right) and with the aircraft following, went back on coarse in it���s easterly direction. i continued to watch it, this time through the side window which was to my left facing south. at first i thought it was a trick of light, or something to do with the window, or the combination of the two. i then opened my side window and stuck my head out. the void was still there. i then looked at the other aircraft. not one had a void anywhere around them. what was strange, was that this void was not just cutting through the blue sky, it was cutting through the clouds and coming out of the clouds before the aircraft. the void look as though it was leading the aircraft. the length of this void never varied. it appeared as though the aircraft was flying into the void, but at the same time it appeared it wasn���t. like i stated before, the aircraft seem to follow it. the void was never behind the aircraft, nor was the aircraft surrounded by this void at any time. i studied this void for some time. i realized i could not see through it and there was no distortion of the sky or clouds around this void. i watched it until i could no longer see it. i could not identify what type of aircraft it was except to say, that it appeared to be the same size and similar shape as the others in the air that day. the aircraft appeared to be shiny and silver in color. i watched the other aircraft to see if this would happen again. i did not observe anything like this with any of the other aircraft that day or any aircraft in the days that followed. approximately three to four minutes had gone by from the beginning of my sighting to the end\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27405,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4333909,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152011-0005","longitude":-96.4981467,"occurred":1290898800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nebraska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1295127483000,"summary":"Object

in and ready for bed, and had just come out of the bathroom from brushing my teeth. as i walked from the bathroom down the stairs to my bed-room i heard this extremely loud buzzing/humming/almost grinding sound coming from outside that was so loud the windows of my house were rattling. curious as to what it was and expecting to open the door to see a helicopter flying too low, or a low flying jet passing over i opened the door to look outside, only to see something i couldn't have ever imagined in my wildest dreams. peering out from the front door of my house facing south, directly in front of my point of view there was a large (guesstimating 150 ft. in diameter) metallic, solid black sphere hovering about 150 yards from where i was standing and maybe 150-200 feet in the air. directly in the dead center of the sphere was a blueish white sort of laser like beam spread out from the craft, and rotating back and forth and up and down very slowly as if it was searching for something, and as i was standing there this beam passed directly over me. i didn't feel any heat, or pain from it, i was only slightly blinded for a split second... but this was well after i'd gotten a good solid 20-30 second view of the object. the sound emanating from this object was this intense humming, grinding, almost like the sound made when you run over a tree root with a lawnmower, or when a construction worker is using a pile-drive minus the chipping sound, or when some1 presses down on an object too hard with a grinder, but consistent and continuous, and again,loud enough that the sound was rattling my 2 story house's storm windows. i'm shocked it didn't wake up the whole neighborhood. after watching for a good 20-30 seconds i wanted to document it somehow, so i ran into the house to grab my iphone with the hopes that the object was low and close enough that the resolution on my phone wouldn't have trouble capturing the object, as it usually does anything from a distance at night. here's where things get even weirder. the entire time i was in the house to grab my phone was all of 15 seconds. mind you, when i came outside at first the object was not moving, just hovering. within that span of 15 seconds i was inside, i came back outside to find that the object was gone from it's original spot, but i could still clearly hear it. thinking that it had to be nearby, i looked around, and then ran (as fast as i could in house shoes) around to the back of the house to find that the object had traveled at least 2 miles away and all i could see was the faint remnant of the beam still moving as if it was searching or scanning for something, before the object disappeared behind the ridge-line. i didn't bother trying to film, i knew it was too far away for me to have any chance of capturing. here's where it gets even more odd. as i'm standing watching it disappear behind the ridge-line, i hear another loud sound of a craft, only this 1 is familiar. i turn around to see 3 black helicopters in formation, flying very low, and hauling ass, with only their spotlights on facing directly in front of them. they followed the exact same direction i saw the craft travel. now, i have witnessed strange lights i couldn't explain in the sky before, i have even had 1 ufo experience in particular that altered my whole perception of how a viewed physics, reality, religion, and what i perceived as possible and impossible, but this... this was different. with all of those other sightings i got a sense of excitement, wonder, and even at times warmth and comfort. what i felt when i saw this object was an almost sickening sense of fear, discomfort, and dread. with all the other sightings i wanted to see it again, i was excited to have seen them. this thing... i wished i hadn't seen it, and it had me so uneasy i had a lot of trouble not picturing it when i was trying to sleep. every-time i got the image in my head, and remembered that sound it made, it sent chills up my spine. i'm asking the ufo community, any1 who reads this who has seen this object whether in person or in some kind of video they've seen to share their experience with me, as i'm hoping to find some answers as to why or even what this thing could have been. thank you for your time, and keep watching the skies!","distance":"101-500

vehicle on the street by my house, i looked straight ahead out the front of my windshield to see what i thought was a shooting star but quickly noticed the ���shooting star��� never fell, instead it was traveling at an upward angle, it was pulsating three different colors, red, orange and white, it was never just one solid color almost like a flame would change colors, but it wasn't fire it looked like more of a glow.   i noticed this object seemed to have a tail at the end of it, the whole thing began moving upward then back down several times and moved like a caterpillar or a jellyfish. i couldn't believe what i was seeing, i quickly called my boyfriend and described the object and asked him to try to look for it where he was at,  but he was unable to see what i was seeing from his location, as i continued to watch this object in the sky for about 10 minutes it started looking more like just a star, what looked to be stationary so i hung up my phone and began taking pictures. i snapped 15 photos on my samsung behold ii, 5 mega pixel camera back to back, i left my finger pressed and did not release it, i had my elbows resting on the dashboard so that i wouldn���t move the phone. in all the photos the object is clearly in another position in the sky and moving up and down as if it was jumping around. i would have taken more photos however my phone had a very low battery and it shut off. i stayed staring at the object for and additional 10 minutes after the photos where taken then decided to go inside to charge my phone, i hesitated to exit my vehicle because i was a little frightened however, i was excited that i was able to capture it on my camera phone. i went inside and charged my phone about five minutes, in attempts to get video of it, but when i came back outside it was no where to be found. after watching this object in the sky for about 20 minutes i can definetly say that it was an unidentified flying  object... i just want to know

go to work in that building.  i was early so i reclined on one of the large, cylindrical concrete sculptures outside of the entrance near the convention center (essentially lying on my back).  i was looking upward at a patch of sky that was between the staples center and nokia center.  as there was a lakers game this night, there was commotion on the street and numerous spot lights were shining into the sky, criss-crossing each other.  i was watching these crossing lights and noticed that when one looked at a star, one could create an optical illusion such that the star looked like it was moving slowly in relation to the moving spotlights.\r\n\r\noddly, while observing this phenomenon, my eyes caught a small, orange, star or planet-like object that was genuinely moving.  i knew it was moving for real as opposed to the optical illusion i was noticing because i compared its motion to the stability of sky-scrapers and stars.  my heart began to race and i stood up still watching the object.  it was darting across the sky at a quick but not exceedingly fast rate.  it moved in seemingly random directions without stopping at all when it changed direction.  my first thought was that it was a reflection of some kind (perhaps a laser pointer) off of overcast/clouds/smog but the sky was clear enough to see stars even in downtown.  i wanted to call someone's attention to what i was seeing but did not want to lose sight of the object.  i considered the possibility of a helicopter but it was evidently much higher than a helicopter could possibly fly and moving in ways a helicopter could not.  it covered relatively large areas of sky in no time at all, but not such large areas as to seem completely impossible, but i have absolutely no knowledge of any human vehicle that could move in the same way.  i watched the light move around the sky for about 10 to 20 seconds.  the light eventually moved over the staples center from my perspective and i could no longer see it.  i walked partially around the building and was not able to locate it again.\r\n\r\nmy immediate reaction was a sense of some panic and shock.  i am a college educated person.  i am no ufo \"nut\" or devotee.  i have never been opposed to the idea of extra-terrestrials but i also have maintained skepticism.  i have never actively sought a ufo.  i have no real reason to believe that this incident

went to my grandparent���s house in salem, il. it was my mom���s mother and father. well after a great meal and always fresh homemade bread or rolls with lots of homemade butter. we all sat and watched tv or talked and enjoyed the rest of the evening. i was always the center of attention with my granddad.  he just loved to tease me or get me into trouble and mother would always come to my rescue and chew him out or make him stop. granddad should have got the whipping instead of me. but i always managed to get a whooping before we headed back home. \r\nwell this sunday wasn���t any different from any other sunday at mamah and granddads house. and when we would get in the car, the 68 chevrolet biscayne, to go home, my favorite place was always laying on my back, in the back deck below the back window, so i could watch the stars twist and turn when dad would turn a corner or go around a curve. well this night it was a full moon. i watch the moon as we traveled towards home. that is when i saw two small bright white objects appear. they were round in shape, and circling around the moon. they each had different orbital paths and moved fast. i knew they were fast moving because as soon as they disappeared behind the moon they reappeared on the opposite side and traveled around the moon again. they were bright enough that you could see them when they moved across the moon. sometimes these two objects would travel around the moons outside circumference so they were always visible as they traveled around the moon.  i watched in amazement and being young 5 to 6 years of age, did not understand what i was seeing. i told my parents what i was seeing and they dismissed me again as if i were being silly. when i went back to look again these two objects were gone and i never saw them ever again.\r\n\r\nthe attached photo is a rendition of what i saw, that i created just for this report, it is not an actual photo of the objects i recall seeing. it was a clear night with many stars in the sky.

(facing the sun) i can assure you, it was not whispy clouds or stars. i saw something unidentifiable. in the past, late at night i have seen a small white object (not satellites)cross the sky and change direction, but kept it to myself. this latest one was worth mentioning. i'll be keeping my eyes on the sky from now on, and will surely have my camera with me.
