were web cams set up over the world and some in weird places, this one was in a remote location but i dont know where. as well the original picture looked a bit sharper to me but you can zoom in and

were two steady lights almost directly in front of me, just to the left, just a little up into the sky as if it might be a low flying helicopter, about a nickel's diameter in relative size. \"as the crow flies\" they would have been over my house. i hadn't noticed it come into my field of vision, but suddenly noticed that they were moving very slowly, left to right, although they curiously appeared to be a possible plane banking to the left - but moving right? the lights were not blinking, were definitely white circles or spheres, and there were no faa required green nor red lights visible now nor during the entire sighting. kingshighway is two lanes in each direction and the road was very busy with evening commuters like me, so the sighting was via multiple short looks while driving safely. i shortly noticed a small circle of light appear just by the right light, slowly \"descending\" into an equilateral triangle position relative to the other two lights, and became the same size as them. the triangle of lights then appeared to slowly \"elongate.\" i was figuring i was seeing single craft with lights that was changing its orientation while traveling, so i'm still thinking some kind of helicopter when a small fourth circle of light starts to appear between the two \"rear\" lights. while that light became slightly larger, but not as large as the other three lights, two \"lines\" of light started to appear between each of the rear circles. those lines also became slightly longer, while the \"front\" circle became a thick white line having \"grown\" back some. during the perhaps two minutes of the sighting, the object(s) seemed to get slightly closer where it seemed a craft had slowly curved along the sky while i was driving. i started losing it in the trees and buildings almost directly right of me when the object got there. most of the sighting i could see the object out my front windshield, but when i had to look out my right passenger window i deviated from my course and took a right to try to get a better look. i was now driving residential city side streets that are rutted with snow and ice - i glimpsed it only a few short times and quickly lost it through the neighborhood trees and houses.\r\n\r\ngetting home about three minutes later, i parked my car in my driveway and started walking to my front stairs and suddenly i heard a plane start to fly by from my left, coming from behind my house from over the large cemetery across the street. i could clearly hear jet engines but saw an incongruent triangle of steady red lights with a blinking white light between them! i see planes go by my house ever day, being about six miles from the international airport, but i've never seen a plane with all its tipped beacon lights steady red with a bottom blinking white beacon. i continued walking up my stairs and stood and watched for about 30 seconds until i lost it in the nearby trees and homes, never changing that lighting configuration. ironically, this plane came from the direction where white lights were when i lost them about three minutes before.\r\n\r\ni've attached a created representation of the changing of the white lights, and punctuated it with the plane i saw when i got home. when i got in i discovered that one of my computer's main disk drives had failed

approximately 500 feet above the city moving west to east. the objects emitted no audible sound and were changing color from orange to red. the objects were in formation, one behind the other and separated by 20 feet. the objects' shape were roughly globe shaped, somewhat like a chinese lantern. the first group of three past to the east with no sound of any kind. nor were there any contrail or smoke. no smell of exhaust such as jet fuel was evident. a second group of three again approached from the west and at the same height of as the first. with the second group i had the presence of mind

where i stopped at a traffic light. something just happened to catch my eye and in the sky right ahead of us was this very strangely shaped object. in my mind i was not thinking \"ufo\" at all but just \"what is that weird thing i am looking at?\" it was circular shaped and looked like the sun was reflecting off it in a serious way. i thought it was a plane or weather balloon or something except that i had never seen one with such a bright white light. it almost looked like it was made out of glass or something. the middle of it was not shiny but almost seemed transparent in the clear blue sky. what was most noticeable was the shiny, shiny bright white light.\r\n\r\ni said to my husband \"what the heck is that??\" and pointed. he said \"where?\" and was looking around but didn't know i meant up in the sky or just wasn't looking in the right place. it was a bit high in the sky - like as high as i might see a plane or helicopter or whatever.\r\ni repeated \"right there!\" and kept pointing but it started to move horizontally to the left until a nearby tree was crossing the sight of it. i tried to keep my eyes on it and the light turned green so i drove forward so i could get passed the trees to show my husband what i had been looking at. but when i got passed the trees (maybe 5 seconds later) it was nowhere to be seen.\r\nmy husband asked \"well what did it look like?\" so i described the thing and that was when he said \"i think you just saw a ufo\". after a moments thought i came to the conclusion that he might be right. i had never seen such a thing in my life. when i saw it i genuinely was simply curious as to what this strange thing might be. never in my life might i think i would be reporting such a thing. i am in complete awe of what i saw and can not find any other logical explanation. \r\nit occurred to me that it could have been some sort of reflection on my wind shield but no matter how i tried i could not re-create the thing. i am about 100% sure that whatever it was it was definitely there in front of us in the sky. at the speed it was traveling there is no feasible explanation as to where it could have disappeared to s quickly either.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

over our house.  we did not leave our bedroom to see where that object went. the other object continued to hover, but it seemed that it had \"spikey\" lights around it.  the object seemed to go up in altitude and then stop, this went on again for a while.  my wife was now videotaping and the object had gone up in altitude where we had to move to another part of the house to videotape it.  we video taped it from our dining area window and also our family room window.  at times it seemed that the object would move very fast and then stop suddenly, i have never seen anything like this.  \r\n\r\n

ciggerette. to the east, i noticed an extreamly bright object believing it was a planet or satelite initially. appeared to be flying between 60,000-80,000 feet. it was a clear, visable sky with no cloud coverage. the light began to blink, slowly from dim to bright approx. ever 10 seconds, after flying directly over me(45 seconds after inital sighting). i knew then that this was not a satelite because it was too bright, moving too fast and i've never seen a satelite blink. not losing sight of this \"blinking light\", i noticed the sound of a military turbine jet engine. i then saw a small military aircraft flying into the same direction(west) as the \"blinking light\" at approx. 5,000ft and climbing fast, several miles behind and below blinking light. i believe the military aircraft had just taken off from a local airport, either scottsdale or deer valley airport, but it was not flying in typical flight pattern of the city. continued to watch the \"blinking light\" after noticing the military aircraft. within 3 minuetes, the \"blinking light\" and military aircraft's anti-collision light were both in my field of vision. the \"blinking light\" then changed direction to the north. after 3 minuetes of \"blinking light\" traveling northern direction, it appeared to hover, remiaing stationary at 60,000-80,000ft. i was able to see the single military jet's anti-collision light still catching up in direction, yet behind \"blinking light.\" at this point, i lit another ciggerette and began to simply watch it \"hover\" for another 5 minuetes when i lost sight of military jet. 30 seconds after losing sight of military jet, i had to go back inside to answer a call. didn't go back outside when i was able to an hour later.

viewing the object, looking for any signs of movement, sound or anything that would resemble a planes movement. the object was going from shining yellow light to a mixture of red light that would fade in and out blending with the yellow.  i estimated the object to be hovering at maybe 1000-1500 feet above the airport, and it sat comletely still for around four minutes. oddly, when i started questioning in my mind what i was seeing andthe validity of the object, it slowly and almost impossibly smoothly started moving from left to right in my view, still shining, at this point i ran inside

don���t remember.  the final answer of how to turn the box was inside out. i remember being walked down a hallway my hands were at my side and i could not move them, the ���observer(s)��� was behind me. i looked to my right and i saw a boy my age with dark hair, he was wearing pajamas and he could not figure out the box. we were not allowed to talk and i was not allowed to stop but i thought the answer and turned the box for him anyway, he turned around and smiled at me as i was made to move on.\r\nthe second test was scary. i was tied back to back with another girl. we could stand up and i remember feeling like i was being watched from the upper right hand corner of the ���room��� it was black and the room looked like it could have been very big but maybe that is just because it was so dark. burning sticks of fire would fly at us and we were meant to move them away using our minds, if they touched us they burned, or felt like it. our hands were tied so we could not use them to defend against the sticks. i tried to throw the fire back towards the ���observers��� i was very mad at them.\r\nhave not had any other dreams similar or seen a ufo since.\r\nthanks for listening. i recently found my friend h on facebook, she remembers the rainbow too.\r\n","distance":"21-100

quebec is a small town up north. i don't remember much of that place as being memorable except my ufo encounter. my brother and i were coming back from a friends house about 9-ish that night. i was doubling him on my handle bars. we were talking about school, girls..Things 14 year old boys talk about.\r\n\r\nthe area of this town was dark, but there were plenty of houses around.We were near home, we were looking at the ground (since riding a bike in the dark is tricky) and suddenly the ground around us was illuminated in red light. now i don't remember if my memory serves me right here, but i recollect the lights near by fading just before it hapened. we both were immersed in the red light.  we looked up quickly and saw a cigar shaped ufo flying really low to the ground. about 80 feet to the roofs of the houses below them.The object was going 40kmh (aprox). the ufo had to be 30-40 feet long. it passed over our house which was a few yards away from where we were standing,the ufo lit everything below it in a red light. what still amazes me today is: thinking about it, the fact that there wasn't a single sound. like, it didn't have a motor/engine of sorts or displaced any air.\r\n\r\nthe undercarriage of the object looked more like molten lava which is where the light came from. the top wasn't visible much because the light from below blocked a clear view. \r\n \r\nit made a straight path to the tree tops of the forest a few feet away from our yard. always in a straight line, no sound.\r\n\r\ni am 29 now but in my mind i still see it as it passed over the trees. every branch of the tress lit up. revealing every detail of the tree trunks and branches in red light and then as it passed the return of the dark. gives me the creeps.\r\n\r\ni must say that since that day, i have a keen interest in ufo/alien subjects and research it like you all do. i just wanted to tell you what i saw and how i became \"aware\" i don't like to use the term believer.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
