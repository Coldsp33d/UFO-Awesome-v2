am and we both walked to our neighborhood's elementary school which happens to be the half way point to both our houses, that's were we split up to each walk home. i was walking my dog home and was pretty close home, just about a block away. i was looking at the sky (which was very very clear) thinking to myself how nice it should be tomorrow. right as i was looking at the sky i saw a rather large disc over head fly by extremely fast. i'd say it was about the size of the average frisbee held above your head at arms length. the whole thing was glowing, the center was more white and bright and as it got to the edges it was more of a mustard yellow. i saw it for a good 2-3 seconds before it disappeared. after seeing that i knew i just saw a ufo and by ufo i mean i knew it wasn't of this earth. i stood there for a good minute thinking to myself what do i do who do i tell. i continued to walk home. after walking about another minute my dog (nicest, calmest, quietest dog, rarely and i mean rarely ever barks) stops walking (and this dog loves to walk). she turns around and starts growling. the hair on her back was standing up she was showing her teeth and everything. this scared the crap out of me. i kept pulling the leash and saying dixie (my dogs name) calm down come on. she then let out a loud vicious bark. then i heard the sound of something speed walking towards us from behind. it sounded like a dogs paws on the pavement. we could not see anything but it was getting louder. my dog suddenly turns around and takes off pulling me. the faster we ran the louder and closer it sounded. i was afraid to turn around to see what was behind me but i did anyway as we ran and saw nothing. i let go of my dogs leash and ran into my backyard and went through my back door into my house. my mom woke up from me running into the house. she asked what was going on because i was out of breath. i tried telling her but she got out of bed and kept accusing me of being on drugs. then my phone started ringing and it was my friend (i had told him to call me when he got home when we left each other) i pick up the phone and started to cry as i tried to tell him what happened. before i'd get to the substantial information, the phone would disconnect. my house has full coverage... i didnt want to call him back because he was using his house phone and i didnt want to wake everyone at his house up. i went back to my moms room to continue to try to tell her what happened. she started to believe me and was getting freaked out herself. my phone started ringing in my room so i went to go answer it knowing it was my friend. as i'd try telling him again, the phone would disconnect. he called me back right away and my mom was screaming for me to come into her room so she can try to make sense of things. i tell my friend to hold on, i left the phone in my room. as  i was trying to tell my mom what happened more in depth, my cell phone started ringing (disconnected while i was talking to my mom and my friend was calling me back) i lost it. i broke down and told my mom every time i tried telling my friend what happened my phone disconnected. she didnt understand. this happened over and over again and i was eventually able to tell him quickly what happened. he was afraid bc he said he was hearing humming outside. he went to sleep in his parents room. we were 15 at the time... i counted how many times my friend called me. he called me 17 times within a half hour period. that means that my phone disconnected 16 times in that half hour period. again, at my house i have full at&t 3g service. i then stood outside my moms and my room and stared down the hallway for a good half hour as if i was hypnotised, not saying it was from \"aliens\" thats just how scared i was, i didnt want to move. my dog, sat and stared out the back door all night. my mom was just as scared as i was after knowing the whole story and hearing my phone ringing over and over again knowing that i wasnt hanging up the calls, they were disconnecting. my mom was so scared that she made me sleep with my door open, lights and tv on, and she made me take my necklace off in fear that it could be used to choke me. this whole story sounds far fetched i know and my being 15 at the time probably makes this sound silly but i didnt even really believe in aliens at that time. after that incident i've become somewhat obsessed with aliens and ufo's. when i tell friends this story they look at me as if im legitamently mental. i don't care what people think when i tell them this story. i know what happened and i take it to my grave.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

and had crossed cooper avenue when i saw overhead a large, white, non-reflective, cigar shaped object moving to the south.  there were 2 youths in my back seat and i asked them if they could see it, too.  they could view the object from the back seat, initially leaning forward and looking out the windshield and then looking out the side passenger window behind me (the driver).\r\n\r\nat first glance i thought it to be a commercial jet, however, when i took a second look and asked my passengers to look, we saw there was no tail, no wings, no windows, no markings.  this object was a long cylinder-shaped (cigar) and rounded on both ends.  it was white, but not reflecting the sun at all.  it moved at a steady pace toward the south and slowly began ascending and turning slightly to the south west.  we continued to watch this object, discussing it the entire time, looking for anything that could identify it (ie wings, tail, propeller, windows, colors or markings).  we watched it literally as far as we could see it.  \r\n\r\nwhen we could no longer see the white cigar shaped object we saw in that same area a jet-liner (in the vicinity of the memphis international airport) which showed up black against the blue sky and the wings and tail were quite visible even from the long distance.  i asked my passengers if that looked like the object we all saw and they agreed that the object we saw and discussed was not an airplane.\r\n\r\ni turned off union avenue at willett and arrived at my destination.  i estimate that we saw and observed this object for approximately 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes and the only time we could not see it was when a building obstructed our view.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

morning hours at 7:45 am central standard time on december 10, 2010 (i confirmed the date and time by reviewing my text message to a friend with whom i shared the experience). i was rolling out the garbage bins for friday morning pick-up and the triangular shaped craft, with 3 soft glowing well defined lights beneath, was moving very slowly at a diagonal from my right to the left with no sound. i am accustomed to seeing aircraft which originate from or travel toward carswell, afb; however, this craft was on a trajectory outside of the usual flight paths i've witnessed.\r\n\r\nthe shape of the craft was distinguishable as a dark silhouette against the background of the early morning sky, and the 3 equally proportioned lights were the dominant feature. at a higher altitude, there was a military fighter aircraft too small to identify, but was still audible. i watched for about 2 minutes, as the craft grew closer and eventually passed directly overhead. i looked to my left and saw a neighbor in the car about 3 houses down; however, this person was not a co-witness. i remained in place and continued to watch. in the time i looked left again, toward my neighbor's moving car, the craft disappeared in a blink. my initial thought was that in a clear blue sky, i should be able to reacquire the craft, as there was no way a conventional aircraft could have disappeared so suddenly. the sky was cloudless, my view was unobstructed. i was unable to take a picture at that moment, but have discovered a photo that fits the description, the time of day and similar weather conditions under which i witnessed the ufo.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

down payment for a t-shirt order i do costume designs and i while i stood outside waiting for them to pull up i noticed a really fast object to my right darting by in the sky i thought it was odd something like a shooting star etc not sure because it shoot by so fast so it caught my attention and made me extremely alert and i immediately began to comb the night sky in search for anything strange or sudden movements etc, it wasn't alot of stars visible that night but a few none the less so as i was doing my observation another object caught my eye it appeared to be a bright star much more brighter then anything else in the night sky besides the moon is much smaller then the moon, so as i paid closer attention to that particular object which i assumed was a star i noticed it starting to flicker and make some slight movements and change colors from bright white to a darker blue then a reddish color so i was shocked and excited by my discover and i waited and watched this object about another 2 mins before for my family member pulls up and i proceeded to observe this object as i walked from my front yard where i was standing to the drive way about 10-15 feet from where i was standing in my yard i got in his car got the down payment and instructions for his t-shirt order all while keeping a close eye on this object. i was in the car talking and watching the night sky for about 3-5 mins then i departed from his vehicle and to my surprise the object which appeared to be a bright star changing colors and making slight movements up and down was still visible from my yard so i rushed into the house grabbed my video recorder and came back outside this time i approached the drive way to get a better angle and clear shoot with my camera and then proceeded to start shooting as much as i could. now at this point im outside  standing in the freezing mich weather filming what i thought was a strange star and it wasnt till after i zoomed in closer on the object i was able to witness something i never seen before in my life. now this bright star had morphed from one bright light into two distinct points of light two different colors and they started to make movements like two orbs colliding and dividing separating and joining again changing patterns and growing in size. i observed the erratic activity for several mins then something else stranger began to happen the one star or orb multiplexed and grew from two points of ligt to 3 then 4 then ultimately 8 to 12 different orbs was seen at one time or another they increased in colors as the patterns and movements became more rapid and more complex in directions they all seemed to move as one unit flashing and changing colors and and going from one to several at speeds of light they would move so fast and jump out of frame and then come back into my frame even when i tried to zoom out i could only see one object that appeared to be flickering then when i zoom in again it would start to build up and make more balls of light or multiply in size and grow bigger and became more evasive in this movements it seemed precise and deliberate all tho i couldn't determine what i was actually filming it was definitely rare and unique to me i stayed and observed it for around 15 mins or so before the freezing cold forced me inside to retreat. i went inside to warm up and charge my battery and decided to go back outside after around 20 mins or so and captured similar activity in segments of 13 15 mins for a total of 40 mins to a hour the object was visible around the 4th segment of me coming back out to capture more footage it moved out the reach of my cam and i wasn't able to record anymore. im attaching a few still shoots from the actual video footage and a link to some of the video footage i i i up loading to youtube i also have more footage if your interested. let me know im curious to have a expert analyze my recording and get some answers.            \r\n\r\nhere is the

it started to display odd behaver, moving up and down and side to side. what made it stand out is that it was strobing white and red in a constant fast pace after waiting for a while i noticed it was making its way down past the trees out of my field of vision. this object continued to appear almost every night of september, every night as soon as it was dark this thing was visible it would always start at the same spot in the sky however it would some times move of in a different direction than the previous night. i have gotten several witness to view the object some would say it was a star, even though it would strobe just as much when viewed by others it does seem to slow down its movement when viewed by others., however it would seem to come alive when i would see it alone. it would start by rocking or swaying back and forth for a minute an d then steadily it's self at a certain spot in the sky and then make a straight line right to left and then when it got to a specific point it would stop and then it appeared to\r\nwaddle back to the point it started. i tried to get a police man to witness this object but hew refused to come in to my house and said that in 10 years on the force he has never been called to observe a ufo. the next night i got out on my roof and took several pictures of the object with every setting i could and used a star for a point of reference while taking tease pictures i had to witnesses waiting the object and tiring to plot its location with a google star chart while talking to my friend who lives a few blocks away mas waiting the same object from his front door with the cameras' lens  almost fully extended i could see this object perfectly clear with no light flashing it was a plain low or flat gloss metal spear white on visible marks or detail what so ever but when i would zoom out or look with the naked eye it was flashing red and while light. \r\n    i watched this thing almost every night in september but in october november and december it could not be seen.However as i walked out of my house on december 15th around (.35-940p.M. i saw a huge triangle shaped craft pass over me. i could not tell if the object was going on a straight path when i noticed it or of it was hovering over my house before i came out,but as i was going to my car i stopped to watch this massive black ship pass over head it seemed to be as big as a cargo plain or bigger. i could make out the shape from directly underneath  as well as see the back of the ship and there was no means of propoltion, it was gust a simple shape it made no noise that i could tell and moved about 35mph. it had three lights two in the fear on each rear corner that where approx 10ft. round and 4 to 5 feet at the center. all three lights where not very bright and seemed to be soft and or matte in finish. \r\n     january 1st 2011 the orb was back, until then i was not able to see it but in october someone caught the orb on tape and put it on you-tube.\r\n visible the jan 1-3 and then not visible for cloudy overcast for a few days  \r\n but again on the 7th and 8th. on the 8th i gathered several witnesses to view the object however the few neighbors i could gather where not very interested to stand out side and watch this light in the sky that was surprisingly visible from the street. my brother-in-law brought his two kids to observe the orb from the street and from my second story window although it was visible it did not display the same unearthly strange movements as it had in the past however it still moved up an d down and side to side while staying in a very small area in the sky. closer to 8pm the object started to wander downwards into the trees and then started moving straight up and slowly down several times after observing for about 25 min my brother in law left and as soon as he did the sphere started to move around left to right and up and down very fast! i called him on the cellphone and told him and he said i know i can see it! but i'm blocking traffic so i gotta go!\r\n \r\n     i decided to call david macdonald and john bacon to tell them of this real time sighting and asked if ether of them could come witness this even though they could not however i had john on the line explaining to him what the object was doing when i noticed it started to drift more and more to the right until it was directly in the flight path of air traffic while this was happening a helicopter passed by the object approximatively 8 to 10 times however the air plains had to at first go far right to fly around the object,(there left) and as it moved further to the right the plains started to fly to the far left! coming almost directly over my house to avoid this orb! one plain had to pull up hard and fly directly over the object. as i told john the (helicopter) that i saw fly by this thing had no flash beacon, it only had one solid light, and i thought that odd yet i assumed this craft to be a helicopter because i could here the rotors and i could see them circle each other low around the city off in the distance before they would take turns doing a fly by,every few minutes another helicopter would fly directly in the path of this object and get very close but the sphere was unphased by this as it just appeared to see what would happen. usually after the sphere starts to wander off it does not come back however this time it did around 10:45-11:00pm the sphere was back hovering over the tree where it usually is except it is off to the right a little. \r\n    at approx. 11.Pm a new craft came up from the north on the far left from out of the clouds i could hear helicopter rotors very faintly however this craft only had one solid white light and was almost even but a little higher than the orb possibly a quarter-mile between the to objects. the orbs' movements very stubble yet the other craft seemed to have trouble keeping steady for about 15-20 min. however as i checked on them both every one in a while through the net approx. 2hrs the craft on the left stopped moving around and started to behave like the orb.They where both hovering ether waiting each other or both of them together were waiting something else. i saw a ufo last night on the side of the expressway and when i spotted it it moved across the road over me and it continued south a little to the left of i-75going about 80-85mph 5-800 ft off the ground and i saw two more lights in the sky come toward me from a sw direction as i pulled in to a gas station to get a better look and get my camera the first one disappeared however i saw an other while light coming from the same direction but further back it moved very slow and as i watched it come closer it to just disappeared just a little closer than the first one.     \r\n\r\n

manheim from lititz, we were heading to mollys gas station. i was driving and noticed some bright lights in the sky, at that time i pointed it out to my uncle. i kinda laughed and said it was a ufo. i keep my eye out from time to time but was not prepared to be witness to what comes next.  as we approach the first bend we are watching this craft hover over some backroad fields, a few farm homes around and many developments within a mile north if not closer. it was only a few football fields away, pulsating peach colored orbs hovered over in front of us. went around bend and watched it through some trees. when we came around the bend next to the pond right in front of doe run elementary school the orbs fell silently towards my vehicle. our windows and sunroof wide open we yelled as i swereved a bit! not paying no mind to the car behind us.  this object acted as though weightless, fell in front of our eyes slowed down about a football field away right above the school, spun as the orbs shined in my windshield,almost blinding but made a silouette of a grey haze against the black night sky. may have been a rounded but triangle shape.  after it slowed down and lights shined in our direction it spun....Horizontally,very fast. then diagonally, like a ball being spun on water by hand.  best yet we then watched it take off in no way i have ever seen anything fly! as if spinning wasnt crazy enough! it silently took off towards the town of manheim and could literally see it fly until it was prob over mtjoy pa in a matter of 20 seconds. right when it took off at top speeds we watched in disbelief as it slithered like a snake in the air, it did not go straight. i stepped on the gas but the time i got a half mile it was long gone from our sight in the distance.  we thought about reporting it but wasnt prepared to tell people this. i thought i would wait and see if anyone else came forward, we thought for sure somebody would but i havent seen anything yet. it is now the 9th.  it changed the way i look at things for sure. i believe i was in shock for the past couple days. i know it sounds crazy but i didnt ask to see this especially right now at this time of my life, but i also feel very lucky and now believe in a larger picture without discrediting any beliefs or opinions. i am now at peace

was closer.  my wife and son both started yelling what is that.  we all noted it did not have flashing lights of any kind and it was a solid color.  as we all stood there in awe, its speed took off
