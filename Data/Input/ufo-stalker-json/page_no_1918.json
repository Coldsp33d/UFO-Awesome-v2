triangular object in the sky. it was almost the same color as the nite sky (almost a matte black in finish). the object was approximately three football fields in width across and between 2 to 3

story i couldn't miss it when i looked that direction. i watched it slowly rise, and couldn't believe that this sighting blew away the one i had from phoenix.\r\n\r\ni was excited, since this one was really clear at first. the object was shaped with what i can only explain as it looked like a white dove. similiar to various logo's you see of doves. it was glowing extremely brightly, and did not have a pulse factor to indicate it was a 'star' when it finally rised high enough up out of site. \r\n\r\nwhile rising, the (what i call) white dove would rotate at approx 45 degrees at a time. holding that direction for a shorter duration the faster it rised. as it got to half way to my sighting ability, it started to change shape to look more like a circle. once it started going this shape, the dove would appear less and less.\r\n\r\nat one point i ran inside to get my camera, but the battery is dead. i grabbed my cell phone, which having such a low quality/zoom, you can't really make anything out. (3.2 megapixel). i tried running in after snapping a few picturephone photos of it, grabbing my old telescope. the viewfinder was not setup properly, and by the time i got it usable the object was gone.\r\n\r\nobject was south of my location, which is the northwest side of houston. mapping it, locate beltway 8 and gessner road. from there it would be southernly. \r\n\r\ni was up most of that evening, being that i continued to hear typical local sounds such as traffic, gunshots, kids racing loud cars, but my favorite was waking up and only hearing the sound of a helicopter. that's when i had realized, i've heard a lot of aircraft activity. i don't normally hear anything but the occasional one here and there after sundown. \r\n\r\nthey were the larger, slower, cargo style aircraft. c130 maybe? then the helicopters i can't say for sure, but they did not sound like a huey. i heard but couldn't find it a couple times, and the few times it had passed by i found it with a spotlight on. it was moving too high/fast to be a littlebird by local leo, who i don't even think use or have. i thought that it made more sense that they left it on, and were not using it.\r\n\r\ni am not sure if this high traffic volume of military aircraft has anything to do with this ufo. i found it important to say that in my opinion, it does not. there have been a few nights here and there where i've seen it before, though, usually they flyout northeast in sometype of formation, and once the main group is gone, it's over. \r\n\r\nonly strange human flying object event i had, was that i heard a small plane. there is hooks airport near by for them, but i've never heard them at 4am. \r\n\r\ni was in and outside of the house a lot that night, hearing typical break-in warning sounds, and checking around the area with flashlight for harris county jail's next member. so for a lot of these human craft experience, i was outside and able to get a clear view around for it's location. \r\n\r\ni could not see the small craft, only hear.

set and i was unfamiliar with the neighborhood. without looking up - so it was in my line of view- i saw three lights in the sky. they were a bright white/yellowish, round, and evenly spaced. at this point i was so surprised that i almost completed stopped the car and i could not take my eyes off of the lights. i had two thoughts in my head, \"i have to take a picture of this\" and \"it must be a plane\". i pulled the car over and stopped. the lights were getting closer but moving slowly and seemed to be too low to the ground. i could see the shape of some kind of craft but it was dark and this was difficult. i believe it was very large. mainly i was trying to determine if it was a standard airplane. although i don't know the exact shape, i know it was not the shape of a commercial airliner.\r\nas the lights became larger and closer they moved from a horizontal position to a vertical position. now, as i am recalling this, the rest is a little fuzzy although everything i have already typed is crystal clear.\r\nit moved over me and i turned my head to look out of the drivers side window. i looked up and saw a red light underneath. now i began rationalizing again that it must be a plane since i have seen a red light on planes. now i heard a noise similar to an engine sound but quieter, like a \"whoosh\". now it moved faster away from me but still in my field of view. i believe it was gaining elevation now.\r\nnow that i think about it, i can not think of why i decided to look away. i believe i looked away while it was still visible to me which is strange because i would have wanted to watch it until it disappeared from view.\r\nlike i said before, the end of this experience was a little fuzzy and almost became dreamlike.\r\ni was excited after seeing this and realized i was rationalizing in my head \" it must have been a plane getting ready to land\", etc. although i really knew it wasn't and i had seen a ufo. i feel a little confused about how calm i

over looking center city philadelphia. i always kept my telescope in front my window. my guest got a kick out of looking at the different sights on south 13th street. they especially enjoyed looking down to the spectrum stadium on game night. this particular night i was walking pass my window and something in the sky caught my attention. by this time, i had been living in my apartment for 6 years. i had looked at the sky on many, many nights. but there was something different. i looked through my telescope and what i saw, well, i don���t know what i saw. but whatever it was, i felt that i needed to get it on tape. i got my video camera and did just that. at one point i found myself saying out loud, ���if you���re not stars, give me a sign��� just at that moment these lights blinked three times. well, needless to say, this really got my attention. as a matter of fact, it scared me. did this thing hear me? am i losing it? i continued to film and while i was filing the lights started moving. the only way that i can accurately describe this is to say that it looked like a ship that was nose-diving in the ocean. i filmed as long as it was visible. at one point i got up on the ledge of my window (13 floors up) and filmed until the lights disappeared behind the wanamaker building. these lights move from directly in front of me, to the far right i me, and just disappeared. i could not wait until the next night. at 9:22 pm i was right back in the same window, camera ready. nothing. i filmed the same areas, and nothing was there. that monday i went into work and my former boss was a retired army person. i showed him the tape and asked it he knew what this might be. i asked if this could possibility be stars or the constellation orion���s belt? his answer, and i quote ���if this is orion���s belt, he must be bending over���. i don���t know what that is. he suggested that i contact our local new station and speak with the weather person there. i did. he suggested that i contact the weatherman at one of our other local stations. he gave me his number, and i called. after explaining my reasons, i soon realized that i was an unwilling participant in their joke. how i realized this, this weather person tried to give the number of yet another weather person. i just hung up the phone. i can truly understand why people do not come forth in situations like this. look at just how long it has taken me to say anything about this. and i���m still not sure about this. if this turns out to be no more than a constellation of stars, fine. if not, this uncertainty that i am feeling at this moment about submitting this will be well worth it. the tapes, as well as the camera is available for your viewing and inspection.\r\n\r\nthank
