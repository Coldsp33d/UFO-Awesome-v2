use of of walkie talkies. while working a security detail on 1-7-11 at approximately 1010 hours pm i and another coworker at the base station overheard a brief, loud and clear voice come across our frequency. this was not bleed over, skip, or outside cell phone or other form of interference. it seemed louder and stronger than our power output. i am very familiar with many different languages, and i can say with certainty...And it really creeps me out to say this, it did not sound human. there was a gutteral vowel and consonant pattern spoken at a slighly higher pitch and speed than common human language. it was erie and unintelligable. this exchange took place when i called in a spot check over the walkie to the base station. the base station replied back to me. i heard approximately 5-6 \"words\" between a brief one-two second period of time a fraction of a second immediately after i was acknowledged to by the base station. this communication i perceived to be a either a mocking or mimicking of the base station message because it seemed to contain the same amount of phonetic groupings and cadence as was broadcasted to me. the signal was crystal clear and it boomed over the frequency, stronger than the normal signal strength. i was really taken back by it, i remember saying to myself \"what the h--- was that!!!\" out loud to myself. i was approximately 100 yards away and outside from the base station. it was cloudy with high humidity because of the winter storm closing in, temperature about 29 degrees. in all my years of experience i have never heard anything like that over the air, as stated ealier i have heard many different forms of bleed over transmissions, but it was in clear human language. this voice sounded somewhat similar to that of a young adult female, but like 60 % similar, a mix between genders is all i add to it. i went into see the base operator immediately afterward and they said it sounded like a female over the radio. there was a female security officer working but i knew from what i clearly overheard that it was not her. the operator called the female and inquired about the transmission and she stated negative on any recent transmissions. i saw or heard nothing else unusual as i looked around outside immediately after this happened. several other security personnel working farther away on the premises heard nothing unusual, including the female. only myslef and the base  operator heard this unexplainable transmission. of  any past experiences with unexplained phenomina i have had a pre-dawn clear sky sighting in my youth in 1974 of a dime sized held at arms length object that was a bright white oval shape. when i was walking outside to deliver newspapers i saw it motionless at around 45 degrees to the horizon in the air, motionless. after about 2-3 seconds of observing it the bright oval left horizontally at an extremly high rate of speed directly towards and overhead me and out of sight. my wife in 1978 observered a big white slipper shaped craft with windows overhead a neighbors house at close range in the late afternoon. she watched it for approximately 10 seconds as it sat motionless, then it took off in an instant. she didn't recall it until the next day. she said she thought she was being watched by it, and felt compelled not to remember the sighting. recently in the third week of november 2010 while driving down the road around 12:15 am she obervered overhead of the street directly in front of her windshield a dark sillouetted craft against the clear starlit sky. she could only describe as a semi circle, or ball shape on the end of a stick or pole type object that was motionless. as she approached it and observred it for a couple of seconds it took off with a trail behind it away to her left and out of sight. this object was much smaller than the slipper shaped craft she saw years ago. the smaller craft seen recently is within a mile of last evenings radio incident. these have all occurred to us in the same town.

episode was followed by missing time for about 6 hours, and another time i awoke with my hair a huge tangled mess like i've never seen my fine hair before or since. i have already reported those events on this website before.\r\n\r\nit has been 2 years now since i have seen anything in the sky or had any events. i moved to maine 2 years ago, and unfortuantely, nothing. nothing until last night when i had the most intense dream of all my life. i dreamt that i was back in arizona and was ( with a number of other people) taken away after a whirlwind and me running to hide in the closet where i was praying as if it were the end of the world or my life. and i am an atheist! anyway, i was taken to this intermediate station where i was being evaluated by some aliens that looked liked human sized embryo's in suits. they had something attached to my mouth for breathing. they asked me if i smoked cigarretes and proceeded to have me smoke on through this ectoplasm like attachment to my mouth. they were also evaluating my body and seemed to be communicating something about my foot. now, i have an infection in my r great toe ever since i slammed my foot in a door many years ago. i will either have to remove my nail or be stuck with this nasty fungal infection for life. \r\n\r\nmoving on, i was brought to what appeared to be a different galaxy. there were millions of people there. i felt my body was very heavy and i was quite cold. they first greeted me by showing me this hand signal that my hands could not replicate. i kept on asking questions about god and the afterlife, and if i would ever see my family again, etc..They told me the biblical god was not true. they asked me if they could pick up my mother the following day, but i explained to them that my mother was a religious woman, and would be frightened by the experience. they gave me something to drink, but i apparently drank too much of it and they had to keep me longer for observation. i looked at my hands and they looked frostbit. i walked around this new galaxy which seemed to have housing installations that were similar to our own, yet they had a sort of flexibility about them that i can not explain. and everything was moving very fast. i was taken back to the original examining room where i asked them when they would be back, and they said in 2007. i awoke feeling like i had just emerged from anesthesia, and my whole body was tingling for about an hour afterwards. i kept feeling the skin on my face because my skin seemed to be absent in space or just felt different. i can't explain it. i quickly reasoned that 2007 was backward in time, and convinced myself this was just a very, very intense dream. i was quite shaken up by it and looked and saw that my window was open in the dead of winter! i don't know what to make of all of this. i used to have contact with ufo's in az as i had said before. but this is the first time in maine that anything like this has happened. a dream vs virtual reality?? i don't know. it really shook me up.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27292,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5520105,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01072011-0005","longitude":-69.6317121,"occurred":1294387200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1294431912000,"summary":"Possible

galloway, ohio.  from my home i have now had numerous sightings of this object in a seven week period. on the night of the latest sighting there were a lot of planes in the sky in the area with a peculiar plane as well which flew over just east of the subdivision at low altitude  about four hours earlier in a northeasterly direction.  i did catch a video of it.  i mention this plane because it seems every time i catch this ufo/orb/fireball object on film, 3 times now, this low flying airplane with an unusually bright front fuselage makes it's appearance.\r\n  \r\ni made an official report of the second sighting /first video with mufon 12/9/2010 but couldn't upload the video. the first time i filmed the object the peculiar plane passed close by during the video at low altitude, almost right over my house.( see first attached video to see that sighting )  i saw a similar looking plane ( with a brightly lit forward portion of the fuselage) christmas eve pass to the southeast at low altitude, maybe 3/4 mile away. that night i set up my camera on a tripod and left it on the front porch facing the area.  at about 9:29 pm est that night my camera caught a brief 5 seconds flash of what appears to be the same ufo/orb/fireball object just over the treeline to the southeast of where the first video/second sighting had been taken place. ( see 2nd attached video to see object ) this was the third sighing. in that video you can see a quick flash just over the tree line and a few seconds later just to the left the object starts to illuminate out of the darkness growing in intensity and in mass and then dimming back out to the point of no light at all,(illumination and de-lumination was a five second process) but you can still see the object very dimly head off to the left for a few seconds.  then about thirty second later there was another quick flash in the same spot as the first flash.\r\n\r\nthe latest and fourth sighting( see third attached video ) took place december 30th, 2010 at 9:36 pm, also from my front porch, and in the same exact spot as the third sighting.  i watched the sky off and on that evening because there was a lot of air traffic and it was a very clear warm night out.  i peered out my window and saw an object to the south east over the tree line just before 9:30 so i grabbed the camera and headed to the front door to see what it might be and started shooting.  in the video you can see what appears to be a very bright fireball drifting towards the camera from over the trees, 4 to 6 hundred yards maybe. i zoomed in and out.  as i zoomed in the second time the object changed from a fireball to kind of a large pulsating orb growing brighter and dimmer in intensity, sometimes even blacking completely out.  \r\n\r\ni caught over a minute of footage of the pulsating at mid to high zoom and maybe 3 hundred yards out at that time.  \r\n\r\nit looks as if during the pulsating period of over a minute that the object starts on my side of the tree line and only travels a few hundred feet at best, which couldn't possibly be a plane.  even stranger, the object veers off to the left slowly and eventually disappears behind and below the roof line of the house in the foreground ( which is about 300 feet away from the camera ), which means the object was between the tree line and the house in the foreground because the tree line is above the top of the roof that the object disappeared behind.  which also means it couldn't possibly be a plane (since the neighborhood wasn't wiped out by a massive plane crash that evening, doesn't have an airport in it and the object never resurfaced)\r\n\r\nit might take a while to download the videos if your computer is as slow as mine, but you can also view the sightings on youtube if you type in *info about link moved to additional evidence section--cms/sg). feel free to visit the site and ask me whatever questions you might have.  i will do what i can to help.\r\n\r\nseems very strange whatever it is and  it to seems to frequent the

incredible speeds with no sound what so ever, fly east, taking off slow and then was instantly at the farthest end of the beach we could see then shot straight up into the sky and then shot passed us to the west. after watching it for about five minutes or more i'm not sure for some reason it's hard to remember how long we stood there but it eventually came back down close to where we first seen it and it seemed to fall onto the water then disapear either into the water or over the horizon but it seemed to go into the water since the lights on it were still the same size.I remember after it was gone related or not, the wind all of a sudden was blowing very hard and a small shower came over and lasted for about 10 minutes. the lights on it were in a circular pattern around the craft then one on top and one on bottom, so it wasn't a shape i could see except for the lights leading me to think or under the illusion that it was a saucer shape with a bulb on top and bottom or kinda like the shape of a planet with ring's silohoutte. the colors of the lights were different but i can't remember the colors but i know their was atleast three different colors because the light on top and bottom was red and the lights around it are the ones i can't remember what color they were. blue, green, and white are colors that come to mind but alot of confusion comes to mind when i think about those lights and it's been a couple of years and it was never a big deal to us that we seen it for some reason we have both been very calm about the whole ordeal. after the craft was gone we continued down the beach talking about it completely calm as if we had seen it thousands of times but it was the first time for either of us to have seen anything like that. i've always believed that the possibility of life evolving on other planets was possible i never thought i would actually witness something like this,not that i'm saying this came from another planet but i am saying i have never seen anything manuver like this before. i know what i seen and so does my friend. i still call him every now and again to ask him if he really seen it to just to make sure i'm not crazy. so im either a crazy who hullucinated just once in my life seen something at the same exact time as someone standing right beside me that just so happen to hullucinate the very same shape and assortment of colors as i did and we are both just crazy or it was real. it was real. everyone i have told has said i was high or that i'm crazy or think we were joking trying to get a laugh out of everyone but my story hasn't changed and it never will. i seen a ufo, alien or secret military technology don't know.

about 9:00 pm on a friday night, clear weather conditions, 4 lane highway with tall pines to the south and a clearing to the right as the causeway was approaching. no buildings in this rural area, no street light that i recall but there may have been some spaced very far apart. there was very light traffic. as we came down a small incline and approached the straight-a-way i noticed 2 lights hovering above the highway, about 2 miles ahead. they were white and a little brighter and larger than car head-lights. i asked my boyfriend what the lights were and he said it looked like a small plane's wing lights. perhaps it was trying to land on the highway. as we drew closer i noticed the object seemed suspended above our side of the highway, about 100 feet in the air. it wasn't moving at all. the lights appeared to be on either end of the hovering object. we slowed down wondering what the object could be. there was a car coming in the opposite direction who was going at normal speed (probably 50 mph) seemingly not to notice the object. when our car was about 100 ft from the object a bright spotlight came from one end and shined on our car for about 2-3 seconds. it was not blinding, but bright. we slowed down on our approach, i rolled down my window and stuck my head out to have a look. the object was not very large, maybe as long as 2 semi trucks and about 20 feet wide. i could not see any details, only a dark shape above me. we pulled off to the side of the road immediately and so did the truck behind us. the car that had been going east-bound continued without slowing down at all. the two of us got out of our car and the 3 occupants in the truck got out as well (2 men and a woman) \"what the hell was that!\" one guy said to us. we all stood looking at the hovering object. it made no sound at all. we observed it for a few minutes then it rose vertically a few hundred feet and moved away, very smoothly, south east. we watched it until the trees blocked our view. it was not in a hurry, it did not make any sound, it did not move like a blimp, a helicopter or a plane. there wasn't much converstation between the 5 of us. i think we were all a little bewildered. one of the men said, \"we won't tell if you won't!\" we all laughed and got in our vehicles. when we arrived to our destination about 20 minutes later we called the pensacola naval air station to see if anyone had reported anything unusual. they said no. the next day there were no reports on the news or in the paper. the only difference my husband recalls in my recollection is that the lights were red, not white.

2009 i have seen stars engaged in markedly non-star-like activities every single night that i have have walked home from work in the dark.  my walk home takes about an hour so i get quite a bit of time to observe the night sky.  \r\n\r\ni have routinely witnessed \"stars\" change color rapidly (from blue to red to green to orange, etc.) as well as change size rapidly.  i have watched \"stars\" go out completely only to reappear several seconds or even minutes later.  in the boise night sky, i have witnessed up to 13 of these anomolous \"stars\" in a given evening all over the sky in every direction.  there are approximately 7 of them that are reliably present every single night.  these \"stars\" of which i speak are quite obviously not like the rest of the actual stars in the sky.  \r\n\r\nas a result of spending so much time observing the night sky, i have done quite a bit of studying to satisfy my curiousity about these bizarre star-like satelites (i assume they must be satelites of some sort...Man-made or otherwise.) and have learned a great deal about astronomy in general as a result.  \r\n\r\nless than two months ago, while walking home, i observed two of the \"stars\" in orion's belt not only change size, intensity and color (seemingly in response to one another), but they actually at one point they quickly swooped around each other!  even after becoming accustomed to seeing these \"flashers\" as i call them, seeing that caused me to drop the coffee i was holding onto the sidewalk and stare, mouth agape for at least a full five minutes.  \r\n\r\ni hold a master's degree in engineering and have worked for the government since i finished graduate school five years ago.  i am quite sane and completely at a loss as to what these \"flashers\" imitating actual stars are up to.  \r\n\r\nthese \"flasher\"-satelites, if they are indeed man-made, do not behave like any publicly known man-made satelites.  to my knowledge, no government on earth has created a satelite that can not only mimmick actual stars but travel in a quick, agile and independent manner.\r\n\r\nso maryland witness, what i am saying here is that you are not

her look for something outside. as we went outside i said what are we looking for and she said her sister,my aunt, just got off work and was wondering if she was seeing things or what and wanted us to look up in the air and see if we could see the same thing she was seeing since it was right across the street from our house,about 20 feet. so when i initially looked up,while standing in our front yard,i seen nothing and since my mother couldnt see it either ,she replied we dont see anything. my aunt evidently was still insisting on us to look more cause she knew she wasnt crazy and was lookin right at it almost above our house,but towards the other side of the street about 10-20 feet. so since there was a big tree in our front yard at the street i walked under it and went i got to the street and looked up, my god i said, look moma look!Here it is here it is. my mom said were are you looking as she walked towards me next to the street,and then she seen it,oh my god louda,she replied to my aunt, i dont know what that is,then i think my aunt said on the phone,i knew i wasnt crazy,what do think that is. from that point on i couldnt get my eyes off of it as it just hovered in mid air with no noise and spinning rather slowly,it had no wabble at all and was the picture perfect ufo.I will never forget this ,i thought, as i was watching it,slowly i started to watch the windows on the craft because they looked to be different in shape all the sudden,but i didnt notice the different shapes of the windows at first at all for either being startled or maybe they wasnt different at first,i really dont know. as i was watching the windows all the sudden i started making out letters,these windows say (texaco found oil) as the craft spins. what in the world i thought,mom can you read what the windows say as that thing spins, she says she never could but i know what i read on those windows. then this perfectly shaped ufo starts to go towards our local dirt track that we can see the from our house and when it got close to the race track you should have heard the roar of the people over there. it was like aahhhhhh, but very loud for us to hear them from our house. when it got to the race track its like it was checking things out since it just hovered there for a while,like it did at our house, and then finally starting back going north at a very slow rate of speed. after it got  quite a piece from our house and we couldnt make it out anymore we went back in the house. it was for sure being controlled because of its actions,like stopping at our house, then easing over to the racetrack and stopping, then taking back off again. all in all, i still to this day have never found out how this thing hovered in one spot,spinning,with no noise,and definetly looked very shiny,metallic metal of some sort,and if it was, it must have been somewhat heavy. plenty of people seen this thing but i never heard anything else about it. ive always wondered, if texaco found oil,why would they send a perfectly looking ufo to my house to let me, and the people down my street, know that they found some oil, doesnt make any sense to me but what do i know about texaco and there advertising if thats what is really was,then so be it,but it seems to me like that would be a waste just to let people know.!

(i am sorta known for sky gazing - i think its so pretty.. clouds/stars/moon/sunrise&set, all pretty.) it had been overcast past days before then and so the crisp clear sky was more noticable & special looking. the stars were really bright (for city sky) particularly orion, & moon was big (full moon & lunar eclipse just 2 days before).. i was in middle of pointing up & saying \"look how pretty\" to my friend, when i noticed that one, a big bright reddish/orange 'star', was moving upwards.. \"hey that ones moving\" i pointed & said after a moment. normally i pry wouldnt have pointed out some moving light in the sky.. we live in a valley w/ a good amount of air traffic, & airplanes/helicopters are no wonderous thing to take note of. (thats one thing that leads me to believe it wasnt normal.. it wasnt like i was conscious of it 'not being' normal vehicle, i just sort of instinctually automatically knew it was something else.)\r\nwe watched it move upwards towards orions belt in the sky (im bad a judging distances.. but it was pretty freaking high! like up in high atmosphere high.) then it moved left, swinging around towards & then under the moon, & it grew larger/closer as it did this. by then we were both (may have been 1 or 2 others out there then too?) openly wondering what it was: a helicopter? no. there's absolutely no noise. an airplane? no. no flashing lights. what is that? - all in all we watched it for a pretty long time. 5+ minutes @ least.\r\n\r\n3.)a star (or planet - cuz so bright, & reddish)\r\n\r\n4.)after getting a good long (& relatively close) look at it, im confident in describing it as such....\r\na reddish/orange/amber 'orb'.. it sorta glided through the sky, kinda fast too (faster than floating balloon speed, thats for sure - oh, & there was no wind at all that night anyway). when i intially noticed it, it was really bright.. then as we watched, it got dimmer (but never completely went out), then lit up again (repeated this 2.5 times). it was almost like it was a ball w/ fire in it. no other lights. absolutely no noise omitted at all. it was a tiny bit darkers in areas, it seemed.. like the bottom, i wanna say.. but basically, it was colored/shadded in a way that u could tell it was a sphere, a ball. - ya know?\r\n\r\n5.) as we watched we were both just sort of mystified. im all rational thinking, so even though i pointed it out & noticed it was odd, i was kinda trying to justify it. \"its a helicopter. right?\" no, my friend said, theres no noise, heli's are loud. \"well its gotta be something. weather balloon? is that what weather balloons look like?\" i dunno said my friend.. (as it was dimming/relighting) \"but its dimming, oh, here it comes back.. i dunno what that is, but its ******* wierd!\" just then he ran inside bar to get someone else. \r\ni just kept staring at it, trying to figure out what i was seeing. at one point i thought, & may have even said, someone should record this. i even had my blackberry in my hand.. but i didnt even try.(?!?!) - i think i figured it'd be futile, cuz my blkberry takes shitty pics/video under good conditions.. let alone at night of something sorta smallish. now, i regret not trying. stupid.\r\nafterwards, like 30min later, as i drove home i saw a helicopter & then an airplane.. it was then that the oddness of it really set in. after seeing those the difference was strikingly evident.. no blinking lights, just one solid orb! no sound! wtf?! also, it occured to me that the whole time while we were watching it, there was not one other aircraft in the sky anywhere.. which is odd, because like i said, pretty heavy traffic area. - almost no time between 6am-1am that you cant go out, look up, & see a plane or 2.. almost dont even notice them anymore. its when there's none out, that its more noticable, you could say.\r\n\r\n6.)it moved behind the roof of bar in the horizon, & i ran to the side & front to see if i could spot it again.. i did, from the front of bar, just as it moved far off enough so that i could not see it past the rooftops across the street. it seemed to be headed north.. and was a lot lower at this point too.\r\n\r\nok is all. oh, quick side note.. i told this to a coworker a few days later (& he's a huge skeptic type.. not at all magical mystical conspiracy thinking sorta guy).. and he said he saw it also, w/in 1-2 days of my sighting (timeline wasnt 100%). he had also seen it while smoking out back w/ a customer.. only his experience was in daytime (between 7am-10am i guess, thats when he works). another difference was when he saw it it was glowing white then turned orange/red, it too did the dimming/relighting thing, but then he said after following it for a few minutes across the horizon, it just blinked out. (?!?!) i believe him completely, because he told me this before i had chance to explain any details about what i saw. all i had said is i seen something strange @ work. and it was 'technically' a ufo, to me @ least. \r\n\r\nthen i google searched it. i found dozens & dozens of videos, pictures, & blogs & such that show or describe almost the exact same thing! (there are some that are similair but w/ differences too.) i couldnt find any more for the same time & location as mine though. - and i dont think it was a weather balloon or lantern thing.. although, if i could find out a way to know if a wb was flying round there at that time, id check it out 4 sure too.\r\n\r\nand that is my story. never seen anything ufo-ish before in my life. not even particularly stoked that i did. just really

naturally i ran to his bedroom window so fast my feet didn't touch the floor. it was the urgency in his voice that concerned me. just out of his southern window was what looked like a horizontail shooting star.Heading due east through the air with a little firey tail. 1..2..3..It suddenly changed into a flashing star and up it went blinking red..Blue..Green..White..Amber. then poof next to it red.Blink.Blinlk. white.. .. and to the south of it two more blinking lights red..Blue..Amber. so then i started to lose my count because it looked as though lightning bugs were let out of a jar..Twinkling the colors of the rainbow. we were so excited counting and screaming the colors as they flashed on/off.The sky was cloudless filled with humidity. so we guessed as to how close and how bright the objects were. five was the number we agreed that we saw. however, they were all over the place while tightly huddled together in a central area. then the squadron moved further west and poof they were all gone. we were in shock knowing that we needed video proof i ran to my bedroom to get our little polaroid digital camra. just in case. bam they were back. my son started to wonder if we were being invaded. calming his fears i went onto the porch. we saw them going west then circling to the north then they were out of our line of vision, for one hour we watched these strange lights. we did take footage. we can't be sure if the ufo's are visible the batteries died.It is too late to go out now and everybody is asleep. one thing that stands out in my mind that seems strange the whole ufo observation was never disturbed by any sound,the air was eerie feeling. it was like a dream slow and still..No backgroun noise at all. my son was pretty upset. he wants to know who is

talking to my son on the cell phone when he said he saw something strange down our county road towards our house. it was a very bright flashing white light. when he said that i looked out my pickup window to the right and saw the light too from where i was on the highway but as i went down the hill i lost sight of it.  he said it was still in front of him and flashing slowly.  i made him stop on the dirt road because he believed it to be not even a half of a mile ahead of him.  i turned right on county road 411 and saw the flashing light again. it looked to be less than a mile away.  my son was in his pickup two vehicles ahead of me, my husband was in his pickup between us as we headed down the dirt road toward the house.  i was still talking to my son about the light and how it was flashing strangely like it had three different flash points. the light would flash from left to right and then start at the left again. as we were driving down the road we watched it about a mile and a half down the road.  it didn't move as if it were going up and down the hills of the road, in fact it did not appear to be moving forward on the ground.  we never got any closer to it but it never really got any further away. i mean like the size of the light never seemed to get smaller or fade. and then it was gone.  i thought i had lost sight of it due to the hills and valleys in the road.  but when i topped the hill again where i knew i could see it, it was no where in sight.  if it had been an ordinary vehicle, i would have seen it from the top of the hill.  if it had been an airplane
