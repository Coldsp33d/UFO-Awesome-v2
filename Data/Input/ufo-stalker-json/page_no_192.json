spaceship shaped row of lights hovering above the ocean in front of us. another set of lights appeared out of nowhere and the tow sets of lights looked like two different objects hovering close to eachother. after awhile they dissapear and later on reappear further down left from us, closer to the peir yet look about the same distanc eaway as they were before. it usually starts of withe one set of lights then another set appears but this time after the second set dissapears again one set of light disconnects and start hovering one alittle far above the other one. the one on the bottom seems to fall into the ocean and the other one dissapears again. when they show up later me and 3 pthers drive to the peir and walk to the end of it where many are fishing and ask some people what they thought of what we saw and said it was probably a barge ship, even after we explained how far above they were flying of the ocean and how the lights dissapeared and reappeared in completely different spots. the lights then reappear and they seem just as far away from the peir as they did from our house. some people look but most don't pay much attention to the odd hovering, disappearing lights and keep fishing. after they dissapear again we go home and found out its common to see mysterious glowing lights and orbs in the sky in emerald isle nc, which seems odd because there's loud jets that fly by often i'm guessing from a government base nearby so maybe these lights are associated with the government?? not sure but weirdest tging ive ever seen especially since some people on the peir acted

apparently blocked my view.  my wife then repeated her question asking what that was in the sky.  she then motioned for me to come over to where she was sitting in her chair and look for myself.  i got up and walked over to her looking into the sky.  i could not believe my eyes.  it was a yellow/orange glowing orb like object moving very slowly in a north/north easterly direction.  it appeared to be pulsating.  at first i wasn't sure if it was a chinese style flying lantern that i have seen on tv.  i thought this could be a possibility as the object appeared to be on fire.  very quickly i dismissed this assumption as the orb appeared much more spherical in appearance.  i quickly retrieved my phone from my camp chair and took a photograph.  i then switched the camera to video.  i began recording the video of the orb.  the video i recorded was 22 seconds long.  i stopped recording because as i recorded it looked to me like the video quality was not very good and appeared very \"grainy.\"   after i stopped the recording the orb continued for another minute or two in a north/north easterly direction.  rather quickly the orb changed course to head in a more northerly direction and appeared to accelerate quickly.  the orb appeared smaller and smaller and disappeared from sight.  altogether the entire incident was approximately 2-3 minutes in duration.

freaks out again\r\n.\r\nthe last photo was not take by me, but is very close to the image of alien that i have.\r\nthe only way to see if these aliens are few or many or if they are being controlled (like my drone) by the two orbs seen far away in the background... if so, these guy are super awesome uav pilots. galactic champions, if you will.\r\nwatch this footage at super slow-mo and have some

can’t you see it?!” and he pointed straight up into the night sky. i only saw it a second or two later because the color of the flying vessel was a dim metal grey and – regrettably – my eyes aren't what they used to be and had to adjust again to the dark sky. but, after also having spotted it, and having just enough time to focus, it was exactly obove us and i could clearly discern it. it was not even that small. this also proved to be the most spectacular event we saw that night. it must have been after 23:00 hrs., maybe 23:15. making a photograph was out of the question: too dark, no camera within grabbing range and no time to get one inside.\r\n\r\nthe direction was approximately east-west. and it passed right over our heads, no sound.\r\nthe vessel seemed to be one object in a diamond shape (don't laugh: something like thunderbird 2, but edgier), seemingly again consisting of four separate diamond-shaped segments.\r\nthey may, on the other hand, have been 4 grey graphitic segments flying very closely together as if forming one object.\r\nbut i am pretty certain it was the former. the reason for (some) doubt lies in a kind of indentations between these segments. like the indentation for an exhaust pipe in the chassis of a car.\r\nadditionally, in the middle of each of the four segments, there was a (as to form) lightning-like bluish-white neon tube-like light, but serrated light like a real lightning bolt, put in a diagonal position to the center of the whole. as i remember it, the four lights alternately – and very quickly – went on and off, i.E. they rapidly flashed in a kind of crosswise pattern, but in a very exact and regular rhythm.\r\ni have never witnessed anything like this. my mother still hasn't because her eyes could not meet the challenge of the dark and fast movement of the object..\r\nthe vessel did not seem to be flying very high, we heard not a sound from it although it moved right over our heads. my estimate is that it went pretty speedy, maybe between 150 and 200 km/h (as said: no sound) but since the height was rather unclear, so remain its size and speed.\r\nif i must make an estimate: height: approx. 100 mtrs. size: about the size of a fighter jet (which it was not). my guess (if it was 50 to 60 meters up), circa 20x7 meters at the largest. if it was higher up it would be anybody’s guess. was it a drone, possibly? who might know? how big do ‘they’ make them these days. (and would ‘they’ now know how to make those fly in complete silence too?).\r\n\r\nthis last event feels as a one-time experience and i gladly share it on your site. hopefully it will contribute to good things, such as facing up and bringing an end to the playground-like ridicule and mocking of serious people who are brave enough to devote themselves to the explanation of these phenomena, or simply dare testify about their seeing them, propagating truth and openness and - not the least - disclosure about these matters and, finally, trying to really devote ourselves to our continuous education and development, if not for a higher purpose then at least for our own good as mankind.

after picking up take-out food. i opened the sunroof to show him the stars. the first craft came into view traveling north at incredible speed but not in a straight line path. each deviation in course was mostly slight, noticable and instantaneous with little or no change in velocity or acceleration. the craft then made abrupt turns, stops, and then turns completing a segmented loop and then continued northward fading in the light-polluted sky. immediately following was the second craft behaving just like the first, excepting the loop, and faded in the same direction as the first.\r\nthe
