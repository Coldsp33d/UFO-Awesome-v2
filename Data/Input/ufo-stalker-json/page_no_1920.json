possibly some type of weather or other balloon but not like anything i've seen before so ...Just for the record! i was driving on silas creek parkway in winston-salem around 9:15 am and as i slowed at the intersection of silas and peter's creek and was turning to the right onto peter's creek, i looked up to see something \"floating\" fairly high in sky to my left, in a south easterly direction.  what caught my eye was that it was very dark against the light blue morning sky, and elongated, vertical, strangely shaped - nothing like a \"regular\" flyaway helium balloon, banner, or any recognizable aircraft or bird -i almost hate to say but it reminded me of those \"flying humanoid\" things i've seen on tv!  i lost sight of it as i drove up to my bank on peter's creek parkway, but as i was sitting at the teller window i caught sight of it again, high over the tree line to my right, and i asked the teller if she could see it also, and asked her opinion of what it might be?  she said she could, and called another teller to come over and she also saw it, but all of us were frankly puzzled as to the object's identification or purpose.  just about that time, a flock of birds crossed overhead in the opposite direction, and i half-heartedly joked \"well, at least i hope birds don't start dropping out of the sky like the news has been reporting all over the globe!\" \r\n\r\ni was wondering if the national weather service had a balloon up there at the time or if anyone else had reported seeing the object, or if it was large enough to be caught on radar?  i would have thought it might be a collapsed balloon, except it seemed to keep moving at the same altitude or even higher, it certainly wasn't coming downward ��� but moving very slowly, almost seemed to be standing still at times - much slower than runaway balloons normally seem to travel in the atmosphere, it seemed to deliberately continue in the same direction the entire time - not moving erratically but very steadily.  honestly the best description i could give is, it looked rather like a hefty man suspended in the air - as if dangling from some invisible plane! except it had to be bigger than a person, because it was so visible at that height.  so all told, whatever it was, was in sight for at least 20 minutes and i could have probably sighted it longer, except i had to get to work at that point and could not continue to track it.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the truck, maintaining altitude. it was changing colors from red to white but in a twinkling \"star like fashion\" there was no place to pull over in the first few seconds, but we kept the object in sight. then a second \"starlike\" object came out only this one was smaller. i got out and the \"plane or what ever\" passed over head. it was dark but i could see what looked like a long cylinder with very slim \"wings\" at the very back, there was no audible sound.\r\n\r\nit had two white lights on the front, and two red lights at the rear close together in the center. there are lots of aircraft with a rear set wing, but these wings were comming from the very back where the horizontal stabilizers are normally located, and appeared to be more like sticks than wings as they were very

january 2, 2011 at 7:05am when i noticed an intense light in the distance coming from the sky to the east, seemingly several miles in the distance.  i first assumed it to be a conventional craft; however, what was strange about it was how brightly the light was glowing, especially considering that it was essentially day-time. i continued to monitor the craft out of curiosity and soon thereafter the intense light began to subside, but not completely diminish, revealing more details about the craft's design.  it had no easily discernible surface features and appeared to be completely smooth, the brightness of the light on the structure had greatly decreased and remained only as a dull orb of illumination that was located in the middle of the underside of the craft which itself was clearly disc-shaped, though at one point it did appear to have perhaps some more angular and geometric features, though the general shape of the craft itself appeared to be that of a disc, there were obviously no wings, and all other features that could be seen as being indicative of a conventional human origin were absent. the object hovered in the sky without any sort of obvious flight path, it did move left and right, up and down, but these were slight and graceful maneuvers that were not easily noticeable, or dramatic. after the first minute, or two of observation it had noticeably moved closer to my position which i found to be disconcerting as i was the only one in the car, and on the road at the time.  as i got a closer-view of it i noted it seemed to have a gunmetal coloring best described as a dull gray/black.  i continued to keep my eyes fixed on it and it appeared to \"blink\" out of distance 3-4 times, i had considerably slowed my speed and was clearing tracking it when i noted it \"vanishing\" and \"reappearing\".  the way it moved was very strange and foreign, if i had not been able to see changes in where it was positioned in the air, it would've been very difficult to even perceive its movement.  at this point i had been watching it for nearly 5 minutes when trees and other objects in the road started becoming obstacles and preventing me from seeing it..  the craft started out coming from the east, heading west, and with a considerable altitude (it is difficult for me to exactly estimate its starting height in the sky as i have no background in such things and it would be an arbitrary guess.), and by the end of the sighting had noticeably lowered its altitude, maybe comparable to the altitude you'd commonly see a low-flying helicopter and appeared to be moving west and at my last glimpse of it, it had crossed over to the other side of county line road and seemed to be clearly moving west, where as initially it was difficult to ascertain a flight path.  it is also worth noting that i had am radio on the whole time for background noise, and when the ufo was at its closest point to me the radio completely ceased to function briefly, first there was a gratuitous amount of static, then the radio went silent, though it was still on.  this could be completely unrelated, or have a completely mundane explanation, but it is too big of a coincidence not to mention.  and as mentioned before, when i first spotted the object it appeared to be several miles in the distance, and towards the end of the sighting its distance away could be measured in hundreds of meters.  i eventually turned off the road, i continued to scan the sky for the object, but there was no trace that i could see.  i did not immediately share this occurrence with anyone, besides one person, because of the unavoidable skepticism and scrutiny it would inevitably bring as well as the sort of persisting environment of ridicule that exists for those making any sort of claim that is perceived to be extraordinary.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"New year's eve 2010, at approximately 11:00 pm pst, my wife and i both observed two orangish objects in the southeast night sky, approximately 25-30 degrees above the horizon.  based on the surrounding hills, it was our guess that they might have been somewhere between the towns of peshastin, wa and cashmere, wa although if they were higher up or big, they might have been closer to wenatchee, wa.  the sighting was through a large bathroom window.  \r\n\r\nbeing an extremely clear night, it was easy to distinguish the two objects from the surrounding stars, not only because of their color, but also because they were considerably larger than the stars. in fact, that is what attracted us to them, not only because of the orange glow, but also because they were bigger than the surrounding stars and in a place where we had never seen big stars. \r\n\r\nbecause it was night, we didn't have any way of telling how high up they were and what size they were.  all we could tell is that they appeared as if they were orbs. at that point, our instincts told us that the objects were perhaps 10 miles to our southeast and maybe several thousand feet above the ground, but those facts are purely guesses. \r\n\r\nat first, each object appeared to be stationary.  perhaps a minute later, one of the objects appeared to travel slowly to the northwest, which would have put it on a straight course to possibly travel over our house.  as it progressed, it also appeared to become  slightly larger than it was initially, which would probably be the case if it was, in fact, headed our way. \r\n\r\nwhen they both started moving our way, all of a sudden the second orb, which was behind the first one when we first saw them, seemed to do an about face and went in a south east direction for a few seconds, then appeared as if it was heading toward the ground.  we lost sight of it when it went down below the hills which surround our home.  \r\n\r\nthe object moving in our direction appeared to be about 60- 75 degrees above the southeast horizon.  after traveling toward our home for about a minute or so, it appeared to stop and seemed as if it was perhaps only a mile or two away and several thousand feet above the ground. again, the distances are strictly speculation.  \r\n\r\nsince the remaining object was now much higher in the sky and closer to our home, i went outside for a better view.  the object was still glowing orange and remained stationary.  suddenly, the object began to pulsate with a strong, white light which lasted several seconds.  it reminded me of a strobe light.  the light was so bright, it was difficult to look directly at it.  after maybe 5 seconds, the white light then faded back to the orange glow and then repeated itself perhaps two more times, each time emitting the same strobe-like white light.  \r\n\r\nafter the strobe light episode, the orange glow of the orb pulsated, making the object appear larger, then it would go back to the original size.  the length of time it took for it to grow larger then return to the original size was about four seconds.  it then paused for around 5-10 seconds and then repeated the growing large then returning to the original size again.  it did this around 4 or 5 times.  after that episode, it then slowly, over the course of maybe 15 seconds, faded until there was nothing left to observe.\r\n\r\nthe entire sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.  throughout the sighting, we were astounded that there was absolutely no sound.  again, because we were unable to use a frame of reference, it could have been so high up that we wouldn't hear any sound.\r\n\r\nbecause the sighting was so noticable to us, we thought others must have seen what we saw but in subsequent days we heard nothing and saw nothing in the local media, until we were directed to the ufo northwest website, where we read the account of the family in bremerton, wa.  \r\n\r\ntheir appearance, and the fact that there was more than one, lead us to speculate that maybe we were seeing similar objects. we also thought there might be some connection to the many folks who were setting off fireworks throughout the valley but neither one of us had ever seen anything like this before.   \r\n\r\n

wales.  it was quite dark, there was a solid ceiling of clouds not high but not low either. i noticed a reddish-orange light in the sky heading in my general direction from the west. it was slow moving, much like the speed of a slow moving helicopter, my first thought is that it was and the bright light was its search beacon. i didn't think too much of it until it came closer, but i continued to watch it.\r\n\r\nit was flying in a straight and level path well below the cloud cover and soon began a wide-arced turn which is when i started to realize it was something abnormal. the bright light never dimmed as a search beacon should have if it had been turned away. i dashed into the house, grabbed my camera and snapped off a shot.  unfortunately, the shutter remained open for 1/10 of a second causing a blurred shot.  it was too dark to see the adjustments on my camera so i didn't take any more shots. the object had grown closer as it made its turn to the north, appearing much like a very bright military flare at this point.  there was no smoke coming from it, the sky was clear enough that i would easily have seen any.  it made no sound, no red and white lights hazzard lights were flashing from either side and the intensity of the light made it impossible to see any details of the object. i doubt it could have been more than 10 to 20 feet in height and width.  its speed never varied, its trajectory seemed to be controlled as it never climbed, dipped or wavered to either side. there is no way anyone could convince me that this was a chinese lantern...Far too bright to be that. i estimate the closest it got to me was within 1/4 mile, its altitude being only 1000 to 1500 feet at most.\r\n\r\ni continued to observe the object for a full four to five minutes before it dissappeared over the hilltops to the northwest, heading in the direction of the nearest raf base. the light grew only slightly dimmer as the object grew more distant. while the object was recorded on my camera the duration of the shutter opening showed movement of the camera and gave the recorded image the appearance of a fireball with a tail (a tail that the object i saw did not possess). i more adhered to the object being something military in nature due to both my lack of explanation of it and its course in the direction of the raf base.  that is until my friend called me from the uk on december 31, 2010 to tell me she had seen two objects near her house (that same house) which matched my description to a tee. that's when i started searching and saw there seems to be many sightings identical in nature from many parts of the world.

light. as i drove the pattern of this shadow continued to be erratic in its flight. it was also very fast and seemed to \"skip\" or \"slide\" across the sky at a very fast rate.  well, i suddenly found myself directly under this phenomenon. i had the feeling this thing knew i was watching it.  i started to see a break in the clouds and focused on this point to see if i could see anything other than the shadowy glow and the thing disappeared as though someone turned the light off.  i witnessed this phenomenon for about 30 minutes or so. perhaps this was a search light.  but, then why was there a search light in rocklin on a monday night?  i have lived here for years and have never seen a search light.  and, why wasn't there any beam that could be seen?  and, why did the light seem dim and appear to be coming from within the cloud formation?

what i thought at 1st was a plane i \r\nwalked to the left lit my cigarette and looked up at jupiter (i think) which i always do at night, but i could still see the \"plane\" in my \r\nperipheral vision and it didn't seem to have moved so i walked back over to the left and i could see it unobstructed between two tree branches so \r\ni used the branches to try and judge movement and i couldn't see any and i now noticed it looked a bit odd there were two normal white lights \r\nthat looked the same as on most commercial jets but they were in the middle very close together and there were two outer lights but all four were very close together and at the outer lights it seemed to curve some and there was no bright white blinking off of any of them which you normally see on planes and there was no small red blue or green blinking light that i could see anywhere, i was starting to panic at this point because it still wasn't moving and now i can't remember what color the two outer lights were. at that point i ran left again to knock on my kitchen windows then i thought no one inside would come fast enough, so i ran inside and my mom was right there and she came out right away and saw it, it still hadn't moved then i ran back in and told my brother to grab his binoculars (i don't know why i didn't think camera) and i threw my sons coat at him because i wanted him to see too, when i ran back outside it still hadn't moved and i was trying to point it out to my son, then it started dipping below the tree line i think at this point it had been a good 5-8 minutes (hard to tell when you're that excited but my cigarette had burned down) so i ran down my back stairs and up my driveway and i could still see it between trees and then a few seconds later i couldn't see it anymore. my brother and son never saw it, my mother did and she said it looked wierd not like a plane at all but she thinks it may have been a helicopter, but she says it definitely was not moving at all for a few minutes.I believe in ufo's, i always have as far back as i can remember and i have seen one in broad daylight back in about 1997, but i'm not crazy and i don't think every flashing light in the sky is a ufo, i'm a very rational, objective person. i live in boston and i'm very accustomed to airplanes and helicopters day and night, i'm well aware how they can look odd sometimes especially at night and how they can look like they aren't moving. this was positvely not moving, and i'm about 98% sure it was a saucer shaped ufo. i do want to add though, air traffic seemed quite normal so i'm guessing there was nothing odd picked up on radar anywhere.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

something streaking across the sky. he pointed it out to me and we both watched dumbfounded as this thing streaked across the sky parallel to us. it was dark grey, had sort of a pinecone shape. it had no lights and there was an erie silence as it streaked past. it also had no tail engine or light in the rear as it passed us. we initially thought it was a satellite streaking by but it was much closer and didn't glow like they do. it was almost barely visible. there was no glow like something reentering earths atmosphere either. we estimated it to be at about 15,000-20,000ft traveling quite quickly like satellites do. it then made a sharp adjustment in its trajectory and we watched it until it disappeared behind trees and houses. i made a quick sketch of the incident within a minute.\r\n\r\nthe moment (when looking for meteors) sounded like this: \r\n\"oh theres one! ..Wait, what is that? \r\n-i dont know. ..Its not glowing or anything. \r\n-maybe its a satellite.

parkway makes its way over the 405, there is a great view of mt. hood and since this day was bright and clear, mt. hood was particularly visible.\r\n\r\ni had headphones on and the world was drowned out by the beats of amon tobin.  i continued ahead, but turned my head to the right so i could check out the view.  i was noting to myself that mt. hood was remarkably white with snow and that hopefully we'll have plenty of water this summer, when i noticed some movement out of my left field of vision.  there was a tiny dot in the sky - about the size of half a grain of white rice - moving in a straight southern direction.  what struck me immediately was that it appeared to be gliding, rather then flying.  \r\n\r\nthere are often planes flying over this space in a north/south direction and for an instant, i thought i was seeing a passenger plane.  no sooner had i thought this, then i realized the for a plane to be that far away, it was moving awfully fast, so i immediately rationalized it as a sea gull; also not an uncommon sight along this road.\r\n\r\nnote: i travel on foot on this road several times a week and i've done so for years; i am very familiar with the general environment.\r\n\r\nbut, i couldn't see any wings.\r\n\r\nas i was processing this - perhaps two seconds had passed - it passed directly behind an electrical pole.  i began leaning foreword in an attempt to see around it and as a result was able to see just the northern-facing end of it as it, without slowing or stopping, began to move in a more easterly direction, exactly along my line of sight of the pole.\r\n\r\nit moved along the pole for perhaps another second and then, once again without slowing or stopping, continued on its southerly course at a very brisk glide.\r\n\r\nit never slowed or sped up.  it just kept going until it was gone.\r\n\r\npart ii: the next day\r\n\r\nnote: since i've told a few people this story, i have been amazed how many people don't know what i mean by \"book light\".  google \"book light\" if you are one of these people.\r\n\r\ni have, or rather, had, a small purple book light i bought at walmart a couple years ago.  i happened to be using it during my day on saturday and when i packed up to leave downtown, i forgot to put my light in my bag and instead put in my right coat pocket.  my coat is a rather heavy down jacket and the pockets are thick and deep.\r\n\r\ni know i put it in my pocket, because as i was walking, i remember rolling it in my hand a number of times.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home, i threw my coat on the couch and went to the bathroom.  while in the bathroom, i remembered my book light and wanted to make sure i got it out of my pocket before i forgot.  i went back into the front room, picked up my coat, reached into the pocket and it was gone.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was that it had fallen out as i took my hand out of my pocket at some point on the way home.  a couple weeks earlier this happened with my bus pass, so it was a very real possibility.  but, i also thought, perhaps i had absent-mindedly put it in another pocket or my bag.\r\n\r\nnope.  not anywhere.\r\n\r\ni thought, perhaps it fell into the sofa cushions when i threw my coat there.  pulled them all out.  nope.\r\n\r\ni looked all around the general area in case it had fallen out when i threw my coat.  nope.\r\n\r\nit was gone, having fallen out of my pocket.  damn it!  i gotta be more careful about that.\r\n\r\ni go into the bathroom and take a long shower and go directly into my bedroom and dink around on the computer.\r\n\r\nabout two or three hours have passed since i looked for my light and its now about 10:45pm.\r\n\r\ni go out into the front room and bam!  its right there, smack-dab in the middle of my front room!\r\n\r\nbright purple light on the light cream carpet.  how could have i missed that?\r\n\r\nthe answer: there's no way i could have missed it!\r\n\r\ni got goose bumps and was a little freaked out.\r\n\r\ni called a couple of friends to tell them what had happened, but no one answered.  so, i called my mom.\r\n\r\ni didn't touch it.  i left it on the floor.\r\n\r\ni'll deal with it in the morning.\r\n\r\ni got up just after eight.\r\n\r\nit was gone.\r\n\r\ni live alone.  i have no pets.  the doors were locked.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27232,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5307715,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01032011-0015","longitude":-122.6675571,"occurred":1292622780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,

live on the third floor.  the windows face south towards sutro tower.  i was watching tv on the my laptop with a dim lamp on in the room.  a flashing light caught my eye from the top of the hills to the south.  i looked out the window and saw a series of flashes from the top of the hill, perhaps a quarter mile away.  my first thought was that someone was taking flash photographs from the top of the hill.  why someone would do this in the middle of the night is beyond me, but i was searching for a rational explanation for what i was seeing.  the flashing went on for perhaps five minutes, in intervals of about thirty seconds, flashing five to seven times each time.  as i continued to look towards the top of the hill, the flashing became less regular in its intensity, whereas the first several flashes had been a bright white,  the next several flashes were infused with bits of vibrant red and blue.  next, the flashing light took a different position on top of the same hill, slightly off to the side of where it had been.  it glowed a faint \"trio\" of white, blue, and red light.  the light then seemed to sort of morph and change, and a glowing orb \"flew\" to the hill that is the eastern side of where the ucsf medical center and campus are.  as the orb flew past, the houses on the hill behind it were illuminated a brilliant red hue, directly behind where it passed.  i use the word \"flew\" in quotes because the orb object seemed to move in a way that was more \"fluid gliding\" if that makes sense.  it seemed to be made of plasma, and the light that it was/carried was like a \"liquid light\".  the orb then seemed to reposition itself on the new hill and stayed hovered there. it stayed a redish-amber glow at this point.  as i continued to look, i noticed two other lights positioned above and behind the orb.  they seemed to hover in the trees, and seemed very small, perhaps the size of bicycle headlamps.  i stood and watched for half an hour, this trio of hovering of small lights, one amber-red orb, the other two small twittering, twinkling white lights.  the lights were perhaps an eighth of a mile away. the smaller lights seemed to \"twitter\", or blink and flash in a way that looked like a morse code.  this configuration stayed put until the time i went to bed.  i felt somewhat afraid that the objects would get closer.  i, of course woke and they were gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27230,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.7794995,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01032011-0013","longitude":-122.4127655,"occurred":1294050900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg,
