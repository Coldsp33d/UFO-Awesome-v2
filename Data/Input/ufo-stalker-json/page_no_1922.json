southwestern sky, some of which were maneuvering in ways that seemed to defy conventional laws of physics. being an avid student of astronomy and all things sky-related, she ran inside to tell me what she saw, and i stepped out to see what she was talking about. by the time i looked, there were only two orbs left, as she said many of them had shot off in different directions and then disappeared. the orbs weren't falling or moving in any one particular direction, but almost seemed to \"sway\" in the sky before they slowly 'phased' out. admittedly, there were many fireworks going off for new years, although this was a good two hours before midnight. based upon the angular position of the objects in the sky as well as their bizarre movements, it was completely inconsistent with fireworks that i am familiar with. our neighbors, who were one of the families engaging in firework launching also made comments about the anomalous lights, remarking on never seeing anything like it before. my initial thought was to grab my 1200mm xt6 reflecting telescope to get a closer look, but within about a minute of coming out of the house, the orbs vanished in place. they looked like very bright red stars, slightly less radiant as sirius but more stable in terms of consistent brightness. there is no doubt in my mind that these were not astronomical objects of any kind, and the combination of 'some moving rapidly/some not moving at all' seems to rule out the possibility of these simply being fireworks or flares. after they phased out, i never witnessed any further activity that night. having studied the subject of unknown aerial phenomenon extensively, it should be noted that this phenomenon is identical to sightings reported in southern australia, tinley park illinois, and the uk.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

helicopter usually does, and emitting an orange glow without any blinking lights like most aircraft. i woke my wife up to get her opinion on it as we were now coming up on it above us. at this point i had to look back at the road because it was flying over us. she watched as it flew over us and across the freeway back towards the east and noticed the shape being round with the back end being flat.

we lost site of the object and weren't able to see it anymore. we had no feelings other than confusion at what we had seen.  \r\nwe see police helicopters on a nightly basis in la, and my wife grew up

of your fist when fully extended from your body. it seemed to fly across the sky and downward out of sight. i hollered to my fiance who was in the bathroom that i had just saw something. i went inside for a few moments, and while i was inside she saw the exact same thing from a different room. i had not described to her what it looked like yet, and she told me it was like one diamond on top of a smaller diamond that seemed to fly across the sky and was glowing with a bright light that seemed to emanate from the top diamond with a blue aura around it, and the smaller diamond below was also emanating a dimmer light with a lighter blue aura (it happened to be the exact same description of what i had seen about 20 seconds prior.) the objects seemed to fall from the sky, down below the horizon. we went outside after she told me she had seen it too. there were no clouds in the sky prior to this, and then a wave of a cloud-like smoke came across the sky. she went inside for a few minutes, and i noticed the cloud-like smoke was moving incredibly fast across the sky. when she came back outside, i came in and she said the smoke was rising more, and then mysteriously vanished into thin air. i felt a sense of awe watching the events unfold, and she was scared to death. my brother did not witness the diamond-like objects, but he did witness the smoke. he was just as interested and in awe as i was. i'm still in a sense of awe as i post this, a mere 20 minutes after the sightings we have seen. i did not have a camera to take pictures with, and the objects moved by relatively quickly, lasting in the sky almost a few moments. the objects moved by too quickly to take a picture even if i had a camera. i've seen meteor showers and shooting stars, and i assure you that this experience was neither.","distance":"Over One

still.  one dimmed iits lights and flew low over a nearby field that is also near hwy 99 and then into the neighborhood and out of sight. this was about 8:45 pm. the kids drug me out of bed to see the ones still standing still in the sky. what i saw looked orb like or oval in shape, there were three of them, blinking about five different colors and made no sound. we live near mather afb and can also hear planes from sac international airport, these made no sound. they also could hover like helicopters but again no sound. i was able to watch with the kids for about 15 min they seemed to scattered away from each other and then one that was blinking multicolored lights began blinking only a blue and silver light. two flew away in opposite directions and one seemed to just disappear. i had the kids draw what they saw. the boys drawings look oval shaped, my daughter drew the one that flew close by and it was shaped like a flat rectangle. we did take pictures and video with our cell phones but they are horrible quality so i wont submit them unless someone really wants to see them. none of the kids were worried or afraid they all seemed to be excited. i felt apprehensive, it seemed like the more pictured we took the closer two of them came. i had the kids come in off the roof and we watched them from inside the house. we watched for them again tonight but they weren't there and didn't show up. the major things that make me think this was unusuall were they shapes of the crafts, the many blinking colored llights, and how they made no sound.

lightly.I was traveling on matowomanbeantown road going from 301 south to rt 5. i was aprox half way down the road, where the park and ride is located at, when i saw a huge aircraft about 200ft in length emerg out of the clouds about 100 ft over the tree line. the first thing i noticed when i saw the craft coming out of the clouds was that it had an unusal amount of lights on the front of it to be and airplane. being that i am in the aerospace industry i see large aircraft on a daily basis and none of them have that many lights. nevertheless i was just thinking it was a large plane flying low. i continued driving slowly and watching it and shortly after it came out of the clouds, it banked a hard right maybe 60 degrees or more and at this point i could see the entire shape of the craft. it had lights covering the entire priemeter of the craft and what seemed like what would be the cockpit/fuselage it had lights surounding that part too. in the center of the craft where the fuselage would be at there was a red blinking light ontop of the craft and one on the bottom of it. this is what is called and anticollison light required by all aircraft flying in us airspace. i got excited at this point because i thought it was a b2 bomber and i have never seen one before. being that ive never seen one before i was not sure of the light pattern of the b2. it had the exact same shape a b2 has except the tail of the craft cut straight accross from wing tip to wing tip. the b2 has several triangle shapes on the tail of the aircaft. once the craft came out of its 60 degree bank and leveled off it just sat in one spot and did not move. at this point i pulled over because i was amazed that it stopped and hovered. i did not think this was a ufo, but was just some sort of aircraft that didnt exisit. so i pulled over and got out of the car expecting to hear a very loud enging running because the craft was hovering and it takes alot of power to hover an aircraft. i got out and i heard nothing but silence. thats when my heart started to beat really fast because i had an idea of what i was seeing. i went to grab my phone to take and picture and the lights just went out. i could still see the craft in the sky being that it was no more than 75 ft from me and it was snowing so it was easy to see. the craft was dark almost black and i could still easily see it hovering. i watched it for about 5 mins with its lights off just sitting there hovering. after the 5 mins it just started to slowly move out of sight and that was the last i saw of it. i did not hear any jet aircraft in the area which i thought was wierd because i was just outside of andrews airforce base and you cant get near that place with out setting off some sort of alarm. i know of 3 aircraft that can hover and two of those are stationed in the area i work and live. those being the osprey and joint strike fighter. both of these make alot of noise. this craft made absoultly no noise and just sat there and hovered. i havnt the slightested idea of what i saw that night. not sure it was man made or not of this earth. im leaning towards man made because of the anticollision lights located on it. but i know of no aircraft that is 200ft on length and can hover with out making any noise. i will truly never forget this expierence.","distance":"21-100

over the road.  my first thought was that it looked like a new radio or phone tower with red, blue, and yellow lights, but i knew that wasn't possible because we travel down taht road often.  we first saw the lights about half a mile away and as we got closer we realized that the lights were hovering just over the tree line attached to a dark boomerang or triangle shape.  all of the lights seemed to be flashing at first, but as we got closer all the lights were shining down towards the road.  the object was not moving at all it was just hovering over the road.  when we passed under it we still could not figure out what it was, i wasn't driving so i turned around to look back and see it from the other side and i couldn't see it anymore.  we turned around about 100 yards past the object to try and get a picture of it but it was gone, no lights in the trees, in the sky, or anywhere else that i could find.  the object was not a helicopter because it made no sound, and not a plane because it was too low and did not move.  whatever the thing was it was about as wide as the highway and i could not tell how long it was because it was dark behind the lights.  this is the first time i've ever seen anything that i couldn't explain around here although i did see unexplained lights in the sky in iraq in 2003.  this area is only about 45 miles from ft. bragg/pope air force base, so i guess it could possibly be some kind of military project that i've never heard of.  i'm not one to jump to conclusions, but this thing has me confused.  i don't know if anyone else saw the object or made any kind of report.  i really just want to know if this fits with ufo sightings or if anyone can tell me what this may have been because it was only about 3 miles from my house.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

primera vez que vi un ovni fue en marzo del 2008. no recuerdo exactamente la fecha, y la ���nica fuente que tenia para confirmar (mail contando la experiencia a otra persona) desapareci���..\r\nfue en la ciudad de villahermosa, tabasco. m���xico. \r\nestaba viendo la tele con mi novio, cuando mi cu���ado nos llama para que salgamos a ver algo.. cuando voy al balc���n de la casa, logro visualizar como 4 luces rojas en el cielo, pero no se alcanzaba a distinguir ninguna forma, solo luces. se mov���an lento, para cualquier direcci���n sin ning���n problema.. empezaron a danzar o formar figuras entre ellos, y luego se fueron incorporando de a poco, dos objetos mas.. siguieron haciendo l���neas, rombos, tri���ngulos, y despu���s de 4 minutos aproximadamente, empezaron a desplazarse hacia un costado hasta desaparecer de mi vista. fueron pasando uno por uno, como por una misma ruta, as��� hasta perderse, siempre con una velocidad lenta, sin realizar movimientos bruscos. no se pod���a distinguir la distancia, pero daban la sensaci���n de que estaban mas lejos de lo que parec���a. yo en ese momento estaba acompa���ada de 6 personas, m���s otros vecinos de la cuadra que salieron a ver tambi���n al ser avisados. intentamos ver con un telescopio, sacar fotos, pero era in���til.. no se lograba visualizar nada desde esa distancia. \r\nen ese momento no pod���a creer lo que estaba viviendo, espere toda mi vida para verlos, y cuando llego ese momento, era muy dif���cil de creer.. hasta ahora lo recuerdo y es algo m���gico que pude presenciar. \r\nal d���a siguiente del suceso, averig������ si alguien m���s vio algo as���, y solo una persona confirmo haber visto entre 3 o 4 objetos, cerca del lugar. mire las noticias, y no encontr��� ninguna informaci���n relacionada. \r\ny eso fue todo. \r\nhasta ahora me pregunto: ���para que vienen? ���qu��� hacen o buscan?
