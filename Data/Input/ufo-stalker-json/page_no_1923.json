shaped object dart away from the contrail and descend very rapidly! for the rest of the day contrails were forming e to w creating a blue and white striped sky. the contrail themselves are a mystery and seem to be related to orb presence. on 12/15 i observed a black oval object leave an area of contrails. exactly like the photo from mo posted on report page right now. i agree with the witness in mo when they say that these contrails don't dissapate like normal jet contrails. i have seen the same thing countless times now. when i try to view the maker of the contrail with binoculars, i sometimes see a long dull gray plane with no markings. othe times i see a small, highly reflective object that appears to be a plane length ahead of the contrail! kind of bouncing around. i haven't reported anything for a few months now, but felt compelled to today. end of the year thing. maybe. anyway, on 12/2 i saw two white strobing orbs floating right near each other. the next thing i know, they turn pale orange, get bigger, and ascend rapidly out of sight. other phenomenom that i personally feel are connected: blue and pink auras in the clouds, but not near the sun which would explain the colors, white flashes of light at night. also blue. orbs that look like common stars until they start moving, ascending, descending, merging with others, make sharp turns, blink on and off,fly in really low, to name a few.  colors of the orbs range from white to amber to yellow. i have been seeing strange things like this consistently. how i feel? bewildered awe. happy new year mufon, i'm sure

unusual to see something that low and that bright in the sky in this area.  at first i thougt it may be the life flight helicopter landing - but there was no noise, and my dog was barking at it - he has never barked at life flight when it has flown over before.\r\n  this bright light was moving very slow and was very bright white;no other colors were visable. i kept my eye on it, as i started walking down the driveway to get past the trees to get a good look at it.  it was low, could not have been any higher than 2 or 3 thousand feet, maybe the height of a radio transmitter tower.  as i was getting even with the tree line, the object started to make a slow arching turn towards the east, and began to speed up.  when i cleard the trees and was standing in the open pasture, the object was gaining altitude; then suddenly accelerated to the east and was out of sight in less than a second - with absolutley no noise. struck me as wierd; i have seen things in the sky before - but for some reason - this bugged me.  i have told my husband (who arrived home about 20 minutes after the sighting) about this - but have not told anyone else.  i keep a camera handy - but did not take it

have an unobstructed view to the west, as i live in the roxborough/manayunk section of the city, with an elevation of 300' above sea level. i was finishing my work on the computer, and had previously watched the sunset, which occurs at 4:43pm on this date. every clear day, it is like watching a pacific sunset, as the sky becomes golden, filled with layers of red and blue as time progresses. after sunset, i was attracted to the window just to continue to watch the sky change. due west, over the rooftops and towards the tree line which marks the schuylkill expressway about 3 miles away, i noted three objects of intense brightness which stood out above the sunset. the clearest one was almost on a straight line from me, about 30 degrees above the tree line. its distance is hard to measure, but i would estimate anywhere from 5-10 miles at least. the clearest intensely bright object appeared spherical, or round. off to the right, about 40 to 45 degrees and separated by at least ten miles, were two bright objects which looked more like streaks oriented left to right on a tilt from my perspective, bottom to top. though it was too far to see these objects moving, their movement was discernible by reference to fixed objects. what made this interesting, was that if this was weather phenomena, the objects went in different paths, the \"streaks\" moved up and towards the right, which is wnw, while the bright sphere/orb appeared to move right to left before fading from view after 5 minutes observation. these objections were so bright they stood out against the afterglow of sunset, at least 10x brighter than the surrounding sky. i never hesitated in my feeling that these were unnatural objects due to their intensity, and the strangeness of their appearance as i have observed innumerable sunsets and never saw this before. all three objects seemed to grow more distant and fade into the sky. the only \"camera\" i had was a 3 megapixel iphone 3gs. i am attaching the one picture, untouched ( i can \"edit\" in iphoto playing with contrast and other features ) but the orb is slightly visible over the fireplace of the house in the foreground. i am referring to the house with snow on both sides of the chimney, almost exactly in the center of the photo. i had used the zoom application on the camera, but couldn't see the object in the viewfinder at the time i was looking right at it, when taking it in the iphone. it was only after uploading the photo i saw it did appear exactly where i knew to look, over the fireplace of the house in the center of the photo.This is truly a case of the picture not doing justice to the subject, as even while i was looking at the iphone picture full screen as i was taking it, i could barely see what was so clear to the naked eye. i only wish i had my camera, with its great resolution and zoom, but was in my car. i can state i have never seen anything like this before. p.S. i was wearing my corrective lenses, but these objects were visible without them!!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

forgive any grammatical greviences and spelling errors.\r\n\r\nat 1842 hrs, on the night of december 27th, 2010, i was waiting at a bus stop for my ride to work. the night was clear with little to no cloud cover. \r\n\r\ni was distracted and looking around waiting for the bus to arrive, thinking \"a watched pot never boils,\" when something from the corner of my eye caught my attention. what appeared to be a bright flash drew my attention to the sky. the object was to my w-nw at approximately 10 o'clock from my perspective, and i was facing north on the street. as to what altitude it was at i can not guess, as at night, anything with a light on it could be 100 feet up or out into the atmosphere for all i know. all i do know was that it was in the direction of a flight path for the international airport, and appeared to be at the same, or at similar altitude that the aircraft fly at. it was just a bright blue-ish white object that was flying at a leisurely pace in a n-ne direction. \r\n\r\nat first i thought it to be an aircraft, namely the night patrol helicopter that is often overhead my neighborhood. however, this was not like the helicopter. now please bear with me but this is the part that confused me. the light was too bright and to, uh, \"pure\" to be the helicopter. with the patrol helicopter's lights, they appear to be, well, white, with no idications of color, and often i can see the beam, or at least the \"starburst pattern\" when the light is directed in my direction. the rotating beacons on the copter can be seen as well, so when the light is not on, you can see the tail and the red/green indicator lights. \r\n\r\nthe light on what i saw was very bright and just on the blue side of white. it didn't appear to be a directed beam either, but like a light source viewed from a distance. the brightness of it is what caught my attention. it was bright enough to divert my attention away from the passing cars and street lights. as i watched the object, i noted that it was heading in an apparent n-ne direction, and at a speed that would put it out of my field of view behind a building across the street in several seconds. \r\n\r\nit was shortly after i noticed it that the light began to fade. this is why it stood out to me. the light just got dimmer, until it looked like a small dim orange light, as opposed to the bright blue. not just like a light shutting off, but visibly got dimmer.  no indicator lights, no rotating tail beacons. the dim orange light was a little dimmer than some of the stars that were observable at that time. the dimmer light did not change course either. just continued on it's n-ne course. it was then that the object was obsecured by the building, and my bus was visible at the end of the street. when i got off the bus later, i continued to look for the light to the north, but it had been several minutes on the bus and i did not expect to see anything. \r\n\r\nthe whole incident couldn't have been more than 10-20 seconds. i myself felt nothing in relation to the object, except perhaps curiosity.\r\n\r\n i can only conclude that this objet was either space debris, or perhaps a polar orbit satellite. i assumed it to be glint from a satellite's panels, so i checked online to see if anything was transiting, but no satellites were reported transiting my area at that time. it didn't have the repeating pattern from rotating that is often found in space debris either. but as i didn't observe the object with any length of time, i cannot make any firm conclusions.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

balcony, talking and smoking cigarettes. there is a large tree to your right when you're standing on this balcony looking out onto the street. the neighborhood is in a condo complex near the water in foster city, ca. \r\n  anyway, we were chatting away, when out of the corner of my eye i saw this orb appear from behind the tree. it arced out from behind this tree from my right to left. i was the first to notice it as it silently hovered no more than ten feet away from us at eye level. it was about 8-10 inches in diameter. the only way i can describe it is that it looked like a ball of plasma, the insides of it seemed to be moving. it was changing colors also, vivid reds and blues, pinks and orange; it was absolutely beautiful, like \"living light\". it didn't seen to emit light. it's hard to describe. it's like the light was internal, contained. after a few seconds my three friends noticed it too. the conversation fell silent and all four of us just stood there dumbfounded, staring at it. i remember it seemed difficult to focus on, it's as if my eyes couldn't get a sharp look at what exactly it was. it hovered there for about 20 seconds, then it seemed to notice that we had noticed it (we all got really quiet and were staring at it at this point). the plasma ball silently floated away to our right and disappeared behind the tree where it had appeared from.\r\n  we stood there shocked. nobody said a word for a minute that seemed like an eternity. i asked my friends \"did you guys see that?\" and they said \"yeah\". none of us could explain what it was. the funny thing is, none of us ever really talk about what we saw that night. i'll ask them from time to time if they remember that night, and they do. none of us can come up with an explanation of what the hell we saw.\r\n  years later, i can't shake the feeling that there was some kind of intelligence behind it. it's hard to explain. the way it moved was very precise and deliberate. at the time, it felt like it was watching us. i think about it every day and hope to find out what it really is we saw that night.\r\n  ","distance":"20 Feet or

bed, went to my room on the second story of my house and opened up my window to look at the night sky and smoke a couple cigarettes as we do sometimes before we sleep. my house is in a new development, the development was built on what used to be a bunch of farms, a couple ranches still surrounding. my house is in the coner of the development, i have no neighbors to the right and only one to the left, a house slightly smaller than our own. feilds surround our houses, very little light obstucts the night sky, it is always a very clear veiw.\r\n\r\nanyways, we're staring off towards where the stanislaus river would be, enjoying our smokes and an orb shoots into the sky, perfectly. about 50 feet staight up and stops. we watch it hover for about a minute, the only way to describe it's movements is perfect, precise, elegant as it started to \"float\" or \"hover\" towards my neighborhood. it went behind a couple houses beyond our veiw and we thought \"oh, well that was it\" and continued with our smokes.\r\n\r\nstill staring down my street and into the sky a bit in awe of what we had seen a deep eerie silence took to the surroundings,and it appears again. only this time hovering symetrically, parallel to the road and towards my house. it was only about 20 feet in the air and slow. of course, we started screaming the closer it got. loud! my sister was in the room right next to us, her bed directly on the other side of the wall where mine was. she had gone to bed. i am positive she did not have enough time to reach sleep, let alone a deep sleep. she did not wake up from our screaming. neither did my parents, who were just down the hall and sleep with their door wide open. it was completely silent except for our terror.\r\n\r\nas the object approached my house, let me tell you, the color was amber, yellow, red. the orb did not glare or hurt our eyes to look at. i shut my window yet my blinds were still open and we stopped screaming. it hovered directly in front of my house for about 30 seconds, it seemed to be on the streetlight, but not physically harming anything. the orb then shot off, so fast, to left of my neighbors house into the feild behind our houses. the streetlight was out for a moment and then flickered gradually back to on. i opened my window and we were leaning out onto the roof for just one more glipse of this unknown object. the feild was alight, a glow coming from it and turning everything sepia colored around us. we felt so calm, and like we wanted to see \"them\" communicate with \"them\". it was a tranquil feeling, like everything would be alright.\r\n\r\nwe were listening to a mix cd that had seemed to stop playing throughout this experience. we sat on my bed in awe and a song startled us a bit, from just starting to play. the lyrics are what may have alerted us, \"something tells me this isn't real, something tells me not to care.\"\r\n\r\nthat is really how we felt, you know? ironic, along with the fact that the cd was made that day and we just happened upon that song.\r\nwe left my window open for awhile trying to get just one more sighting, just to feel that almost comforting, calm, and tranquil feeling again.\r\n\r\nwhat has brought me to giving my experience to mufon, is that i've seen more unexplained events afterwards. orbs that turn into airplanes, some star treck/star wars looking craft hovering above a feild just 15 feet above the ground and rising slowly. i have never seen white owls until after my first experience. i know how stupid it sounds but research i've done makes me believe owls have something more to them. i mean i've seen 7 owls take off my roof uniformly, in a v-shape towards where i saw the first amber orb. shortly after they were out of sight i saw a white orb, in the same spot as the amber one, flight to to same highth in the sky, turn amber and almost flatten to disappear. i watched for about an hour and it did not go down my street this time, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nthere are very many witnesses to these owls, and a friend of my sister, who experienced the phoenix light phenomena (amber orbs) in the nineties has had strange dreams and experiences since moving to stanislas county.\r\n\r\nfriend's of mine, and people i don't even know have reported seeing these amber orbs. in daytime, nightime, dusk, dawn, twighlight. everyday school kids are seeing the orbs that turn into airplanes, a new one every week.\r\n\r\ni actually saw one while trying to describe them to one of my friends, sitting in his car around the coner from my house one night. he saw this also. my sister and her boyfriend said they had seen a strange airplane at the same time i had when i got home, they had asked me before i had said anything if i had seen it.\r\n\r\nso many multiplying strange events have happend since the first.\r\nan amber orb following my sister's boyfriend home from work, just twenty feet above his truck and mimicking his speed, almost messing with him. he felt calm, and in awe.\r\n\r\nso many similar, strange and unexplainable events. i don't know what to think anymore. i really think mufon should reasearch this area of california. i really do. sightings and experiences are increasing as the year ends, i can't wait to see what is in store for our nation in 2007.\r\ni have never experienced a ufo or unexplainable event until 2010, and it is no shock that i found out it is the year for ufo's in california.\r\nwe are infested.","distance":"20 Feet or

like the back was a square, but it was really hard to tell. there were also 2 jets flying over the craft, turning around and coming back. i tried to film it with my camera phone but i'm unable to make

overland park from a christmas visit with my parents in wichita.  we were taking i-35, traveling northeast, and the sighting occurred near gardener, ks.  the drive had gone smoothly so far; it was a cold, clear night, and we were relaxed and chatting intermittently.  i was staring out the front windshield when my husband pointed to the passenger side window and said, \"there's a ufo.\"  because his tone was so casual, i looked out expecting to see a billboard or something else mundane. \r\n\r\ni saw three bright points of blue-white light, moving in a triangle formation.  the lights were flashing on and off rhythmically.  the flashes were fast, but not strobe-light fast.  the lights flashed perhaps 1-2 times per second.  the flashes were very regular, like a clock ticking.  i could not make out what the lights were attached to, so they could have been from one object or three objects moving in tight formation.  my husband said something like, \"it can't be a plane because it's just hanging there.\"  however, as i watched the object, it appeared to be moving away from us and also weaving from side to side.  it seemed to be hovering like a helicopter rather than flying like a plane. \r\n\r\nour car was out of alignment and fairly noisy to drive, so i could not hear whether any sound came from the object.   \r\n\r\nbecause the object was traveling the opposite direction we were driving, i did not get to watch it very long.  our car's rear windows were fogged up, so i was unable to watch the object once it was no longer in view from the front passenger side window.  \r\n\r\nafter the sighting, i regretted not having a camera handy and not being able to watch the object for a longer period of time.

i was standing overlooking a valley and could see lights way off in distance.  warm night and then, just like movies i guess, i look directly up to see a nose, then wings, etc of a super large.. i mean a miles wide, delta type craft, fly over very low and silent and headed west out over those lights.  the detail i recall now is pretty weird.  i won't bother with that as it was a dream and my mind has been on ufo's since that october event.... but, it felt like i was looking over the sacramento river valley toward the west.\r\n\r\nthat's it.  only a few times in my life have i had such a vivid type dream...And each of those turned out to be prophetic about significant specific events in my life.  this didn't feel so personal, but had all the other \"feel\" of those few weird dreams of my distant past.  if i were to gamble i would bet i will (and based on that dream, many will) see some giant delta craft in our lives.  it did not alarm me at all, although it was rather aweinspiring,  i was clearly not a \"player\" in this dream, just a small observer.  i thought it odd i did not dream about the type of craft i so recently witnessed.\r\n\r\notherwise, i shall spend more time looking up and listening to those who witness the unexplainable!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":27130,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4001669,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12272010-0004","longitude":-110.871903,"occurred":1286485860000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1293479584000,"summary":"Highly reflective sphere at about 5000 ft altitude daytime","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":80,"locationName":"Miami, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:79280"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1923}
