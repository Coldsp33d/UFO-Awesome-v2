and i was traveling on 26, 31, or 33 from idaho falls to jackson wyoming, i can't remember which now and i was just working there not real familiar to the area, in fact i was kind of lost, i barely made it to work in jackson that morning, and i was in a state of shock and a bit worried when i arrived that someone would come after me... on my way to idaho   i saw lights as i came up the road, from far off it looked like a giant ferris wheel on its side, leaning, i thought to myself that was so odd, in the middle of nowhere, in the woods; this? but as i got closer i realized it was surrounded by vehicles, big military vehicles, white vehicles, men in haz-mat looking suits, men with guns..\r\nit was down in a sort of small valley and the road i was on as i reached it began climb up around a mountain (headed toward jackson) so i had a birds eye view by this time. i slowed down, almost to a stop as i seen the ferris wheel i had seen in the distance was in fact not a ferris wheel, it was a huge space ship! it was crashed i almost wrecked staring at it i couldn't hear or see anything i was just in shock.\r\nit had to have been at least 80-100 feet across, it was shaped more or less just like you see on tv, a disk shaped thing with a portal/door at the base, it had windows all around the middle of the ship, and toward the base it had colored lights, i know there was red, blue and orange or yellow..\r\nby this time i started coming back to my senses and realized i was in danger; men began running to their vehicles and waving their arms and yelling, drawing their firearms, heading up the mountainside toward me, needless to say i took off pedal to the medal no exaggeration, it would take them a minute or so to get back on the road as where they were there was only a crude rough road winding down to where the spacecraft was, so i immediately had an advantage, i barreled up the road reaching 90 + miles per hour in my jeep grand cherokee 4x4 on a winding, incline with cliff on one side and a wall of mountain on the other, suddenly animals were running across the road and up the mountain away from the site, i kid not; there were raccoons, deer, and all sorts of creatures just migrating away from there! i was slowing then speeding weaving in and out of these creatures, i hit the mountainside more than once and careened almost off the cliff several times, i'm telling you it was the most blood pumping thing that ever happened to me and i have been in some situations..\r\nall kinds of things raced through my mind as i sped away from there looking in rear view mirror.\r\nthankfully i got away, i started taking random small roads as soon as i seen them to lose a trail, and eventually  through meandering all the rest of the morning i arrived in jackson just before 8 as my shift started. i thought about what happened and my friends all told me i looked like something was wrong, i said i was just not feeling well, but what was bothering me was what exactly was going on back there?? would it be in the news? of course not.. were those men after me? and also a feeling of wonder, and excitement that i had witnessed something i called others crazy for believing in.. it was really true; there is something out there..\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":27129,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.4960514,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12272010-0003","longitude":-112.0329545,"occurred":995180400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1293466817000,"summary":"What

moved to additional evidence section--cms/sg).\r\n\r\nstepped out of back door to retrieve firewood from wood bin.  glanced into eastern sky and saw bright orange sphere approaching.  initial thought was a meteor or missile shot from wallops island.  quickly realized object had no tail as it continued to move sw towards house.  initial estimate was object was between 5000-6000' high, traveling about 200-250mph.  knowing it was unusual i turned and opened door and told my wife to come look at the object.  object had continued sw but then appeared to maneuver lower in sky with a series of turns to the south and the back to the west.  due to moisture in air object appeared to have a \"halo\" around it with a slight cone of light towards leading edge.  \r\n\r\nmy wife joked \"it must be santa claus\".   there were no aviation navigation lights, landing lights, anti-collision lights observed and object maintained bright orange color. at this point, maybe 45 seconds into sightings i determined that this may be a ufo.  as object reached a spot about 70-80 degrees in elevation while looking se from my back patio, it accelerated and climbed at an extremely fast speed heading sw until it disappeared from sight approximately 30 degrees above horizon. object was not in any standard traffic patterns for nas norfolk, norfolk international, or washington center from my experience.  could not determine if loss of sight on object was due to cloud cover or due to height.  entire episode lasted no more than two minutes and there was no propeller or rotor noise, engine noise, etc., associated with object.  i contacted 911 who had no information about any reported sightings or unusual activity and offered to transfer me to the nas duty officer.  i declined the phone transfer.\r\n\r\nmy wife's comments during event indicated she thought it looked like a star due to the \"rays\" that appeared to emanate from object.  i thought this may be due to moisture, clouds, atmospherics, etc.  she also said \"how come it isn't making any noise?\"\r\n\r\n15 minutes later i heard propeller aircraft turning and launching from nas norfolk, a distance of 3.02 miles north of my home.   i saw and heard both civilian and military aircraft in the traffic patterns at navy norfolk and norfolk international airport (4.25 miles east of residence) with standard navigation lights,

2010\r\n\r\n1:45 am\r\n\r\nhi,\r\n\r\ni would like to report a ufo sighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis took place in hudson quebec, canada, dec 25, 2010, christmas evening, at approx. 9:15 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy wife and i, and my two children aged 26 and 22, were visiting my nephew there and we were at a gathering of family to celebrate christmas... dinner.\r\n\r\nmy daughter had a few pieces of fireworks left over from the summer and we decided to walk over, a block, to a clearing beside a nearby school. \r\n\r\nthere was about a foot of hard snow on the ground and the temperature late that afternoon was between 10 and 15 degrees celsius below zero.  there was no wind.\r\n\r\nthere were 12 of us in all, including three young children.  all the others were adults of ages 22 through 60.\r\n\r\nmy nephew and a friend of his were present.  both are experienced commercial pilots.\r\n\r\ni myself am a retired mechanical engineer, aged 60.  there were several other professionals among us.\r\n\r\ni set up a few firework sticks in the ground and proceeded to fire them off.  there were a total of about 8 items, five of which shot simple 'light balls' high up.  \r\n\r\nthe sky was slightly hazy in areas, and stars could be seen easily through most of this haziness.\r\n\r\ni was in charge of the fireworks; the others were about 100 feet away for safety.  there was one fairly bright street light just off to one side and behind us.\r\n\r\nat the end of the final launch, the whole of which took about 10 minutes, one of our girls called out something to the likes of... ��� oh, what are those���.  we all looked up to the back-side sky, partly obscured by the streetlight.  it helped to block the streetlight with, say, one���s hand, in order to see the objects better, at least from my own point of view.\r\n\r\nthere, we all witnessed what i can only describe as glowing colors, changing from copper-red, to golden hues, orbs.\r\n\r\ntheir size was roughly 10 times the diameter of jupiter (as it has been lately), though not as bright.  they were not spectacularly bright, nor were they dull; (like amber highway lights about 15 poles distant).  if there had been any clear shape patterns/or distortions they would have been noticed.  the shapes did not change much, basically oval/spherical.\r\n\r\nwe estimated (the pilots jumped in to help) the distances to be roughly 1 to 2 kilometers away at elevations of about 2000-3000 feet or so, angled about 40 degrees with the horizon.\r\n\r\na couple of us had seen what was most likely a plane passing far overhead and above them, at perhaps 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\nhowever, we focused on the  two orbs.  they were very clearly visible and well below any cloud mist.\r\n\r\ni quickly asked if anyone had brought with them a camera.  no one answered to the affirmative, even though we had many cameras back at the house, a block away.  nonetheless, my niece had indeed brought her old cell-phone camera and had tried to snap a picture; she and her companion reported that the picture did not register, either believing that there was not enough light or that she was not able to get the objects into focus within the short time they presented themselves to us.\r\n\r\nthe orbs were present for only about 3 minutes, from the time we first discovered them... they may have been there longer, but not observed.\r\n\r\nthe orbs were moving in a roughly north-easterly direction, and slowly.  they made no sound that anyone could hear.\r\n\r\nwe were looking at them and they were traveling in our direction, at first.  \r\n\r\nit was shortly after the fireworks show that we first noticed them.  within the subsequent 1st minute, the orb at the left appeared to come to a stop, and did not change its brightness, except for the color changes (about one full cycle per 3 seconds).  the second varied at what appeared to be the same rate.  the variation transitioned smoothly/continuously, not in an abrupt off-on manner. \r\n\r\nthe orb on the right was at first about the width of 2-3 fingers apart (held at arms length) from the orb on the left.  it appeared to brighten until it roughly matched that of the left orb.  it then started to move forward as the other remained put, after first hesitating.  it made a bending pattern movement and came around much closer to the left orb.  i thought at one instant that it was going to connect up with the other, but it came instead to within a distance of about one finger width away (at arms length).\r\n\r\nat that point it stayed put and the left orb slowly moved in a new direction to the south-east.  shortly afterword, the second orb slowly started to move in the same direction, following.  both went on their way into the distance and faded out of sight within the 3rd-4th minutes.\r\n\r\nit really appeared to all of us that these objects had been observing us and only changed direction after having noticed that our show was over, or that they had been discovered.\r\n\r\nin discussing with the pilots, they decided to call in to their professional connections to see if any planes were in the area at this level, that might explain the observations.  two calls were made, with no confirmations of any such low flights.\r\n\r\nwe conjectured:  \r\n\r\nnone of the lights were typical of any known plane standards, that the pilots could think of.  there were no sounds at all, if one were to consider helicopters in the area, as a cause.  this amazing coincidence of two objects seemingly communicating with each other, on christmas evening, at this hour, was very unusual.  in particular, the coincidence of our lighting fireworks (or anyone doing so on this day), and the timing of the orbs seems inexplicable.  their change in direction within a minute of our observing them is equally uncanny; they seemed to be watching us.\r\n\r\nthe transitioning lights were not beams of light shining down onto the earth nor into the sky��� no traces in the slightly misty air.  the 'entire' objects were clearly illuminated as opposed to lights on the objects��� this is unusual.\r\n\r\nand finally the most unusual coincidence of all.  i had been, early in the same day, looking back at digital pictures i'd taken two years ago in northern newfoundland, of what i was curiously suspecting might be a ufo.  i'd taken 3 high resolution pictures of this but had never gone back to study them.  i showed these to my daughters this same day, and we guessed, in the end, that the object in this case, was more likely an unusual weather balloon ������dirigible that had a shape ���resembling a dragon���.  next, just before i showed up to light the fireworks, (the others arrived at the clearing 5 minutes before me), my daughter was explaining to one of the pilots there about the story of those other pictures.  they were joking about it all��� and then, this new  experience occurred. also, one of the fireworks pieces was called 'alien invasion' and my wife was calling out to bring on the aliens, in gesture only. very weird indeed.\r\n\r\nall this was a very real experience that can be confirmed by all present.  the three children were unfortunately quite upset and frightened by the sighting.  it took us a few hours to calm them afterwards and convince them of an alternate acceptable explanation for all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely \r\n\r\n*(wit's name and identifying information deleted -- cms/sg).\r\n","distance":"Over One

that they were helicopters flying in formation.\r\n\r\ni walked outside to get a better look and was struck by the fact that there was no noise for how low they seemed to be flying. also the lights were not blinking as aircraft lights do. as i watched the lights at the head of the formation seemed to disappear as they flew south. we had low cloud cover tonight so the objects had to be flying low

capture much. \r\n\r\nthere were about 7 lights in the group flying in a loose formation and i could see two or three of them maneuvering around each other. the main group moved south of my location and disappeared. there was one straggler that was red in color that moved along behind the main group. it eventually moved past and disappeared as well.\r\n\r\ni couldn't tell if i lost sight of the objects because they rose through the cloud cover of if their lights were directional and they were shining away from me after they moved by.\r\n\r\nmy parents were driving north of town and they saw

east in the direction of denver.\r\nit dimmed down and changed to a reddish color.  when it looked as though it was over lookout mountain it disappeared, just as it would be going over the denver

i decided to see if i could see them from out my front yard. surprisly so, i saw over 20 neighbors in my front yard.. for a quick moment i thought, \"man i should've  charged a fee,\" laughing to myself.  so i went to mingle with my neighbors.... were watching the show, and i nudged my one neighbor and said, \" wouldn't it be cool to see what tonight would look like from an astronaut's point of view?\" he said, \"yeah it would be kinda cool.\" right after i said that i immediately looked straight up, and wouldn't you know, i saw this light making a wavy circle, kinda what a current of electricity would look like, but it was connected. i quickly said to everybody, \"look straight up!!!, quick!!\" apparently a few did because i was heard a few awes..., seconds later, the circle stopped and i noticed it was two lights making this circle... one stopped immediately and the other went in one motion northeast, by this time a woman said, \" is that a satellite?!\", giggling to myself i said, \" no, satellites don't go that fast honey.....,\"  i looked to see if the other one was still there, but sadly it disappeared, i had no idea which way it went, for the simple fact my eyes were tracking the other fast moving light.  it took about 8 sec. or so for the first light to get out of our line of sight... and...By this point the fireworks were secondary entertainment...

meridian rd. and i was sitting in the passengers seat. we were on our way to the tallahassee mall to see a movie. which me did not see. me and my friend were... sceptical believers till we saw this. while looking out the window to my right i saw a triangle in the sky. at first, i assumed it was a cell tower or something then, after thinking for a second, realized that there are no cell towers anywhere near the area. i should know. i've lived in the area for near 25 years now. not to mention, it was very visible. it seemed to be hovering above what would be the southern end of thomasville rd, near the miracle 5 theater. we almost stopped (slowed to a crawl) after i pointed it out to my friend and watched it for near a minute. it made no noise and did not move. it simply hovered. there were bright, blueish lights at each of the three corners. i could clearly see the outline of the triangle and even some detail. and there was very little detail to be seen. that is to say, it was very smooth and seemed to have a mirror finish. and after nearly a minute of watching, it made a full 180 degree turn, in place, and literally streaked out of view. meaning it moved fast enough to leave streaks of blue light behind it nearly a mile long. this is what i saw, described to the best of my ability. i would like to know what i saw, and if anybody else saw the same thing, which i know is a long shot, as there is almost no chance anybody from tallahassee will read this, let alone somebody who saw the same... craft i did. as far as feelings after seeing the craft, i had very few. the overwhelming feeling was of certainty. certainty that i had seen something i had never seen before and something that, as far as i know, humans are not capable of doing. and i must admit, i felt excitement at having an experience of my own. i knew they must be out there. the only question i had was whether or not they were visiting our planet. i no longer ask that question. at least one did, in fact, visit us. and i can only be sure of that because i saw it. i was not high. i was not tripping. i was not hallucinating. i am very sane. and that's all i can say. now, i just need to know. there is very little i wouldn't do to know.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then

but they looked like they were all following each other across the sky.  i took almost 15 minutes of video of this event standing outside on the patio of my house!  this is the most amazing thing i have ever seen! i cannot explain what this was.  they were not planes, and there were no other aircraft in the area that might have been dropping flares.  these things were completely silent, and they just kept coming.  you will see from the video that i took,(this time with my digital camera)them coming from the tree line on the right, and slowly moving across the sky to the left, before just fading out.  i have shown a plane flying in the sky to compare against and also the moon for reference to rule them out as being planes or celestial objects.  these things were moving across the sky

windows and high ceilings, so when you are sitting down on the couch and looking up at the tv which hangs on the wall, you can also see out into the sky.  the sky above my house has airplanes that pass over all the time.  you automatically know that they are planes because they typically have lights that are white in color, and they emit the normal flashing lights pattern as they fly across the sky.  it is a normal and regular occurance to see them through the windows when i am in there watching tv, but this particular event caught my eye.  as i was watching tv tonight, i glanced up at one of the windows because something different caught my eye...  i saw 3 very bright orange lights in a triangle formation slowly moving across the sky almost floating above and toward the house.  i ran and picked up my cell phone, the only camera i had, and went outside and shot about 1 min of footage of the event.  i am an avid ufo hunters follower, and have seen this exact type of formation featured in one of their episodes.  it looked almost exactly like the \"phoenix lights\" but maybe not as big, and there were only 3 lights that looked like they were in a triangle shape, not the multiple ones you saw in the phoenix footage.  there were however two more lights that were in front and behind the triangle shape.. i will discuss this more below...  i could not believe i was actually seeing this with my own eyes.  i could not even tell that the camera phone even was picking up the lights in the sky.  it was not until later when i looked at the video afterwards that i could tell i did get something. the lights that i saw were a very bright orange, much more intense than the airplane lights that cross the sky, and definitely a different color.  they were not flashing like the airplane lights do.  you can't see the airplanes that were also in the sky flying in the video, but there were at least two to three airplanes in the area but were at a much higher altitude.  the airplane lights were much dimmer than the orange lights that show up on my video camera footage, and i guess that is why you can't see them in the video... the 3 orange lights i saw were in formation, and not moving in distance from one another, but seemed to be moving as a whole.  they were in a triangle formation, but i could not make out anything in-between the lights like it was some sort of a craft or something.  it was just dark.  the size was enormous, at least 2-3 football fields or more... it is hard to tell size, but it was huge.  much much bigger than the house.  probably easily as big as the entire high school that is directly across the street.  it was moving slowly in the direction of the house and was literally almost right above the patio area where i was filming, although high up in the sky.  there were also two more orange lights, same color and intensity.  one was in front of the triangle, and one behind, as if one was leading the triangle shape, and one was following? or they could have even been possibly connected. it is hard to say.  i could not make out any type of object in-between the lights, just the actual formation itself. it got so close that i ran inside the house to shut off the light, and when i came back out, it was gone.  i looked all around the sky outside the house, and could not see it anywhere.  if it was an object, it either disappeared completely, or turned off the lights or left at an immense rate of speed, because i was only in the house for about 10-20 seconds before i came back outside again to continue filming.  it just disappeared.  i never thought i would actually see something like this.  i only get to see it on tv...  i was completely dazed, and almost shocked when i looked up and saw this thing in the sky that i have seen on tv before... i remember them saying \"get video!\" so i grabbed my cellphone and ran outside, and i still can't believe i actually have witnessed what many others have. i felt i should share this information since it maybe can help us all finally figure out one day what is up there... i have attached two videos.  the first is the actual footage that i was able to get of the triangle shape, and the next is a short video of exactly what i was doing and how i shot the video about 10 minutes after the event had happened...  thank you.
