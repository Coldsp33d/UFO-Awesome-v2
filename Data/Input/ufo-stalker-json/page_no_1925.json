noticed a shooting star, pointed it out to \"chuck\", when simultaneously we noticed three brighter than normal stars in the northern sky. upon further inspection, we noticed the stars were moving in a southwestern direction and the distance between them never changed. the three \"stars\" began to get brighter and brighter until they were roughly the size of a small basketball or a large football. at this point, we realized the \"stars\" were attached to a triangle, boomerang shaped object. the only reason we could tell the shape of the object was because as it moved, it was blocking the stars behind it. there were no clouds in the sky this evening, and it was very quiet and still outside. the object flew directly overhead with no sound. \"chuck\" noticed the hairs on the back of his neck were standing upright and my hair and scalp had a strange tingling sensation. a short distance from our event there is a small airport, now, we are used to seeing small airplanes take off and land, so we are well aware of the size, appearance and light patterns of these aircraft. in almost a split second, the three \"stars\" became very intense, we heard an almost mechanical, electrical kind of humming and the object instantly shot off in the direction of nashville. a short time after, we could see and hear helicopters heading directly behind the path the object had been taking. at this point, we realized what we had saw as being the mythical tr3b. from our vantage point, we feel the object was at least two to two and a half football fields in width. we have reported this to no one and have not contacted any agencies in regards to this for fear of retribution or retaliation, or even ridicule. all these events took five minutes in total to unfold. we plan on making nightly trips over the holiday break to try and witness these events again.

the lights did not look like anything i have ever seen before. i leapt out of my chair, which i do a lot because i like to see what is flying over my house, and went outside. i noticed that there was no noise coming from the lights, which i think i should have heard judging by the distance i think the lights were at. i also realized how quickly the lights seemed to be traveling. in a span of approximately 20 seconds the lights traveled from the northern end of north las vegas to approximately i-15 and sahara ave. \r\n\r\nthe lights then traveled to the west and became blocked by the house

near boutte, louisiana on highway 90. i can assure you that this encounter was not something from earth! i investigated this very carefully and the investigation included all police departments in and around the area of occurrence. i even spoke with a st. charles parish police officer that was on patrol the night of the event. the officer i spoke with patrolled the area where the event occurred at the exact time the event occurred. he stated he did not see anything and there was no animal reported being hit anywhere around the area i witnessed the event. i believe he is being honest about his testimony. in fact as i was witnessing this event cars were passing by fast as if they did not see anything on the road. i was able to capture 2 pictures that night. if i would have known the significance of this event i would have taken more digital images and also i would have tried to make contact with the people involved at the scene of the accident. \r\n\r\nas reported earlier i know exactly what road i was on and the exact area within a mile of where the event occurred. this road was the only one available going to and from my destination from houma to kenner, louisiana. \r\n\r\ni am adding the link to my original report below if you want to read all of the details. some people that do not have knowledge of animals will look at it and say it is a cow, etc. but it is actually made up of many different types of animals combined! i have had zoologists and cryptozoologists look at it and they cannot determine exactly what type of animal it is. when i witnessed it in person it looked very much like a golden animal (camel). i also witnessed 2 people at the scene of the accident. i thought they would show up in the picture of the car but they did not. maybe they were to far behind the car to show up? the car appears very ghostly as if the back of it fades and there is a image of an alien on the side of the car. the animal appears swollen for some reason and there is a circular pattern on the road next to it. this leads me to believe that something landed on the road by the animal. i have looked this images over many times and i have found unusual things about them. of course the most bizarre is the evil face that appears on the head of the animal when you zoom in on it! see my other post for that picture. \r\n\r\nthe place that this event took place is about 15 minutes from my house and sometimes i drive back to this area and usually something strange occurs when i do. i am going to drive back out there tonight and i hope i see something that can help to explain what i witnessed back in 2007. all of the evidence from the accident including the car, animal, blood, glass, etc was gone hours later when i drove back to the scene of occurrence! whatever this event was it was not from earth! there are also unusual images that are embeded into the two pictures i captured that night. some appear to be human faces and possibly words. the words are very difficult to make out. a small object that is white with a red tip appears on the road by the animal. i am not sure what it is? the image of the alien on the side of the car appears to be holding something that looks like a phone. \r\n\r\nmy reason for this post is to include two more images. these images are of the ufo's that appear in the sky above this occurrence. you can see different colors around the ufo's that would represent great energy and power coming form the objects! \r\n\r\ni know that the images i captured are something that is very unusual and not of things that normally occur here on earth! i saved the images on the original memory card to preserve the evidence. these images have not been edited or manipulated. the only thing done was the images were they were lightened so you can see them better. these pictures are of something very unusual and i wish that everyone knew the truth about them. i am in hopes that one day someone with photography and paranormal (ufo)investigative knowledge can help me to solve this mystery. *(wit's first name (charles) deleted --

thats when i noticed the object,bright white not moving ,about5-6 thousand feet elevation watched for a few minutes ,thought it might be a ballon,so i opened the camper and grapped a high powered

half.Using the scope i focused in on it ,it seemed to have a red light incircling it, rotating around its circumference. the weather is really good today ,no snow,moving clouds mostly sunny. i  almost got bored watching it ,called a couple friends ,didnt get an answer,,about 9.30am  ,,took another look before i left to go back home to salida ,,thats when i think i saw i guess was a mothership

be somewhat transparent.It dissappeared into a cloud ,never came out the other side,i didnt have my camera,,was late for work,, had to go,,by the way .South of here is the san luis valley,,east is

x-mas lights when i first noticed 2 glowing orange spheres in the north sky. they were moving slowly from west to east. then suddenly, 2 more spheres appeared behind the first 2, traveling in the same

shaped object moving to the east, but much closer to me and going in a slightly southern direction. i yelled for my son to come out and as he did he was able to see it also before it was obscured by a large tree just down the street. it was a full moon, so i was able to see this thing clearly. it had a sort of quicksilver look to it and i was able to make out a row of square shaped windows that were illuminated. looked to be 4 or 5 windows and i could see the pillars between them. there were no blinking lights or colored lights at all. just white light coming from the windows and the moon light reflecting off the outside of it. there were no wings, and it made no sound. i did not see any type of vapor trail or any obvious method of propulsion. i was just there, moving across the sky at a rapid rate, until we lost sight of it. i estimate the entire event was no more than 3 mins from first seeing the orange spheres until the end when the silver craft went behind the tree.\r\n   i did notice another neighbor in thier yard right after this and i went down to ask them if they had seen this thing. they said no, they had been working on x-mas lights and had not noticed anything unusual.\r\n   i was pretty freaked out by it, and did not sleep much last night. i got up several times to look out the window to see what was out there. nothing else happened. i got up this morning

at a sand dune called the cross because there is a permanent structure of a cross on top of the sand dune.\r\nwe were standing next to the water on the gulf of mexico facing the water\r\nwhen one of my buddies noticed the object and he stated \"dudes check it out a ufo\" so we turned towards it. there was no wind that night and the gulf was as quite as a lake. the object was traveling paralell to the road\r\nmaybe 100 to 150 feet above the road. the objecct appeared to be a sphere\r\nof solid white light. so we started jumping up and down waving and shouting at it and low and behold the object chaged directions and came directly towards us and and in no time the object was almost on top of us. the object made no sound whatsoever and at the last second my friend that spotted the craft shouted run so we took off running for the direction of the sand dunes towards the road. never run so fast in my life and somehow escaped the object. we gatherd back together in the sand dunes and then my friend who originally spotted it saw it again as it resumed its paralell course on the road heading eastward. there is a large water tank it came close to and would guess the object to be about the size of the tank part of it. and it i had to guess would say the diameter of it was about 35 to 40 feet. then the object did somthing strange as we watched it go past the water tank. that part of the beach was lighted up pretty well with business in that area. the object went almost pitch black and all we could make out was a sphere silloett of the object. so i guess they have the ability to turn off the lights on the craft so as not to be seen at night time. then the object disappeared in the distance and was gone. ok credibility the friend that spotted it had like a four point zero grade average at a local college. me and my friend both went through radar school in the navy about the same time. the other friend was going through a trade school. interesting note the friend going through the trade school said he claimed to see a similar object go into the gulf waters. this paticular friend is almost leagally blind but claims he can see better at night than in the daytime. prefer to remain anonymous on this because of the real men in black are out there and no one wants a visit from them as documented in one of times lifes books i think is where i read about them. just one last humorous note to the sighting we hadn't even opened the bottle of wine we had with us that night which we gulped down afterwards. lucky we all didn't end up on jupiter that night. well that was our sighting event. this thing was practically directly over our heads when we took off running. sarry stuff! don;t remember any missing time. weather balloons cant change course as this object did as it made a beeline toward us. well thats about it on the sighting. i am a firm believer in the bible and it states somewhere in revelations before the end of time there will be strange lights in the sky. i believe it.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

sick, on his last day on earth. i came home from work to let him out at lunch time. carried him outside, and being tired i propped myself against the basement stair railing. watched the dog and then looked up in the sky and saw this huge (very large) craft in the sky, lower sky. i put my head down to check the dog and then it occured to me what i saw. un-believable it was it was so large, sparkled so much around the middle that i never have seen that sparkle since even though i look for it, yes still do. the craft was low. then all of a sudden i saw it start to disappear from my left to right, just like someone put a veil to cover it, it disappeared just like that. i never heard any noise, nothing. i picked up my dog, thought to myself what i saw and living in a small town here in pa. decided not to say anything. however, in about a half hour i did telephone the local radio station and without giving my name asked them if anyone called about a strange craft in the sky. no was the answer and i hung up, then telephoned the lancaster airport (small) and was told a man did telephone about a strange craft, i hung up before giving my name. told my husband and a few people.\r\n\r\nthen we lived in arizona for a about eight years. one night about ten-ish\r\nbefore going to bed i decided to have a smoke on the deck. i sat down and looked out to the sky (not high in the sky) and saw these lights. even though we lived near luke airforce base i never heard a noise. i watched these lights and again never thinking of a ufo, i watched them. if it was a ufo it was large, almost as large as the one i saw in akron. next morning in the newspaper there was an article on the lights. \r\n\r\nyes, i believe there are ufo's, if not our government is lying to us on

had (5) 1 inch cuts leading out of my navel and (1) 2 inch cut to the left of my navel.  i wasn't alarmed, in fact, felt very calm.  i showed the cuts to my husband.  i have a scar from the cut next to my navel.  many strange things have happened since.  i am irritated with myself for doing the meditation but i felt very compelled to do it at the time.  i opened the door to communication and now i want it to stop.  i contacted paranormal matrix for help regarding this situation but they have never responded.  i emailed mufon abductions last week and i have had no response from them either.  i did have a close ufo sighting in 2008.  i reported it in 2009 after someone else saw the same thing a yr after i saw it.  they had photographed it and my photos did not come out with anything.  i am

saw this huge black man bird thing gliding without a noise coming from the east maybe the distance would be like three streets over but about maybe five blocks down.[which three steets over there isnt five blocks because the woods are two blocks down. when i saw this i was stunned and stared at it trying to figure out what it was and then i saw it wasnt anything ive ever seen. i ran into the house and yelled at my husband and my grown son to get out here quick. they came but seemed like forever and they looked and saw it too. when they saw it they thing was like the a few streets over and then disappeared behind the big trees.  when we saw it we all said that no one would believe us; but i have recently been talking about it because it has bothered me so much. i lived in this neighborhood all my life and i can remember of three ufo sightings since i was five and all the sightings were in this neighborhood or around stinson field airport. i never came forward about them because people think ya lost your ever loving mind until recently when others ive spoke with shared their experiences. i have other stories but this one is the most recent and i was wondering if anyone has ever seen this thing. it is silent like it was a glider but i could see the body was exactly like a man a very large man. thank you for listening to me and i hope you dont think we have gone mad too. i called my daughter and told her afterwards and thats what made my mind up to stay silent.  i had my darn cell on my the whole time and not once thought of taking a picture it happened so fast and im not that
