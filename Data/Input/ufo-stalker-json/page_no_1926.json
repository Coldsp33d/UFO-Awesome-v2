head trying to figure out what in the hell that could of been! all i know is no known man-made aircraft can move that slowly and with no sound across the sky. very very bizarre and i wish there was an

university campus with a friend and glanced up for no reason--it was cloudy out. i saw this orb-shaped object moving at a good 20-30mph across the sky.  it appeared to have one light on the front (similar to an eyeball). the white was a white or beige color, but the craft itself glowed dimly a pinkish orange color.  it moved in a very direct, straight path below the clouds, but higher than the treetops.  i would estimate it to be about the size of a regular suv.  i would never consider myself a ufo person, not even with an \"open mind\".  but this ufo startled me and my friend and i followed it, running, for a couple yards trying to figure out whether or not it was a ufo.  there was no way it could be a balloon--because of the front beam/light it had.  it finally went out of sight over trees and into the far distance.  we were able to watch it for about 2-3 minutes.  it never occurred to me to report it until i was trying to tell my mother, who asked me to look it up, but no other sightings were reported, unfortunately.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

12/15/2010 wed night. \r\ntime: 22:00 pst. \r\nlocation: outer sunset district of san francisco, ca. \r\n\r\nmy ir camera was pointing 17 degrees east (magnetic north for san francisco) and it was pointing up from the horizon about 60 degrees. this black triangle was not as close as my nov 2008 sighting that flew over my house. this ufo was father away (maybe 3000 feet high or so), but my 3 times power ir night video camera was able to bring it in closer. this triangle had two round shape bright white lights constantly on. these lights were located at the ufos far end section, but the strangest thing was that it seemed to be flying on its side or sideways. i did not see any other lights turned on nor blinking, if it made a noise, i could not hear it radiating. it seemed quiet to me. i was able to record a few seconds of it as it past the cameras lens. i was not able to follow the ufo with the camera, because other houses blocked my view of it. i will try to capture more ufos

the evening. the barn cats started acting weird, making sounds i have not heard from them before and puffing up. i went out of the barn to investigate if there was an animal causing their distress but i saw nothing.\r\ni fed the horse then started walking back to the house. the night was foggy and the sky was partially cloudy.\r\ni saw 3 orbs of white light in the sky in front of the barn. they were flying in individual circles where they would meet in the middle and fly out again. at first i thought it was search lights but they were moving too differently from the searchlight pattern, they were moving in different areas of the sky.\r\nthe circling orbs of light moved from the sky over the barn up towards the house.\r\nit reminded me of vultures circling.\r\ni watched them for approximately 10 minutes. then it went to 2 orbs of light then they vanished.\r\nthey were visible in the cloud cover better than the night sky.\r\ni got my husband and he grabbed the camera. we were not able to get a photo but we got a short video on the camera.\r\nwhen i was watching the orbs, i wondered if they were angels. i did not think i would feel so apprehensive watching angels because i

looked like  stars in the sky by the moon. i have never seen anything this close this birght, as the objects formed a triangle pattern and a sort of orion's belt i counted 16 objects.Planes flew in between the objects so it looked,( i later realized the objects where very far away even though they looked close) the objects started moving in formation  to the north and then disappeared. this

had my camera , taking pictures all day long it was working fine, when i pointed it at the object it just would not work for some reason, as well as i could not see it on my viewing screen ,like it

picture fine.\r\nwhen i got home to download the pictures to my hard drive and as it was transferring it suddenly unmounted it self and gave me an error message saying it was not there anymore. after

college. it was close to 10 o'clock and very dark out and cold. the street lights were not really working and somewhat dim every block or two there would be light. and when i decided to look up at a tree which i often do to stare at the sky or tree's. i ended up seeing some big round object above a house. it was probably 20 feet or so above the house. i am horrible with estimation of how up high it was. but it was double the size of a 3 story house maybe triple. it was hovering above the house for a while with some noise that you couldn't really hear. at first i thought it was an airplane since there was three glowing lights under it that formed a triangle. but then why would it hover above a house and then after thinking about it. i started to walk faster to avoid it since i was a little scared yet i was fascinated since i do believe in aliens and visitors from another planet. it moved a little to the right and circled the area a little probably one full circle around 4 or 5 houses away and then it came back to the same house then went right towards east side shaw's direction as it ascends higher into the air before disappearing from my sight. i could only see a pitch black object in the sky with the three lights under it. i have thought about posting it earlier but when i arrived home i told a friend and family member about it and they told me that it was probably just an helicopter or airplane. i just let it go even though i do think about it occasionally until someone told me about mufon. there is not enough proof what i saw was a ufo or an helicopter or airplane. but what i do know is that a helicopter would make more noise and an airplane would not stop in a random spot for so long since they have a destination to arrive at. therefore what i saw was something that is unexplainable and remain in my memories.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
