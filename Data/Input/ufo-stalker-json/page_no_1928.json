(i never heard anything, even when it was right overhead).\r\n\r\nthe light was bright green and irregularly shaped -- somewhat oval -- but more like if you had two ovals on top of one another and then offset them so that they started to make a v shape, but not quite.  the edges of the light were crisp, and it did not appear to be anything but light (there was no visible aircraft emitting the light).   the entire event only lasted 3-4 seconds, but it was impossible to miss and i would swear in court that i am 100% certain what i saw (i have a government clearance and am trained in emergency planning, and have learned to be observant.)  \r\n\r\nit is difficult to estimate how high the object was (and therefore the size), but it was below the clouds that were in the sky at the time (which seemed fairly low), because as it passed by the clouds above, it was still visible beneath them.  \r\n\r\ni know it was not a plane because plane lights are yellow or white and this was bright green, plus it was not shaped like a plane, was moving faster than any plane i've seen, and did not make any noise (you can always hear when a plane is flying overhead, especially if it was as low as this light seemed to be).  it was not a meteor (i've seen many), and not a searchlight (for it to have been a searchlight, the searchlight would have had to have been positioned in the woods behind my house, and there is nothing there but 200 acres of woods; also, i would have seen the beam of light coming up from the searchlight, and there was no beam of light, just the light flying

looked in its direction it was dimming out. i knew it was not an airplane as there are always planes flying over at much greater altitude than this light was at. it was stationary. \r\n\r\ni continued staring in the sky and then two red orange lights/orbs lite up. they were stationary, in the same place the first light came on. the two lights stay on for a few seconds and then dim out one at a time. \r\n\r\ni knew then this was not anything i could explain. i am still driving but now going very slow never taking my eyes off the sky. a few seconds later 6 - 8 red orange lights come on. \r\n\r\nthe lights are in a row, still in the same place, not moving. the lights are all on for a few seconds and then one at a time they go out.\r\n\r\n i seen lights and noting else. i could not see what they were attached to. after all the lights went out that was it. they sky looked just like nothing was there, like the ufo was invisible. there was no sound, nothing dark blocking my view of the stars, nothing.\r\n\r\n i was shocked when i seen the lights because i knew what i was seeing was a ufo, but i could not believe i was really seeing it at the same time. \r\n\r\nas i drove closer to my home at a very slow speed, and still looking at the sky i realized that the area of the sky i seen the ufo at was almost directly over my house. \r\n\r\ni whipped in my driveway, stopped immediately, got out and stared at the sky, but there was nothing there just the stars. \r\n\r\ni went inside freaking out, i was alone pacing back and forth in my kitchen going to the window looking out, and then i would think what if they are still out there, so i would walk back to the main area. if i was to look out my kitchen window i could see the ufo if it was still there. it was not there, but i wanted to look and didn't want to look at the same time. \r\n\r\ni text my sister, i think i just seen a ufo. right away she called me and she was freaking out too because she said the son of the woman she worked for had just seen the exact same thing i had seen a few minutes before.\r\n\r\n my sister works at a gas station which is about 7 miles north of my home. the same time the boy was seeing the ufo she was closing the store when all of the sudden all the lights went out in the store, and all the lights in the entire area surrounding its location went out.\r\n every thing went pitch black. she said it was like something drained the power.\r\n\r\nthe home of her boss is about one mile east of the store my sister works at. this is where the boy seen the ufo. he described the exact same thing i seen. it was over his house long enough for him to go inside to get a shotgun and come back outside. it scared him. this all happened about ten minutes before i seen the ufo. \r\n\r\nlater in the evening my sister is texting a friend about the events that had happened and he replies to her that his uncle also seen a ufo and his uncle had described what he seen to be the same thing i had seen and the boy had seen. \r\n\r\nhis uncle lives a few miles northeast of the gas station my sister works at. \r\n\r\nso these lights made three appearances on the night of december 13 between 6:00 to 7:10pm in a distance of about twenty miles, with three different people, myself included, in three different locations.\r\n\r\ni do not know the other two personally, i have not spoken more than a sentence to the other two people. we do not share anything in common except the fact that we all know my sister.

ship !!! no crap! i watched it and tried to get my camera out,that stay's on my side, and just missed the huge ufo. it had no light's on it and i could see window's on it and what looked like a computer board from a computer but in black. no light's and it suddenly manuvered a 15* turn and fast and shot off so fast that we, (american's) never could have that kind of technology.I am an industrial wiring technition, and i put computer's together. i have a vast experiance in this area. and don't drink or do drug's. i am a devout christian and study the way's if god every day.I watched it speed off and the government can't verify it as being one of their's they don't have this kind of technology and won't have it for atleast 2 or 300 year's from now. even if they can reconstruct a ufo from scratch. thay don't know the codes for navagation of the ufo. a translater could if they knew the language..He,he,he... so it sit's in a hanger and never will be seen or acknoledged....I know this because i was in a ufo..I don't remember all of it, but i do remember the feeling i got when they are here. an enlightened feeling of mind. a good feeling. not harmful at all. and i have definitave proof that ufo's exist and tht alien being's exist and i can prove both  too in one video !! have a video that has been stashed-- and if anything happens to me it will be telivised all over the nation on a secure channel. i have had several close encounter's with me and my dog. and proof is all i have a no-one will investigate this.. and it is still happening today. if you are in the area of northgate mall on the roof you can get some fascinating photo's.I have one in  the area that was within 30 ft. of my front door. and i have proof of that too ! as i mentioned before.They are doing a study on me as well as i am on them..They don't want other people to know; as not to pannic the nation. i also have \"radar photo's\" of the alein ship's location's showing a grid on my digital photograph and showing other same ufo's. i have seen this and it look's like a radar grid layout showing the possition's of all other ufo's that are over earth and only in my area. my digital camera doesn't have grid patern's in it's programming? so all the ship's are the same on some area's and other's show diferent ufo's. to this day i have categorized quite a few ufo's.More than any other person on earth. atleast in this area i am king of photography of ufo's here..Feel's good letting other's know what i have kept secret all these year's. *(wit's last name

they left to get dinner, so the rest of us returned to my friend's condo, which is near marina mile and i-95.  we were standing on the balcony smoking cigarettes, when my attention was drawn to a flash of light out of the corner of my eye.  i looked to the east-northeast and, between some tall slash pines, i saw a strange object.  it was at least a few miles away but, without any reference for its size or distance in relation to other points, i cannot be much more certain of its position.  it was a glowing white \"sphere\" (or something like a sphere).  it dove straight down, and as it moved a trail of sparkling white light trailed behind it, almost like the trail of certain meteorites.  then it \"zigged\" (for lack of a better term to describe its motions) quickly to my right (probably moving east-southeasterly) and slightly down at an angle a short distance.  at first i thought it might be a firework.  then it stopped, and the sparkling trail stopped at the same time.  i was confident at that moment that it was not a firework, and i pointed it out to my friend and his friend.  as we looked, the object zigged back to my left (probably moving north-northwesterly) and down at a slight angle about the same distance from where it started that it had moved to the right, the sparkling trail of white lights one again following behind.  my friend's friend suggested that it was a plane, or a helicopter, but me and my friend were quite certain it was not, and were asking each other and ourselves aloud what the object was.  during this time it zig zagged twice more, first right then left, about the same distance as its the sparkling trail following when it moved and disappearing when it stopped, and then simply faded away.  immediately after it disappeared, a second object appeared right where i had noticed the first object.  like the first object it was a white glowing sphere.  like the first object it first dove straight down, the trail of sparkling light following.  then, like the first object, it zig zagged right and left, following roughly the same pattern as the first in terms of direction, angle, distance, and velocity and also stopping at the same places and for the same amount of time.  after it zig zagged about four times, it proceeded to start diving up and down, at slight angles, the trail still following it when it moved and disappearing when it stopped.  at one point it dove up and stopped and then faded to a dim point of light, almost unnoticeable, in fact i thought for an instant that the object had disappeared, but then it flashed back to its previous intensity and started diving slowly down.  finally it dawned on me to ask if anyone had a cameraphone, which my friend did, and was able to catch the last 22 seconds of the sighting, by which time the object was very low, at times partially hidden by the tree, and its movement up and down and side to side became much more slight than it had been previously.  my friend's friend was behind us, having gone back into the condo, and was making jokes, obviously thinking we were fools and that the objects were (as he had maintained) a plane or a helicopter.  we thought no less foolish of him given that the objects clearly did not behave like or appear like any airplane or helicopter that exists.  at some point the object disappeared, possibly behind the trees, or behind the interstate, or both, or maybe it just disappeared like the first, we could not be certain.  afterwards me and my friend spent a great deal of time asking each other what the heck we had just seen.  it was not the first time i had seen a ufo, as it was in his case, but it was the first time i had seen more than one at a time.  we told our two friends, the couple, about it when they got back, and tried to show them the video but, unfortunately, on a cameraphone screen it was not very impressive, plus we had been very late and missed most of the action, but on a larger screen it is somewhat more convincing.  we wished we had not been so hypnotized by the incident that we were slow in recording it.","distance":"Over One

the \"sun\" and many other things going on inside. it was transparent as if though you were looking through a portal to all the galaxies and universes. there were also two other witnesses. one of the pics was on the front page in a small corner of the sun news in silver city that i believe read \"solar flare in mimbres.\"  mimbres is approximately 25 miles east of silver city. i was a freelance

fearful. i was upset because i was awakened from a beautiful dream, as sometimes i do have and was upset because i was wakened. i was dreaming i was in the solar flare and looking down and beside were two peopl, i belive, but could not see their faces as they were white like lightning. as we were coming over the horizon i noticed that landscape and it was dark and remembered that i had to go down

your camera and look outside.\" in the dream it felt as though the people that were beside me were my equals and did not feel like an abduction. it was most awesome and i did not want to come back down. when i raced down and saw the solar flare the other witness who was still watching, i believe, said that one of the stars shot down over the house or shot a beam but i believe he said one of the

sun.  once your eyes has adjusted, the object can be seen and sometimes with no difficulties.  the object from my prospective seemed to just be hovering although it is moving extremely slow.  what seems always, the object would appear while looking almost southwest in direction (compass bearing 244 degrees) from power rd. and hwy 60,  and between 30 to 45 degrees above the sw horizon at an altitude estimated to be about 3,000 feet (or near high air traffic route height).  the object appears to be traversing west (270 degrees) from the east direction (90 degrees).\r\n\r\n  and  for the

 f-stops \"0\",  and i bracket the shots between 1/30sec to 1/800sec in the beginning.  in that way, i was guarantee at least one picture being good.  in the beginning, i focused the lens by focusing on a jet near the same distant in order to locate the object.  working with a set-scope can prove challenging when trying to locate a small and sometimes dim object in the far distant with a darken lens.    3/4 of those pictures taken are salvageable; the others are white washed beyond fixing, and the darken pictures seems to show more object details and color rather than just white.\r\n\r\n  tomorrow i'll be watching for it again starting at 1300 to see if it passed over me, or it just appear where i been seeing it appearing.  absolutely not a jet, helicopter, or bird.  possible balloon, however that's unlikely since the object was spotted at a distant of 3 to 8 miles at extreme altitude.   it don't look to be a weather balloon neither since weather balloon i seen and captured on film usually has something hanging below the balloon (like it was two separate objects).  the object been seen south of gilbert, southwest  of mesa.\r\nno guarantees that it will repeat its pattern tomorrow, but i'll be waiting for it with my camera in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nso far, it is still an ufo to me.\r\n\r\nthe picture shown is the 1000mm.","distance":"Over One

ahead in the eastern sky, two very bright lights close together, about 30-deg above horizon.  the lights alternated blinking out and reappearing several times - then the visible one initiated what appeared to be three successive and distinct \"shooting\" forward of new objects with bright tails - but with the each new object originating from the previous.  the object(s) then simply disappeared.\r\n\r\napproximately 5 minutes later, four dimmer objects were noticed in the ne and northern sky.  we pulled over to the side and got out of the car and observed the objects moving east-to-west, and west-to-east by making erratic changes in direction and speed.  one of the objects appeared to be coming toward us (became much brighter) and then again it began the \"shooting\" process with each new streak ending in a new light and then shooting out again. this event included four distinct \"shootings\" - and then the light disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe initial feeling was we were observing a fireworks and/or flares display.  this feeling changed to thinking we were watching a modern day dogfight.  this excitement was fortified by the sound of jets overhead - but the sounds did not seem to correspond to the location of the lights.  i seemed as if the jets were attempting to intercept the objects.  \r\n\r\nat this point i called 911 on my cell and reported the sightings to the hugo, oklahoma 911 operator.  i explained that there was a light show going on in the northern sky and that she would probably be getting some additional calls.\r\n\r\noverall, we observed the lights and listened to the jets for 15-20 minutes.  the lights eventually disappeared (dimmed out) but in different quadrants of the northern sky.

it really looked like the \"silver surfer\" from a cartoon. crazy... and i have no idea what they were... but just wanted to share. i wish i had a better vantage point when i was filming. it does not look nearly as impressive on-screen, but i tell you that seeing it was totally wild and bizarre. at least you can see how about how big the objects were, what they looked like with the contrails, and that they were changing directions and dropping rapidly. i am just glad i caught even a moment of it on film. anybody else see anything like this before? anyone else see this that night in santa monica? maybe someone knows what they were.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26962,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0230443,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12132010-0003","longitude":-118.4833812,"occurred":1291252140000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1292285591000,"summary":"Silver surfer ufo - fireballs over santa monica on dec 1st and 8th 2010","tags":["ufo","fireball"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/26962_submitter_file1__SILVERSURFERUFO.mp4"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11,"locationName":"Santa Monica, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:81062"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1928}
