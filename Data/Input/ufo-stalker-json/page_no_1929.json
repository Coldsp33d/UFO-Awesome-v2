and alameda st. last night (december 11, 2010 at 6:20pm) waiting for the light parade to come by.  i was bored and looking around myself and noticed two stars in the sky.  i realized that one was moving, must have been what caught my attention.  i pointed it out to my children, but only the younger one saw it.  as we watched i could tell it must have been moving higher and higher because the star was getting smaller and smaller and finally disappeared.  i was traveling probably south-south-west in the sky and we observed it for about a minute or so.  we were amazed and talked about it for a few minutes and then started watching the street again, still waiting for the parade to start.  about one to two minutes later my younger daughter called out that there was a triangle in the sky.  this time all three of us saw it.  it was about the size of a quarter if i held it at arms length.  it was also traveling in the same trajectory as the star-like light we had seen.  south-south-west.  the angle of the triangle that seemed to be the front, well the two sides that make up that angle were covered with circles.  if they were lights, they were not shining, but i guess the reflection from the street lights below allowed us to see them.  it could have been a string of balloons....But the triangle itself was solid, not just the lines of the two angles.  i could tell the triangle was solid because it was grey in color as opposed to the darkness of the sky.  it also blocked out the stars that would have been seen if it wasn't solid.  so we thought maybe balloons.  one daughter said geese, but no, like i said solid.  it flew in the same direction as the other light we had seen and disappeared from our view in about a minute or so.  when i looked at my watch, it said 6:23.  so maybe a total of 5 minutes through the entire event.\r\n\r\nmy initial reaction was excitement.  my second reaction was skepticism, being the parade and being roswell, someone might have been playing a prank.

intersection, when i noticed a bright light hovering in the southeast section of the sky.  my first thought was that it was an aircraft perhaps waiting to land at a nearby airport, however i thought it was an odd time for aircraft to be waiting.  as we traveled east the light appeared to be moving east towards the aurora area.  my husband commented that it may be a police helicopter monitoring aurora.  that sounded like a reasonable explanation.  we traveled east on i-76 to the hwy 85 exit.  we proceeded north on 85 for about 5 minutes than i decided to look back and see what the light was up to.  it was no longer over southeast denver, it was now east of us traveling north as we were.  dia is in the vicinity, so we assumed it was probably going to land there.  well it didnt.  it continued to travel north with us.  i thought maybe it was airtraffick control until i realized that the light did not have red or blue flashing lights.  in fact it did not flash at all.  i double checked my speed an i was driving the limit.  i figured by the time i got to ft lupton or platteville it would go away.  well it didnt.  it continued to follow us.  right after we went through platteville it got closer to us.  we took the backroad that leads to two rivers parkway and it continued to follow us.  when we were approx 10 min from home it got closer and slightly ahead of us.  my husband and i started to try to find a rational expanation for why we were being followed.  i had let him know about my recent curiosity with ufos and aliens and told him that i have seen other strange lights on our trip home from blackhawk.  we always are driving home around 3 or 3:30 in the morning.  we go twice a week and we've been going consistently for about 4 years.  i do not drink alcohol nor do i take medication.  i am very aware of my surroundings and any changes that occur on our trips.  my husband got uncomfortable with me telling him that i believed that is was a ufo with a motive of trying to communicate with me.  i wasn't scared, in fact when i realized it was following us i figured if it was terrestial it would recognize my receptive reaction and assumed it would follow us home.  my husband on the other hand flipped it the bird, and told me it was probably someone in the gov't messing with us.  we are law abiding citizens and dont have any reason for the gov't to take interest in us.  well it stopped traveling when we did and parked in the sky to the east.  it was not high in the sky like stars, in fact it was only as high as the tower lights that are  located directly east of my house.  we entered our house and i immediately went to my kitchen window and it was still in the same spot.  it did't move.  i figured it could sense what i was thinking so i expessed that i was tired and i wanted it to leave us alone.  i proceeded to bed.  i had to get up in a couple of hours and decided not to look for it until daylight.  when i looked for it at 8:00 am it was gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26951,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.763823,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122010-0007","longitude":-105.2133997,"occurred":1292067000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1292199659000,"summary":"Bright

to a parking lot of a church. i happened to be standing by my car as i noticed a falling star out of the corner of my eye, looking south. as it brought my attention towards that area of the sky, 5 more falling stars shot off in random directions, leaving me excited that i had just seen 5 simultaneous falling stars! half way through my cigarette, i moved to the front of my building where there was less light to interfere with my view of the clear sky. standing now on the westside/front of my building with a full view of the southern, western and northern skies, i was scanning the sky for more spectacular surprises, since about 2 months before, my girlfriend and i both witnessed a star-like ufo, north of town, moving very slowly to the east and upward, disappear. after experiencing that i became more aware of what's going on in the sky, therefore, everytime i'm standing or step out in the front of my building, i automatically look towards the northern skies to see if what we saw, is there again. i can't help but to look. what i saw in october, was a light evading my view by mimicking a star. it moved very very slowly, upward and to the east, but as it moved behind the view of a lamp post in the grocery store's parking lot across the street of mine, it'd stop dead still and i would have to shift positions of my head to locate it again. i'd move my head further right, it would move left behind the viewing of the lamp post, i'd move my head left to spot it again, it would move right behind the lamp post again...It was off in a distance but still bright and flickering green and purple, sometimes dimming for moments, a very redish orange color, then flickering again. at that point i ran inside, woke my girlfriend to look at this \"light.\" as soon as we step outside, it was still there but motionless and less actively flickering. it looked like a normal star in the sky. my girlfriend sort of got angry that i woke her and said \"it's not moving. it's a star! i think you're just seeing things...\" i insisted she keep her eyes glued to this \"star\" because i had a feeling it would display the show it was for me, again. a minute or so pass by and next thing you know, this light starts moving towards the east and up again, still at a very slow speed, almost as if it were gliding. my girlfriend in excitement and confusion said \"it looks like it moved over to the right a little!\" within seconds from her saying that, this light stopped dead in its track, elevated by a small amount and disappeared. i literally felt like falling over and it scared her to wanting to go back inside right away to \"hide.\" i regained myself but i was very speechless at what had happened. it left me with a feeling that it knew we/i could see it, and it moving out of my view was a way to \"cloak\" itself from my sight because like i said, i felt it knew i was watching it. very creepy. on the morning of december 10th, as i described above, after i moved to the westside of my builing with the south, west and north in my view, i looked to the northern skies. i took notice right away to a flicker, high in elevation. as i focused in on where it came from, i noticed what at first appeared to be a plane slowly floating along, again towards the east but at a very slow speed. i'm not good at determining distances in the sky, but it was pretty far up, high enough to be a plane. i stayed glued to it but noticed sort of a lag in its flashes. it would flash but not on time, as a plane or helicopter would like on a tick of a clock. as soon as it would flash and go black, it would flash again a second or so later but it would be slightly behind its initial flashes. while it continued east, there are trees in my neighbors' yard that would have obscurred its view. on one of the trees, there's a very large branch that sticks outwards towards the west, therefore, the direction of this light would first go behind that branch then re-appear in a small space of the tree, before it disappears behind all of the branches and twigs, etc. at the speed it was moving i stayed focused because it was odd and i was certain it wasn't a plane after its strange characteristics of speed and flashes. as soon as it moved behind the large branch that was poking out of the tree, i waited for it to re-appear in the small space. it should've taken a second or two, to get past the branch's cover, but nothing. i was in denial at that point, thinking \"no, this can't be happening again! wtf?!\" running towards the street just to spot this light again. i looked toward the direction it was going, but seconds later, i noticed it again, but way higher in altitude but the odd thing was it was a solid red light, sitting still and then finally disappearing after a couple seconds later! i again, ran inside to wake up my girlfriend, but as i entered the bedroom, she appeared to be \"awake\" already with her face, facing the door way and her eyes wide open. i asked if she was ok, but got no response, i walked up to her and shook her a little and asked again, but still no response and still a dead stare! that added more creepiness to what i had just seen, but then she finally rolled over and just said, \"it's hot in here\" then back to sleep. she had no recollection of being \"awake\" when i went in there or even talking to me, but seeing her with her eyes wide open for a good couple of seconds staring off into nowhere, made me feel a bit uncomfortable with the events i've witnessed. my heart at that point was pounding , i moved to each window of the apartment looking out to see if i could see anything in the sky again. i get to my kitchen window which faces the west and looked out. as soon as i took view to the western skies, i notice an odd \"light\", which at first, i thought was a helicopter because f.E. warren airforce base is out west of town and i always see helicopters going to and from there or in that direction. i kept my sight on it moving at different rates of speed towards the north, starting at a really high altitude but then lowering as it moved along. as it lowered some more, it disappeared, again... a couple seconds pass and it re-appears higher in altitude, somewhat in the same area it disappeared at. it again started floating along, blinking at random times moving first down in elevation again, and then much higher than it was, and then coming to a complete stop in the north/western skies. i watched it sit still, and vividly blink red at random times for about a minute, and as seconds went by after so, the blinking was gone, and i was staring at the black of the sky again. i closed up all of the blinds and went straight to bed, because of how uncomfortable that entire event turned out to be. i have a feeling that these objects/lights know that we can see them because of their evasive manuevers to get out of sight. if i wouldn't have been looking around those nights or if i wouldn't have focused in on those particular lights, it makes me wonder if they would have ever moved position in the first place. it's pretty odd stuff and makes me feel like i'm somewhat \"connected\" now that i keep seeing these strange things.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26947,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1493514,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122010-0003","longitude":-104.8130462,"occurred":1291977600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wyoming","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

in my seat for almost two hours, couldn't sleep so i decided to start driving.  i immediately noticed this star like figure in the eastern sky.  i've seen this same figure many years ago as a teenager in idaho more than once.  i knew it wasn't a star because it was too close to the ground and way too bright.  i also noticed it moving when i would stop the car, it would go back and forth from one side of i-80 to the other. i tried to keep up with the other cars because i've never felt so terrified, i felt like it was there for me for some reason, only because this isn't the only time that i've seen it.  my brother and my grandmother have also seen this before.  my heat was on inside my car but all that i could feel was cold.  i was stopping at every exit because i couldn't stay awake, i would drink coffee and red bull but could only continue to drive for only twenty minutes at a time.  every time i would stop it would move closer but when i would continue driving, it would go off into the distance.  i finally couldn't drive any longer so i pulled off at a truck stop at rock springs and once again reclined me seat to try to sleep.  i could see it moving south as i fell asleep, it was my last image of this star like figure.  when i was sleeping, i was dreaming about it and a man that i have never seen before.  in my dream, the man kept repeating that he was the reason that i could not bear children that they had other plans for me.  i remember trying to wake from this dream but could not, and once again have never been so terrified.  also, when i was driving, a friend of mine was sending me text messages but for some period i quit receiving these messages.  when they finally came through, i had three missed messages at different times, but i remember checking my phone frequently and never did lose service.  after sleeping for three hours i woke up to continue driving. even though i could no longer see the object, i still could only drive about twenty to thirty minutes at a time, i was drained of energy.  i had to pull over and sleep for one or two hours every twenty to thirty minutes.  a drive that would normally only take me less than five hours took me more than twelve hours because i just didn't have the energy to continue.  i've made this same drive several times and was sick with severe anemia from cancer before and still was never this tired.  in fact it's still hours later and i don't feel like i have any energy just yet, but i did notice i have three blister like sores on my neck in the shape of a triangle, very painful.  don't know if they have anything to do with my sighting or my fatigue but don't want to dismiss it just yet.  also, i tried to stop and take pictures of the object, but it seems like every time i would stop and get my phone ready to take pictures, the object would become very dim.  and according to my call log, i called my husband at 5:24 am to tell him about what i was seeing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26946,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.8283038,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122010-0002","longitude":-106.9361609,"occurred":1292071500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1292145481000,"summary":"First

(basically a swing like device that you sit in and repel down the building with ropes to clean windows of high rise buildings) anyway i climbed over the parapet wall and let myself down to a seated position at the top of the building.  as i did this i was looking up at my parapet clamp to make sure everything was still hooked up properly which required me to look pretty much straight up.  well as i looked up something really strange caught my eye.  i saw a bunch of white looking objects way up in the sky and i was like wow what is that.  they didn't look like balloons or anything i had ever seen before.  as i sat there absolutely dumbfounded as to what these objects were doing in the sky i just stared at them.  i must say at the time i felt like i was in the twilight zone because i was seeing something that i could not explain.  i must have just stared up at these objects for a few minutes before i realized you know what [witness name removed cms/dr] these things maybe ufos.\r\nnow at that time i had never seen any ufos on tv that looked like these things did so it was a total mystery to me.  anyway i was absolutely fascinated by what these objects could be so i did something i have never done before i actually climbed back up on top of the roof which is not easy to do.  imagine holding on to the top of a high rise building and pulling yourself back up over the parapet wall to get back on top of the roof. (it wasn't easy)  anyway once on top of the building i took all my safety gear off and just looked up in total amazement at these objects.  it was clear to me after a few minutes that these were not balloons.  and there were so many of them that i didn't even try to count them.  they were white looking sphere like objects that were just stationary in the sky.  again i would estimate about 30 to max 50 objects in the sky.  they looked like they were really high up in the atmosphere but i could clearly see them.  what really puzzled me was how these objects stayed stationary for 15 minutes of more.  they looked like they were all at about the same altitude.  and the rally weird thing was that they appeared to be in some kind of formation.  not like anything i had ever seen before like military.  each object was keeping a little distance between the objects that were next to them.  i could see them like constantly adjusting there position in order to remain separated from the rest of the objects in the formation of ufos.  now again i had never seen anything like this before that day and i was starting to get a little freaked out because the more i analyzed what these things could be i started to come to one conclusion \"these are ufos\".  but i remember thinking to myself that ufos are metallic looking objects and these looked white or maybe even luminescent.  that and the fact that there were so many of these objects in the sky i was really puzzled because i was conditioned to believe that ufos were just one or two in the sky not a bunch of them at one time.  i had never seen a movie or a tv program that ever showed a large number of ufos in the sky ever so to see all these things in the sky was unbelievable at the time.  anyway after about 15 minutes of watching these things just hang out in the sky i became absolutely convinced these were some kind of ufos.  now i was all alone on top of a roof of a 7 story building and i remember i was a little nervous about being all alone up there with these things up there.  part of me thought what if they beamed me up i think.  so i distinctly remember a moment when i had seen enough and i wanted to find someone else and show them because this was the most incredible sight i had ever witnessed with my own eyes.  so i went down to the 7th floor to tell anyone to come look at these ufos.  however when i got to the 7th floor there was nobody in the hallway.  i didn't want to walk into one of the tenants office and shout out \"look out the windows everybody there is a bunch of ufos in the sky\".  so i went down the elevator to ground level and ran out to the back of the building and looked up to see the ufos.  and all i saw was one or 2 of them which from the ground level didn't look that spectacular.  i mean anyone looking up would have thought that they were just balloons.  but the formation that i saw from the roof looked completely different when you consider that they maintained the same formation for approx 15 minutes or so.  anyway i was too embarrassed to tell the parking guy who was standing 50 feet away about what i had seen because they might of thought i was crazy or something and i could loose my job if the owners found out about it.  i worked for myself at the time but i thought they might not want me to clean their buildings if they thought i was seeing ufos in the sky above their buildings so i never told them.  i remember every time i had to clean those buildings from that time on i was dying to tell the management about my ufo sighting but for the next year or 2 that i cleaned those building i never had the courage to tell them out of fear of loss.  when i finally got back on top of the building all the ufos were gone.  i was a little pissed at myself because i wasted all that time going down trying to tell someone else to look at these things that i never got to see them take off or what ever they did when they left.\r\n\r\nin conclusion i don't know how big these things were but they had to be pretty big in order for me to see them because they were so high up in the air.  i would say they were at least 30 thousand feet or higher.  so they must have each been about 30 to 50 feet across or bigger.  i told my grandparents that day when i got home and got my 1st dose of crazy looks when i tried to tell them what i had seen.  i realized really quickly that people didn't want to hear about ufos so i kept this pretty much to myself now for over 20 years or so.  \r\n\r\nby the way i had an even more bizarre sighting in the same general location of tarzana in 2004.  they came back and this time i actually saw them traveling at a very high rate of speed.  i also saw what i believe were some kind of probes that came within 50 feet of me that i have never seen or heard about before.  in 1994 i finally got some kind of answer to my question that i had from my 1st sighting in 1988.  i saw the exact same objects on a tv show called \"sighting\"  they showed the same type of cluster ufos that were popping up in mexico in the early 90's. \r\n\r\ni will give you a brief description of my 2004 sighting and if you want to contact me i'd be glad to tell you the whole story.  i have the exact date this occurred on a 2004 calendar but i'd  have to look for it.  anyway i frequently look up in the sky because i know there are things up there and since my 1988 ufo encounter i kept looking for ufos and it wasn't until 2004 that i saw another one.  i was at my house at [witness address removed cms/dr].  less than one mile from the original sighting back in 1988.  anyway i look up as i was leaving the house like i do frequently when i'm outdoors now.  i saw a white ufo like object that looked just like the ones i saw before in 1988.  i ran back into the house and got binoculars this time and this time i got a rally good look at this object.  it appeared to be only a mile or so away at about 1,000 to 2,000 feet in the air.  i could clearly see the ufo rotating, i forget which direction though.  anyway this thing stayed stationary with a slow rotation for several minutes.  than i saw what i had been waiting to see for over 15 years or so.  i actually saw through the binoculars 2 other ufos that were traveling at a very high rate of speed go shooting by each other like they were playing chicken with each other way above the original ufo i was looking at.  i remember thinking wow i finally got to see one of these things moving through the sky that absolutely takes the balloon theory out of the picture.  balloons don't go that fast.  i mean these things had to be going in excess of 100 mph heading right at one another and passing directly above the stationary ufo i was looking at through my binoculars.  that was a very exiting moment for me because i had all kinds of questions and doubts about what i had seen years earlier and at that moment i felt like i had got my answer.  these were definitely ufos.  anyway i continued to watch the stationary ufo for several minutes than it too began to move to the west and it began to pick up speed and then it moved out at a high rate of speed.  this thing was approx 1 mile or so away and then it took off west and traveled out of sight over mountain range to the west in about 10 seconds or so.  the mountain range to the west is about 10 miles away so you do the math.  i have seen fighter jets many times and this ufo would have left a fighter jet in it's dust.\r\n\r\nnow here is where the story gets really strange.  i continued to look up at the sky to see if their were anymore ufos flying around and then within a minute or 2 i saw these very weird and small objects come floating over the freeway right over my house no more than 50 to 70 feet above my head.  these objects looked like they were about the size and shape of a speed limit sign.  they literally looked like someone had painted a speed limit sign with very colorful colors on the front and back of the sign.  it looked very much like graffiti artist painted these signs with several different colors.  anyway these objects all of the sudden just started coming over the freeway right over my house in a very uncontrolled and strange way.  they kind of floated though the air turning over and tumbling through the air at a very slow speed maybe 100 feet off the ground right over my head.  i saw maybe 10 or so of these objects go right over head and continue heading south at a very slow speed maybe 2 or 3 mph.  this was not newspapers or paper floating in the air because it wasn't windy that day and i got a good look at these things through my binoculars.  i watched these things fly out of sight over the next few minutes as they traveled south over an apartment building that was a quarter of a mile away.  never once did any of these objects stop or touch the ground.  they all moved off out of sight and never came back.\r\nafter years of thinking about these objects i thought maybe these were some kind of probes that were sent down from  the ufos because they wanted to check me out.  i thought what if they saw me checking them out and they wanted to let me know they were checking me out as well.  why else would these things have come over the freeway right where i was within a minute or two of the ufo that i was watching took off.  \r\n\r\ni don't know if you have ever heard of anyone who has seen these objects before but it was really weird to me and i have seen a lot of ufos on tv programs over the last 15 years or so and i have never seen anything like these small ufos that i saw that day. anyway if that wasn't strange enough than all the sudden i see what looked like a v formation of birds that were about 500 feet in the air fly over as well. the only problem is i saw these things for several minutes through the binoculars and they didn't look like birds and they never flaped their wings.  i must have watched them travel over 1 mile or more in a v formation until they went out of sight as well.  the only thing i could explain these things is maybe they were small remote operated planes but i don't think they were.  but they could have been i just don't know who or why anyone would or could do this with about 10 or so delta wing objects flying at slow speed 20 mph or so for several miles i would have to assume.  i think all of these objects were connected because they all happened back to back to back.  i don't believe in coincidences.  anyway if you want to contact me to discuss this further i would be happy to talk to you guys about this.

'disks or coins' with detailed design on them...(i just recently got many of those same ones in the past month (nov/dec. 2010)..Last year i actually got pictures of a 'glob' of stuff and then it formed into these disks. recently i caught them in a different form,..Not quite into the disk yet but going there...A fuzzy ball!...I watched 'six tiny lights' skirting around the sky like fireflies last year and when i enlarged them they look like gol'darn  kids kiddy cars...I got a 'black thing' and when i enlarged it it didn't get the pixels like it should have but became a sharp rectangle with sharp edges and a gray edge around the black. doing further investigation of my photos i haver found that it 'may be a doorway' to a larger craft where these tiny things emerged from. (i've gotten the black thing in recent photos too...Still appears as the same type of thing.....I have seen 'strobe lights' that shoot out a beam and then the object turns like a globe and shoots out the strobe light again. same night it happened again(last year) but no where in the sky but level with my house but down a ways to our left but way below the mt. that's when i caught the first glob of the disc formning....I've got photos of a craft looking form with a string hanging down...(last year)..Recently i have got pictures of the disks/coins...And ...Are you ready for this...'long airplane looking crafts!!!' i watched them every night for over a week (and if it wasn't for the rains and snow and bitter cold would still be out there)they are around for at least an hour every night.At first the light was like a flashing light...I thought it was a plane and took it so i would have a reference if i ever got something'strange'!..It ended up being the strange things.There were at least ten iof them,one right after another and going in all directions..All different...Several are like a bar with different lights..Some with more than others...The usual 'discs/coins' and something that looks like a bio plane. there is also one of them against what everyone 'thinks' is the moon (but greenish tint)..It isn\"t the moon...The moon was the exact oppositre direction. i 'think' it is that ??'mother craft the things come out of.I looked for the door but this one was a little different and instead of at the edge it looks like it is in the middle...I also have seen and have pictures of the 'v shape' (several going in different direction s).Most of this stuff my camera picked up and i didn't see the stuff until looking at my picture.However, a couple of weeks ago i saw a low flying v lower than the mt's. and it was like a lit up christmas tree. there were three lights on each side and across the bak with one red light on the back left. the photo i fot has it as a solid white(brightness??) but there was a red streak which made me think a plane leaving a trail,..But..The red ?Trail/ was also in front of it..(this is all this last month(i have a nikon 300 camera and had it setting on a tripod and used a cable release so there wouldn't be any shaking.I put it on 'programed' because i didnb't know what to set it on.(the one i took last year i had it set on a fast speed for takuing pictures of birds in flight during the day and was able to catch the falling fireball!) oh yes, my camera was fiorst set on 1600- asa and i cranked it to 3500. also, a couple of weeks ago i actually saw the bar with lights craft like is in the pictures,with my own eyes!!! a light lit up and then one to the right and then another but zipped fronm one to the other.When it got to the end they all stauyed stil (without blinking) for a split second and then 'disppeared' ..Not shot off,..Just disappeared,..Like in harry potter's invisable cloth...Which,by the way is why i ythink our pilots can't catch them..It's not that they are so fast,..They just change...The recent lights with colored string seen in kokomo indiana and are thought to be something 'new' i have a group of pictures of way back when i lkived in st.Pete fla. the local mufon said it wasn't anything yet at least fifty of us saw it. i also have the 'string' coming down little by little and again i think 'crafts'; were coming down it.Don't send the local mufon guy.He camed with the ball of fire but wasn't interested in it as he said it was suppose to be a traingle or a 'creature' discription.'i' had pictures ..Yet he was impressed by what someone else said they saw...There are far too many photos to even try to submit (i have hundr4eds)..I will give a sample so you can see the different ones...I need to send them by e-mail because i can't open just separate pictures by hitting browse below it opens family phoits too. please send me an e-mail to answer and i'll enclude them there.
