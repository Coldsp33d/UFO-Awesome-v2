i was around 3, i had an encounter. a blue-grey humanoid like being appeared in my room one night and told me that they were from another galaxy and that they were there to observe me and they bring no harm. up until 2nd grade i had been watched by the blue grey humanoid who i had dubbed my 'imaginary friend' in fear of being rejected. i remember the last night i saw them, they put their cold spindly fingers on my forehead as i had laid in bed, pretending to sleep, and they said something in their language, which they had tried to teach me a few times, but i never really understood. ever since that night i've had a fascination with space, physics, and cosmology. i was extremely advanced in those subjects, especially for a third grader. i was dubbed 'einstein' by my school. it seemed like since that day i became tremendously smarter than i was before. i had continued seeing the circle of blinking lights throughout my life, and the closer the lights got, the more knowledge i had about the universe the next day. it stopped in about 6th grade, when i attempted suicide, it seemed like the entities gave me a break for a few months, but showed up again the next year, in the form of repeated blinking lights. i have made a bunch of accomplishments and done many things 'reserved for geniuses' since 2nd grade, including a model of the 4th dimension, a string theory project, and an explanation of dark matter, in only 7th grade. recently though, on july 11, i saw what i call 'the mothership' of the blinking lights. it was a massive circle that looked about 30-40ft long and was white in color. it was positioned in the middle of the circle of blinking lights.","distance":"21-100

one night, a man killed all of us, and he woke up terrified. he had that dream twice, and it left such an impact, we all (wife, kids, including me) remember it to this day. he freaked us out telling it to us, and discussed it for an hour or so afterwards. \r\n     we were passing through yarnell after spending a day in prescott. dad drove up to the old shop, a little spooked, as were we all, as he reminisced on this nightmare of his. he asked me to take a photo of the old run-down store. i took two. one of the structure, which accurately depicts the light left at that time, and one of the sky, which made the structure go dark. my mother took one too. \r\n     mom told me, jokingly, to look into the window's and to tell her if there is anything creepy. \r\n     i am going crazy trying to edit them, and view them in different ways, to help me see the reality here, but in the end, i can't shake the conclusion that something is definitely there. \r\n     so, i am sending 7 images. 3

texas in the last two weeks of my training to become a jet fighter pilot.It was a clear bright blue sky.And we had just come down from flying t-33 jet trainers with our instructors.It was about three o'clock in the afternoon and we had just landed, about twenty of us including our instructors,and as i was walking into the flight shack with my parachute over my back, i looked down the ramp to my left and saw many people out on the ramp looking up into the sky. i turned around and looked up into the northeast of the clear blue sky and saw three \"v\" formations of glowing white flying saucers. i told all of my fellow cadets and instructors to look up.There were 33 altogether.There were 15 in the middle \"v\" and 9 in each of the other \"v's on each side of the big \"v\". they were moving slowly from the northeast to the southwest. when they got at a 50 degree angle above us, the second saucer in the little \"v\" on the left side fell out of formation and fell like a falling leaf to the left. at that point, the entire formations stopped in midair. the falling saucer stopped falling and got control of itself and flew horizontally over to a position right under it's little \"v\" and then went straight up into its position in the little \"v\".Then all three \"v's\" made a left climbing turn to the southeast and climbed on out into space at about a 45 to 50 degree angle and were out of sight in about 3 to 4 minutes. my instructor and an other ran into the flight shack and called wing headquarters for permission to take a t-33 to fly up to them when we first saw them. our t-33's had a limited ceiling of 39,000 feet with the wing fuel tanks. the tower told them that they were watching them and had done a triangulation with a theodolite and had determined that the saucers were at 100,000 feet and were 100 feet in diameter. we all just looked at each other and realized that there was a civilization far superior to ours and it was like we were in the dark ages compared to them. i had wanted to run back to my cadet housing to get my camera to take a picture of them,butwe cadets were not allowed to leave the flight line except in formation.I thought that there would be pictures in the paper the next day,but there were no pictures or any comments about them . the air force had really squelched any news about them. however the \"tower\" had to keep a detailed record of the saucers which was an air force regulation. i am sure that the record was deleted. there were thousands of people in waco that saw them so somewhere there has to be a record of the incident. i went on to become a jet fighter pilot with the 452nd fighter day squadron and 322nd fighter day group during the korean war, but never saw combat.\r\n","distance":"Over One

never went back to the farm after that night. we seen it 3 to 4 nights for about 3 weeks. it was beginning to mid july. before the ufo kecksburg festival they have every year. i was watching a ufo

(i don't know what heights drones can ascend.)\r\n\r\nsunday 2nd july 2017. denton manchester england uk about 4.30pm.\r\n\r\ngolf ball just appeared out of nothing. about the same distance away but to the left of the neighbours roof. this was witnessed by girlfriend myself and my mother after we shouted for her to come take a look.\r\nit was rising diagonally upward slowly. towards the roof apex and emitted a bright light like an arc welder spark. (thats the nearest and best description i can give it.) the light came on, around the object for a few seconds and went out for a few seconds, repetitively as it rose. it got to about 100 metres away. the light had stopped. it rose up some more, looking like a golf ball again and just faded out into nothing. gone...\r\nbut my girlfriend said \"no it shot away quickly, into nothing\". maybe from her perspective or position in the garden it did. i was messing about trying to get dead batteries out of my camera. \" if it returns next sunday i will be ready.\r\n\r\nsunday 9th july 2017. denton manchester england uk about 4.30pm.\r\n\r\nthis time i was ready with hd camera set on a tripod, with two sets of batteries. just in case. girlfriend had binoculars and was watching out for me.\r\nblue sky with white fluffy clouds. sunny again. \r\nthis time we spotted two tiny star like objects skimming and bobbing out from behind the clouds. they flashed as they moved, in a strobe light fashion. left to right, back and fourth. they seemed to be playing chase and evade with each other. they moved mostly horizontally at great speed. appearing and vanishing. i tried to get some footage but it was difficult to guess where they were going to pop out from behind the clouds.\r\n\r\nthe footage. as you will see i am no expert with a camera. it is only a £100 fuji film camera. i'm still learning how to use it. the footage is inconclusive to me but there are objects on it i'm not sure about. there are birds that are flying about. there are commercial aircraft circling manchester, in order to land at manchester airport about 5 miles or so away to the southeast.. there are some anomalous looking objects but i'm not sure. \r\ni must admit we were excited during the filming and where i say \"got one\"..Well that could have been a bird. ha ha!.. anyway i have uploaded my amateurish footage for you to scrutinise. \r\ni will keep looking on a sunday afternoon and try to capture these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

family place in crawford maine. it was between 1 and two in the morning when i woke up for no reason and felt drawn to the window. the beds are in the attic and the window is in the center of the peak at the end. i almost had to stand on my toes to look out. even now i can't explain how i was compelled to look, but what i saw at that critical age changed my perspective of reality for life. between 70 and 80 degrees high and a mile or two away i saw what i have to describe as a green dancing star. this thing was bright emerald green and was moving all over the place. it went up, down, sidways, zig zagged. it didn't seem to have any clear path, it was just dancing. i was staring in awe and knowing this couldn't be human and all of a sudden i got a strange sensation. it felt as if this thing was in me, in my mind, like it knew i was watching it, and in that same moment it froze and just pulsated. i watched and waited for a few minutes but it wouldn't move again, and i couldn't shake the feeling that it knew i was watching. so i thought i would trick it, i went and laid down away from the window. i don't know how long it was before that feeling passed, maybe a few mins, but when it passed i got up and looked out the window again and there it was, dancing around like a pixie amongst the stars. once more, and much sooner this time, the sensation came over me and it froze again. this time i stayed up and stared at it until i was too sleepy and went back to bed. that seems like a standard ufo sighting but here's where it gets strange. i remember the next night i had a hunch it would return and i planned on seeing it again. wouldn't you know i woke up again, compelled again to look, even though i already wanted to. it was later this time, closer to 3am but when i looked out, there it was dancing again but it also seemed to move more fluidly than zig zaggy, but again after a few minutes it froze again. i decided to trick it again, so i laid down for a few minutes. this time when i returned to the window it was still frozen, but i could pick it out by its brightness, color and the way it pulsated, as well as that connected sensation. it was at this moment my brother woke up and asked what i was doing. i told him i was watching a star move. he said \"what?\" rather skeptically and jumped out of his bed and joined me at the window. i pointed out the green star and poof! that's all i remember. i don't remember going back to bed or any more about my brother's involvement. he has since told me some of the rest that i can't remember. he said it was moving like crazy, impossibly, and he says it came down, went over the property in front of the window and flew over the trees across the highway where it descended out of sight from the attic window. we moved downstairs and looked out the large picture window facing true west and  overlooking the highway. we saw it descend into the trees less than a mile away and the green glow faded. my brother is high functioning autistic and his brain works like a computer, he has the iq to prove it. he practices radical honesty, much to other peoples surprise and regardless of their reaction lol. i have no memory of any of it after he joined me in the attic window. as far as i was concerned all these years, we both lost interest and went back to bed. just a couple years ago it came up in conversation and he told me his side. since then i keep getting a reoccurring flashback of the light in the trees, but it is all i can recall of our shared experience. i've never stopped looking up and have seen a few ufos since and will submit reports for those as well. the truth is out there.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

unidentifiable flying/floating object sailing over my area (east hamilton, ontario), from my apartment balcony. my balcony faces n/e, toward the bay of lake ontario. i stepped out to take a look at the construction crew tearing down an old high school across the road from my building, and to check on the current temperature, when this object caught my eye, drifting at first in my direction (fully south), coming from the north area of the city, closer to the lake. it was fairly large, and i estimated it to be almost the size of an austin mini cooper car. it looked solid/3d, and was rectangular and box-like in shape. the colour was a dark grey, but parts of it appeared to be a lighter grey. it changed direction as it approached my area, turning left, and heading toward the town of stoney creek (south-east/east). my neighbourhood is on the border of stoney creek, and this object floated away over that town and out of sight. i captured a few photos of it with my mobile phone, but by the time i went into my apartment to get my phone and returned to the balcony with it, the object had moved further away, so the photos don't show it very well. i had no idea what this object was when i first noticed it, or when it sailed past my location. it looked like a large, rectangular, metallic box. how it was airborne, and how it remained so, completely puzzled and mystified me. i was talking on my house phone (cordless handset) with a friend while all of this was going on, and i remember just laughing slightly when i first saw it, telling her, \"holy crap... there's a ufo heading this way, and by that, i mean an unidentifiable flying object.\" then after it started to turn toward the east i said, \"well, now there's a large metallic, rectanglar box just sailing past this neighborhood... gonna grab my phone and take some photos.\" so i stepped inside, grabbed the phone, and took about a half-dozen photos, before it sailed too far away. i don't know how to describe my feelings at the time, really... nothing extraordinary, because i had no idea what this object could be. i was just really puzzled/curious, more than anything, because i couldn't figure out what it

(1 other time i did not) this world is truelly a more magical place than i ever new or expected.\r\n\r\n  in other news i think i have been abducted... not sure how many times.  i would like to find some help, but don't know where to go. i would like to be analyzed, may be try & go under hypnosis & seen by true professionals. to see if i'm not just having bad dreams & sleep paralysis...

have  occurred very fast while the cylinder remained parallel to the ground. 2-3 seconds later i could no longer see the object. the duration of the entire sighting was probably less than one
