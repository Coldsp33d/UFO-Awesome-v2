texas (which is approximately a 30 mile drive for us), my spouse and i saw unusual lights in the sky.\r\n\r\nwe were traveling south on hwy 183 and it was at approximately the 12 mile mark south of breckenridge, that i noticed a short string, of what appeared to be \"christmas lights\".  at this time of year that is certainly not unusual but what was, is that these lights were at some distance, located to our south/southwest and about 10 degrees above the horizon.  there is no hill there from my vantage point, no house and no towers.  the lights were clearly elevated some distance above the ground and may have been over, or near i-20, possibly west of cisco, texas.  at that distance it was hard to discern.\r\n\r\ni was in the passenger seat, so i leaned forward to get a better look through the windshield.  the lights were clearly visible for about 5 seconds, until my view was momentarily blocked by trees.  when we passed the stand of trees, i was able to see the lights again. unfortunately, another stand of trees again blocked my view and after only 4 or 5 seconds to clear the trees, the lights were gone.  they didn't just move away, they were simply gone.  total viewing time was about 10 seconds.\r\n\r\ni asked my husband if he saw the lights and he answered yes, however, he thought the lights might have been an aircraft, as he only got a glimpse of them.  he was having to pay attention to the road.\r\n\r\ni could not be so dismissive, as i had clearly seen the lights, which appeared to look like multicolored christmas lights in a slightly elliptical, horizontal pattern, as depicted in my illustration.\r\n\r\ni might also add that i had just emailed a friend before we left home, telling him that we might see a ufo. later, the lights appeared right after i thought to myself, \"ok, show yourselves.\"  evidently someone, or something heard me but they didn't show for long.\r\n\r\n1. we were driving to eastland, for a meeting.\r\n2. we noticed the object (lights) due to the fact that they suddenly appeared in the sky ahead of us and were quite distinct.\r\n3. i won't say what i thought it was but i can say what it wasn't.  it was not a conventional aircraft, an hallucination, venus, swamp gas, weather balloon or the goodyear blimp.\r\n4. the object hung in the sky, 10 degrees above the horizon.  it's lights flashed and/or rotated around it's outer perimeter.  the lights looked like multicolored christmas lights.  the object appeared to be disc shaped, seen edge on and slightly tilted.\r\n5. i was not surprised, as i knew it would be there, somewhere and we would see it.\r\n6. we watched it until we lost sight of it behind trees and then it was gone.  \r\n\r\ni did not have time to take a photo, therefore i am enclosing my depiction of what we saw.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

(the object was fairly stationary but i was having a hard time keeping it in focus with such a high zoom so the camera was moving around a lot)\r\n\r\ni zoomed in to take a look and all i could tell in my screen was a ball of orange light and saw it flashing a few times so i just kinda assumed it was a plane and i wasn't getting a focused picture.  i also filmed an airplane passing close to it which passed right over me.  as you can see, the plane was clearly a plane and the camera operated quite well.  it wasn't until i played the video back on my 50 inch high def television set that i realized what the object was.  this was about five days ago.  i toggled the whole video frame by frame and made some startling revelations as well which are only clear in particular frame.  my conclusion are as follows:\r\n\r\n 1.) it is clearly a saucer shaped object sitting atop a glowing fireball\r\n\r\n2.) near the end of the video around minute marker 2:18 it started flashing a white light.  in one particular frame at minute marker 2:20 the ufo is at the lower right of the screen and flashes or \"blips\" an image next to itself which looks like the object in black and white like a film negative.  even stranger in this frame, on my bigscreen you can clearly see a blue have above the object and inside the haze you can clearly see about eight houses and what appears to be two people standing in the front in the lower right of the haze.  i took a photo up close with my cellphone from the television screen of one of the houses and the people and emailed it to myself, and sure enough in full screen mode of my computer you can see a large white house, the outline of the roof and windows, and in the front the image of a long blond haird thin woma standing facing away from me and a man sitting in front of hear.  you can see this haze and the houses in a circular fashion in the video on the computer while watching the viseo, but only on the bigscreen is it large enough to make out the details.\r\n\r\ni concluded this might be a wormhole above the ufo that opened up when it blipped and the images inside it might be in another place and time.\r\n\r\nin other frames such as one in minute marker 1:07 it the craft is focused enough and the flames are subsided enough that you can see what appears to be windows in the ring near the top of the craft and on the bigsreen it appears to have 4 little white heads and bodies standing there.  i snapped a picture of this with my cellphone to and sent it to my email and it also looks very clearly to be heads and bodies inside the window.\r\n\r\n3.) from the frames that show the houses behind my house below the object you can see the object didn't travel very far across the sky in the two or three minutes i filmed it.  it seemed to be traveling much too slow to be any type of aircraft.  it seems it would have fallen out of the sky.\r\n\r\ni don't have anyway to send the video with this post because i dont have it in a form, other than you tube, to send it.\r\n\r\ni did send some pictures from my cellphone to the \"wilder\" woman from mufon, but she said she couldnt make anything out and she was going on a thirty day leave and to contact mufon directly.\r\n\r\ni did send the video via \"you tube to the email address for the director of mufon a few moments ago @ *(email address removed--cms/sg)  since this was one of the only ways i could figure out to get you the video and i asked him to forward it to you for my file.\r\n\r\nfeel free to contact me if you would like to research the actual video that is still located in my video camera in its original condition.\r\n\r\ni am anxious to see this object in more refined detail.  especially the objects in the wormhole and the heads and bodies in the windows\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

and red light flashing at the bottom of it. as we continued our conversation i kept my eye one it, because really there was nothing else to look at. my first thought was that it looked odd because it seemed to not move, but then again being in a car moving 70 mph can do that. at this point it was at my passenger window (my husband driving) i looked away and then looked back and was bewildered. the flashing light were gone and there were very bright golden colored lights flashing across the object. the lights moved clockwise, then counter-clockwise around the object. the object did not appear to be moving and was hovering in a field just above the tree line. the best way i could describe it was if you imagined light panels flashing across a disc. this would continue for a moment and then stop, followed by the green, blue and red flashing lights coming back on. i immediately told my husband to look and we watched it for about 2 minutes. there wasn't much traffic on i-4 but the cars around us slowed down, i could see the driver next to us looking at the object. we all slowed down to about 50 mph, which on a florida highway is rare. as we continued to drive the object moved farther and farther up, we watched it from miles away until we lost sight of it completely. i have never seen anything in the sky look like this. i am highly skeptical about ufos, and i think most things can be explained. this was nothing normal. whatever this was didn't mind being seen, or why else would it have been so close to a main highway on a friday night. it was very bizarre and of course now we are very curious as to what we saw. i wished we could have taken a picture but of course, the camera was in the truck with our luggage:(","distance":"101-500

i was next to my boyfriend.  i am familiar with the skyline and the stars, and spend a lot of time with my nexstar telescope looking at the sky from this exact location.  i was surprised to see, however, that there was what at first appeared to be a really large star where there had never been one before.  it was bright orange, round, and very large though i could tell from the horizon and the island that it was pretty far away from us.  at least a few miles off.\r\n\r\ni asked my boyfriend if he saw it and he said that he did.  at first i thought maybe it could be a star or a planet, because sometimes they appear quite large.  however both my boyfriend and i agreed that it was too big and way too bright to be a planet.  i stared at it with him for at least two minutes, and during that time the orange sphere hovered, then moved up and then down and then slightly up toward the south east direction, then stopped and hovered again.  \r\n\r\nat this point i was pretty frightened, so i ran to get my brothers.  they came to the window and we all watched it, where it hovered for a moment and then took off moving up into the air while racing towards the south east corner of the sky until it disappeared behind the clouds.  it moved faster than any flying object that i have ever seen, and it made absolutely no noise.  one of my brothers was particularly unnerved by how silent the craft was, especially because it moved so fast.  \r\n\r\nthe appearance was not like a fireball.  ive never believed in ufos or ufo sightings, but after we saw this we did some research into similar sightings.  unlike most others that see an orange ball, the sphere that i saw did not seem to be on fire or anything like that.  it didnt spark or change color either. instead, the sphere we saw was very bright, orange, and consistent in its brightness.  it was circular, and seemed to have relatively defined edges, though it was really far away.  it was the weirdest, creepiest thing i have ever seen.  \r\n\r\nafter it sped away, and disappeared, it did not come back.  but some weird things started happening after it was gone, on the canadian side across the river.  first, the wind picked up like crazy, blowing from the north east/ east toward the south west/west and it was blowing so hard that our windows were rattling in the wind.  the wind actually made waves appear on the river.\r\n\r\nalso, after the sphere sped off, a bunch of strange white lights began to blink on and off across the inland area of the canadian inland that we can see from the window.  they looked like those lights on towers that blink to warn airplanes, but they were much shorter and the light was white not red.  the canadian area is an indian reservation and the part of the reservation where the lights were blinking is only sparsely inhabited and mostly just used for fishing and hunting (the residents live elsewhere on  as it is a really big area).  i didnt even know there were lights on that part of the reservation to blink, as i have never seen them before (and i have been living in the area for 18 years).\r\n\r\neven weirder, downriver a spotlight or flood light kept flashing from what appeared to be a boat out on the water.  i looked through binoculars but could not tell if the light was from a boat on the water or from a house that is right on the river's edge on the canadian shore further to the south east.  the light blinked on and off sporadically with no discernible pattern.  i have never seen anything like it, though i think i should mention that we are relatively near to selfridge air force base.  mind you, this was thanksgiving and it was 2 in the morning, and it was freezing cold outside. \r\n\r\nlastly, and it was my boyfriend who pointed this out, there was a weird absence of freighters before and after the appearance and disappearance of the sphere.  typically, a lot of freighters come by on the st claire river, even in november (they dont usually stop running, if ever, until january or until the ice is too thick).  they come by on average every 15 minutes to 30 minutes.  thanksgiving evening, just a few hours before the sighting, had been particularly busy with freighters and i remember that because my cousin kept calling out every time a freighter went by all throughout thanksgiving dinner and into the evening.  however, from 130 am to at least 30-40 minutes after the sighting (roughly 3 am or 3:10 am), not a single freighter, or any boat went by. we fell asleep around 3 and so there may not have been another freighter for an even longer period, though i can't confirm that.\r\n\r\ni have never never seen anything like this before. i was so freaked out, i had to take a sleeping pill to actually go to sleep.  i know that i am not crazy or imagining things though, because my brothers saw it and my boyfriend did too.  in the morning, we looked up ufo thanksgiving 2010 on youtube and someone from portland oregon posted a video of a sphere very similar to what we saw the same night, all the way across the united states in michigan.  the coincidence is uncanny.","distance":"Over One

stood in front yard. across the street about 30 feet above the neighbors house was a ufo. it was fairly large, about the size of 1.5 school buses. it was a disc. the dome on top was more square like, sort of like a top hat but a little shorter. the craft was black. the dome had large windows that took up nearly all of the dome. there were lights on inside and i could see dark shadowy humanlike figures looking out at me. there was no noise. there was no visible means of how it was hovering at maybe 1 or 2 mph. there was a distinct calmness in the air or atmosphere that surrounded the craft

next door was standing in the yard staring at this object also. she also seemed to move very slow and animated. she was an elderly woman visiting from germany and spoke no english. as i looked away from this woman to again look at the ufo it wasn't there. things (sight and atmosphere) had cleared up and stuff was moving at normal speed again. i thought it had left, or i was seeing things. but a quick glance down the street and it was there moving very slowly over somebody elses house. maybe five or six houses away. i have only told this story to about seven people, mostly family. my

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This event took place in or around 1974, when i was in my mid teens. i have verbally told many people about it over the years, but have never put it down in writing till now, which is strange since i am a professional biography writer by career, also publishing paperbacks in the self-help genre.\r\n\r\nthe location was corby, northants, england. i'd been at a friend's house on occupation rd, and had cycled back to my home in argyll st, about half a mile away. i'd been putting my bike in the shed at the back of the house, and had been scanning the sky as was my habit. even then (and still the case today) i was a very keen aviation enthusiast. i was a senior nco in 422 sqdn air training corps, and often represented the sqdn in aircraft recognition. in those days i could identify just about every aircraft type flying!\r\n\r\non that occasion, i noticed a triangular formation of lights moving across the night sky from north to south. my natural assumption was that i was viewing an airliner as the speed across the sky would have been consistent with viewing a large aircraft at typical operating altitude in the fl360 area. it was a very clear night, and the moon was full and sitting high in the western sky. \r\n\r\ni noticed that the projected flightpath of these lights would take it very close to the bright full moon, so i decided to run into the house, grab my 20x50 binoculars, and wait to see if the aircraft would cross the face of the moon, thus allowing me a very clear silhouette by which to identify the type of aircraft. when i was in the house i told my dad about it, and he also came out to look.\r\n\r\nwhen i came back outside, probably no more than 20-30 seconds after flying through the door on the run, i quickly found the lights again, and confirmed they were likely to cross the moon. i found them in the binoculars but was unable to see the aircraft shape, i also noticed the lights were white and steady, not flashing or coloured as i might have expected some to be on an aircraft. i remember moving my view to the left to see the full moon, and then back to the lights, and then, knowing they were going to converge, watching only the moon.\r\n\r\nplease remember that at this moment my expectation was to see a clear outline of a conventional aircraft against the bright, clear, full moon. what happened next has burned itself so clearly into my memory that it is as if it happened yesterday. while viewing the moon, at 20x power, it took up much of the viewfinder, but with enough black sky around it to clearly see \"entry\" and \"exit\" points where the aircraft would cross the surface. i knew it would be quick, but i had enough confidence in my identification ability that i knew i'd get the type of aircraft.\r\n\r\ni watched the lights come into view from the right, but instead of giving a clear outline of an aircraft, those lights disappeared behind the surface of the moon. i continued to watch through the binoculars for maybe another five or ten seconds, but those lights never did re-appear to the left of the moon. i removed the binoculars from my eyes and scanned the clear night sky where an aircraft lights should have been if i had been watching an aircraft, it was gone.\r\n\r\nboth my late father and i were amazed at what we had seen, i moreso because i had witnessed this through the 20x50 binoculars. we both looked for the lights for several minutes but to no avail.\r\n\r\nthe next day, during classes at school, the best friend i had visited that night told me that he had seen something strange in the sky after i had left. he described the exact scenario i have outlined above, but he brought up the subject, not me. we had independently seen the same thing, without communication, even though we were at our respective homes in town, a good half mile apart.\r\n\r\nover the years i have often reflected on that sighting. it was my first ufo event. i have had several others since then, but nothing so amazing as what i witnessed in those mid teenage years. i was a credible, level-headed witness with a background in identifying aircraft types. i had expected to see nothing out of the ordinary, i had been using professional standard binoculars that had once belonged to the manager of the england football team, and my sighting was confirmed by my dad who watched it with me, and my buddy who saw it independently.\r\n\r\nthe speed of those lights must have been phenomenal as they crossed space and disappeared behind the surface of the moon. the deceleration must have been greater than our known technology even now would allow for. was it three objects or one? my impression has always been three, because the size of one object would have been unimaginable. i had no doubt as to my impression that these were controlled craft, then or now.  it was an amazing, perspective-altering sighting, which even now leaves more questions than it provides answers.

there wasn't a lot of sky visible. one night about 11:00 pm when i was approximately 11 years old,i started looking at the sky out my front bedroom window. i sadly thought to myself, \"i want to go

noticed a dark object flying toward us.  at first i thought it was a large bird then a kite, but as it went over head you could see it was a triangle with a dim light at each corner.  it was blocking out the stars as it went over. you could see the actual shape was a triangle with a notch out of the back.  i  thought perhaps it was a stealth bomber, only it was low to the ground and made no noise. it moved slow like you imagine a ufo would.  my wife is pretty hard to impress and she was like you need to contact those mufon people it was so real. the next day you rationalize it and say it was nothing just a plane or something, we will never know.  that was late october. then in late november about the same time 9:45 pm i see another triangular shaped craft. same flight pattern, only it had more lights this time, and before it could disappear from sight it made a hard left turn impossible for a plane.  i was shocked and couldn't believe my eyes. i ran in the house, told my wife and ran back out looking for it.  i never saw anything else but it was so real. i was uneasy about seeing a actual ufo. i tried to rationalize it again by thinking it must be a drone aircraft, maybe a new stealth model they are testing over southeastern oklahoma?  not too long after that, news reports came out of sightings that weren't too far away. i was encouraged to write this report. i hope it helps other people that have seen it to know they are not crazy, i saw it too.
