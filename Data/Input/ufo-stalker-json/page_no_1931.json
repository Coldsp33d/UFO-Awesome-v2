altitude to be about 10,000-12,000 feet. we were at roughly 4000 feet in elevation. that airplane had come over the mountain and had been in view for about 90 seconds. following the same path as the plane there appeared a sphere of pure white extremely bright light. it came over the mountain and covered roughly 3 miles in about 1/2 a second. it stopped or more accurately slowed to match the speed of the plane instantly a short distance behind it. the sphere appeared to be roughly about the same size as the airplane or maybe a little larger. we all watched in pure amazement as the sphere followed the airplane for the next few minutes over the horizon and out of view. this thing went from a few thousand miles an hour to about a hundred miles an hour in an instant. all i could think about was that the pilot had no idea what was happening as there are no rear view mirrors in airplanes. many years later i told this story to a friend who said he saw the same event from about 5 miles further to the east.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

angeles, california. shortly after we had arrived in late march of 1976, we drove down to the beach city of venice by the ocean just south of santa monica to drop one friend off for a radio interview at a local radio station somewhere between 7:30 and 8pm. as i parked to let my friend out,..My car was facing north toward the santa monica pier with all it's colorful rides and the pacific ocean was directly on my left, the driver's side.\r\n\r\nas my friend got out of the car, i happened to look out my window to the left  (the window was rolled down) and commented to the others how clear the california sky looked with all the stars glistening when suddenly, among those stars, there appeared to be quite a large, moving object which immediately gave clear indications by the nature of it's movement that this was not just an ordinary flying object, but one with \"extreme\" maneuvering abilities to move either quickly right to left and then back and forth very quickly in a controlled and \"darting\" fashion. it had several bright and glistening blue-green lights and was shaped like an oval, sphere-like object. because the western sky was so clear that night, this object was easy to view, although it was very high in the sky approximately at a 60 to 75 degree angle up from the ground where i was in my car and out over the pacific ocean just off the venice california coastline.\r\n\r\ni recall immediately shouting to the others to please witness what i was seeing and two of the others acknowledged what i was seeing. we watched as it did it's unearthlike maneuvers in the sky (all done in a relatively short and very local space in the sky) for just a few moments more. it all took place in less than 3 minutes and then,...Suddenly, just after it stood still hovering in one place, it tore off faster than anything imaginable darting like a comet's tail to the south of where we were and disappearing clean out of sight. just imagine an object travelling from right to left in the sky in less than a fraction of a second. nothing known to mankind moves that fast. \r\n\r\nin contrast to this vessel were two other planes in the sky....One a jet and the other a small local plane. the speed that this object travelled was so fast in contrast to the jet in the sky that it made the jet appear to move like a sloth.\r\n\r\nall of us were amazed to have witnessed this unusual event and, i might add,...None of us were drinking, stoned or in any way other than totally straight. we are all college grads and at the time 28 years of age having just arrived in california. to this day, (i'm 62 yrs old now) i remember the event like it was yesterday because it was witnessed in a short time, in incredibly clear skies and i was of a totally clear mind. it was a clean and bright vessel and it travelled at enormously fast speeds and could stop on a dime and simply hover back and forth.\r\n\r\nall i knew was that we/i had just witnessed something never before seen by my human eyes and that nothing could have ever moved that fast from a standing position. hey ...This was not just another day on the planet earth. i've seen nothing even close to this amazing incident/sighting since then....But i will always have this to compare things to in the event it ever happens again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26893,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0022744,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12082010-0005","longitude":-118.4648076,"occurred":198316800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,

corn is about 6 feet high. about 9:30pm. time was important because i had promised to bring her home by midnight and home was about an hour away. gorgeous night, cloudless, bright stars. visibility probably 20-25 miles. so pretty, we continue to stay in our seats and stare at the sky in front of us. within a few minutes, we (i?) notice dim light on the horizon, proceeding left to right, same speed. am guessing it was the first satellite i ever saw. we watch it slowly disappear over the horizon to the right. for some reason, we continue to watch the night sky directly in front of us, still sitting in the car, though we are 'on the clock'.\r\n\r\nfew minutes later, notice another light, brighter, starting from similar position as previous object in the far left sky (i do not know which compass direction we were facing). same path over horizon, same steady motion as first object, except this object's light is brighter. when object reaches mid-point of our field of vision, it seems to stop. we wait in silence for object to continue left to right movement. it does not continue. however, it seems to be getting brighter.\r\n\r\nafter a minute or so, i realize that the object is moving and it is becoming brighter because it is heading straight towards us. estimate the object was 4-5 miles away when girlfriend and i become agitated; not exactly frightened but upset that this thing is headed our way. looking back, it was an odd initial response.\r\n\r\nshe looks at me and says we have to leave. i start car and reverse out of the field (we were about 50 yards in) and onto road heading back to new brunswick. should be about a 10-15 minute drive to get back to route 27, out of franklin park farmland and back into town.\r\n\r\ni accelerate to a high rate of speed (60-70?)on winding roads to get away. my girlfriend turns her passenger door mirror up to sky, and surprise, surprise, the object has arrived and stays right behind us in the center of her mirror.\r\n\r\nnow my agitation turns quickly to fear and then to anger. what am i running from? why am i running? it's probably a helicopter having some fun with us. i see a farmhouse up on the left (i'm not stopping in the middle of the road) and pull into the driveway behind an old 40s ford or chevy black pickup. there's just enough room to get off the road and behind the truck.\r\n\r\nfarmhouse is front right, truck in front of me, an 7'-8' hedgerow running the left of the driveway. i remember opening the door, placing my left foot on the ground to step out of the car, while looking up to sky above the hedgerow to where the object should be. i remember a bright light behind the hedgerow. i remember looking up to scan the sky and my memory ending at the top of the hedgerow.  \r\n\r\nmy next memory we are in the car, not talking, driving towards a t roadway stop sign (our road ends and you can either turn left or right) at which we will make a right and then be back on 27 in a 1/2 mile. as i pull up to the stop sign she says 'there they are'. i look out my window on the driver's side and see it.\r\n\r\nit was a perfectly round, smooth saucer. surface looked like brushed stainless steel. no windows. perfectly smooth. i'm looking at the bottom of 50' - 60' saucer, about 30' over me. the bright white light was bottom center. i later remembered a red light at one edge and green at the exact opposite edge. about 10 years later i met a usaf test pilot through a mutual friend. told him about the sighting. he believed my story (a bit too easily i thought) and thought the object to be terrestrial because of the red & green lights on the aircraft. \r\n\r\nno sound that i can remember. no wind or breeze. it hovered over us and then slowly moved across the street (more farmland). now i can see full craft; top and bottom are identical shape and surface material. i estimate middle top to middle bottom about 20'.\r\n\r\ni make the right and can see the traffic light on route 27 up the road. i follow along with craft (it follows us?) on our left. it has now lowered itself to just above ground, but moving with us about 40' away. my speed is normal. i'm no longer concerned about it. i lose sight of it behind a strand of trees and bushes running along the road; when we reach an opening there's no sight of it - but i have no interest in stopping to see where it went.\r\n\r\ni pull up and stop at the traffic light on 27. it's a long light. we don't say a word until my girlfriend notices a crack in the windshield; passenger side, it's a jagged crack about 3 inches up and 4 inches over. she excitedly points out the it wasn't there at the start of the evening.\r\n\r\nwe then notice the time on the car clock is 11:22pm. as this was all happening around 9:30pm, we should been at this traffic light about an hour earlier, even with the stop - which at the time, i did not remember that i had stopped. that memory came back to me later.\r\n\r\nclocks were unreliable on american cars in the seventies, so we confirmed the time when we got home. the car's clock was correct.\r\n\r\nwe discussed it later only once and only to confirm that we saw the craft directly over us and what it looked like.\r\n\r\nwent back once trying to find the farmhouse. i did not find it. i was never very interested in returning to the area.\r\n\r\nlater that year saw 'close encounters of the third kind'. no nightmares, no desire to head towards a meeting point and no after effects that i could point to other than a lifetime interest in ufos. \r\n\r\nwe later broke up and i have not seen her in over 30 years. but the sighting still seems as if it happened last week.\r\n\r\n

were in a large wide open hay field. to the south of us about a 1/4 mile was a ridge line approximately 500 feet in elevation running east to west and separating our town (very rural) from the next; sparta twnsp. at about 10:00 p.M., all three of us noticed three separate lighted objects hovering overtop this ridge. we could not make out the shapes as it was very dark but clear that night. all three objects were far enough apart that it could not have been one object or so we thought. as we watched for roughly 5 minutes and with no sound (no sounds that night at all except peepers), the 3 objects simultaniously started to rise vertically at an easterly direction for some distance. all three stopped for a matter of a few seconds then raised higher vertically at a westerly direction. not hardly a split second later, all three in a straight line flew west at a high rate of speed and disappeared out of sight. i knew then that these were not conventional aircraft as i weekly went with my father to the local airport to fly each sunday afternoon. i have kept this to myself all these years and through my beliefs and the world wide reports coming in daily, i felt it was time to tell my story. i know to some that it may seem a little far fetched but my two friends saw them too. lastly, through my interest of the subject, what really bothers me is at that time, there was a large sheep ranch on the other side of that ridge. animal abduction going on? never thought of it; never heard of missing sheep; who knows? i hope my 2 friends may read this and verify my story. i had used their nicknames to keep them anonymous. i lost touch with both after high school in 1970. thank you mufon for giving me this

outside and while she sniffs around for the perfect spot to go, i always gaze up at the sky.\r\nas soon i looked up i saw a low flying, small airplane in the sw sky. right next to the plane was another craft that did not have the same lighting as the plane. we live in airport community and we are also along the flight path of several commercial jets flying in and out of tampa. needless to say, we are very used to seeing planes of all kinds and can find at least 3 of them flying over at any given time.\r\nthe small plane was flying from n to s. this other \"craft\" was flying in the opposite direction and appeared to have passed the airplane at one point. all that was visible of this other object was a large yellowish-orange light that flashed on and off slowly, nowhere near as fast as faa lights on planes. this light was the only light or part of this craft that was visible.There was no noise, that we could tell. (my husband was called outside to witness this craft as well). we estimated this object as flying at a 5,000-7,000 ft altitude.\r\nniether of us could identify what it was as it did not look at all like anything we had ever seen in the sky before. we eventually lost sight of the craft over the treeline as it flew to the north.\r\n\r\nthe second sighting took place on friday, december 3rd.\r\nagain, it was just before 7pm and i had taken the dog outside. as usual, i looked to the sky.\r\nin the western sky at that time are two brighter stars that sit paralell to one another at approx 20- 30 degrees apart. i was looking in this direction when i noticed a third star-like light in between these two stars. i thought it looked unusual because i didn't recall ever seeing three stars in a row before.\r\nas i watched, suddenly, the middle star faded out of existence, as though it heard my thoughts that it looked out of place. i continued to watch for several more minutes but it never reappeared.\r\n\r\nthe third sighting was last night, december 5th.\r\nonce again, just before 7pm, i took the dog out. because of the sighting i had just a few nights prior, i looked to that section of the sky. there was no third star.\r\nmy gaze went to another set of stars that appear to form a triangle with a fourth star in the middle of the bottom section but a little but higher than the two lower corners. (this star arrangement is a bit to the north and a little higher than the previous described stars from friday night.)\r\nas i looked at this triangular star formation, i saw another star-like light appear to the left of the triangle. it flew toward the right side of the formation for a short distance before it it disappeared. like friday's sighting, this light also just went out.\r\ni became extrememly excited knowing that i wasn't seeing something mundane. i waited and watched a few more minutes when siddenly, to the right of the triangle star formation and about 20 degrees to the north of the right most edge of it, another light (which i believe may have been the same light that had just disappeared due to this appearing along the same flight path) appeared suddenly and darted so fast to the right that it left a streak of silvery light behind it before it disappeared once again. the streak was not a contrail but the light from this object due to the speed at which it flew. the streak faded away quickly after the light disappeared. the speed of this object was unimaginable and there is no way any human could survive movement like that. this was also not a shooting star, as i have seen plenty of them and this was totally different.\r\n\r\nafter seeing this object move so fast, i took the dog inside and grabbed my nightvision scope in hopes of seeing this object again and possibly tracking it. i spent nealry 20 minutes outside scouring the sky but was not able to find this object again.\r\n\r\nthere is no way for me to estimate the altitude of the last two sightings but, from their appearance i would say they were pretty high up in the atmosphere. i was very excited after viewing each object, especially the last two.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

the southern sky, fairly low, about as bright as venus would be. my first thought was that it was just a plane or helicopter, but i realized something about the twinkling and blinking of the light was not quite like anything i'd seen before. it would twinkle brightly with a whitish light and then there would be dimmer lights (also seeming to twinkle) which seemed to have more color to them. i could not distinguish if they were the conventional red & green of a plane- just that they weren't the same bright white. i think the thing that was most odd was that the sequence of the lights seemed completely random. the bright (white) light seemed to be \"on\" for anywhere from 1 to 5 seconds, and \"off\" for a similar irregular interval. when \"on,\" it would change quite a bit in intensity. at first, i'd had an impression the light was sort of rotating or spinning around something, but then it just seemed to random. i opened the door and took a step outside and couldn't hear any engine noise, though as bright as the light was, it seemed i should have been able to hear something- however, there was interference noise from inside the house and it was a bit breezy. it was also overcast and showery (though not raining at that moment). i could see a layer of clouds above and/or beyond the light, but the light itself was in the clear. the object moved in a smooth straight line, seemingly towards the southeast, not going up or down in elevation that i could see. it seemed to me to be somewhat slower than a plane generally would be, but i suppose that could have been an illusion. after a couple of minutes, my view became blocked by my neighbors' house (and then trees and hills). before the light caught my attention i had been happily watching \"the walking dead\" on tv, so i'd just like to note that this light did look so unusual to me that i felt compelled to duck out on several minutes of the season finale to investigate. that being said, i suppose my initial thoughts were probably correct, and it was either a plane or helicopter whose lights for some reason just looked very odd. i did try to look up info on identifying aircraft by their lights (particularly why the blinking would have been so random), but did not find much- at least not enough to completely convince me, so that's why i wrote this report.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

passenger and before hitting the george washington bridge, i noticed a bright star then i noticed a cloud to the bottom right that looked peculiar due to the fact that weather.Com was reporting no clouds in the area 20 minutes prior, other stars were highly visible.  \r\n\r\nthe \"cloud\" must have been huge, from my point of view it was as long as my thumb and i would suspect it was several miles away.  i told my wife and she was trying to see but she was focused on driving.  it was a little rough to keep a constant view as there were a lot of street lights but between them i could clearly see that the object looked like a squished pyramid, with a very well defined bottom portion.  the upper part may have been more illuminated due to the moon/skylight and gave a very dark purple (to me it had the color of a fluffy cloud at night) but the bottom was pitch black and it looked way to well defined to be a coincidence. \r\n\r\njudging by the relation to the star i was keeping in view as something to base any movement on, it was stationary for at least 5 minutes.  around 21:08 we took a curve that had a lot of trees in the way and a light, the view was obstructed for no more than 10 seconds and upon the star coming back into view the object was completely gone.  i kept an eye on the area and scanned around to see where it could have \"floated\" if it was a cloud and it was 100% gone. \r\n\r\nit was a cold, crisp, clear night with great visibility.  winds wnw @ 10mph 49% humidity, dew point 15 degrees, visibility 10 miles.  i am a prior service army medic and i tried to rule out several things but i am certain this was a physical object under intelligent control due to the sudden vanishing.  something that large does not stay stationary for so long then completely vanish in less than 10 seconds.","distance":"Over One

began to notice something very strange. all of the dead pelicans were exactly about a quarter from each other all lined up on the left side of the bridge with other birds around the body. scary thing was... the bodies were not mangled at all. almost like they just fell from the sky and were strategically placed like that. this went on for a while  but before we exited the bridge when we saw lights in the water shaped like a diamond. the colors were blue then red and then seemed to rotate and move around then dissappear. i was freaked out bc while off the bridge you still have a good visual of the water. and,the lights were still there. if anyone was in the va area that night you may remember that the sky was really clear and there was seemingly more stars out.  the connection btw the pelicans and the lights were more than a coincedence. i hope there is someone out there who can back me up. from what ive read there was numerous sightings that night.
