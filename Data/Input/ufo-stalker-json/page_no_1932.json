and lots of planes and helicopters. but i have also saw on 5 occations from then till now a weird white (a little bit to bright) light normal size for a regular plane but without the wing or tail lights. always flying from the sw to ne direction with no sound. there are biplanes here as we have an airshow every year. so i these could explain the strange lights. but what i saw tonight has left me stunned. i was sitting listening to my ipod and heard a weird fizzing and poping noise, i 1st thought it was my ipod but realized i could heard it in my left ear without the earphone in. i also felt a throbing hum in my stomach before it replaced the fizzing popping. which was coming from my right (sw). i looked up and to my right saw a glowing red/orange toadstool of molton lava, sprewing and dripping in all directions, the inside was dark and shaped like a cats eye (horizonal)but not black, but empty,is the only way i can discribe it. it seemed to moving like liquid and flew to the north, it looked about 5-6 hundred yards away doing 50mph ish. the seemed to be some sort of short thin cloud at a 45 degree angle 1 and ahalf its lengh, pointing to the ground. at this point nextdoors dog when crazy barking and yelping.It must have been about a minute of me watching its lazy flight it wobbled as it flew. all the time i felt and heard the hum. something snapped me out of it and probably nextdoor shouting at the dog. i wondered if i had enough time to run in for my camera, the thing was slowly arching to the nw. i ran and got my camera and draged the wife out but it had got to far away for my camera to pic up, and my wife didnt get a good look. sunderland, silksworth 10/04/10 10ish before match of the day","distance":"501 Feet - 1

each slowly moving, but not all in the same direction or from the same radiant as a meteor, of closely similar brightness.  it produced the effect of a cloud of slowly diffusing particles of light.  i'm estimating each to be at about -4 to -5 magnitude, very bright.  some of them flickered very slightly.\r\n\r\nthe points were all bright when i first saw them, and over about 45 seconds, each one faded in turn until none were left.  the lights were ssw of my address [coordinates moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg] in north-central austin in the hyde park neighborhood, and at a very low (angular) altitude, perhaps 10-15 degrees, and visible through a gap in the trees. \r\n\r\ni have only a vague impression that they looked to be over austin downtown or at least ut, but only having magnitude and not really any clues from movement characteristics, it might have been farther (but i don't think closer).\r\n\r\nmy brother was leaving my house to go home, and we were standing on caswell ave. talking, and directly toward campus on that street in a gap between the trees (ssw).  i caught movement out of the corner of my eye and saw the lights.  my first quick impression was of a bunch of fireworks slowly dissipating as they normally do, but over a much longer period of time and definitely not falling from the sky.  nor did it seem to be like an exploding plane or helicopter because the lights were two uniform and very pointlike, and there was no residue in the sky of any explosion event.  it did not at all look like a meteorite fireball because of the slow lingering and very slow movement of each \"star\" in non-uniform directions.\r\n\r\ni am an amateur astronomer and have seen a number of unusual atmospheric and optical phenomena, so i'm not an

at that point i knew i was seeing unconventional craft for sure, nothing i'm aware of can move that distance across the sky in a perpendicular direction to their direction of travel, literally just in the moment of several seconds each time!! i left the atm and turned back my direction and didn't see them anymore, but it seemed that the \"plane\" ufo had also gone backwards when it last switched sides, where the \"plane\" object had become a larger relative size to the same size as the \"helicopter\" object!!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26849,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6347925,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12042010-0008","longitude":-90.1943142,"occurred":1291344000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,   Triangle,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1291520406000,"summary":"Two triangles move and change unconventionally over st. louis","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"St Louis, Missouri","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:82785"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Thousand Oaks","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On 2010 dec 03 about 930 pm while enjoying a back yard camp fire in thousand oaks california near the 23fwy at avenida de los flores we noticed a light in the eastern sky which appeared to be the same color and brightness as a yellowish fog street light. it was flying toward us (west ward) it then zig-zagged then flew straight again, then zig-zagged again. it almost appeared to be a flame fired toy balloon but it was too bright \r\nand with the speed and the sudden turns any flame would have been extinguished. it made no noise at all and in about 2 minutes it suddenly gained altitude faded to a red dot then vanished. i live under the flight path to lax and this light flew across the flight path around or just below the altitude the jumbo jets fly. the clouds were moving slowly, there was very little wind and there were no aircraft seen in the area. using google earth and measuring from the mountain it appeared to fly over it seemed\r\nto travel about 5.5 miles in about the 2 minutes we observed it.  i think it could have been what is known as an earthquake light. there were power lines under the center of it's path but it was very high in comparison to the lines. if it was a flame fired toy balloon the person who set it aloft could have started a brush fire.

around 15 mph. as it passed above the streetlight in front of my home (at this point we were in the street watching it amazed) i saw what i interpreted to be the glint of light off of a metal

saw a very bright round orange light to the north, but upon getting closer to the house i could not see the location of where it had been due to trees. in taking out the dogs from the house just moments later, though, i felt nervously compelled to take the camera out with me. as soon as i got outside, i saw an object which had an easily discernable dark triangle shape, but seemed somewhat rounded in the back. it had 3 solid bight white lights on the back, with a red blinking light on each side of these 3 lights, and seemed to have a dull solid white light on the front point. it came from the north, traveling south/southwest, and was at a height much lower than the average commercial aircraft, certainly less than 5,000 feet. i could not tell its true size, but a nickel at arm���s length would have easily covered it. it seemed to move a little slower compared to the usual aircraft sighted in the area, and may have emitted a faint rumbling sound, but i���m not sure.   the path of this object was nearly identical to a triangle object which i saw on august 9, 2007 and reported earlier this year. the sky was very dark and completely clear of any cloud cover. it should be noted that all commercial flights in this area travel from either east to west or west to east, at a much higher altitude, and do not have the pattern of lights that i saw on this object. duration of the sighting was less than 30 seconds before it just seemed to fade away, perhaps due to distance.\r\n \r\ni took 5 pictures with a new sony cybershot 14.1 mega pixels camera. the first one picture, numbered 00441 on the camera, shows the object's lights, although the image is small. the odd thing is that this first picture, #00441, did not download from the camera to the computer, even though i downloaded all of the camera���s images three times. the other 4 shots did download and all were just black. the first picture is still viewable in the camera.  the only other time that this camera and its download malfunctioned at all was in a sighting report i made of an orange light which occurred on september 23, 2010.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

(that was very eerie).\r\nat that time i had a volvo model 960t with a sun roof so i just sat and looked up through it . what i saw is still fresh in my memory after all those years.\r\nabout a 150 meters east of the junction there are bunch of residential buildings (about 15 story high). \r\nin front of one of the buildings about the 14 th floor hovered something which looked like a bright star as big a little truck.\r\nthe best way to describe it is ��� a bright star ��� which is moving in a frenzy \r\nto almost all directions at once, changing hundreds of colors in a millisecond (from blue to green to orange to even what seemed like gold and silver).\r\nthe object was clearly in front of the building, and while emitting \"rays\" of light all over it did not project on the building behind it . \r\nthe object was \"making a show\" for us ���moving up and down like a crazy firefly. i could not take my eyes of it . and nor could i make a sound .\r\nsuddenly in a blink of an eye, the object \"leaped\" about 50 meters upwards and vanished behind the building only to re-appear a second later pointing further to the east. \r\nas soon as the object got further away from us ��� many people jumped in their cars and shouted \"lets chase him!\" , and drove madly after his flight course further to the east .\r\ni geared my car and  said to myself i gotta get my friends to see this  or they would never believe me. i drove in ridicules speed about 9 k\"m to the north  to my friend's house, grabbed them out of their beds and hurled them to the car,  we drove \r\nback to \"ramat aviv\" junction, two ladies were still standing there, we asked them bluntly \"which way the ufo went?\" and they pointed east. \r\nwe turned east and drove another 2.5 k\"m until we reached one of the bridges that are crossing the \"ayalon highway\". (kakal bridge),\r\nthe bridge ( a 3 lane from each side type) was already full of people , border police , light army units, and even tv crews! \r\nthe crowd faced north, we dumped the car on the sideway and run to the ledge of the bridge , and looked north as well.\r\nwe saw the \"bright star\" hanging about 60 meters above the traffic, as if it was a lamp hanging from a ceiling. this time it was bigger, it didn���t change color, and was just hovering silently. this continued for a few minutes.\r\ni stood about 20 meters from an army jeep and i saw the border police soldiers (about 6 of them) pointing their guns towards the object.\r\nthen i heard the officer say to one of the corporals \"tell them not to do anything (with the guns) ..\".\r\nan nco that stood by said: \"what are you trying to do? start the war of the worlds?\" (it was not a women like the below report say).\r\na few minutes later the object suddenly sprinted up and away like that fastest rocket i have ever seen. until it became a bright red star. \r\nme and my friends hanged around for a couple of cigarettes, looking up , than the red star made a sharp right turn and vanished.\r\nthe next day the main newspapers covered it and the headlines said:\r\n\" a ufo in tel aviv`s sky \" and described about 15% of what really occurred .\r\nthe chief of police said it was \" a kite that had a stick light attached to it���or probably a children`s hoax\"\r\n (yeah right, during my army service i could spot the rear light of a bell206 a cobra or a mig27 from miles away with no night goggles ���.I am pretty sure this wasn���t a kite.).\r\nthis was a very public sighting and a very direct ufo encounter-but strangely enough ��� it almost has no records on the net.\r\nthe only difference is that i saw it with my own eyes .\r\np\\s\r\ni wasn`t aware of the ufo subject at all at that time !\r\n.\r\nthis is the report i found on the net today:\r\nhovering ufo causes traffic jam in tel aviv\r\nat 2 a.M. on tuesday, september 17, 1996, traffic on high road in the ramat aviv section of tel aviv, israel came to a sudden stop as motorists abandoned their cars to watch a hovering ufo. tel aviv police received dozens of calls about a \"light-emitting ufo\" doing aerial loops over the northern end of the city. according to the daily newspaper ma'ariv, police spokesman gadi doron said officers reported seeing \"a strange light in the night sky,\" along with hundreds of motorists at the scene.\r\nas the onlookers watched, a soldier of the border police offered to shoot at the object. other members of the crowd disagreed vehemently. one woman said, \"what are you trying to do? start an interstellar war?\"\r\nabout an hour before dawn, the ufo stopped \"doing tricks\" and headed east, parallel to the avenue shaul hamelech. enthusiastic motorists attempted to follow in their cars. then the ufo reversed direction, flew back to ramat aviv and gradually disappeared.\r\nin their story, the newspaper ma'ariv listed 16 recent ufo incidents in israel.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26837,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.066157,"location":null,"logNumber":"IL-12032010-0005","longitude":34.777821,"occurred":842943600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

and i heard a jet coming fairly low from behind us. we both turned around to see the jet. a popular tree blocked our view. we then turned back around and the craft was gone. their was plenty of sky

house in the mountains with my dog (extremely smart australian shepard) after work at around 10:00 pm. at 11:30 i went into the kitchen to make something to eat and as i was washing my hands at the sink i saw 2 flashes of blue light through the sliding glass door in the back yard out of the corner of my eye. i didnt think much of it and went over to the stove. so now im facing the sliding glass window and as i look up i see another flash except this time its in my direct vision and my dog sees it too, perks her ears up and starts growling. as i stand there, kind of in shock, i see 2 more flashes all within 15-20 seconds of each other. so as my dog and i are standing there staring out the into the darkness, after what felt like maybe a minute after seeing the lights, both my dog and i hear a loud bang come from one of the bedrooms upstairs. i immediately call 911 and head straight into my mom and dads room to grab a gun. dispatch tells me to stay in the room and hide somewhere to wait for the police to arrive and not even 30 seconds later i hear the police cars pull into the driveway so i put the gun away and crawl out the window to meet them (yes i grabbed my dog too). the officers searched the house and the surrounding area for a good 20 minutes and find nothing. here's where it gets weird, as im telling one of the officers about the lights 2 other officers, who were standing over at thier car talking to each other, immediatley walk over to me and start asking me questions about them, what did they look like, what color were they, what shape were they, ect... so i ask the officers why they're so interested and they tell me that they have had numerous calls throughout the past year regarding the exact same thing, and apparently another officer (who wasnt there) had seen them recently too.\r\nnow keep in mind that this area is in the denver metro foothills where every house sits on about and acre of land and in my parents case, the nearest house is over a mile away and the back yard is litteraly a forest. \r\nbut its now 1:05 am as im writing this and i havent heard or seen a single thing since the police arrived about an hour ago. \r\n\r\nwhat i thought the lights were at first, was that it was a flashlight from someone trespassing, then once i heard the bang i thought for sure that they had broken in. only when i saw that look on the officers face when i was describing it did i realize this was something else. thinking back to it now it doesnt make any sense that it would be a flashlight because when the flashes would occur it had no motion, the light was solid. the lights would just shine in place for a second or two, then go away. and the bang sound, i really dont know how to describe. it was as if someone dropped a heavy box or something in one of the bedrooms, and to be honest im still to affraid to go in there and see if anything is out of place. \r\ni dont know why i even got on here and wrote this, i just remembered seeing this organization on 9news a long time ago and thought that this might interest you. anyways, that was my experience tonight.
