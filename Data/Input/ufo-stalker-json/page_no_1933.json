what happened was the triangle all of a sudden had extended its front point, what i mean by this is, first the lights and blacked out sky were triangular and the next second the front of the ship had extended with lights, now the lights extended from the front (top) of the triangle and the lights were arranged in a parallel line up of maybe two or three lights out from the front, then back out at an angle for one brick and another at an angle back in, and another brick forward then the two parallel bricks came together angled in towards each other. i was shocked both when i first saw this and i told my friend on the phone holy **** there is a ufo flying over my head, she continued to talk and i said did you hear me, i am looking at a ufo flying over, she said take a picture, i knew there was no time to take a picture and i don't think the phone camera would have caught anything anyway, besides i couldn't take my eyes of it. i feel it was at a low altitude one for the size of the ship and as it went out of sight relatively quickly, it was ~ 6' wide at its back and flew about the same speed as aircraft.\r\n\r\n i immediatly thought it was a \"black triangle\" i don't feel it was \"out of this world\" i feel it is our military's.  i am always looking up into the sky at night looking at the stars, and just happened to be outside at the time.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

hit a pillow. it slowed to almost a stop and slowly cruised along the shore line. it was very very low to the ground. it had a huge bright spotlight on the front that was being shined all over the shoreline as it passed over.  it looked like a flying wedge of cheese. it was a flat looking black, almost gunmetal. had a smooth look to it. i could see no seems or edges to it. it had a row of lights along the outsides of it running towards the back. it was moving so slowly and completely quiet. if it was any thing normal, it would have fallen right out of the sky.  my home from the shoreline where it flew over is about 3 blocks or so.  we could see it very well and that it was extremely large. while moving with the shoreline, it passed behind the larger of the two smoke stacks on the powerplant at southbeach. it was lower than the taller stack, but above the shorter one. i have been told that the taller stack is approx. 3oo feet tall. that thing was about 280 feet up or so.  as soon as it passed the second smoke stack, it turned towards the ski hill or airport at ki sawyer airforce base. it was still moving very very slowly. the thing that got me about when it turned, was that it turned perfectly 90 degrees with out banking or slowing leaning or anything.  it went paralell to hampton street, which is only two over from mine. it was very low, it was flying up hill. once it got to the peak of the hill side, it flashed off at ungodly speed towards the airport. it made no noise when it went from maybe a mile or two an hour to infinity in a blink of the eye. i have

my house watching tv with my three stepchildren and my nephew. i noticed a light coming through the  window blinds that face my backyard. i originally believed someone had pulled around to the back of my home and was in the process of driving away. i went to the window, but didn't see a vehicle. i then walked to the front door, where surrounded by children i still failed to see a car. then, i looked up and slowly cruising above a juvenile pine tree-line was the most astonishing sight i have ever beheld. the object was metallic silver and square shaped, edges were rounded, the top was slightly domed. there were lights shining down from the four corners. the bottom was smooth and seemless. there seemed to be no means of propulsion. this object was approximately 10 feet above the trees yet there was no movement from the pine trees. my stepdaughter asked me, ( is that what i think it is?) i replied, ( i don't know what that is  sweety but we're locking the door.) the children slept in my room that night and every night that they came to visit for about a month until the event began to fade for them. we still talk about it every now and then..But we don't go outside after the sun starts setting anymore.

was a blimp. at the time it was moving very slowly. i thought the chasing lights were a message board on the side of a blimp. she asked me if i was sure so i looked again. it was definitely not a blimp. i could see a single line of chasing lights that would have a occassional break in them, kind of like a binary code or morse code. i could see they wrapped around the object. the red light on top stayed on continuously.\r\nit continued slowly from the west to east side of the freeway. then back over the freeway. at this point we had been watching for about a minute. then the craft began accelerating very quickly heading north. when i say quickly, i mean like a jet taking off or faster, pulling away from us with some serious speed. i was positive at this point that it couldn't be a jet or a blimp. it seemed to be within 1,000 feet or so from the ground. we couldn't hear any noises.\r\nwe pulled over at avery parkway and continued to watch. our cameras on our cell phones weren't good enough to get a photo of it. it continued north at high speed for about 20 to 30 seconds after we pulled over. then it headed out over the ocean and was gone in the next 10 seconds. the whole

offered the binos to my wife and noticed that with the naked eye the object was not as bright as before.  after 5 more minutes it was not visible to the naked eye.  i continued to observe through the binos until 1:20 am when bands of cirrus began to obstuct the view completely.  total duration of the observation was :35 minutes.  \r\n\r\nmy wife and i have many decades and many, many thousands of

very close and low, just over the trees it seemed. they hoovered in the same spot for about 15 minutes and then one just faded out.Then a few minutes later the second faded away. then the third. the next night 11-9-2010, i was coming home around the same time, but this time i had my nephew with me. we saw what appeared to be the same lights hoovering in the same location and as before they hung around for at least 15 minutes. we drove over to the next driveway on the other side of the field to see if we could tell what the object(s) were but all we could see were the lights. as before, one by one they just faded away. i've been out to the field several nights and just sat and watched, but there has been nothing out there since those two nights. from what i am reading, there are reports of sightings in several surrounding counties in the last two weeks. conyers, covington, monroe, madison and some further out.. two sightings in clayton county and i believe one more but i don't recall the county. also, there was a report of a sonic boom as reported in the ajc that was heard around carrol, douglas and harelson counties. very strange.\r\n\r\nin the pictures i've attached, there is a bright light at the bottom of the photo and a smaller light to the right. the light to the right is our neighbors street light and the light to the left is a reflection off of a license plate. the lights at the top of the photo are those that appeared to be hoovering in the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":26804,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6691903,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12012010-0002","longitude":-84.0124704,"occurred":1289364600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1291196631000,"summary":"Unknown

she said she saw something that looked like a ufo because it was low and seemed to be hovering and there were blinking lights on it. we blew it off until me and another one of my friends were driving from lawrence toward olathe at around 9 pm and we saw the exact thing that my first friend had described. the ufo started off looking like a star. it then got extremely bright and started lowering, moving toward us driving on the highway. it flew directly over us and the bottom of it looked to be in a triangle shape with the same lights described above. we then saw another ufo act in the same exact way. we went back into town then grabbed a few of our friends because we saw so many abnormally twinkling \"stars\" that turned out to look like triangle ships as the dropped down. we went back on k10 and pulled off in a dim area to watch this strange situation. sure enough, the same exact thing happened with three more ships, all looking similar but the blinking of the lights seemed to be different for each ship. there were two ufos that were next to each other then one started moving up and one started moving down at the same time. there were so many bright ufos in the sky that stayed in the same place for the most part but would tend to minutely move up, down and side to side. the last ship we saw that came down made a sound when we didn't hear a sound come from any of the other ones we saw. it sounded like a \"whomping\" noise (hard to explain). two of my friends said that they felt tingly all over and the top of their head was tingling sensationably and they couldn't help but have tears come even though they were not sad, they could not explain why this was happening to them. eventually we came back home because it was getting late, but they never left the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26803,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9732789,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12012010-0001","longitude":-95.2299301,"occurred":1291181400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1291195616000,"summary":"They

blvd, lake buena vista, fl 32830), when my 9 year old grandaughter said it was thundering outside. i went out on the balcony to look.  at first, i thought the noise was an airplane because i could see one traveling across the sky and then i realized it was a firework show over disney world (probably magic kingdom but i'm not familiar with the area enough to be sure and we are several miles away and couldn't actually see the fireworks).  \r\n\r\nafter i figured out what the noise was, i noticed a star-like light very high in the sky, well above the airplane that was flying in the sky.  it really stood out because there was not a single other star in the sky.  i thought it odd because i'd been at the firework show at magic kingdom the night before and had seen a lot of stars in the sky so this difference really caught my attention and caused me to really focus on the star-like object.  \r\n\r\nafter a few minutes, i saw the object move very slightly, so slightly i felt maybe it had not happened.  i also was a bit freaked because i had seen a similar looking object back in oregon last week when i was walking my dog late at night.  it also moved very slightly and i felt perhaps i was imagining it so i thought oh no, my mind is playing tricks again.  but, this also caused me to really fixate and watch the object and when i saw it slightly glide just a tiny bit a couple more times, i called out my grandaughter to see if her younger eyes noticed anything.  asked her to watch it and she humored me and then got a little scared when she and i both saw it move a bit slightly.  we came back into the room and i talked to her- she wanted to know if there were humans or aliens in the ufo and i reassured her that everything was ok.  \r\n\r\ni went back into the room for awhile to keep her company and kept peeking to see if it stayed, which it did.  about 10 or 15 minutes after the fireworks stopped, i saw the light move more noticeably and then it started to dim and then got bright again and did this about 2 times before i called my grandaughter back out to look.  she and i watched as it dimmed and lit back up and then it totally disappeared and then quickly lit back up and dimmed and lit back up one more time.  then it disappeared and slightly after this we heard a sound like a backfire or firework and we could not see it anymore.  \r\n\r\nwe went back inside and i kept checking periodically and about 10 minutes of it not being there, the next time i went out it was back in the same location in the sky.  it stayed for awhile and i just went out to check and it is still there and it's now 22:16.  in fact, it's movements are not as subtle and i could see it moving from side to side in a downward semi-circle pattern several times.  it moves slightly and then steadies and remains still for awhile and repeats this way over and over.  unfortunately, i don't have any binoculars handy but am wishing i did so i could see even better.  i just went out one more time before i submit this.  at approximately 22:31, i saw it dim again and then a large cloud cover moved in between the oject and i and i couldn't see it anymore.  i waited for about 5 mins but the clouds continued to block the view and i can't tell if it's still there or not.  \r\n\r\nas far as my feelings about the sighting- i felt a mixture of excitment and skepticism when i first saw it.  the excitement remained as i watched and then i was a little frightened when we saw it dim and re-light and disappear.  right now, i feel calm with an underlying excitement.  i have had a couple of experiences in the past 2 years where i spotted a ufo-like object but have been by myself and just tried to put it out of my mind because i felt maybe i was imagining or perhaps even delusional.     \r\n\r\nthis event made me feel compelled enough to search the internet and find this site to make the report.  i also will be researching the internet to learn more about other sightings at disney world- i really got the sense that the object was there to watch the firework show.  \r\n\r\ni just looked outside again, it's 22:41 now, the clouds are all gone (not a single one in sight) and the star-like object is absolutely not present.","distance":"Over One
