experience of foreign and us spacecraft and aircraft of all descriptions. it is my professional opinion as a  past dod employee that this was not an aircraft or spacecraft from this planet, area 51, or any other secret base. it is not an ���unkown��� but clearly an et craft to anybody with a brain. the encounter started around 910 to 930 pm on 28nov2010 and i hastily departed the area at 9:43 pm. *(name deleted--cms/sg) and i had stopped at the railroad crossing between ca hy 70 and ca hy 20 eastbound on woodruff lane. it was a dark night with no lights and a clear starry sky. i stopped to see if any of my friends would show themselves and to look at the stars. the pleiades was almost directly overhead. to the west *(name deleted--cms/sg) noticed a ���flasher��� between jupiter (very bright) and another star to the south of it, i think this was all at about 45 degree elevation. she saw the flasher about 5-10 minutes after we stopped, i located it within 5 minutes later as it was flashing perhaps more than a minute between flashes. it was stationary. i continued to observe it throughout the encounter. a train was approaching in the distance, we were on a rise and it took maybe 10-15 minutes for the train to reach us. the flasher increased its rate of flashing until when i left it was flashing every 3 seconds. most of the flashes were dim but maybe every 8th or 10th flash was brighter than any stars and an adjoining flash was fairly bright also. the spacecraft started to move slightly just before the train lights became visible to the south. it moved in an arc that was easterly at first and then turned northerly towards me. it was almost directly overhead when i departed. i noted that although the craft appeared friendly to me, i became dizzy and they were attempting to immobilize me. i walked with difficulty around my car, backed up, and departed quickly, as i do not allow myself to be abducted if i can avoid it. i continued to be dizzy and disoriented even when i arrived home, but i called in my protection from lord ashtar and others. i believe they were friendly but not in the least concerned about any agreement from me to allow them to interfere, they were apparently concerned that i was quite aware of them and wanted to know who i was. i have a faculty to go back in time and will do so and investigate them further once i feel it is safe to do so. on the way home i made myself invisible and deflected their attention to the pickup truck far behind me. most ets have difficulty separating out individuals so they were able to follow me home but were somewhat confused about my location and identity. i was still somewhat dizzy and disoriented after arriving home, meaning that they were still trying to interfere or investigate me. i will wait until i am pretty sure they wont return before investigating their identity further. i note that they showed themselves by flashing and that encounters are interactive, ufos do not show themselves to everyone, so they apparently initiated this encounter, and i had stopped to observe any spacecraft that might choose to show themselves. i talked to them and had asked for whoever was up there to show themselves, and i am very telepathic for a human. there was no moon, no clouds, and perfect visibility in all directions. the flasher was brighter than jupiter at a bright flash and difficult to locate when it flashed dimly. i note that flashers are common, if they do not move they are not aircraft or spacecraft (satellites or secret rocket craft). helicopters can remain stationary but normally not for long periods and do not vary in intensity nor do they operate at high altitudes, and they have other colored running lights, not just a white flashing light, and it is not several minutes between flashes. the object appeared to be at high altitude, probably orbital altitudes but there is no reference to determine altitude.\"\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:33:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

several pairs of planes that appeared to be flying in formation to the east on a north heading. (too close to be commercial airliners) i was situated in a postion facing south at the darkest section of my yard. 9:10pm from directly overhead i saw a large blur coming from a direction behind me. i looked directly at the object and noticed that it blocked the view of the stars above it. there were no lights at all on the object. however there were six circular markings on the underside of the object. the six circular markings made an upside down v with the point of the v moving away from me. i had a pair of eleitz wetzlar 8x30 binoculars in my hands. i immediately veiwed the object with these. viewing this object through the binocluars i could only see the center portion of the object, with its outside portions outside my viewing. i could see all six of the circular markings on the underside of the object. the object in its entirety was triangular in shape. each point of the object was rounded and not pointed. at arms length measuring between thumb and first finger it was 5 inches in width and 3 inches in length. i would estimate speed to be close between 500 and 600 miles per hour with an altitude of 500 to 1000 feet. entirely silent. i lowered my binoculars and veiwed it flying away and out of view south. i timed the viewing of this object to be 10 seconds and noted the time. i immediately sketched to paper what i viewed as best as i could. i also noted that the object appeared solid because nothing could be seen above it. i waited 15 minutes longer viewing the same area of sky before going inside to type up what i viewed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26793,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6152742,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11302010-0002","longitude":-82.8107303,"occurred":1291007400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1291139716000,"summary":"Triangular, six circular markins on underside of craft of lighter coloer","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Trenton, Florida","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:83273"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Cumming","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I arrived home from work at around 0615. as i exited my vehicle in the driveway i turned around to look at the mailbox. a light caught my eye high in the sky over the tree tops of my neighbors yard. the light was bright and high in the sky. within seconds it was at the tree line then came within 5 to 10 feet of the top of my neighbors house and the blue light fizzled out like the left overs of a firework. no further incident after this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26792,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.2155396,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11302010-0001","longitude":-84.1323726,"occurred":1283693400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1291121105000,"summary":"Falling blue light, then the blue light flickered out like a firework .","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":85,"locationName":"Cumming, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:83274"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":null,"country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is an addendum to my previous report filed on 11-28-2010 titled, \"shape-shifters:  peach-colored lights/orbs and hovering, fake planes.\"\r\n\r\ni just want to add that the sightings have become a regular thing for me now in the evenings.  in my previous report, i mentioned that focused awareness seems to play a big part in whether these \"things\" materialize, and that continues to be the case.  as soon as i leave work at 5:00 p.M. and begin to think about the craft, it appears, almost like clockwork.  it continues to follow me for much of my commute home and occasionally seems to respond/react to certain thoughts i \"send\" it.  \r\n\r\non sunday evening (11-28-10), while driving home from work through dauphin county, this thing manifested in varying ways:  the standard peach-colored light that can be mistaken for an approaching plane; the fake craft that the peach-colored light morphs into; a craft that followed me over a mountain and erratically strobed a host of colors; and a similar craft that erratically strobed only red.  i flashed a flashlight at the thing from my car window a few times but was unable to notice any distinct flashes back other than the strobing that it was already doing.\r\n\r\ntonight, however, the thing was bolder than ever and appeared in plain sight of thousands of cars on major traffic arteries during rush hour.  i was shocked by how bold this thing was:  it wasn't just a hovering orange light this time.  instead, it actually pulsed rhythmically (instead of strobing), about one pulse per second, while it hovered overhead (at about \"plane altitude\") and only occasionally moved about. it barely attempted to behave like a plane or other \"normal\" aircraft this time.. i saw it behave similarly about 25 miles down the road in a more rural area where it was really conspicuous.  in my mind i thought, \"you should camouflage yourself more,\" and at that moment, it faded out and disappeared from view for a bit.\r\n\r\nmy feelings during these sightings vary from wonder, excitement, and hopefulness to feelings of being unnerved and disturbed. \r\n\r\ni really did not want to add more to my previous report, but i do want readers to know that there are folks out there who are experiencing daily sightings of these shape-shifters, whether we like it or not.  i realize how crazy all of this sounds, but i also don't really care about credibility or about proving anything at this point.  i'm merely posting this to acknowledge the experiences i've had and the craft/beings responsible for them, to inform and educate readers, and to be a voice for others experiencing the same phenomenon who are hesitant to make themselves known.\r\n\r\nif these daily events change significantly (new type of craft or clear contact with an entity), i will be sure to file another report.  thanks, again.//","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26791,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2108116,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11292010-0009","longitude":-77.1851047,"occurred":1291080600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1291098560000,"summary":"Addendum to \"shape-shifters\" report filed 11-28-2010","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:83275"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"San Antonio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting on my back porch after having supper when i noticed a light moving from the west to the east. it was about as bright as the stars i could see and it's movement was what caught my eye. this was about 6:30pm. it was traveling about the speed that a satellite would travel as seen from the ground. i watched it for about 15 seconds before it disappeared behind a tree to the east of me. about five minutes later, as i was again scanning the sky, i saw another light flare up above a tree in my front yard, due south of my position. i didn't see the light until it flared on but i determined that it was moving from the southwest to the northeast. this time the light flared on for about two seconds then dimmed out for about two seconds then came back on. it did this three times before dimming out for good. i kept watching in the direction it was moving but didn't see it again. about five minutes after this another light flared on in about the same location as the one before this but this time it was traveling south to north. this one stayed lit for about five seconds before dimming out and disappearing. i again tracked it's course but didn't see it again. about five minutes later another light flared on what seemed to the west of my house. this time it was moving from the north to the south. the light stayed lit for about six to seven seconds and as it traveled south it seemed to zigzag slightly then it dimmed out and disappeared. i, again, scanned the direction it traveled and didn't see it again. this whole episode has me excited.

saw a big red-tinted, whitish circle over a full moon at about 2 am that was about twice the size of the moon and that it appeared above his eye-level at about 45 degrees and cast a shadow through a large window in the upstairs room he was sleeping in--it gave me pause. he stood in front of the window and watched it for about 10 minutes or so and then decided to go back to bed. it really shook him up. the shadows cast by it were almost as distinct as day-time shadows cast by the sun. he said it was like watching a moon-set and a sunrise except the sun doesn't rise at 2 am and the sun doesn't rise in the west. the more he tried to figure it out, the more it shook him up. and not being able to explain it right now is troubling for him. i've done some web searching and nobody appears

wide view of the lake, including the portion that is the second picture, and has no objects that resemble the significant object in the second picture. the second picture is altogether a different picture in which i had the same angle as the first, only i zoomed the camera in a little and took the picture only a few seconds after. you���ll notice that in the second picture there is an apparently fast-moving, rounded disc-like object in the sky. this object didn���t appear anywhere in the first picture, which is strange considering the larger view and the fact that it was only taken a few seconds earlier. i hadn���t noticed the image until later in the trip (i hadn���t reviewed the pictures until later) when we put the pictures on the computer and viewed them all. the pictures interested my family and me, but we never did anything about them. the third picture i enclosed is just a magnification of the section in the second picture of the object. that���s the most clarity my

a few months ago in sept. 2010.  i've \r\nhesitated to report these events previously but do so now in the hopes that others like me will find the courage to break their silence and to share their experiences.  a staggering number of individuals have reported the same phenomena elsewhere online, and many have posted incredible footage on youtube of what i'm about to describe.  although i have not filmed the phenomena myself (yet), i can attest that the footage posted by users such as (names of websites moved to additional evidence section--cms/sg) are true to what i've witnessed myself.  i do not personally know these users, and i cite their videos only as further evidence of my witness testimony.\r\n\r\nhere's a synopsis of my experiences.  i've intentionally excluded certain details that i'd be willing to discuss confidentially with mufon investigators but do not wish to disclose in this forum or to third parties.  here are the basics:\r\n\r\nit began on a late july evening in 1997 in northumberland co, pa, when i peered out my open window on an overcast night, as i often did, and looked \r\nskyward.  i recall the time was about 1:00 a.M.  in a period of time that spanned no more than one second at most, i saw an anomalous light strobe three times at three different points in the sky and disappear.  i felt certain that it was one light that had moved to three different points in the sky and had strobed three times at each point, rather than three different lights that strobed in succession, probably because the points were somewhat close to each other instead of at opposite sides of the sky.  i estimated the altitude of the light to be no more than that of a low-flying, small plane, although it could have been much closer than that.  in any case, i was practicing a religion at the time, i did not believe in extraterrestrials, and i was also an avid sky-watcher who had never witnessed anything like this, so this anomalous event knocked me for a loop and scared me terribly!  although it seems humorous in retrospect, i recall that i slept with the light on and with religious objects near my bed (and with my window closed) for several subsequent nights.  i pushed the event to the farthest corners of my mind, although it never quite escaped my memory.  \r\n\r\nthirteen years passed, my belief systems changed greatly during that time, and i had opened myself to the likelihood of abundant, advanced intelligent life in this universe and countless other universes.  probably due to my 1997 experience, my interest was piqued when i read reviews of the recently released book by journalist leslie kean titled, \"ufos.\"  i bought the book and finished it in september 2010.  it fascinated me, and i began to familiarize myself with the works and writings of various schools of thought on the subject, major researchers, groups, contactees, etc., trying to distinguish the real from the fake.  i truly believe that this \"primed\" me for what happened next.  that is, i think that the whole reason for my most recent sightings is that i had grown in awareness enough to be able to absorb and process the experiences.  i'm getting ahead of my story here, but suffice it to say that these events are purposeful and often interactive.  consciousness is key.\r\n\r\nback to my account:\r\n\r\none evening in the last week of september 2010 in northumberland co., i was out for a walk/jog, which is routine for me in the warm months.  at the time, sundown was somewhere between 7 and 7:30 p.M.  i was walking/jogging toward the beautiful sunset, thinking about extraterrestrials, the books and literature i had just read, etc.  very few clouds were in the sky.  all of a sudden, i noticed an incredibly bright light in sunset.  too bright to be a star, as it shone with such a magnitude that it was not obscured by the brilliant sun.  plus, it appeared to be emanating from within the earth's atmosphere at about the altitude of a small plane.  the light was a peach color, like the color of the sunset.  it was stationary.  i laughed at myself, because i was caught off-guard by this light after just finishing the ufo book and reading all about ufos.  i figured that my imagination was running away with me, and i chided myself, thinking that i had mistaken the reflection of the sun gleaming off a plane, or the headlight of an approaching plane, for an anomalous light.  the fact was, though, that this light remained stationary for at least the 15 minutes that i walked/jogged in its direction, except for a few times when it moved slightly to the right or slightly to the left.  it also faded in and out--faded to a pinprick, then it would suddenly reappear and pulse brightly, then fade out, disappear, reappear, etc.  again, there were no clouds in the sky.  \r\n\r\ndespite all this, i convinced myself that it was nothing that couldn't be explained, and i didn't think anything further of it . . . until my next walk/jog a few days later, when it appeared again at the exact same place in the sky while i was thinking about ufos.  again, it faded in and out (not rhythmically--just randomly), moved here and there a bit, but just generally hovered.  it was close enough to me that i would have seen a craft/shape if it were an ultralight, glider, plane, certainly a balloon, parachuter, kite, etc.  on this second occasion, i paid closer attention and \"knew\" that . . . i was seeing exactly what i thought i was seeing.  i didn't feel fear--only immense curiosity and a certain sense of hopefulness and excitement.  i tried to mentally \"talk\" with the thing.  on subsequent walks, i may have even received rudimentary, yet personalized, messages back (although this is difficult to \"prove,\" so i will exclude the details here.)\r\n\r\ni should also mention that i reported seeing the anomalous light to my family members, who live next door and who do not believe even in the remotest possibility of extraterrestrials or sky phenomena originating from other beings.  on the morning after i had a sighting of the amber light, my father reported that a \"helicopter\" had landed atop the mountain about half a mile from our homes, observed about 6:00 a.M. as he was heading to work.  when i pressed for more details, he told me that he did not actually see a helicopter, but that the saw extremely bright lights that appeared to be landing atop the mountain.  his interpretation was that someone lived up there and may have needed helicopter transportation to a hospital.  i have not been able to confirm or refute this--i only mention it because he did not see a craft (only lights) and because of the next part of my story.\r\n\r\nafter the sightings of the bright, anomalous, peachy light during the last week of september and first week of october 2010, i stopped going for evening walks as it became too dark to do so.  i also had a series of urgent matters to take care of, and i ceased to even think about ufos for over a month.  i began to think about them again during the past week or two, perhaps to take my mind off other things, and that's when the most incredible part of my story began.\r\n\r\nit was on or about november 17, 2010, when i was driving home from work (i commute 135 miles daily by car, mostly through rural areas).  i was in dauphin co. at the time, skywatching while driving (unsafe, i know), when a weird light caught my eye.  it seemed stationary, like a stationary plane light.  i had to keep looking back at the road between my views of it.  at one point, when i looked back at it, i saw that it was a plane.  \r\n\r\ni was somewhat disappointed and kept driving.  when i reached a particular part of my commute (a small village in lower northumberland co.), i noticed an immensely bright light in the sky, hovering not far above tree-top level--perhaps a few hundred yards up, like the size of a small \r\nplane about to touch down in a few minutes, but lit up like a rocket!!!  it was ridiculously bright, and the brightness completely obscured the rest of the craft.  it was a long cigar (horizontally shaped, like an airplane lit up from wingtip to wingtip) of incredible brightness, just hovering, \"looking\" right at me!!  the brightness did not increase, decrease, or move--it was definitely hovering, or else moving at such a slow speed that it would have dropped from the sky if it were a typical plane.  by this time, i had slowed down to about 40 miles an hour.  a car approached in the opposite lane, i took my eyes off the \"thing,\" and when i looked at it again, this time i saw just two incredibly bright \"headlights\" and two fainter lights on the wingtips of what appeared to be a plane.  it had begun to move toward me, but at a ridiculously slow pace.  it flew over me, from left to right.  my thoughts during the event were initially \"what the h*** is that?\"  just baffled curiosity, tinged with breathless excitement, and then a bit of a sheepish, confused feeling after i saw the \"plane.\"\r\n\r\nwhen i arrived home, i spoke with my father again and relayed what i had seen, because i felt like i needed to tell someone.  i was astounded when he casually informed me that he, too, had seen a bright \"plane\" that seemed to hover or fly unusually slowly.  he saw it in the exact same location as i did, and the object behaved exactly the same:  it flew over him from left to right.  he didn't tell me when the event occurred, but it must have been months ago, as he does not normally travel along that road.  \"it was a plane,\" he said, with a tone of finality.  i didn't try to convince him otherwise.\r\n\r\na day or two later, i took an alternate route home from work due to an accident along my regular route, and i traveled through dauphin and schuylkill counties.  while i was waiting in a line of traffic to access i-81 n, i noticed the same \"hovering plane\" type of light in the sky among the other stars, airplanes, and jets.  its faintly peachy color gave it away.  i stared at it for a long time, waiting in traffic.  as i did, i noticed very faint strobe-like lights that seemed to emanate from it and travel around it.  for whatever reason, i once again wrote it off as a \r\nstar with extremely distant jets in close alignment with it.  i continued to travel north. i looked at \"it\" once while driving on the interstate, and i thought i saw a contrail in the moonlight behind it, which befuddled (and disappointed) me yet again. \r\n\r\ni swear i saw the amber/peachy light again near a shopping center that i stopped at on my way home in schuylkill co.  (at the time, i was just \r\ndismissing everything i saw, so it's hard to recall details now in retrospect.)  then, after i left the shopping center, i witnessed almost a repeat of the previous event in lower northumberland co.:  a bright (but not nearly as bright as before) light seemed to hover, then \"morph\" into a plane-like object before proceeding to slowly fly over me from left to right!  because i was on a highway, i lost sight of the object after it flew over me and was behind me and behind trees surrounding the highway.\r\n\r\nthe most recent encounter(s) i had were on nov. 22 or nov. 23 after work.  i left work at 5:00 p.M. in dauphin co. and proceeded to walk several blocks to my car.  i saw a very, very strange looking \"helicopter,\" complete with helicopter sound, flying right past me over the parking lot.  i couldn't see the shape of the helicopter very well, but it appeared to have a bright green light on top and a red light on the bottom.  this one may have been a domestic or military craft--i'm not saying it was unexplainable, just that i had never seen a light configuration like that before.\r\n\r\ni proceeded to drive toward a shopping center in cumberland co.  while waiting in traffic, i saw the amber/peachy orb-like thing again in the sunset, facing me.  it looked at first like a plane approaching, but as i sat there in traffic for a good ten minutes or so, i realized that it was not increasing in size in the slightest, nor was it decreasing, fading, pulsing, or otherwise moving.  it was, however, glimmering--dancing, even--in an odd way, more so than the typical glimmer of a star in the sky.  it seemed to be multi-colored at times.  finally, as traffic cleared and i drove across a bridge toward the light, it began to approach, take the form of a plane, and turn to my right at a 90 degree angle.  i took my eye off it to watch the road, looked back, and all of a sudden, this thing flew right-to-left, right over me!  it had done a complete 180 in the second or two that i had taken my eyes off the road.  \r\n\r\ndespite all this, i was just left feeling bad because these objects were merely planes, and i was seemingly incapable of identifying them as such.  i thought i was perhaps misidentifying things.\r\n\r\nafter some shopping in cumberland and dauphin counties, i proceeded home.  while in upper dauphin co., in the area where i had previously seen a hovering light, i noticed a very odd-looking \"plane.\"  instead of the typical white light \"strobe\" that domestic craft have, this plane's strobe light \"fluttered\" in a bizarre way.  i'm sorry that i cannot describe it better than that.  suffice it to say, it was an abnormal type of strobe that i had never seen before.  again, i'm not completely convinced that this particular one wasn't just a regular plane with a broken light or something.\r\n\r\nfinally, when i had reached the part of my commute through lower northumberland county, in the exact same place that i had first seen the bright, cigar-shaped-light-turned-hovering-plane, and in the exact same place that my father had seen something similar, i saw it again!!!  it wasn't as bright this time, but it was bright, peachy-colored, and hovering on the opposite bank of the susquehanna river.  i mentally asked it to come closer, to show me what it really looked like.  at this point, i was driving about 35 mph and looking for a place to pull over.  i suspected that this was the \"real deal,\" and i wanted an opportunity for me to observe it without moving.  i pulled over at the first opportunity and opened my window.  \r\n\r\ni had lost view of the light behind some trees for a bit but soon saw it through the tree tops, slowly making its way toward me (it was flying about a few hundred yards up in the air from left to right again).  finally, it cleared the trees, and i stuck my head out the window and saw it:  it was a small, low-flying jet/plane, complete with \r\nplane-like sound, much to my consternation.  \r\n\r\nwhen i arrived home, i performed internet searches on \"hovering planes\" and \"ufos that become planes.\"  this led me to the videos of many youtubers who have been observing and capturing these things for quite some time.  the usernames i mentioned above are just a few who have posted videos of exactly what i saw:  peachy orbs/lights that morph into plane-like objects.  some of the videos even show daylight footage.  i cannot emphasize enough that these are legit, and i encourage anyone even remotely interested to take a look.  i thought i was a really poor witness until i viewed these videos, at which point i almost wept when i realized that others have seen what i've seen.  the \"orange orb/fake-plane ufo\" thing is real, it's prevalent, and many of us are witnessing it, worldwide.\r\n\r\nas for my opinion about what these are and why they're here (for what it's worth):  i believe they're extraterrestrial in origin.  not sure whether they're \"manned,\" as it were, or perhaps just probes or holograms.  they don't appear to do anything except observe, and, occasionally, interact.  they seem to appear when one thinks about them, almost exclusively on clear nights. i believe that they are simply trying observe and to spread awareness of their existence at a grass-roots-level.  they are both bold and cautious--they're undaunted by urban areas, where they can blend in, but rural areas and daylight seem to be no big deals, either.  i would love to know why there are so many of these, and why \"they\" seem to want to be noticed.\r\n\r\nthanks for the opportunity to provide my personal account of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":26774,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2092916,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11282010-0008","longitude":-77.1907547,"occurred":1290412800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Cylinder,   Flash,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1290980187000,"summary":"Shape-shifters:  peach-colored lights/orbs & hovering, fake planes","tags":["lights","hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:83292"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Las Cruces","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i were driving through southern new mexico, approximately 30 miles north of las cruces. i commented on the beauty of the clouds, as chemtrailing seemed to be absent or minimal that day, and took a photo using my digital camera. i did not see anything unusual in the sky at the time; however, when i uploaded the image to my computer i was very surprised to see something in the upper left hand portion of the picture which looked like a metal hinge of sorts with several squarish openings in it. my husband and i looked at it with wonder, first discussing if it could be a reflection from anything inside the car. we determined that it could not be that, and remarked at how the ufo image was embedded within the clouds -- clouds in front and behind.

noticed a bright low altitude light moving southwestarly.  it was silent and seemed to be floating along like a fishing bobber in the water.  object was relatively close but not discernable by the naked eye.  i ran back in and grabed some binoculars.  i could not believe what i was seeing. it  had a disc shaped helm that was a row of lights.  these lights were a bright whitish blue kind of color. they were pulsing from one end of arc to the other and also flashing in random sequences as well.  i gave my nephew the binoculars and immediately started saying i dont believe this something is not right.  its a disc its a disc.  we were both a bit in dis-belief.  the object was vanishing behind a northsouth fence/tree line.  we drove around and out into the open in front pasture.  here most all of the sky is visible.  we proceeded to watch the object until it stopped and appeared to hover in one spot far off above the southwest horizion.  upon gazing around the sky we statred to notice several objects all over the sky.  there were several that were flying low on the northwestern horizion headed southwest. at first they were bright yellowish lights and appeared quite large.  they would begin to flash and display different colors of light.  some times there were three to four of these in fairly close proximity.  some times they moved toward each other and at other times they would almost touch and then move away from each other one heading northward and the other southward, both moving at the same rate.  there were also objects moving south to north.  these would fly almost directly over head and made almost no noise.  they sounded kinda like a jet engine,but with a much quiter tone.  these are what i call the flying bars.  they had two whitishyellow lights on each end.  in between were several different lights flashing, pulsing, and possibly changing color.  it was hard to tell with our crappy binoculars but you could definately see the lights on these objects.  there were also objects that were rectangular flying light panels.  these objects had the most lights and the most different colors.  there were reds, blues, greens, ambers, white, orange, purple, and possibly more.  all flashing, pulsing, some steady, some blinking and some possibly moving.  the objects moved at a fairly slow rate of speed but speed up and slow down as well as go up and down at times appearing to just \"float\" around.  we also witnessed triangular shaped light arrays on some of these objects.  these had bright whitishblue lights on three points with many other lights in between and inside the triangular shape.  i was watching a statonary very bright orangish one low in the southwest sky.  it pulsed brightly and vanished.  then there were several smaller flashing flying objects.  my report is a little scattered because i was really rattled by all this and there was so much happening.  we watched the show in total disbelief for about an hour.  upon a break for some turkeyday leftovers we both independently drew simple pictures/diagrams of what we had witnessed.  we drew three of the same objects and two that were quite similar.  we saw triangular, discshaped, square/rectangular objects.The only really good closeup view was of the initial craft with a definite arc of lights on its helm. at approximatly ten p.M. i went back out on atv and almost all activity had stopped.  there were still a couple of strange objects around but nothing like what we had previously witnessed.  its about eleven on sunday morning so my details are a bit lacking.  we never could really see what the objects were or looked like except for the amazing mumber,color, and actions of the lights on these craft.  i have seen some weired stuff in my day but this takes the cake.  i live on the outside test loop for majors field in greenville, texas.  the airforce has taken control of some stuff out there.  i dont know if there is any connection but its worth noting.  thank you for your time, and no for once i was not drunk on a saturday night.  i feel today like im crazy because i cant hardly believe what we actually saw.  could ten airplanes be seen at any given time at numereous places, variable velocity and trajectory in the sky for over an hour?\r\n\r\n

an oval object with what appeared to be a ring around it moving slowly with bright lights covering it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":26770,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5988113,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11282010-0004","longitude":-83.464654,"occurred":1290930300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,   Oval,   Saturn-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1290940208000,"summary":"Bright light hovering above the trees.","tags":["lights","police"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Madison, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:83296"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Conyers","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving along salem road from interstate 20 towards brown bridge road. object caught my eye because it was too big to be a plane, the shape was different and the lighting was solid. the shape was blimp like, but the shape was almost like a domed serving platter. the object first appeared to be hovering and then it was moving off towards the west (i think). i was trying to drive and keep the object in my view. i did stop and try to get a better look, but then the trees blocked my sight. it was also moving away from me and getting smaller. \r\n\r\nas i lost site, i got back on salem road and turned onto brown bridge road heading towards mcdonough. i caught site of the object again but it was moving away and the trees were blocking my view. i tried to keep up with it and eventually lost it completely. \r\n\r\ni remember feeling like i could not be the only one seeing this. i thought about it just being a blimp, but the time and the look did not make me believe it was anything short of abnormal. after arriving home, i searched the skies without any luck. i immediately searched the internet to see if anyone had reported seeing it. i know that i saw something other than an ordinary aircraft.\r\n\r\ni regret not having a camera available to get a picture.
