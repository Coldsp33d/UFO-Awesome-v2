black round object in the sky-one of which slowly came across the lake in our direction and over the tree line. with each sighting there have been several witnesses in our area and there was no sound

world of ufos and ets and i hoped very soon to see ufos in my area and video tape them and hopefully do something in this world to provide disclosure. \r\n\r\nbut i had no idea what i was getting myself into. \r\n\r\nnot that i regret it, but when i saw my first golden-fireball-type ufo sitting over the oldsmar bridge high in the sky, i never knew that i would have anything related to close contact. \r\n\r\nmy friend jessi and i headed to walmart on november 11th, 2010. when i left my neighborhood, i saw my first \"real\" ufo sighting. a golden ball of light shining way brighter than any star(we call it  a \"mini-sun ufo\" in our group on youtube) i had an awesome glimpse of it going over the bridge and i somehow had lost interest in anything else after that. leaving walmart, however, i saw another golden mini sun in the sky right over the parking lot to the right side. i was very amazed. thinking back, it was probably the same one. i had no idea at the time. this one was moving very very slowly. but i made my friend stop to observe it with me. she was also amazed. nobody else stopped to look in the parking lot. they were too pre-occupied.\r\n\r\nit kept getting closer and closer and the grip i had on my friend's sleeve grew tighter and tighter. and then it did something that would have confirmed a regular person that it was a plane. not me. i know what they are capable of. the ball of light shone brightly. it separated into two lights and then slowly but surely it took shape of a plane and flew directly over me. but this was not a plane. the lights were changing on it. some switched on and off, some had strobes. but there were no green and red navigational lights on the wings-- something that is required by law that a plane has to have. the shape of the planes suggested that it was a passenger plane. \r\n\r\nmy friend might not have been convinced that it was a ufo but i was. i have seen the kind of fake plane phenomena before.  i was prepared. \r\n\r\nwe left to go to hess. we stopped at a light and there was another mini sun ufo sitting in the sky. this time i had my camera. i was fully prepared. i had never seen this type of golden light before in the sky. i have lived here for 23 years. by two airports and this is not normal. \r\n\r\nafter the light turned green and i was recording, we took a left turn and the ball started following the car. a little bit behind the car, but it kept perfect pace with the car. in the video, i wasn't surprised by that because i was 100% sure that they were following me. \r\n\r\nafter we stopped at another light, the golden lighted ufo turned to fly over us, took shape of a plane and flew away. \r\n\r\n\r\nafter that night, i started to be \"followed. \" \r\n\r\nthe next night, november 12th, 2010, i went to the gas station with my boyfriend who was driving. there was a ball of light in perfect view of the station. i got it on camera. it hovered for 8 minutes, then started very slowly moving  and then started flashing like a regular aircraft and flew away. on our way up to new port richey, when we were passing a woodsy area in trinity, i saw another ball of light. this one keeping pace with the car. that is on the same video as the one at the gas station. the ball of light following our car side-by-side until it started flashing like they normally do and flew off overhead.\r\n\r\nnovember 13th, i go searching by myself with my camera, and as soon as i get outside and into my car i see a white orb-like ufo spit a smaller white orb out of it's back end and fall to the ground. this was high in the sky so i couldn't drive towards it. that is where i became frightened. i was starting to see these ufos in my neighborhood. i went on my merry way. when i got to the outer side of the semi circle(my house is on the inner circle)of the neighborhood, i saw two white lights kind of tilted sitting in the sky. they couldn't have been headlights-- they were too far apart. i tried to fumble around with my camera but i couldn't get it to work. i drove hurriedly to the shopping center to see if i could get it on film as it passed over and i pulled my camera out just in time to film the fly-over. this fly-over was very different. it didn't look like a plane. it had two with lights far apart, two in the middle close together and one on the side. that is when i started to put two-and-two together-- they were following me. \r\n\r\nevery night after that, my sightings have increased. when i step outside of my house, there are two golden mini-sun ufos sitting in the sky perfectly to where they can see me. if i had to describe how they are capable of this i would say that they can zoom in so far from such a distance that they can see everything you do. not only that but they can change their appearance to make it look like they are far away, when it reality they are much, much closer. when i get in my car to go somewhere, the golden lights follow me. they are always visible in my car. some time it will look like they are coming towards me when i am driving. when i get to a red light or a stop sign, the craft stops in mid air. when i take either a left turn or right turn, the craft also does so. a maneuver impossible for a regular aircraft. these crafts do not change lights when they turn. it looks like a plane that suddenly goes sideways. \r\n\r\neverywhere i go, they are there. the golden lights. i will try and show my friends but they all think they are planes. because the crafts are capable of blinking like a plane, everyone assumes they are planes. but the blinks are irregular. sometimes the blinking even stops for a few seconds and then continues. the lights constantly change numbers and colors and blinks. that is a violation of the aviation code. \r\n\r\ni believe they ufos are covered by a forced-sphere which allows them to shrink or expand their size. it also allows them to project holograms of any type of craft as well as take the form of any type of craft. they are anti-gravity and are capable of any kind of aerial maneuver possible. they can mimic the sound of the type of craft and change the lights on the type of craft also. \r\n\r\n\r\nthat brings me to my close contact sighting. \r\n\r\none day i was sitting in my house. the whole day i had heard a helicopter outside. all day this helicopter must have been flying around outside because the sound wouldn't stop.\r\ni had a hunch. i wondered if these ufos wanted me to come outside so they were making a lot of noise. after all, if they can take different shapes, i thought, it would be easier for them to project sound. \r\ni finally got sick of the noise. i remember saying \"alright. alright i'm coming. \" out loud as i headed to the door. it was 4:30 pm. i walked outside and there was a helicopter sighting in the sky pointing towards me where the usual golden light ball was. i looked right up at it and it flew away. \r\n\r\na few hours later, my boyfriend and i were heading to our friend's house in clearwater somewhere between the 14th and the 19th on november 2010 about 8 pm, we are about to pull up to the house when i see the biggest golden light i've seen so far. it must have been hovering the next street over. i looked directly at it and the light then dove very very fast into the trees the next street over and hid. i could see him through the trees. i yelled out loud because i had never seen such a thing in all of my life. it actually dove into the trees. i didn't have my camera that night, but when i got out of my car a giant helicopter came from the direction of where the golden light dove and flew over me. i couldn't see the helicopter. only the lights and i could hear the sound. it must have shape-shifted. i tried to call out of it to tell it that i didn't want it to go, and then one minute later the helicopter came back over the neighborhood and back to where the golden light i saw was. then two minutes later the helicopter came back over me and flew off. \r\ni heard the sound of a faint plane in the distance. a plane. and right as i was walked to my friend's garage, a plane that was about 3 stories from the ground flew over the neighborhood very fast and very low. it looked like an all gray plane with one engine and no windows. it had one red light on the left wing. the sound it made was very irregular for how low and close it was. i thought i was seeing things. then 5 minutes later the helicopter came from where the gold light ball had been and flew over me for a third time, but this time it sounded like a plane and not a helicopter. it was as if i was looking at a helicopter and hearing a plane. very strange. \r\n\r\nmy boyfriend had consumed some beers and went around the side of our friend's house to pee and i followed him because i wanted to ask him about the helicopter. just then, a white semi-invisible object flew right past our bodies silently and up over the house next to my friend's. i stood there frozen. i turned to my boyfriend and i said \"did you just see that? \" expecting him to say no like he always does. but this time he said \"you mean that shooting star over the neighbors house? \" the orb-like thing flew past us....Which means that it was hiding on the side of the house watching me as i stood in the driveway watching the helicopter go by. \r\n\r\ni was being followed still. by these ufos/orbs/whatever they are. \r\n\r\nthe next day i see the two headlight-type ufos in my neighborhood very close to my house. i got one in hd. it flew behind some trees and when it emerged it was a triangle shape. then it turned into a plane and flew away.\r\n\r\ni have seen one-winged hologram planes fly over me i have seen hot pink planes. i have seen hotpink planes with hotpink contrails when nothing else in the sky is pink. i have seen batwinged shaped planes. the wings are back the tips of the wings look as thought they are bent backwards.\r\ni see many things. golden orbs that turn into planes. \r\n\r\ni am being followed. every day. i feel that i am in danger. it was fun at first, but i don't want to be followed 24/7 anymore. \r\n\r\nlinks: please

highlands road and i saw a pudding shape object appear above my windshield just as if it had been above the car. it shot north following the road. \r\n\r\nas it was above the car when i first saw it, it looked more like a disk, but as it shot forward it took on more of a pudding shape not unlike a dome but it was not a disk. it shot forward from around several hundred yards ahead of the car to out of sight in a couple of seconds. just as it disappeared i saw several yellow balls or orbs streaking forward in the same direction.\r\n\r\ni stopped my car to get my camera out of the trunk but by the time i did that there was nothing.\r\n\r\ni have been watching the news and reading the papers ever since and i have seen nothing about it anywhere. i found out about mufon so i am reporting it. surely other people saw this? you could not miss it. it flew over at least a dozen cars and probably many more that i could not see. maybe hundreds of cars. it must have been seen by many dozens of people or even more. maybe hundreds.\r\n\r\nit seemed to be around the size of a car. it is hard to tell but it was not very big. it was around 12 feet wide. it could maybe have been 20 feet. it seemed to be around 100 feet off the ground. maybe 200, but as it shot off it elevated in height of miles which is why many people must have seen it.\r\n\r\ni hope that by making this report maybe some other people will come forward with photos. it is hard for me to believe that i am the only person who saw this ufo. i know that other people must have seen it. i can't believe that i am the only person who witnessed that object.\r\n\r\nit was not a plane or a helicopter. it was not anything i have ever seen. it shot off at such a speed, it could not have been anything man made. it went from

empty flight, maybe 20 or 30 passengers.  i was seated in a window seat in a row with no other passengers.  as we took off, i watched the night-time traffic below.  i noticed that along a hillside road that was lit with streetlamps, there was what i thought initially to be an automobile speeding down the road going way too fast.  it was following the roadway, so i thought it was on the road.  because we were off the ground and far enough away, i looked over to the main roadway to compare the speed of other traffic with the hillside object's.  the main traffic was creeping along while this golden light was zipping.  at the moment i realized how extraordinarily fast it was going, it zigged off the roadway over the hillside and i realized it was actually flying.  it zagged in the opposite direction, then zigged a third time as it skimmed over the water and i could see it's light reflected greenish underneath it on the water.  i continued to watch and then it submerged into the water, the light turned from gold to green as it did so.  it descended deeper and i watched as it disappeared and the water went dark.  i continued to watch for a minute or so to see if it came back up.  nothing happened.  i looked around to see if anyone else had been looking out the window.  there was nobody behind me.  there was a man across the aisle in a row all to himself, like i was, and he was reading a book.  i looked to the front of the plane to see the stewardess standing in the aisle straightening magazines or something, but clearly she had not been looking out the window to see anything i had seen.  i didn't say anything to anyone because there was really nobody to say anything to.  i'd never seen anything like it and wondered what it could have been.  it was confusing and made me think about it, realizing that i couldn't find any explanation for it.  i knew it wasn't a crash, because the water wasn't disturbed as it submerged.  it just seemed to sink in and it's speed didn't really change.\r\n\r\ni never mentioned it to anybody and forgot about for about six months when one day i turned on the history channel and a man was on the screen describing objects people had seen flying into and out of the water.  they were called usos.  i had turned the tv on about halfway through the program and watched it until the end.  i finally knew what i had seen - a uso.  i went to the library and checked out eery book i could find on usos and even ufos.  i read and watched any other program available on the history channel and other channels about these incidents.  now i know it isn't so uncommon.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

there were stars, the partial moon, and passing clouds.  \r\n\r\ni always look up into the sky when i go out (we have no street lights in our neighborhood, so it's usually easy to stargaze), and in the dark morning sky i spotted a single light moving very smoothly, perhaps 10 - 20 degrees below the moon, towards the lower right side (from my perspective) moving towards the northwest.  if i had to guess its altitude i would say it was in orbit and outside of our atmosphere.  it was white, a touch yellowish, appeared bright but to be at a very high altitude because its movement was fairly quick yet it wasn't passing through a great deal of the sky (it could be that it was traveling away from my perspective at a slight trajectory).  if i'd put my hand out toward it - it would be (at my arm's length) about the size of a seed bead.  \r\n\r\ni watched it for a second assuming it was a satellite, when i looked around it and saw a second one moving in exact tandem with it at a distance of perhaps (from my arm's length) a half a foot, to the left, away from the first one.  it was probably about 15 - 20 degrees to the lower left side of the moon (from my perspective), moving in the exact same speed and northwestern direction as the first light.  the second one was the same: speed, trajectory, size, and color as the first.  though, the first light (to the lower right of the moon) was brighter than the second one (that was on the lower left side of the moon, from my vantage point) and that might be because it was somewhat closer.\r\n\r\ni am aware that it is not unusual for people, during a sighting, to see three lights, moving in tandem, in triangular formation; so i searched for a third light but did not see one.  this does not mean that a third light was not there, as there was cloud cover moving over perhaps (on average, over the entire sky) one fifth of the sky, at that time.  i never saw a third light, though.  i only saw the two.\r\n\r\nwe see satellites, here, all of the time when observing the night sky and these were brighter (larger, too) than satellites.  but, i've never seen two satellites moving together, exactly.  these were.\r\n\r\ni ran back in to grab my cell to use its video camera, found it, ran back out, located the two objects in the sky, again, and shot footage.  the cell, unfortunately, could not detect the lights (perhaps because they were so close to the moon (fairly bright) and clouds (white) and the contrast was too much for the small (not high def) video camera?).  i've attached them, here, anyway.\r\n\r\nas i filmed, they moved in tandem (keep their exact same distance from each other always, never changing size or color or brightness, throughout my sighting), maintained their trajectory but never did seem to travel much of the sky as they both seemed to be moving away from my perspective.  it wasn't that they got dimmer or smaller but rather, (and i know that this sounds odd) they seemed to be moving at a steady and fair pace, but never traveled that much of the sky.  the only way i could perceive what i was seeing was to think 'perhaps they're moving away from my perspective'.  clouds would float between them and i, but weren't thick (at first) so, they'd re-emerge.  when each light went behind clouds and were hidden behind them (they didn't re-emerge) i stopped filming.\r\n\r\ni filmed two videos, in total.\r\n\r\ni did go out, about a minute after filming, to see if they were still there - but i could not detect them as the sun started rising at about 6:30am or so, this morning.\r\n\r\ncould what i saw have been satellites?  yes.  though, i looked at nasa's human space flight sky log database/site, right after my sighting, and searched for my location and the appropriate time, but did not see any two satellites that moved in the same direction at exactly the same time listed there (for my location and that time).  so, i have not proven that they were satellites.  \r\n\r\ni've never seen satellites move in tandem or appear to move away from the planet, so i thought i'd report these.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:08:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26743,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.0677628,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11262010-0003","longitude":-121.3062996,"occurred":1290781320000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1290798598000,"summary":"112610,

toward the north/northeast.  i stood up and looked in the direction he was pointing and saw a bright blue circular light moving in looping movenments in the air.  it would hover for a second or two then descend toward the ground.  other times it would move thru the air with a looping motion.  its movements never seemed to be in a straight path, it constantly looped or made curvy motions thru the air or it would rise or descend/drop out of viewing range as if it were lowering all the way to the ground.  then about ten, fifteen, twenty seconds later it would rise and do all the movements again.  sometimes when it hovered it would turn bright white but only for a second or two then it returned to the bright blue color.\r\n\r\nit did seem to travel at a very fast pace.  my bf seemed to be more
