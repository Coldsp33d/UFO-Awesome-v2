would test the 4 wheel drive in it on his property, besides, noone else was home so we were pretty bored. we ended up going to the ridge cause its close, (we didnt want to go far because we didnt have much fuel and didnt know if it would break down). now up here in the winter its dark by 430pm, and it was roughly 630 when we got up there. my bud left the truck running cause it was cold and he shut off the lights so only the parking lights were on, but we were talkin and i had just finished my smoke, while my buddy was just lighting one, and as i threw the ciggerette out of the truck somthing caught my eye. it was to the right of the truck about 100 yards, and it was kinda shiny and just the corners were lit up on it. it was in the shape of a triangle, maybe 40 foot off the tops of the pines. but as i was just about to ask my friend what he thought it was the tops of the pines lit up about 100 feet from us, so my friend shut the truck off including the parking lights in seconds flat cause  something was on the ground with a light and it was looking for something. it scaned the ground for 5 mins then the lights went away, but just as fast as it went away it came back and started to search around again. but this time the lights were brighter and closer. we sat and watched quietly, for another 10 mins and to be honest i was scared *(word removed--cms/sg) and im a good sized guy. i know that it wasnt a chopper cause they fly over head all the time, this was dead silent. the only thing that we heard was a low frequency hum.........Thats it. well  it seemed like the lights kept gettin brighter like they were gettin closer so i told my buddy we needed to get the hell out of there. but even after he started the truck and turn around it was still there, searching for something like it didnt care that we were there. it could have been up there for hours after we left. all i know is there is only one way in and there is no possible way to get a truck in were we saw these lights. i thought at first maybe some one had a wheeler up there but its posted property......And no sounds, not even the sound of someone walking which there was something walking around cause we could see its light. this was a very intense situation. i know people get all freeked out when they see things in the sky, but how would they react if that something was out of the ship walkin around by them????","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26736,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5502778,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11252010-0002","longitude":-69.1208333,"occurred":1290655800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1290740324000,"summary":"The

light on the horizon. i watch it for a good ten minutes and it never got dim or changed course(as far as i could tell). i happen to be driving in its direction on albany county rte 208. i even tried to catch its attention per say by flashing the high beams at it from time to time as i got closer. as i neared i started to go through all the possibilties as to what it could be(been involed in two other ufo encounters soo this isnt new to me). at this point im roughly a half mile away from it. as far as i could tell it was around 200-300 feet in altitude. the road starts to bend around to the right. as i come around the bend its on my left hand side. im going roughly 35-40mph. i caught right up to it. as i got really close i could see a smaller flashing light kind of behind the ufo. realized it was a helicopter coming towards it!! i stopped the car parralel with the ufo. now its maybe 600 feet from me. if i were to hold my hand out at arms length it was just a little bigger than my hand. while im doing this im listening. no nosie except for the approaching chopper. i get back in the car and make a phone call the place i work.(i dont own a cell, havent since 05. well im suppiled a company phone. basic model no camera and a restricted call list.) i called one of the people i work with. i needed to have some sort of other human contact at that point because i was starting to kind of \"panic\". he found it funny untill he heard the fear in my voice. those were his exact words. well back to it, as i got on the phone it started to move to the right. it had a white light shinning out of the back.Appeared to be the back becasue the direction it was moving. it then stopped again, the light switched ends and it started moving  slowly to the left. with in the next 5 seconds the end with the light lite a bit brighter and then shot off soo far the only thing i could see was a faint glimmer of the light in the distance. thats my encounter, havnt been able to sleep or think the same since.  also interesting is that where this happened is only minutes away from the thatchers park moutains. ive seen the same light up on that mountain randomly. now when i go up there to investigate theres no evidence. i can go right to the area where the lights would be and theres nothing but woods. maybe the same ufo, i dont know? i do know that im having a hard time

at first thought was a commercial airliner taking off from st. louis international airport flying over and away from the city in the distance. about the relative size of an asprin at arms length, i could make out a few white lights and a red light. the white lights suddenly flared up at the ends of the object and became much brighter and bigger, and it soon became a line of white light made up of smaller white lights that appeared to be quickly coming in my direction. the initial dimmer and smaller lights, if a common airplane, would appear to move slowly even if banking, but this object quite suddenly changed its appearance and now seemed to be not too far away and getting closer fast. i figured it must be a helicopter even though it seemed to change its appearance too quickly to be that either. now appearing to be a line of very bright white lights seemingly made up of at least two or more smaller lights in a row, at least five small red lights appeared in cluster at what appeared to be the top back end of the object as it approached, seemingly like a traffic helicopter might parallel the road but very low, perhaps at 200 to 300 feet up traveling along the outer edge of the westbound lanes of i-44. no structure could be discerned yet, just lights.\r\n\r\nthe red lights seemed to be changing in a cluster, and the white lights were flickering, and it was getting closer fast, and i had a hard time trying to discern what lighting i was seeing. when the craft was within perhaps 300 feet of me it started to strobe with a white flash that i could not discern the source other than the object. the last of the three pulses was extremely bright and made me blink, like a camera flash went off. after that strobing, there was a single red disk of light closer to me, and a single white disk of light further from me, which were on each side of a structure that appeared to be off-white in color. the \"fuselage\" that i could see looked like one long cylinder with two cylinders of the same size mounted half-way up the single lower cylinder, the two \"side\" cylinders half-way fused into the lower cylinder. the disks of light were just on either side above the side cylinders. i could not make out a beginning nor end of the craft, nor see its top. there was a bright white ambient glow at what would seem to be the top of the craft, like looking at light source in fog, but the lower structure of the craft could be clearly discerned. basically, anything below the lights could be seen of the structure, but above the lights was a glow that hid the top structure.\r\n\r\nthis all happened fairly fast, about 20 seconds, and i was trying to drive on an interstate, there were two cars in lanes to the left front of me. in my frequent glances i could yet see the bottom structure as it passed by me and i was focusing on the area that had the lights, and with the craft moving in the opposite direction of me i couldn't get an overall look at it. it was a very unseasonably warm night, and i rolled my window down when it passed. there were only two cars near me, and none on the other side, so the ambient sound was mostly just the wind blowing by. i have driven by many traffic helicopters and they would easily have been heard in this situation, but there was no indication of any sound coming from the craft.\r\n\r\nwhile i honestly could not depict the craft for several reasons, i could discern what i've related, which is enough for me to think that this was an unconventional craft. i used to make model airplanes as a kid, and while i was looking at the structure as it was passing by, all i could think was that it was like the bottom of the us navy's a-7 corsair. i could definitely see the a solid structure in a configuration that i'm not aware commercial nor military air vehicles have. the way the lights shined was also quite different than conventional aircraft lighting, it's hard to describe. the pulsing that took place when it was closest while in front of me caused me to be partially blinded in those times, and the last one lit up the highway like something was taking our picture, much brighter and wider in what was illuminated on the ground than the traffic light strobes that go off taking a picture of a car violating an intersection's traffic lights. that freaked me out a bit, and it seemed the other two cars traveling with me also let up on the gas as i did when that happened, so it seemed they saw at least that too. i was also a bit freaked out because this location where i first saw this craft was the last location i saw a triangle of white lights fly over me and turn off and back two nights before, november 20th, which i ironically had planned on and did report to mufon after i got home from seeing this one!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26711,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6007024,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11232010-0001","longitude":-90.3510589,"occurred":1290407400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,

came to get me, saying the aircraft was back. we went outside and watched it in the woods behind our house for at least an hour or so. it was trangle shaped with blue lights. it was less from a mile from our house. my husband thinks it was about the size of a large vehicle, but it appeared bigger than that to me. it hovered in the air in an unatural fashion, moving a little bit every now and then, but staying pretty much in the same area. it also appeared to rotate periodically. we did not know what it was, but wondered if it was military aircraft. our neighbor, ex-military, said it was not. my husband said he first noticed it by accident. that first night he saw it, he walked outside to change cars around and glanced up and saw it. we did not think to call the police, because it seemed unlikely they'd be able to do anything about it. we saw this same object every night for the next several days. we would check for it at night and it was there after dark, usually appearing later in the evening, after ten or eleven p.M. and remaining visible until the early hours of the morning. we would check periodically to see if it was still there, then get tired of watching it and go to bed. in the morning it was always gone. on the last night we saw it, we only saw it for about an hour or so. on that night, the moon was especially full and bright and there were a couple clouds in an otherwise clear sky. the object moved in front of the clouds at one point and we could make out its shape more clearly. it had a solid base, grayish in color and looked saucer shaped, which was strange because when we could only see the blue lights, it appeared triangle shaped. we watched as it decended and disappeared into the treeline, appearing to be landing. we have not seen it since. we

children looked up my brother in law said it looks like there's a 4th one when out of no where flashed on another light, totally freaked me out to see that, i was amazed and since then a believer, we went to the mall and shopped we came out about 830 or so and to my amazement they were still there so i'm trying to convince my husband there ufo and then the lights formed a vertical formations all

white orbs in a diamond shaped pattern rise fron the southwest at slightly above ground level and silently travel upward at about a 70 degree angle.  they traveled in unison as if connected but i saw nothing between them.  they rose to a point where my roof overhang caused them to be out of sight.  they traveled silently and in a flat plane and just before i lost sight of them it appeared as if i was looking at their underside.  they were baseball sized and seemed to be about thirty feet away initially and about seventy feet high as the rose in a north west direction.  i saw a single orb very similar to these about three years ago and recently reported it.  in both instances i felt a calm sense about what had just occurred. i then returned to bed as if nothing exciting had happened.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
