in an effort to perhaps catch a few meteors of the leonids meteor shower.  had stood myself in a good dark area on the patio so as to have a better view of the sky while enjoying a fresh cup of hot coffee.  i was facing due west and had a clear sky, no clouds of any type and an almost full moon, 93% waxing gibbous, directly behind me in the eastern sky.  \r\n\r\ni was leisurely scanning the dark night sky in hopes of seeing a few meteors as well as enjoying the view of vega and several other prominent stars and constellations.  cygnus looked very good as well as deneb and albireo.  i swung my eyes to the north and happened to notice something that at first looked very out of place.  but the longer i looked at it i focused more closely and realized i had something in sight that most certainly was not anything within what we could classify as the ���norm���.    \r\n\r\non first initial sighting it registered as a small light plane such as a cessna but then i noticed that the light configuration and brightness did not fit.  even more so, there were a total of five round lights, reddish orange in color yet rather dim in intensity.  insofar as size they were all the same size and appeared to me as being about half as large as the star sirius yet only one third to one fourth as bright. all individual lights were in a direct n-s line with each other, as well as evenly spaced from front to rear and moving at a very steady pace due south.\r\n\r\ni estimated, by sight only, that they were at approximately between three and five thousand feet altitude.  the rate of movement from initially noticing them until they were out of sight remained the same and could be liberally estimated to perhaps be at or about three to four hundred miles per hour.  \r\n\r\nfrom first sighting of these until they were out of sight there was absolutely no sound of any possible propulsion system whatsoever.   no standard aircraft position lights (red/green), flashing anti-collision lights or strobes were visible either.  there was but a steady, faint/dim brightness that never changed from beginning to end. they did seem to have a touch more of an intense red point towards the center but only enough to barely notice. \r\n\r\nas they moved steadily closer the second and third light began to separate from the main line upwards somewhat and then those two flipped further out to the side above the rest, spun around in what looked like a quick figure eight movement and then immediately came back in.  this action took place when they were directly in front of me.  only once they began to remerge into the line of the other lights all of them quickly transferred their flight formation into a very pronounce ���v���. by now they were to my left, due south, and had never slowed down.  shortly after forming into a ���v��� they then spread out into a straight line, east to west, but continued on south without any appearance of hesitation for those maneuvers whatsoever!  without question there are no aircraft that we are aware of that could make movements such as what i���ve described without obvious delays in their forward movement.  no change in forward movement occured whatsoever!!  even the blue angels or the thunderbirds cannot in any way shape or form make the same maneuvers as what these did as they continued in a very defined forward motion.  \r\n\r\ni had but only two or three seconds before they disappeared behind the trees.  i ran out into the street to see if by chance i could follow them more but no luck.  needless to say it was both surprising and very intriguing.  simply put, just what were the lights that i had just seen and were they experimental aircraft or the obvious other? there is no way of ever knowing for sure.  but i must say one thing ��� it was one of the most invigorating experiences i���ve ever had.  there is more in the sky than stars!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

anyone.\r\ni would like to report this sighting, because i found your site seriously.\r\n\r\ni was watching the sky with my small telescope with a 100-fold increase.\r\nthat night they were visible to the west, mars, jupiter and the moon (half moon).\r\n\r\nat approximately 11 hours pm a little below the moon, a red object appeared, almost as bright as mars.\r\ni quickly pointed my telescope at the object and was amazed at what i saw. a huge hexagonal object with a jet red below it.\r\nthe object was black, but you could see your way, because it was illuminated by sunlight.\r\nyour speed was relatively slow and i could perfectly accompany him using the levers of the telescope.\r\nafter a few minutes following the object, it has exactly opposite the moon, which gave me a reference to then calculate its size.\r\nfollow the object for about one hour, and from a certain point i no longer needed to move the telescope. at that point i was looking at the object underneath. that was approximately in the region of formalhaut.\r\n\r\nthe jet of energy emitted by this object was very different from anything i've ever seen in my life. it looked like a mix of \"flaring\" with laser light.\r\n\r\non the following monday i called the astronomical observatory of campinas, and did not give me much attention. they asked me to describe the sighting eto in the end i say, \"what you saw was a weather balloon.\"\r\nhonestly, i know a balloon. do not release balloons burst of energy, not hexagonal and not fly out of the atmosphere (so that the object was illuminated by sunlight).\r\n\r\ni then calculate the size of the object with the data i had on hand, i could calculate the minimum size of this object, and was surprised to reach the size of 17km (11 miles) from side to side.\r\n\r\ni would like you to get in touch with me and guide me on how best to publicize this sighting.\r\n\r\nmuch appreciated,\r\n\r\n*(wit's first name

\"enthusiast\", if you will. i'm constantly keeping my eyes on the skies, but up until now i've never seen anything that i couldn't explain(as much as i have wanted to see something). on saturday, november 20th at 7:22pm i was driving in the city of roseville michigan, going eastbound on 10 mile road, when i saw this strange light directly ahead of me, at what appeared to be maybe 200 to 300 feet in the air. at first i thought it might have been a firework(a roman candle) that someone had just shot off. but the light remained constant and didn't dim or go out, which is when i said to myself \"what the heck is that?\". i immediately pulled over onto a side steet and got out of the car to get a good look at it. at this point it was almost directly above me, and now looked to be perhaps 500 feet in the air. although it's hard to judge distance on a \"light\". there was no structure that i could make out, just a light. an orange-ish pink-ish hue, a color unlike any other light i have ever seen in the sky, and although not extremely bright, it appeared to have sort of brilliant corona, as if it should have been bright, but the intensity of the light just was not bright. kind of difficult to explain really. as i watched it fly past, it \"appeared\" to be moving at a relatively slow to moderate speed, steadily gaining altitude, and heading on a true and straight line trajectory. i would say it was climbing at a 45 degree angle. even though the speed appeared to be constant(slow to moderate) it didn't take long(about 90 seconds?) for the object to fade away into the distance, at which point i would guess it to be several thousand feet by then. like i said, it's hard to gauge distance on a light, and it was also small in size. if my estimate of it's height when i got out of the car to look at it is correct(500 feet), then i would guess it's size to be 6 feet in diameter. the light never varied in intensity, it didn't flicker, and it didn't change color. i don't know what this was, but i can tell you what it wasn't. it wasn't a chinese lantern. it wasn't a balloon. it wasn't a flare tied to a balloon. it wasn't any sort of radio controlled craft. and it definitely wasn't any type of conventional aircraft. it was simply a \"light\". close enough for me to see that it wasn't \"attached\" to any sort of craft, although the possibility remains that it was indeed a craft, that was \"glowing\". it flew, not floated, but \"flew\" like some type of craft. i don't know what it was, but i've never seen anything like it, and i can't for the life of me explain it. my very first ufo.

at 6.  for a small aerial view, if you wish to look at a map to understand, i was going south on industrial blvd from arlington (76011) to euless (76039) and this event took place at the intersection of trinity blvd and industrial.  \r\n    among my approach to the given intersection i noticed a darkish gray/silver looking balloon floating about in the wind as balloons do at about my 2 o clock and 100 feet or so in the air..Maybe 75 degree angle from the ground.  assuming it was a balloon, i looked away from the object and towards the oncoming intersection until i passed under a train bridge and looked back in that direction. it started wayy up there in the sky and was traveling closer towards me with awkward trajectory until it reached that 100ft height mark. at this point i still thought it was balloon, but the movements were so rapid, like it was either spinning really really fast and i could only see it at moments (like when you turn a fan on in the living room and stare up, you see the blades in still flashes rather than a big circular blur)  btw i apologize if i write funny..Just how its coming out.  egg shaped as it was at the time, it also looked as if it could have been shaking as dice would inside your hand before you roll them.  my eyes are fixated on the object when i reach the intersection at industrial and trinity, for i have a prolonged history in ufo attraction and am beginning to believe this specific event is out of the ordinary.  i stop as the 3rd vehicle back at the red light, and the object is now at my 9 oclock and almost right above me.  it is here that gets me.  the object switches on 2 separate rows of red lights on the bottom.  each light is rectangular in shape, and the rows are parallel to eachother and consist of 4 lights each.  no longer is this object looking as a well-rounded silver egg, but a triangle.  the corners on the triangle were still slightly rounded out as not to make points out of them.  the light is still red, and i am looking straight up with my jaw open as the object starts to move again.  this time without confusing movements.  it travels in the same direction of its flashing lights..Back to front and moving the same direction i would be moving once the intersection light switches green.  but before my light turns green, this object..Now maybe 20+ feet in diameter turns its trajectory around, and so i am free to see the full shape of the object, as light from the ground is barely reflecting off of its edges.  it looks dark, and quite frankly like a boomerang.  without the lights consistently moving on the bottom, i would definitely be saying that it was a boomerang shape.  it turns around as any real aircraft would.. by following the 'nose' of the craft.  or it was just slowly spinning like a top.  but my light turns green and this object is still flashing its lights, turning around and remaining completely silent.  i was on a vehicle which does not enclose me to sounds of the road, and i can definitely tell you there was zero sound coming from above me..Definitely not a helicopter and definitely not a plane.  at this point i am in complete awe and in full awareness of what i'm looking at.  i take off going straight, which is now the opposite direction of the moving craft, but the craft takes a sharp right as im looking back at it while moving with traffic.  it literally travels west almost directly above trinity blvd, moving shiftily up, and down..Up and down while still traveling down the road.  before i couldnt watch anymore because of traffic and an approaching highway area, it turns a spotlight on facing straight down.  mind you, this thing was easily a mile or so away now.  the spotlight was not exactly a laser looking spotlight like in independence day, but like a narrow cone and literally cut off at a specific point before it hit the ground.  maybe less than 2 seconds after turning the spotlight on, the spotlight turned off and the up and down bounce-like movements began again and it kept flying away.\r\n\r\nwhat is really really weird to mee..Is i love ufos, aliens..To talk with another planets race would be absolutely awesome to me..But for some reason this event has really kinda freaked me out.  i think it might be because what i saw exhibited extraordinary technology of which i would not have guessed??  the egg shape with a light color bouncing in the wind, left and right and up and down very very fast like a gust of wind had full control of it.  to it changing shape, color and size.  i don't know..But now, when i see a balloon in the sky my literal first reaction is that of fright.  and along those same lines, when i am driving on the highway at night and there is a highway light out, the shape and color of that dead light fixture is so eerily similar to the initial view i had of my encounter that i also feel fear immediately upon making eye contact with it.  i guess that is why i have taken so long to speak up to you guys.  \r\n\r\nbut there you go, i hope you get back to me because i would probably feel a lot better if somebody has seen the same thing lol.  btw i hear china is about to be the first to publicly break news of communication with another species.  that could be years from now, but its apparently in the works.  pretty cool being they already publicly announced they have ufo technology.  yeah, hope you enjoyed, get back to be if possible!\r\n\r\ni'm sorry i couldn't make this sketch photo big enough\r\n*(wit's first name deleted--cms/sg).","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

watching one of the nasa live cams and i noticed an object  fly near the top of the shuttle. i quickly took 12 screenshots, because this object was so obvious. what i saw is exactly what is in the photos here. i saw a gray metallic like football craft over the shuttle discovery.\r\n\r\nthe cam is not a video cam but a photo cam that is updated every 3-5 minutes. i waited for the next photo and between photo you could see quick motion video of the craft. it shot downward at an angle that was about 60-70 degrees shooting tot he bottom left of the screen. no at that moment i hesitated and could not believe i saw it move. it was a straight line, not a bent line and not curved in any way. \r\n\r\nit is my belief that this ufo was a probe, unmanned but remote controlled and was observing them working to fix the cracks in the shuttle tanks. was it there because it could see something bad happening in the future i wonder? the shuttle discovery was delayed from first week of november to now be launched on the 30th of november. \r\n\r\ni took only screenshots of cams that nasa has. this ufo was over the shuttle discover while repairs were being made. i cannot imagine how an alien craft could possibly get into a high security launch pad area without nasa security or radar towers becoming aware of it. unless of course, nasa did know about the probe, but did not see it as a

\r\ni was watching a live nasa cam and noticed three orb like white objects around the top area of the space shuttle launch pad. these objects did not seem to move in the video and i am uncertain if it was video or photos that updated every 10-30 seconds. either way, i saw no change in their positions. i watched, but the cam position changed so that all i saw was a close up view of the lower part of the shuttle. the orbs were no longer visible with this new viewing position.\r\n\r\ni googled the shuttle info and found that the shuttles launch was delayed on nov 3 due to a fuel leak and cracks on the space shuttle discovery���s external tank. this is suppose to be the discovery���s last voyage, but am uncertain about this fact. launch was now set to 30th of november.\r\n\r\nperhaps it is possible that the discovery was having periodic visits from ufos and this caused nasa to worry?? further investigation is needed.\r\n\r\n*(wit's name and other information deleted--cms/sg) & i often

see them so we will get used to them and not be afraid of them before they land here, and they are going to land soon.  so, after reading the whole website \"the new earth\", which took me six months of part time reading, i did go outside my house one night and look at the sky just for the heck of it, which i normally don't do.  the only thing i saw to look at was directly in front of me to the northeast and looked like what i thought was a planet of some kind, or a star.  i am not at all educated on the planets, as i was never interested in astronomy.\r\n\r\nit twinkled with red, white and blue lights that seemed to be revolving, but then as i watched it i saw it moving around, up and down, backward and forward.  that sure got my attention.  i just stayed and watched it, then went in and got my husband and he saw it too and we were both amazed.  then i called up my neighbors and my husband's nephew and they saw it and couldn't imagine what it was but didn't seem too interested in finding out.  i went inside but kept coming back out to look again.  it stayed there all evening, moving constantly, and i finally went in to bed at about 9 pm.  the next night it was there again in the same way.  this was two weeks ago.  now i am looking all over the sky every night at all hours and i see them everywhere when the sky is clear.  our night sky is literally crawling with these sparkling, moving, objects.  it is utterly fantastic to see.  during the course of a long night they travel closer to each other, away from each other, and they come into view over the trees at different places on different nights.  the one i first saw always came up behind one certain tree on my horizon, but last night it came up farther to the right or behind a different tree, not that close to the first one.  i can definitely see five of them in a circle around our town and valley every night, at probably the same distance away from earth.  they are identical in appearance.  but very late at night the stars seem to be much brighter and i can see more of the moving ufo's, dimmer and farther away in space.  two nights ago i went out at 3:30 am and saw a whole new bunch.  the one in the northeast was stationed quite close to the one that comes up in the east.  four bright moving objects were placed roughly in a square off to the right side of my house, in the sky.  none of these objects has ever come close to earth, that i can see.  they are in outer space but you can still see them with your bare eyes and my eyes are not that good.  i don't have a telescope but one neighbor does and she says she will get it down from a high shelf in her garage soon so we can take a better look.  i have looked at them with binoculars but i get pretty much the same view as without them.  no matter where they are in the sky, they never sit still.  i think it's because they want to attract our attention.  one day i called the local newspaper to tell them about it but they haven't returned my call.  anyone in this town could see them if they ever looked up and paid attention.  we are not too many miles from nellis afb but we are not in the nellis test range where they do their testing of whatever they test.  we are quite far to the west of nellis.  i want to get everyone to see these things.  even if we can't do anything about them we could at least have some kind of a dialogue going on.  whatever you think, i would like to hear it.  thank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

gso, nc my eyes caught sight of some lights in the overhead sky.  my minds eye thought it was a baseball field and upon realizing there were no fields in our area i screamed for my husband to pull the car into the center lane and stop.  as a car passed us the person screamed holy ****.  hovering 100 feet over our head perfectly formed in the background of the dusk of night was a trianle some 200 feet wide just sitting staring back at us.  we decided to make a mental note of the object, had no camera, and we just sat and watched it.  the 60 lights below were mostly the size of your first with three lights red, three green and three orange.  it didn't have any large lights only these small lights.  as the object starting moving west across the road we followed.  we were moving at 15 miles per hour.  as we turned the road to follow the object was no where in sight.  my husband and i though it was a stealth bomber and when we got home we looked them up and we also drew a picture of what we saw so our mings would no run rampant.  we called a local tv station to report and they said they had other sightings but unless it was spitting our flames they didn't care.  we called the fbi since it was the day before 9/11 and we contacted homeland security.  they didn't care.  we are both 62 and have never in our lives used drugs nor are we on any medication.  the stealth bomber has jagged edges this object was a perfect triangle and we saw it as clear as a bell.  we do wear reading glassed but thats all.  it did hover and it did move at 15 miles per hour and it did disappear.
