separation and displacement from my home. i am currently living at my parents home while searching for another place. i mention this to provide an indication of my current mental state of being at the time of this sighting. it seems all in my life has gone horribly wrong, and at the time of the sighting, i was in the process of speaking a rather angry prayer to the judeo-hebraic god yhwh, in whom i believe. at the time, i was casting blame toward him for my recent state of affairs. \r\n\r\ni had just endured a bitter argument which actually caused some suicidal thoughts for a few moments, but i recovered relatively quickly. i went outdoors behind the house and entered into a state of prayer while looking up at the sky.  during the prayer, i was facing due north of scottsbluff and was staring at a elongated dark nimbostatus cloud. \r\n\r\ni was angrily praying that i didn't understand what the purpose was for my being born, when god has permitted nothing to happen in my life that is successful. when i had uttered \"i loath the day i was born and don't understand why you would put me here to get nowhere in this world, and i don't even know why i bother to speak to you when it always seems to fall on deaf ears\",  i saw a bright star-like object descend from the cloud at which i had been staring. \r\n\r\nat first the object appeared to descend at a rapid rate. i thought it could simply be an aluminum-coated party balloon being blown about by winds, while reflecting the sunlight since it was only about 3:40 pm mst and the sun was at a 45-degree westerly position from the objects position in the north. the balloon theory quickly vaporized as the object became quite active. \r\n\r\nthe object increased in brilliance and jolted approximately 10 to 20 miles to the left of its former location, within a period of half a second (estimated based on the perceived altitude of the object in relation to ground miles per inch moved from perspective).  the object came to an abrupt halt, then shot to the right and past the position where it had begun. it then moved 5 to 10 miles to the right of its starting position within less than one second once again and came to a complete halt. \r\n\r\nthe object returned to its starting point and then ascended above the cloud for about 15 to 20 seconds. as the clouds moved away to reveal the object again, it began moving up and down rapidly, about 20 to 30 times with enough speed that it appeared to draw a diagonal line of light in the sky. it came to a stop and then began flying in a round circular pattern, performing 6 complete circles. \r\n\r\nthe object then ascended and moved back above the cloud and remained out of sight for another 10 seconds, then it began to slowly descend below the cloud where it came into view again, then went back up above the cloud. this ascending and descending occurred 3 times. on the third time of ascension, the ordeal was over and the object wasn't seen again. \r\n\r\nconsidering i was angrily praying when the object occurred, i was quite stunned and fear-stricken. while i'm not absolutely sure this sighting had anything to do with my angry prayer at the time, it seems to be more than a mere coincidence to me, giving me the \"feeling\" that \"something\" was observing the commotion i was making, since i was speaking toward the sky out loud. \r\n\r\ni remembered the last utterance i had made before this object of brilliance appeared and i gave in to awe at first as prayer turned into a very silent period of observation of the object. once it had concealed itself not to be seen again, the awe turned into a rapid heartbeat and a sense of fear as i finally was able to move - at which time i went back into the house and mentally repeated what i had seen over and over again for nearly 3 hours after. \r\n\r\ni realize many of scientific mind may want to gain a deeper insight into how the mental/spiritual state of people may be influencing at least some of these sightings, and i have provided mine openly so others may take these things into account. i am concealing the information that led up to my marital woes, and the names of my family members for privacy reasons. however, i believe the \"mental climate\" i was experiencing at the time of the observance may play a very important role in why i saw this \"thing\" whether demonic, angelic, or other-worldly alien. \r\n\r\ni can tell you this much, however. no human being could survive the abrupt stops, or the rapid changes in altitude this thing made. i also feel i wasn't alone in the sighting, as all of the neighborhood dogs were barking ecstatically the entire time i observed the object. once it ascended above the clouds, the dogs continued barking for about 3 minutes after it

(think of holding a flashlight at a 45 degree angle pointing up)\r\nat this point i noticed that i was correct that it was missing the clearance lights (or whatever those flashing ligthts are called) and i wanted to adjust my binoculars a bit so i took them down. after fixing them i spotted it again. it hadn't moved very far at all and was about the same size in the sky as previously. probably took about ten-fifteen seconds to adjust lenses. but when i tried to find it in my binoculars i couldn't. once again i lowered them, and found it with my eyes, tried to put the binoculars back on it and couldn't. i looked through them for about 10 seconds and when i took them down again the object was gone.\r\nit wasn't that it had traveled so far that it became too small to see. it had simply dissappeared. i felt really excited about it and at this point i went inside and told my wife what i had just

wings, but this object had none.  it was bright white, and looked segmented (long white section, then a small grey section, white section, grey section, long white section), kind of like a centipede), and it flew in a straight line.  when i first sighted the object, it was already pretty far away, and yet in the sky it was the size of a dime (which makes me estimate it was at least the size of a football field).  and it was traveling at a high rate of speed.  in no more than 5 seconds the object was completely

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had entered the 101 freeway headed east from the 7th street on ramp.  just north of the freeway at that location is the deer valley airport.  as i drove past the cave creek road exit on the 101 headed east, because traffic was moving kind of slow i was watching out the window of my vehicle to the north, i saw what at first appeared to be what i perceived as a small light aircraft white in color which was also headed in easterly direction that seemed low in the sky and maybe 1/4 mile north of the freeway which is to say relatively close.\r\n\r\nbecause the aircraft was quite apparently in my field of view from the driver window position i proceeded to roll down the window on my vehicle so i could see it better and traffic was moving slowly along as it often does in this area during the morning drive time.  when i rolled down my window i could see quite clearly that the object had no wings and was a bright white color with no other markings.  at this time my thought was that the object looked a lot like one of those military drones because it seemed to be pretty close to the freeway yet not exceptionally large like a small airplane might be at that distance.\r\n\r\nthe object was traveling in easterly direction in a stable flight path and seemed to be slowing somewhat although it could well have been that i was beginning to pick up speed in my vehicle as traffic was beginning to move a little faster.  i felt that i had that chance then to observe the aircraft as closely as i could before resuming normal freeway speeds.  i could see that the object had a cigar shaped front end which had led me to the idea that it was a military drone because they sometimes have that cockpit area that is enlarged.  i noticed then that the object also had a cigar shaped rear shape and was basically a cigar shaped cylinder.  \r\n\r\nas i was observing the craft i kept asking myself to try to determine how far away it was because as i looked closely, although the object appeared to be quite close the edges all around it looked blurry so it made it hard to tell if it was a bigger object far away, or a smaller object nearer by. i was then ready to stop watching the craft because i needed to pay attention to my driving as traffic speed was picking up.  as i looked at it as best i could, it disappeared.  i searched the sky all around and couldn't believe that it was gone in an instant like that.  i was looking right at it when it disappeared.\r\n\r\nas i continued to my morning destination, it annoyed and kind of even angered me a little inside because i kept asking myself if i had a perception problem with what i had observed, or had i seen something unique.  it also made me feel that way because there was a lot of traffic and people driving where i was located that could easily have seen it and i wondered if others had seen it too but i had no way of knowing.  \r\n\r\nseveral months ago i saw a similar object in the sky in this area just east of deer valley airport.  the craft was further away and was moving in and out of the hills there.  this is an area of approach to the airport and the reason i noticed the object then was because of that very thing, that the object was not flying in a normal approach type pattern.  \r\n\r\ni am reporting this because of my hope that others will come forward if they have seen something like this in this area.  when i told some friends what i had seen it felt to me that the words i was using to describe it just sounded ridiculous and trite and i felt like i must have sounded like some kind of idiot.  it bothers me to feel like that because i saw what i saw.  it was not a completely mind blowing extraordinary thing to see yet to me it was something quite unusual and difficult to explain from my own perception, much less trying to explain to others. \r\n\r\ncould i have been seeing something totally explainable?  sure.  could i maybe not have that good of eyesight since i am getting older?  sure.  i personally don't believe that is the case but i don't want to feel like some kind of idiot so i am gonna hit send and report it. i hope you do the same if you have seen things in this area of north phoenix.

it.Then a few minutes later she called me back(she spotted another one). all u have to do is look up.I live across the river from the airport..They have radar.All i can say (they must be flying above radar). they do look higher than a plane would be..To all those who dont get it.Just look up maybe i should report them everytime. but that would be every night just about..Ya'll need a repeat button

sitting outside this morning on my break at 4:30am local time hoping to observe some of the leonid meteor shower. \r\n\r\ni only saw 4 meteor streaks when i was outside, so i kept moving my line of sight in order to see if a different direction would have better action. at 4:50am, i noticed a 'star' located in the vicinity of the big dipper (i don't have that much knowledge of star names and locations) that kept grabbing my attention, because it looked like it was 'twinkling', but the other stars nearest to it were not. this 'star' was very small, like the others nearby, so i'm guessing it was a great distance away, or just not noteworthy in size. flagstaff is a dark sky city, so light pollution is very minimal, and it's easy to see a wide range of stars. there were no clouds to block the view. \r\n\r\ni assumed it was a satalite at first, because of the size and the fact that it was wobbling a bit, but it wasn't following a path. it kept returning to, from what i could tell, what was the same spot (not sure at that distance.)it was the same color as the other stars, but it kept changing it's brightness, lasting a few seconds each time, right before it would move. it would move about it's spot like it was a pinball in a machine, very irradic. when it would move, the light would blur out a little from the object, and it would move fast, zig-zag, make 90 degree turns on a dime. the whole area this was taking place in could have easily been blocked out by my pinky finger nail. there were two stars nearest to this object, and they formed a scalene triangle with the object, but i believe this was a coincidence unrelated to the object. after the whole 30 minutes i stayed watching it, a nurse came outside and we chatted for no more than 5 minutes. when she left and i looked back at that spot in the sky, the object was barely noticable, but i had to get back to work. \r\n\r\ni know it was a meteor shower, but there's no way that was any meteor fragment. anyone
