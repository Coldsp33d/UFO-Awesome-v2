lower than other aircraft that i see in this area as they approach bradley airport 16 miles, or so to the north.  because of this it caught my attention, and it looked a little different than other plane i have seen from the distance i was viewing it, perhaps 3/4 of a mile away at first.  i continued to drive south with anticipation that i would get a better look at it as it passed over near me.  i got to the light at rt 4.  the object was now hidden behind trees.  i turned left on to rt 4 and looked out my right side window.  i picked up the object again.  it was about to pass over my truck.  i pulled off the road and stuck my head out the left window.  i saw a rather faint outline of a triangle shape. at first i thought it was triangular.  i sort of cleared my eyes and stared again - it was straight over the top me.  i confirmed that it, indeed, was a triangle shape. the rear two angles were a rounded radius shape. now i switched my concentration to the pattern of lights on the bottom.  this is when i realized i was looking at something very different.  there were 3 rectangular, rather large, lights spaced apart going along the bottom center of the object.  they did not broadcast light, they just seemed to be illuminated.  if the object was 25 feet wide at the rear (widest part) these lights were like 5 or 6 feet wide and 4 feet the other direction.  there were 2 small strobe-like white lights on each side of the craft (perhaps half-way along the edge of the triangular side).  and there was one red light located somewhere along the center.  towards the front, i think.\r\n\r\nthe object was moving a constant rather slow speed.  it kept moving north in a straight line until it was out of my sight.  when it was straight over me it was the size of a half dollar held out at arms length.  my guess is that the object was about 800 feet above me, but i'm not sure. no sound.  i feel this may have been a secret government aircraft.  can't rule out it may have been something else.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26632,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.7277778,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08062011-0050","longitude":-72.8402778,"occurred":1289881320000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312666591000,"summary":"Saw trangle shaped object with rounded (radiused) rear corners fly straight over the top of me.  three rectanglar white lights down the middle.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":263,"locationName":"Farmington, Connecticut","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:85098"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Wagoner","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my room at 9:28pm i was having some trouble going to sleep, and i saw an odd shape in the sky so i get up looked out my window, it had two lights on both sides that where on the whole time, and one time all of the lights came on, all the lights were on the bottom,there was just enough light i could see the out line of the ship,it was disk shape with a dome top.I was pretty calm just frozen. i would have pictures but my sister wouldn't let me use her camera, the funny thing is she told me in the morning i should of came and got her camera. if you held a quarter up with one eye closed it would just barley cover it.

i spoke with a very nice police officer in the early morning hours of 3-5-2007 about this occurrence and his name is \"clint.\" clint works for the st. charles parish police department. he informed me that on the night of 3-2-2007 he patroled highway 90 not far from the 310 entrance and this is exactly where the occurrence happened. he was also on duty at the exact time of the occurrence. clint stated that he did not see anything like this occur and there is no report of it. in fact no police departments have any reports of a huge animal being hit on the road in this area but i have the picture of this strange looking large animal below! i believe the police officer was being honest but this adds even more mystery to this event. it appears to be a mixture of many different animals. it has a long tail and it's head appeared to me as a beautiful golden head of a camel on the night of the occurrence. a few months ago a friend of mine went with me to the audubon zoo here in new orleans and we showed the image of this animal to a zoologist. he said he would be the one to speak with about this strange animal that we wanted to show him the digital image of. he looked it over carefully and was amazed at what he saw. he said he had never seen an animal like this and could not figure out what type it could be. crytozoologists cannot make out what type it is either. it appears to be made up of many different animals. the average person might call it a cow, horse, etc but close observation shows it is not any one animal type. i have the original sd card saved of the pictures i captured that night. i did this to prove that my images have not been edited or manipulated. the only thing done to any image below is the car was lightened because the image was to dark to see prior to lightening it. \r\n\r\nif you look close at the road that the animal is lying on you can see a circular pattern on it as if something landed there. one of the zoomed in images of the 3 ufo's in they sky above the occurrence shows intense colors and energy about it. notice the mustang car has an alien figure that appears on the side of it with what looks like a hand holding some type of phone. the back part of the car appears ghostly was if it vanishes. oddly the men on the scene of this accident do not appear in any of the pictures. the strange animal was huge and covered the whole right side of the lane. after i arrived back home i called all of the police departments in the area of occurrence including the state police and no one had any record of this incident occurring. i spoke with the st. charles police department where the incident occurred and they stated that any time an animal is hit in there area everyone knows about it. they had not record of it and the cars passed the accident scene very fast as if they did not see anything. \r\n\r\napproximately 8 hours later i drove back to the area of this occurrence with my dad and nothing was there! there was no blood on the pavement, no animal, no car, nothing! i know exactly where this occurred because this is the only route i take coming back from houma to kenner. it is right by where i get on 310 that takes me back to the kenner area. highway 90 is the only way to and from where i live to houma, la. highway 90 near boutte, la is where this incident occurred. \r\n\r\nduring this event i noticed a stillness like no other and it was as if the universe was standing still for a few moments. a very enlightening and moving experience! i have my own beliefs in regards to what i witnessed since i have always had a very strong faith in god. after this incident i have been able to share a lot of information to many people in regards to aliens and there purpose for visiting us here on earth. (1.7 million on myspace) the book of ezekiel has many passages that express words that would make us think of modern day ufo's. i do know that i did my research and what i witnessed that night was not from earth. the image of this strange animal is unlike anything here on earth. in fact when i arrived back home i zoomed in on the image of this animal and at the head appears a very evil looking image of something. i have this image below also. i do have the original images saved on the original sd card from the digital camera i used that night to take the pictures. of course now i wish i would have tried to make contact with the men on the scene but at the time i did not know how signifacant this event would turn out to be. \r\n\r\ni have had some other incidents where i witnessed ufo's etc, but not quite like the night of 3-2-2007. there was an incident this same year (2007) near kentwood, la that i witnessed. it involved 2 18 wheeler trucks and one was on fire. after i passed the 18 wheeler that was in flames a triangular shaped ufo hovered over the woods very close to my car. i did not have time to take a picture but viewing it gave me a wonderful feeling. i felt as if the aliens in the craft had great knowledge and held the answers to many unexplained questions we seek. the ufo took off in the direction of the 18 wheeler on fire. i made the next exit (about 3 miles or so) to head back in the direction of the ufo. when traveling back i heard fire trucks but then nothing was found in the area of occurrence. i do have a picture of one of the trucks laying across the interstate. i plan to go back the the area of boutte, paradis, la more often and i hope i can capture something significant to share with many people. i have looked over these images many times and there are even some words that appear at the bottom of the image of the car but i cannot make them out. i shared these images with numerous priests and pastor's and they believe i was blessed with the gift of visions.

and stare at sunsets and clouds or the appearance of the first stars in the sky.\r\nthis monday evening was warm and the sky was clear. there was a beautiful sunset and the seagulls were returning from their feeding day at the dump. the seagulls fly in a southeast to northwest direction when returning from the dump. in the morning they always fly the opposite direction on their way to feed at the dump.\r\n\r\nwhile watching the seagulls i noticed a reddish/yellow cigar shaped figure moving in a southwest to northeast direction across the sky. my first thoughts were, wow, that plane is reflecting the sunlight in such a beautiful way. then i realized the sun was behind the object, from where i was sitting, and the sun had already set behind the mountains.\r\n\r\ni continued to stare at the object to see if i could tell if the object was producing the light itself or if it might be a reflecting the sun in some other way. i then realized the object was quite large and was completely lit up by whatever the light source was. it was the only light and it did not blink or change colors. there was no halo to the light. just a solid light, almost not appearing to be a light, but none the less a very bright light. well, maybe the whole object. i say the whole object, but it was very high in the sky so maybe only part of it was lit up. whatever it was the part that was lit up was very large.\r\n\r\nabout the same time i am realizing how large the craft was by the light i was also realizing the object was very high in the sky so high i should not have seen it. i should have only seen a contrail. growing up as an air force brat you understand from experience a plane that high in the sky cannot be seen or heard; only the contrails can be seen. this object had no contrails, and was very large. at this point i decided i was seeing something i have never seen before and at that point it stopped for a few seconds and then went straight up until it just disappeared.\r\nthe craft never sped up or moved in a zig-zag motion. it moved in straight lines at the same speed until it stopped for those few seconds before ascending vertically.

thing lasted about 8 min's,,my house is one of the approach routs into atlanta airport i see a ton of aircraft every day but nothing like this. ***also i had a ufo fly over my car comeing from a drive-in-movie back in 1967  a long dark hwy,it scared my date so bad that she never went out there again,,,and i just wrote it off as a ufo--but now iam re thinking that whole night----what did we

o'clock position, it looked like an airplane was moving westward at a typical speed.    it had the appearance of a planet - just a bright point in the sky - bluish in color.  i suppose it was this brightness that caught my attention.  no blinking lights.  however, it quickly accelerated and appeared to take a slight altitude loss trajectory.  the point of light continued to accelerate quickly and moved from our 2 o'clock position to the 10 o'clock position in about 1 or 2 seconds... then it disappeared without any notable changes in the appearance (no flash-out, etc).\r\n\r\nthe driver of the car also witnessed the event.  we both were surprised and amazed at the speed of the object as well as the obvious acceleration.  we wondered if it was meteor, but the light intensity did not change and it did not create a tail or streak so there were no signs of typical re-entry.  \r\n\r\na subsequent google of meteors and the like did not match what we witnessed, which is why i'm

the normal approach corridor on their way to salt lake city international airport. planes typically appear in the south-by-southwest, about ten degrees from south toward the west, then proceed northerly toward the airport, passing west of my residence. noticed another object that i thought was a plane at first, though it didn't move. i re-evaluated the object as a helicopter, and stared to see what kind of helicopter it was (was considering news, police, or private helicopter).\r\n\r\nobject appeared to be the same general kind of light affixed to aircraft that the planes were using, though different in quality (i'm colorblind, and so it may actually have also been a different color). i did not feel that this craft was at first any kind of extraordinary object. something was different about the light--something i can't quite put a finger on. i did not see the object itself; i merely saw the light, and noted that the sky conditions at the time were cloudy and overcast in the area due to precipitation. clouds to the west were breaking up.\r\n\r\nthe object then moved at a high rate of speed to the west, seemingly without really accelerating to that speed--it was just moving quickly, and started very suddenly. within 1-3 seconds, the object crossed 30 degrees of sky and disappeared behind some tall mountains. seeing this, the hair on the back of my neck stood up, and i felt a little upset, though also excited. i spent the next 2 hours researching aircraft and did not find any that seemed to be capable of something like that. i then decided to file this report.\r\n\r\nthe entire experience lasted less than a minute, but it seemed a significant amount of time. i am guessing about 30 seconds, though i did not have a timepiece with me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

bright, yellow-white lights close together. the lights were very different from the street lights, car lights, and building lights in the area. all those lights looked washed out compared to the floating lights. the floating lights were also significantly brighter and larger in diameter.\r\n\r\nat first i thought they were landing lights from a plane flying really low. as i approached i realized the lights were stationary and then thought it must be lights on the end of a high pole - perhaps they're having a carnival in the parking lot of the mall again. as i came to a stop in the left-hand turn lane at rochester and avon, it was about 20 or 30 yards away (west and slightly north) and about 4 stories up... and still not moving. i keep thinking to myself, \"i can't be the only one seeing this\".\r\n\r\nthe thing that stood out most was how i had traveled a mile with this thing in full view and it never appeared to move at all. no wavering, nothing, even when i was right next to it. it was just hanging there steady in the same spot.\r\n\r\nat this point, i could make out a third light, and the three lights formed a triangle, but i could not see anything between the lights at all. i pulled out my iphone and shot 3 pictures, but only 2 came out (not very well, either. i have an iphone 3g so it's not hd).\r\n\r\nafter about 10 seconds it started to move south. it didn't accelerate, it just started moving at a slow, constant rate. as it moved over the parking lot to my left (west), i could clearly see its shape since the ground lights were illuminating it from below. it was a triangle with equal lengths on all sides and appeared to have no markings at all; just a flat, \"grayish\" surface with lights on the each end. i could not tell how thick it was. as it moved, the lights faded to nothing over the span of about 6 seconds and then i couldn't see it at all even though it was fairly close.\r\n\r\nfyi, it was raining slightly and there was a slight \"haze\" in the air.\r\n\r\nthis may be unrelated, but when i crossed the road two miles back i saw four police cars with lights and sirens blaring as they drove through the intersection of rochester and auburn roads. two continued west and two turned south.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

by two people on 10/26/10. second triangle was a different shape.  very elongated triangle\r\n\r\nthe witness for first event took us to the field and we walked the field during the day.  the field had been plowed and bails of hay were there in the area.  we found a spot where it was circular with green grass on outer edge and center has a bare spot.  appearance was that nothing was growing in the bare area.  rain may have washed out any imprints.  it may be that the bare spot in the middle may have been created by the tail end of the triangular object.  geiger counter showed no readings.  see attached photo.  witness indicated the lights were white and went down the side of the triangle and it was hovering when she first got a glimpse of it from the highway 2 area.  object suddenly turned straight up with the tail down when she drove past it.  she turned around farther down highway 2 and went back to get a look, but it was gone.\r\n\r\nusing michael schratt's drawings of classified aircraft she pointed out that it looked like the tr3-b aircraft.  it was about 3 stories high based on her view from the highway.  estimate is the object was about 300 feet on each side.\r\n\r\n10/26/10 event:  husband and wife were outside about 10:30 pm looking at the stars through their telescope.  they happened to look up and saw a huge elongated triangle right above them.  it blocked out the stars and sky and they thought it was about the size of a city block.  back end appeared to be concave.  it was black with single rotating white lights on each corner of the object.  no sound was heard.  it moved slower than an airplane, but also disappeared from their view quickly. they live in the country where neighbors are not very close to each other.  land has large trees

my plans in life were to get me and my two boys off the east coast. i wanted to move to montana because i thought we would be safe there. i also wanted to go to the montana area because whatever i am i knew there would be others like me. \r\n\r\ni can meet people and i either like them or not just by eye contact. whatever this intelligence is that has came to our earth is like an energy force that can jump into a human and leave at will. you can tell when this occurs when someones eyes may change colors. i have seen these light things and they do not bother me. there is something else here on earth that is not good. i get really cold chills and have time lapses when these things are around. what ever these things are they can take you driving down the road. an example of what i am talking about is like when you drive somewhere and get to you're destination and you dont remember the trip. this time lapse thing began with me back in 1996 and 1997. may of this year i have had something that i cannot see bothering me when i am sleeping. these things can touch you! they seem to like to poke me allot to see if it hurts. most of the time i aknowledge that whatever is there and i ask for it to go away. \r\n\r\nthere are beings on this earth that are attempting to help us and there are also beings that would like to destroy humankind. these beings can jump in and out of the human body. \r\n\r\nthis is my opinion about our current world-china is our biggest threat. the new world order began in 2009. the power grid and banking systems will go down. it is important to hold on and hide as much cash as you can. keep you car filled with gas and stockpile food, water and antibiotics. a sign to look for is when our military starts closing down military bases. when this occurs know that the time is near to get the heck off the east coast. i feel there is going to be nuclear war. the only safe places to go are going to be the north west. \r\n\r\ni have been working for 4 years as a cna. i work at a place called cleveland pines in shelby, nc. i love my job but it is not what i was sent here for. i want to be on the border working in montana. i am going to re-apply and try again. \r\n\r\ni found you're name on jesse ventura conspiracy theory. i think that you are doing great work! \r\n\r\nsincerely, *(wit's name and phone numbers deleted--cms/sg) i do not have voice mail set up but i keep my phones with me at all times.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26608,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.3544795,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11162010-0006","longitude":-81.6253434,"occurred":1157698800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"West Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Flash,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289941049000,"summary":"Attack on amtrak enroute to work for customs and border protection duty station piegan, montana","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1530,"locationName":"Charleston, West Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:85117"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Farragut","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was *(wit's job info deleted--cms/sg) on halloween night. this night my wife was at work with me and we were sitting listening to coast to coast on the radio. she called to my attention a dancing star like thing in the sky. the lights seemed to be very bright coming off of the thing. it appeared to be the same altitude as most airliners usually travel. the thing stayed in one spot in the sky in the direction of oak ridge. i am not sure exactly what direction that would be in. this thing appeared to bounce up and down real fast and from side to side i remember once that it was making several large figure eights. i called one of my **(info deleted--cms/sg) that was working in oak ridge and gave him a general direction to look and he seen what i was seeing as well. but he had brought to my attention that there was more than one of these there were about 5 of them spread across the sky in a direct line doing the same thing. the thing appeared to be made up of red green and amber lights, but i could not make out any details of the crafts. the other lights that he had pointed out were just white with the center being multicolored. a good way in describing the movement would be to watch the director of a symphony, the tip of his wand with a light on it and that is all you could see. would look a lot like what we saw. two weeks later, one of my other fellow employees was working just east of where i was that night, was guarding the construction of a new subdivision and called me scared to death, she had seen a light coming down the side of a mountain in the valley she was working in, all she could hear was the wind, and a perfect circle of light was coming toward her(she described to me looked like a searchlight on a helicopter) but there was nothing there to be making the light. during my incident me and my wife had this eerie feeling of being watched but no missing time, except for my wife had dozed off and had a nightmare that creatures were trying to get in the car, but i was awake the whole time watching this thing. now being three years later i still have nightmares of walking outside looking up and seeing this, and or running away from it.\r\n\r\ncould someone please get in touch with me and try to give me a good explanation of what this was or if others have witnessed the same thing.
