directed by jan harzan to submit.\r\n\r\ndear mufon, i decided to finally talk about the \"shadow beams\" after jan harzan said i should.\r\n   i also decided because the first three occurances were in july/august 2010 and the 4th, which was the deciding instance happened in june 2017. after this 4th incident i was so curious i needed to tell someone.\r\n   the first three occured west of reedley, ca off of manning ave at riverbend, smith and bethel ave's. all were northside of manning. the fourth incident was at olive and floyd west of fresno, ca. all occurances were exactly the same in all detail.\r\n   as i drove east on manning i noticed a shadowy cloumn to my left which seemed out of place. as i got closer what came to my mind was a shadow, but from what. i stopped my truck on the south side of manning and got out my 30x80 bino's and started looking at it and it was visible and i looked up following the beam but could not see any object at any elevation that could cause such a shadow. it seemed odd because the sun was further to the west and could not be responsible. i walked along a fence line closer to it (50 ft) and since it was an open pasture i'd go through the bobwire. i walked right up to it, about 10 feet away. i didn't hear anything strange or feel anything. i kept looking at it and looked up but could not see anything except the shadow getting smaller as elevation increased. i was very puzzled. i even put my hand in it but nothing happened. i just stood there with great curiosity and it was making me crazy because i could not come up with a good explanation. i walked back to the fence and through it and then walked south to the road while i looked back at it a few times. i kept looking back at it while i crossed the road, got in my truck and headed towards reedley.\r\n   the second and third sightings were basically the same. i saw it, got out to investigate and returned to my truck. the third time i had my camera and took about 7 minutes of video hoping that some manipulation of the video would reveal something but i was disapointed when after using several tools i could see nothing. i played with the contrast, brightness, sepia, negative and used several different color filters and could not get the shadows to show up. i figured this was more than just a shadow because i have taken much video and shadows do show up. this would not.\r\n   my fourth sighting was basically the same but just a different area. i couldn't understand why i could never see any object that would be causing a shadow. kinda like when an aircraft flies over and you see the shadow moving along the ground or even an exclipse, there is a large patch of \"shadow\" on the earth from the moon. as i could tell with my high powered bino's, i could see at least up to 50,000 feet and more and i never viewed any object that could cause this unless it was in stealth mode. another strange thing is that when these sightings took place the sun was further to the west and could not be responsible.\r\n   i wanted to share this because i am aware of natural phenomenon and this is nothing i've ever heard of.\r\n   i always look to the sky, day and night because thats where the good stuff takes place and i've seen many odd unexplainable things but this i have no explanation. maybe someone else has seen something like this and may come forward thinking what they saw was just too weird to speak about.\r\n   i know what i saw and i am of sane mind and soul. i'm crazier without an explanation.\r\n\r\n   thanks mufon.....","distance":"20 Feet or

silver metallic saucers that disappeared into clear blue sky, never reported that or the other 3 times i have witnessed ufo's (with another person). anyways: i took 2 pics of son, then 2 selfies with myself and son. as i stood up finishing last pic, i saw some black object very quickly go across sky and into cloud cover. i dismissed it immediately thinking that i imagined it and it must have been only in my head, maybe i was low on iron, or maybe cuz i took to many drugs in distant past, i didn't think any more than that. we went about our day. in the evening around 5pm i called my wife in ca. we were in in. away from wife, so i told her of the day and sent her pics. that is when i discovered in the last pic the very black thing that had moved across the sky. there also seems to be some sort of portal looking thing that is in the position to where i remembered seeing the 'thing' go into cloud cover. very very strange indeed. i also have other incidences i never reported.(4) and the craziest one had a big l shaped ship, soundless, 'floating' over a road while a friend and i pulled over in amazement to watch. it had 2 small white lights on underside and no light witnessed in fog under ship, 2 super bright white light circles on the ground. as we drove off, i looked back and it had sped quite a distance away already and i was amazed at how fast it had sped up and was now 1/4

would like to narrate what i experienced when i was in the 8th grade. since it has been a long time since the event took place, i can’t remember the exact date, but this happened sometime around april/may, 2000.\r\n\r\nfour of my friends and i were lying on our mattresses on the terrace of our building, chatting and looking at the stars. there were no clouds in the night sky. it was around 2:00 am. most of our neighbors were sleeping at that time. our summer holiday was in progress, and that’s why we were not worried about sleeping early. we didn’t have to go to school the next day.\r\n\r\nin front of our building there was an open ground where we regularly played cricket, a popular sport in india. there was a well somewhere near the middle of the ground. the well was always filled with water. on that particular night, the level of water in the well was approximately 6 feet below ground level. there were some bushes around the well.\r\n\r\nthat night, while my friends and i were chatting, we suddenly saw a flash of bright, white light 50 to 60 feet above the level of our terrace. it was a three-story building. we immediately got up and ran toward the edge of the terrace to see what’s going on. we were stunned by what we saw! a glowing spacecraft was slowly and vertically lowering itself directly above the well until it came to a halt on the ground, positioned exactly above the well. the spacecraft was a partially-flattened oval in shape. the door of the spacecraft flapped open vertically downward until the top of the door rested on the ground. immensely intense white light emanated from the interior of the spacecraft when the door opened. 5 or 6 adult-sized, humanoid figures in spacesuits ran out from the craft with torches in their hands. the beam of light projecting from each torch was very bright and white, and had a laser-like appearance. the ‘aliens’ searched around the ground near the well for 7 or 8 seconds with their torches, and then ran back inside the craft. then, the door of the spacecraft shut instantly and the vehicle slowly rose upward for about 100 feet, and disappeared from sight. my friends and i were left spellbound. the whole event lasted about 15 to 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe next day, my friends and i went to the spot where the spacecraft had landed to search for any evidence of the event, but there were no footprints or objects left behind as proof. some neighbors talked of some kind of ‘big lightning’, but they had no clue of what really happened. none of them had seen what my friends and i had seen.\r\n\r\nat the time this event took place, i was very ignorant about any of this sci-fi stuff, including intelligent extra-terrestrials or spaceships, or even basic astronomy. my friends and i kept talking about the event for nearly a month after it happened, often inquiring from each other if we really saw what we saw, and each time we had these discussions i was reassured that it did really happen. it was not just a figment of my imagination. with the passage of time, this event faded from my memory, until a few days ago when a colleague of mine mentioned his interest in aliens. we happened to generally be talking about are topics of interest during a coffee break. i told him about my real-life story and he was pretty astonished to hear it. he was the one who mentioned your organization, mufon, to me, and so i decided to share my story with you.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line

past 12 midnight.\r\n\r\nas i got out of my vehicle i happen to look up and take notice of nearly full moon and it's brightness. immediately i noticed at first a blue blurry object just below the moon. it was hovering and then motioned from left to right, but staying within vicinity of the direction of the moon in the sky.\r\n\r\ni got a very strange feeling that i was looking at something other than a star so i put my glasses for distance and began taking cell phone pictures.\r\ni zoomed in and out to try and give it scale. \r\n\r\nas i began taking the pictures my observation was that the object was going through a blurry transformation of shape and color.  while i could not be certain what was taking place, i was positive whatever it was, it had to be significant in size because the distance looked many miles away and high above the horizon up in the sky.\r\n\r\nafter 10 minutes i went into the house to get my roommate to take a look at it and when we went back outside it had disappeared from view. there was no opportunity to witness it as it left from the vicinity i had originally seen it.\r\n\r\ni went into the house and downloaded the pictures onto my computer to verify what i may of taken pictures of and i was astounded at the \"change\" that took place before my eyes knowing i had taken all of the pictures in under a minute. at one point it looked \"cylindrical\" in shape and changed again into an unknown shape as it hovered and made no sound while i observed it.\r\n\r\nall stars in the sky were faint and didn't even show up in any of the photos from what i can tell. no idea exactly what this was, other than a defined ufo.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then

the distance of possibly 2 to 6 blocks west of me but i didnt know how to estimate the altitude.\r\n\r\ni immediately noticed something strange..As the object had no blinking lights, only a bright orange glow to it that never changed intensity or color. the light looked spherical. it made no sound. i dropped my suitbag and case on the sidewalk and turned back to my car to grab my eyeglasses which were on the passenger seat. i closed the car door and put my glasses on. the object was on the same flight path in a straight line going south but it slowed down. it didn't lose altitude or move up or down..It just slowed almost to a hover but then it slowly regained speed again and continued in a perfectly straight line south. i had snapped a photo with my cellphone. then i proceeded to turn on the video camera on the phone.\r\ni continued to photograph the object for about another half minute when it seemed to make a right- angle turn west and move due west. as it continued west it faded out within 15 seconds and i couldnt see it anymore.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

the time was 9:32 exactly. because of the sighting i had the night before i was being extremely observant of the skies. it was almost dark but the sun was setting and the sky was clear with no cloud cover. we turned the corner off liberty street that runs parallel with the golf course. as soon as you turn onto this road you have a clear view of the golf course and the skies above it and as soon as i looked up there was a huge glowing disk shape craft just hovering above the golf course. by my estimation it was hovering just above the club house at the time we turned the corner. as we made our way down the street to our house the craft seem to move closer towards the houses that lined the 3rd hole of the xourse. i stopped the car as soon as we came up next to the school on our right hand side, the golf course and the craft were on our left. i immediately froze at first have been shaken already from the even the night before i couldn't believe it was happening again. this size of the craft was huge! probably about 300 feet long. it was pulsating lights of yellow and red around it and it seemed to make no sound. we parked the car and just stood there looking at this massive disk whapped craft. we stood there for about 10 minutes. i took my phone out to get a video because the night before my phone wouldn't work around the objects and i wanted to try again. this time i was able to get about 18 seconds on video before the craft started to move towards us even more and when it moves overhead of the homes on the course my phone shut down again. this thing scared my daughter and my girlfriend. you can hear them on the video getting scared when it seemed liked the craft was reacting to me filming it. after my phone shut down we got in the car and i took my family home to be safe. i dropped them off and i proceeded to follow the craft on foot throughout the neighborhood. it flew directly over the treeline of the house on the golf course for about another 10 minutes at a very slow speed . then all of a sudden i could hear helecopter and jets coming from the air force base in vienna. as soon as i heard the first jet, the craft took off to the northwest almost toward cleveland. i then saw a bright flash that looked like lighting and the craft was gone. the sky was then littered with planes and helecopter flying in circles around the liberty/girard area. this event shook me to my core. there were also about 4 other cars slowing on the road looking at this object as it flew by. it was amazing and freightening at the same time. we live in a very small, quite town and my neighborhood is a lot of young families so to see this object so close to the house and the ground 2 nights in a row was very strange indeed.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
