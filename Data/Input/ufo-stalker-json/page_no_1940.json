 we live in camarillo california and observed the light/craft from our balcony which is oriented facing west-northwest.\r\n\r\nthe light or craft appeared to be glowing brightly orange-red.  the light seemed to undulate or grow brighter and then dimmer. the light appeared to the west-northwest and slowly moved due east, appearing to get closer and larger.  we observed several other aircraft in the sky at the same time. the normal civilian and military aircraft's lights were noticably different than the light/craft that we were observing.\r\n\r\ni am a former usaf air trafic controller trained in aircraft recognition, air traffic control and weather observation. i could not readily identify what i was looking at.  it did not have standard aircraft lighting. eventually as the very slow moving light/craft crossed to a point where it was relatively straight across and up from us, it simply vanished to my eye. my wife believed she could still see something/ some form after the light disappeared.\r\na few minutes after the light \"disappeared\" another light-craft appeared on the horizon at approximately the same point the first one appeared.  it followed the same \"flight route\" and again disappeared near the point where the first one disappeared.  i observed the second craft through binoculars. the light or glowing red/orange color appeared to be sandwiched between a \"hull\" or craft shape.  as the craft moved closer, the single glowing light seemed to turn into four small red lights in a diamond pattern...Just prior to disappearing.\r\n\r\nthe view from our porch/balcony looks out almost straight across the camarillo airport.  there is also pt.Mugu nearby.  we have a lot of air traffic around us.  the light/s we observed appeared quite different and larger than any other air traffic that was visible. no strobe light, no red or green safety lights like normal aircraft. it appeared much larger than any other aircraft in the sky simultaneously and had a mildly pulsating glow.\r\n\r\nwe captured both craft/lights on a amatuer sony home video camera.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what we observed but my wife and i are interested in reporting it, sharing our video and finding an explanation however ordinary it may turn out to be.

best describe by the planes being completely vertical, flat and fanning each other, nearly missing each other. then they disappeared. there is a point to my west where the bight (i live on petty's bight named so because it looks like someone took a bite out of the beach) where it jutts out, the plane seemed to disappear behind a bush but i thought that would be impossible since i did not see or hear them again. my 2 daughters were sitting in the living room and when i asked them if they just saw that event that took a matter of seconds. one said i saw it and the other said i didnt see it but heard plane engines. i am a pilot and always observe the sky. there is a small private airport next to my house called rose airport which is rarely used and harbors no planes. these planes were never seen again. i could describe them in detail but the defining mark was at the wing tips appeared to have round plates, not oval which i have seen before, these looked like pie plates. please contact me

saw ufos over seattle around the same time on july 4, 1947.   at the time, i was a 22-year-old student at the nearby university of washington in seattle.  the time was around 5:30 pm in early twilight. woodland park overlooked puget sound and the olympic mountain range to the west. i happened to look up and saw a bright, oval or sphere-shaped object descending straight down from the upper atmosphere.  as i looked on in sudden surprise, the object made a very sharp and  almost 90-degree turn to the horizontal and then sped south along puget sound at high speed.  the object was silent and white in color. the total time of the sighting was probably ten or 15 seconds. at first, i thought the white object was an airplane but an airplane would not have come right down from the upper atmosphere and then make a very sharp right-angled turn to the horizontal with no noise of motors    the object seemed to be heading toward mount rainier (about 50 miles south of seattle) and mount adams and mount st. helens. after ten seconds or so, the object disappeared from view to the south as it sped south along puget sound. on june 24, 1947, pilot **(name deleted--cms/sg) and prospector ***(name deleted--cms/sg) reported seeing nine silvery \"flying saucers\" moving from north to south over mount rainier and mount adams to the southeast.  on july 4, 1947, pilot ****(name

idaho.   on july 4, 1947, a seattle city bus driver and other witnesses in the university of washington area said that they saw ufos over seattle about the same time that i saw the object oer woodland

driving northbound and glanced up  in the sky and spotted a shining metallic object. it was a beautiful autumn day, sunny and crisp, clear skies as far as the eye can see. what caught my attention more than anything was the lack of movement from this object in the northwestern sky. the object was stationary with the sun shining off it's metallic and cylindrical shape. it's hard to judge how far away it was, all i can say is that it wasn't very close, but wasn't very far away either. \r\n\r\ni only saw it for about 10-20 seconds before i rounded a bend where my view was blocked by trees. approximately 20-30 seconds after losing visibility, i hit a clear stretch of road that enabled a good view. the object had inexplicably vanished. nowhere in the sky was it to be seen. \r\n\r\ni am familiar and an avid follower of the \"mysteries\" beyond public recognition, such as extra terrestrial existence, secret governments, the potential and nature of human consciousness, etc. having seen many videos and photos of ufos, i almost immediately recognized the object in the sky as one of them. rationally speaking, had the object been a plane of some sort, there's no way it could have gone from unmoving to completely vanished in a mere 20-30 seconds. as stated, it was a very crisp and clear day, and had the \"plane\" flown off, i would have spotted it somewhere in the sky, yet there wasn't a single trace of it. \r\n\r\ni have read a theory before that most ufo's cannot be seen because of the dimension they are in. but if they linger too long in the earth's atmosphere, they become visible due to the gravitation pull. and if they stay long enough, they become permanently part of this dimension. \r\n\r\nunfortunately, because of the short time i had to react, i could not snap a photo or take a video with my phone. this is the first time i have potentially seen a ufo, and i'm sure someone else out there had to have seen it. keep in mind that wright patterson air force base is nearby in the dayton area. so seeing planes fly by is an everyday occurrence. the unmoving, metallic structure, and inexplicable disappearance of this object is why i believe it was not part of the air force.

on the walkway and waited for my puppy to finish up. it was cold and i was just looking around in the sky since it was clear and you could see all the stars. i was looking up and then i looked forward and i saw some light come up from behind the trees, it was quite a bit away from us but it was really bright. it looked like a star in the sky but it was brighter than any other star in the sky. i nudged my cousin and told him to look at it because i didn't know what it was and neither did he. as it was still going up in the sky at a slight angle it then started going faster still really bright. so i ran down my driveway into the road to get a better look while my cousin stayed with my puppy by the house. i was kinda freaked out simply because i didn't know what it was and why it went from slow to fast that quick and why it was so bright. at first i thought it was some night launch the space center was doing but from all the night launches i've seen, they never looked like that or did what it did.  my cousin yelled to me that it was turning and coming close to us in which it was and at that point i got kinda scared and  i turned and ran back to my walkway where my cousin was. as it was turning it got closer and wasn't as high in the sky as the stars were. the brightness of it went down and all you we could see was this thing flying in the sky and were trying to see if looked like a plane or something like it. it was kinda a disc like shape and it had lights but it wasn't flashing the way planes do. planes usually have two flashing lights on the each side and varies in color, what we saw was it had multiple lights (kinda yellow kinda orange) that were flashing left to right in a horizontal line. we couldn't see the other side of the object so we weren't sure if there were lights on the other side of it or not. when it was closer to my house it got slower in speed and it kinda turned east and went in that direction at the same slow speed. we lost sight of it due to the trees being in the way and we couldn't go any farther to chase it in the sky. i was a little freaked out from not knowing what it was and kinda in disbelief of what we just saw. we tried coming up with what it could've been: a rocket night launch from the space center, some kind of plane, a shooting star (but i thought that couldn't be it cause shooting stars don't go up and then hover with lights). and we figured planes couldn't and usually don't make that kind of random speeds and turn that fast then slow down and hover with strange lights like that either. it was very bright too so we couldn't explain it.  and after that happened we started see shooting stars randomly in the sky. i didn't have time to get my camera or video cam but i drew quick sketches of what happened.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26580,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.8609675,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11142010-0022","longitude":-81.6761034,"occurred":1289634300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

is 26461 for that sighting!\r\nback to the hovering object....My son & i watched it spin,move up and down and side to side. when viewed thru the binocs you could make out a shape but then it would shift, it appeared star like with many points and faceted like a diamond.Sometimes it would look saucer like but on it's side with white spikes coming out of it. it seemed to have a protruding light on it's side which i called a nose.\r\nafter watching this with my son for about 15 minutes i called my husband to come up front and take pictures with his new  toy a cannon powershot 4000.He took about 10 pics with different settings which i will try to upload. they came out really good for his first attempt filming at night a non-stationary object.Well after about 30 minutes of this my husband and son were cold tired and bored with it so the went home.\r\ni decided to drive down the highway about a mile  to where the object had slowly moved (probably not a good idea for a woman on a lonely country highway chasing a ufo to do).It was now across the street from my friend *(name deleted--cms/sg)house. i pulled over the side of the road and called her and told her to go outside and look across the street up in the air, above the trees at the light. she asked me what is that?I told her i dont know but i am coming over.\r\narmed with my binocullars and *(name deleted--cms/sg)with hers we both watched in amazement this brilliant colorful morphing object..She said well thats not a plane, a helicopter,satelite,planet or star, then what is it!? the object was moving upwards and to the north but very very slowly.At times it had a purple halo around it like a black light.After watching it for about 20 or 30 minuutes with her she then noticed a second object that was pulsating! this one was  gold, smaller but also star like shaped (like an christmas tree topper with many points).It also made the same movements as the other one.\r\nat about 9pm i decided to call it a night and went home.This am about 5:30 i went back out to our drivways end to see if they were still there but it was overcast. i could see an occasional star peeking thru the clouds ,then i noticed a tiny light moving over head towrds the north. i pointed my flash light at it and bam it lit up like jupiter for about 10 secs then disappeared or cloaked,it was under the cloud cover when traveling north.\r\ntonight we will go back armed with camera and tripod to see if the objects will still be here.Last feb we had something similar to this  that stayed here for 2 weeks, every night same time same place.My husband thought maybe it was some kind of fixed satelite or station but i think they are not stationary.Anyway this will be our familys 5th report with mufon in 2 yrs. we have had other interesting sightings that have not been reported but told to our mufon invevstigator **(name deleted--cms/sg) has visited our ranch out side austin and witnesed with us unussual activities in our clar clean night sky.My friend  ***(name deleted--cms/sg) who i met on the mufon chat board call where i live ufo alley.....\r\nphoto one..Notice the orbs...The bright one is the object...The 3 rd object u may need to zoom 200%\r\nwe have more photos if interested..I hope i picked the best ones\r\nsorry for this long report and not so great writting skills:) \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26573,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.9153269,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11142010-0015","longitude":-97.1391315,"occurred":1289635200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Diamond,   Disc,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289777024000,"summary":"Thought it was helicopter hovering above  field but no noise/lasted for hours","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/26573_submitter_file1__IMG_0039.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/26573_submitter_file2__Objectoverfieldwcarcoming","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/26573_submitter_file3__IMG_0029.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Flatonia, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:85561"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Lyon","country":"France","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This ufo was a typical delta wing but huge, it flew in from the channel way from what seamed england. this ship dropped smaller ships after appearing from the coast. one of these small ships landed in my garden and then exploded and left behind a small perfectly spherical metal ball.
