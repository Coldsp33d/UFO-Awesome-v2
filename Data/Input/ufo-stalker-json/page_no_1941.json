changing color, size and shape.  the colors ranged from red, white, blue, and amber/orange.  about the same time a chopper from the north (unidentified) approached; the lights diminished and seem to vanish.  a few minutes later as the chopper retreated to the south, the lights appeared again.  they were very bright, but not at the same time.  it seem to be a game of lights between them.  others began to appear later around 7:55 pm towards the north/northwest carrying the same characteristics.  they seem to stay in the same position for some time.  they formed an arc or triangle at different points on the sky.  one being on the horizon, the other directly above it and then one over the city lights in the west.  more started to appear and there was a total of 5 flashing and become bright changing from the colors of white-red-orange.  this happened about 8:20- 8:30 pm.  then as they began to ascend higher, they solidified into a low orange color, and \"glided\" away.  they formed a noticeable arc in the sky.  when i saw them i knew that they werent planes or weather balloons with flares as most of the experts would state.  i know what planes look like, i see them every night.  this has been happening for the past two days, but the real changes occured the 13th between the hours of 7:35- 8:40 pm.\r\ni was excited to verify that my feelings about them were correct and able to see them for the first time instead of watching from others.  i wasn't even thinking or looking for them, i was feeding my cat when i noticed them.  \r\ni'm not concerned with their agenda, because we humans have no real control, only our government which continues to deny everything.  they have better technology and as far as i'm concerned they will do what they want regardless of our desires.  i just wish that the government would lie so much in a silly way with \"weather balloons, children's balloons, rc helicopter, military flares, unamed rocketeer, etc..\"  don't they know that most people

panning across the sky in them. the first three north pictures contain a white line in the sky that appears to have two spheres within it or along it, one bigger and one smaller and in different positions in each picture - although the white line appears to be in the same position in the sky in each picture. each attached image is a cropped of the original, two rotated to compensate for the unaligned frame and house - no other adjustments were made to the originals. why this appears to truly be an unidentified flying object, by definition, is that two of the pictures had a twist in the frame relative to the horizontal line of the house top. when that was compensated for with software, the white line-sphere object appears to be in the same position in the sky! what's different in the images is the amount of light the camera let in, the positions of the spheres of the line, and the slight differences in the frame of each due to photography only being a hobby of mine and i couldn't crop them exactly the same. even with my intermediate knowledge of digital imaging, i realize that it is unlikely that a camera anomaly caused these images as the white line-sphere was in a different position and angle in each original, yet rotated and cropped to the same position which is more likely of an actual object in sky there. the three pictures span 17 seconds. another picture of the north taken almost 4 minutes later did not have the object in it. i did not see the object with my eyes at the time, i noticed it when i downloaded the images from my camera to computer two days later. these are all cropped images yet all are at 100 percent resolution of the camera image

sky after 10:30 pm. it also moves slowly in a zigzag and circular or oval pattern in a small area. i want to know really what it is. i say craft, because it could be alien or human. i just don't know and want answers. the other one, not filmed, was only around 1 night on wednesday 11-10-2010. it was out that night for only 40 minutes in the north west close to the horizon. about the video. my dv camera is about 8 years old and doesn't have night vision, but i was using night shot mode with low lux enabled. the only editing i did was clip the shaky movement out after the camera would try to focus on the intense bright blue, white and blinking light. the blur around the object is from me zooming all the way in very fast. my feelings of the object is: i get very fixated and intrans-ed by it. i feel like i could some how communicate with the object. very weird feeling. i am happy that i have finally seen one of these things with my own eyes, but at the same time a little scared too. i have also noticed 2 other star-like objects next to small dipper constellation. they blink same way but with less intensity. so, the ufo i have filmed and the other 2 star-like objects would make a

the cloud lines. it kept going on a straight path slowly just blinking with a strobe like with it.....But what caught me off guard was it stopped and ziz zagged fast in a pyramid formation fast and then went back onto its course it was going and it just vanished...It was like it slowly cloaked itself after that formation. i personally don't believe in all that but when i saw that i about fell

moving left to right across my field of vision.  i observed this object for approx 2-3 mins. also during that time there were several civilian jet liners and helicopters in my field of view and they were dwarfed.  when i 1st observed it i said to myself thats a really bright blimp, then after a few seconds of watching it i concluded that i did not believe it was a blimp anymore. i lost sight of the object because i was in traffic and had to take a left onto 285.  there are a lot of sporting events this weekend so i guess it still couldve been a blimp, but i thought i should report this after

 very clear below about 1000 to 1100ft overcast clouds. (pretty common weather in around north san francisco bay).\r\n\r\nas i was driving east on hwy 37, past skaggs island, about 3-5 miles west of vallejo, i saw two bright, white lights in the sky.\r\n\r\nat first, they appeared to be two landing lights from a larger airplane. i didn't pay too much attention to them, i just noted that it looked like an airplane, going in the same general direction as a \"right downwind\" for runway 6 at napa airport (kapc). if it was a private jet in the pattern, they'd be at ~1000 ft - and that's about what it looked like.\r\n\r\ni did start to notice that the \"airplane\" seemed to be \"downwind\" longer than normal, as it didn't turn right, to base, as it should have done - so, i started watching it more closely.\r\n\r\nmaybe it was a helicopter? but, a helicopter doesn't have widely spaced \"landing lights\". maybe it was a helicopter with an advertising grid below, with 2 large lights? it seemed odd to me - and since i'd never seen a helicopter with a lighted advertising display, that would have to been pointed towards me so that the \"directional\" landing lights would stay a brightly white, from my viewpoint.\r\n\r\nthen, oddly, the two lights, that were level, seemed to bank and turn left (to my right, as it had seemed to be heading towards me).\r\n\r\nwhat was odd, is that the two lights, didn't change in intensity, but moved at a relatively slow speed.\r\n\r\n\"landing lights\", are \"directional\". if they aren't pointed at you, they, basically, go out.\r\n\r\ni'm a licensed pilot with quite a bit of night flying experience - and being based up north of san francisco airport, you can watch the landing lights of the passenger jets take off at night and watch them wink out as the jet makes it's turn after takeoff.\r\n\r\nso, when this \"thing's\" right side light seemed to drop, and it seemed to turn \"left\" (my right), back south(ish) towards central vallejo, it really stood out that the 2 lights didn't change in intensity at all. that would infer a non-directional light - and that wouldn't be on an airplane - as a non-directional light that bright, would blind the pilot's vision. then, as it seemed to still be at about 900-1000 ft, i saw a string of perfectly spaced and aligned 7-8 dimmer lights tying the two bright light together. it was dark, but, if it was a black triangle, these smaller lights would have been the \"aft\" lights. \r\n\r\nwhat was odd, and different from my first impression, was that the right side bright light stayed ~30 degrees lower than the upper left light (as if \"it\" was still banking) - but, the two lights stayed offset and the pair of bright lights (and the 7-8 dimmer lights connecting them) began obviously traveling east, at, i'd guess, at 40-50 mph. (as in def not 10-20 and def not 100) it wasn't turning anymore, it was traveling east over hwy 80 up the auto mall \"valley\" - still with the two lights offset in height.\r\n\r\ni'd been watching it over the napa river bridge, through vallejo (on 37), past 6 flags amusement park.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of it while taking the 37 / 80 west offramp. behind the overpass. i caught a brief glance of it looking backwards on 80 - then i couldn't see the 7-8 dimmer lights between the 2 bright lights, but traffic was a bit hectic there.\r\n\r\ni took the first offramp and doubled back on admiral callaghan, i couldn't see it right away, but, about at the target store, caught a momentary glimpse of an extremely bright, lighted spot about 850 ft up on the valley ridge, behind a rocky outcropping.\r\n\r\nlater, looking at google earth,i'd guess that it was 100% on the way to the top of the hills (that night, i could see the outline of the ridgeline). the lighted spot was pure white, reflected light, and i couldn't see any particular point of light, just a very brightly lighted area 50 to 100 ft in diameter up near the ridge, behind the rock outcropping. there was only a single intense white reflected light and it lasted for under a minute. there was no smoke rising, eliminating a flare as a possible explanation.\r\n\r\ni lost direct line of sight behind the auto dealers and when i got to the top of admiral callaghan, i couldn't see the light on the hill anymore.\r\n\r\ni went down to auto mall parkway, turned right and kept looking up to find the lights again.\r\n\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nin recreating my initial view, what i first had thought was \"downwind\" on rwy 6 at kapc, was wrong. the lights were over the northern edges of the town of vallejo, a few miles south of the airport, about inline with the napa / solano county borders.\r\n\r\ni'm 100% sure of the 2 non-directional lights, the 7-8 dimmer lights and the slow speed, the altitude and the light on the hillside. no smoke, no flicker, no pulsation.\r\n\r\non january 4th, at about 6pm, i called the faa tower at kapc and asked the controller if they had had any other sighting reports on the 23rd. he didn't, and he checked with the controller on duty that night, and he didn't see anything, either. the lights would have been to the south of the tower, behind the controller's visual operating area (runways are north of the tower).\r\n\r\nduration of observation, about 10 - 12 minutes.\r\n\r\nif someone else describes a similar sighting, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nif you were driving east on hwy 37 the day before christmas eve in the early eve, you probably saw it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

plus times and this was not it or even close, and the time made that impossible. i ran to the house to get binoculars,(15 seconds max). upon return, the object had vanished, and i have a clear view and no obstructions. moon was low in western sky but had not set yet. i scanned it's estimated path and it was gone, both by eye and with bino's. tonight i was doing the same routine and noticed the same object a little earlier, but it was lower in the horizon but obstructed by trees in the horizon and was unable to obtain picture or a good view. it remained visible for about a minute, but at a much greater distance, and about the same west to east path. definitely not a plane or satellite. it was difficult to determine if it was a fattened disk or cylinder, but it was large. much larger

thought that it was impossible to get in on camera because it was to far by that time.By the time everything was over we were feeling like did we just see that or what ...

driving home to maple grove from downtown minneapolis this afternoon. we are wondering if anyone else reported this. we were traveling on west 694 about 2 miles out from the 94 interchange when we spotted a large round object over maple grove.  it looked to be the area of rush creek golf course.  at first i thought it to be a hot air balloon but the closer we got the farther west it moved at incredible speed. (this when things got bizarre) we turned onto the 94 exit and then instantly turned off onto the weaver lake rd exit and came up to a red light. while waiting along with a number of other vehicles we could see the large round object (with no distinct features) had turned and traveled back east about 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute and was hovering over boston scientific complex, about a ���  mile to a ��� mile wnw clearly in view.  we were watching this in amazement when out of nowhere (right in front of us) a large black unmarked military style helicopter shows up and approaches the object. right as this is happening we got the green and turned left onto weaver lake rd. we made the left turn and noticed the helicopter had veered off to the right of the object. thinking as soon as we get to the top of the hill (not even a ��� of a mile) the object is going to be right there in front of us. the object had completely vanished. we traveled about a ��� of a mile down the road and could see it had traveled west about 5 miles in less than a minute. my next thought was it seemed to be over rush creek elementary.  i drove up to the school and had a great view for a long ways west. we saw the object but it had traveled as far west as we could see about another 5-10 miles. i proceeded to drive north on 101 until i got to county rd 30 and took a left. and it just may be coincidence, but right after we made the turn there was a trooper sitting off the side of the road. we did see the object again, but it was so far away there was no way we were going to get close to it. \r\na few facts here;\r\nno hot air balloon is going to travel 5-10 miles west and turn around and return east the same distance if not more in the matter of a minute or less.\r\nthere were a lot of people that saw this.  anyone traveling on west 694 at this time of day saw this.\r\nhot air balloons can���t travel distances this thing did. this thing could travel 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute. i called the police department at 7:30 to see if anyone reported anything on this but the dispatcher said she just started working at 5:00 and had not heard anything.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

instantly. there were planes in the distance but all of the planes looked like planes and \"all the planes\" had long trails behind them. what we saw was a 'shiny, metallic sphere' that made no trail when it instantly traveled to the east. within several seconds of the new location to the east... it vanished, just completely disappeared instantly. we were shocked and were looking all over the sky for it. it was gone. the whole experience was less then 6 minutes. i know what we saw was a ufo because nothing can be that high up staying stationary -
