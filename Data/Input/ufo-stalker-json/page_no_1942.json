States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Around 7:15 pm on nov. 11, 2010 on north west side of san antonio, i had just returned from the store for a last minute item i needed for dinner.  i was alone and in a hurry because my daughter and her boyfriend were coming for dinner in about 45 minutes.\r\ni arrived at my apt. which is on the 3rd floor and immediately started heating oil in a pan for chinese food.  i then stepped outside onto the balcony for a quick cigg. when i immediately noticed a boomerang object that was solid red not very large, very slowly traveling east to west out in front of me approx. 6-8 hundred yards away moving silently. very slow. it really looked like boomerang because when it kinda tilted you could see the shape although it was dark but not pitch black out. \r\nnote: i have been watching the sky at dusk and night every day since my daughter told me to look up el paso incident. and, i have seen a few strange things which i'll mention later.\r\nanyway, three white objects, shere like appeared, i didn't see where they came from as i was watching the boomerang,they had solid white lights-non flashing, silent and they kinda flew in a triangular pattern right there in front of me about 400 yards away. they would move closer together and then apart 2 kinda together and one lower below at maybe 10 yards from the other two. they would just stop and hover, not moving, and then start again, moving around.\r\ni then looking out at the sky for anything else, saw two helicopters in the distance, one coming from the east and the other from the north, coming towards my location. \r\nsuddenly, other objects just started appearing in front of me, nothing and then a flash of light one was flash of red and then it was there and just appeared, they were appearing from different parts of the sky, which was still clear as i could see the stars above the objects. these new objects looked kinda roundish would flash different colored lights, red, green, white with no patterns to them flash and then nothing go blank then turn back on. they were slowly moving around in the sky, some would move toward each other as if to collide but veer away from each other, maybe 8 things there in the sky.\r\nthe helicopters were coming closer, but moving futher north -west of where the red boomerang object was, as the helicopters came closer angling in as if corraling, but not close to it, they all three flew beyond my line of sight due to the apt. complex on the right.\r\nthe other pulsing-flashing objects were still there just kinda dancing around some appeared kinda, not transparent but light, i dont know how to describe them. \r\nthen from the west, from behind the west apt. ccomplex appeared something that had 6 smallish solid white lights, it came into view from west going very slowly east but only short distance beyond apt. complex and then it just started in opposite direction without turning. it was coming maybe 10 yards beyond complex and then just reversed itself, so i never saw the other side of it but it was the largest object out there the whole time this occurred.\r\ni was at that point scared but amazed at what i was seeing, i wished someone else was with me to bear witness to what was happening.I wished i had a camera or video camera with me but they are packed in storage as i recently moved here to sa. i wish i could describe better what was occuring before my eyes, but it was so strange to see.\r\nto understand my line of sight, as i said, i'm on the third floor, immediately to my right as i face north, there is a apt. complex. otherwise, my view is open as far as the horizon to the north and a good amount of the east.\r\ni could see in the distance other helicopters heading towards my direction from afar, from the east and from over the apt. complex to the west.\r\nnote sa airport is to the west of me but i don't know how far away exactly. so i hear and see planes coming in and departing all day and night. there was no air plane traffic going on during this.  only helicopters could be seen except for the strange objects still out there in front of me.\r\nthese objects were not planes, nothing moves like they were moving that i am aware of. its hard to explain it and as it was happening for approx. 10 minutes, i had already ran in the apt. to turn off the oil, the lights-objects were still flying around very strange like, circling each other darting here and there, some would \"turn off\" suddenly disappearing and reappear- very odd.Some of them looked kinda clear w- no lights on some pulsing red, white, green as i said no patterns to lights flashing.\r\nas the helicopters came closer they started leaving\r\n some kinda drifting away slowly, others just rapidly headed out towards the east- futher east than the copter coming in, some just blinked out and i couldn't see  them.\r\ni decided i wanted to see what was happening from the front of the apt. complex which is facing north but i thought i might be able to see futher west to see what was going on, i ran-quickly walked down three flights stairs and made my way to the front of the complex, i really couldn't see anything so i headed back upstairs to the balcony{i had already lit another cigg. before i decided to go downstairs and it was still lit when i returned}igrabbed my phone on the way in and took pic but it didn't come out. \r\nsome, maybe 3-4 objects were still out there, they didn't appear to be in hurry, i couldn't see the helicopters but could hear them somewhere.\r\nduring this time frame, maybe 15 minutes, i watched them a few minutes, buzzing around when helicopter came in from above me, the remaining objects just left in different directions.\r\ni called my daughter and told her what had been happening and told her to look out to see if she could see anything.. but she didn't.  she said she was on her way and wished she had been here to see. \r\ni kept watching the sky and didn't see anything but helicopters circling in the distance towards the front of me and out of sight to the west and east. i did hear, i think two large air craft flying over but didn't see them. i saw one large, maybe jet, flying relatively slowly for them go overhead maybe 10 minutes later i guess. i didn't see any of the regular air craft flying but the helicopters would come into sight maybe 5 of them.\r\ni did go inside and grabbed my laptop and looked up the ufo report site and called a cell # that was listed ( 360-591-1481] and left brief message as to what had occured with my call back #.\r\nmy daughter and her bf arrived and i told them kinda what had happened but i was kinda freaked out about the whole thing.\r\nof course, they were starving and i hadn't finished dinner so i went inside and prepared dinner for approx.40 minutes but i felt pretty disorganized and it isn't the way i normally am, i would get goosebumps on my arms when i thought about what had happened.\r\nthe whole time i made dinner, i kept the balcony door open, with the a/c running just to see or hear anything fly over and would look out the door every once in a while. nothing except the copters.\r\nso, what did i see? i don't know. when my daughter and her bf left, i sat out side for a while but didn't see anything else. i did check sa airport for arrivals and departures and all where on time. they didn't come in from this direction that i could see the whole time maybe 2 hrs had passed. \r\ni checked before i went to bed and this morning and nothing was reported. do you have any information as to what happened last night?\r\ni am a, relatively, normal person, married 25 years with two children at utsa.\r\nat the beginning of this report, i stated that i had seen a few strange things: i saw a few weeks ago a blue light flying toward me from the north, it really scared me as i thought it was a ufo, i even told my daughter that it was coming and to come see. as it came closer i could hear it was a helicopter but its front light was blue, as it passed directly overhead, flying really low, i could see it was a black helicopter with a strange flat looking tail.\r\nanother time, maybe 2 1/2 weeks ago saw a brillant white- strobe light object off to the east flying rapidly away, but i could see that brillant white strobe like light for a long time until it left out of sight.\r\nmy husband and i recently discussed ufos and he said if you really saw one there would be no doubt in our mind because he once was strange white light while driving south on i-35 towards laredo. i kinda teased him about it because i guess seeing is believing....\r\nso, if you know anything about what happened last night please let me know.\r\n\r\n  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Sometime between 9:30 and 9:40pm last night (11/11/10), i went outside to have a cigarette.  to be clear, i had not been drinking alcohol, taking medication, or consuming anything that may impair my my judgment.  \r\n\r\nmy apartment balcony is on the top floor (3 stories) and faces north.  there were light, misty clouds directly to my north (w/ intermittent stars visible through them) and clear skies to my east.  it was not until about 30 seconds to 1 minute after i had stepped outside that i saw the lights.  they did not approach as a plane would from the far corner of my vantage point.  instead, the object seemed to glide down from the cloud cover to my nw and traveled straight east.  i am not a certified expert, but studying aircraft has always been a hobby of mine.  i have also seen most types of aircraft in action (fighter jets, helicopters, even a b2 bomber).  \r\n\r\nthe instant i saw this aircraft, i knew right away that this was something that i had never seen or even read about (barring speculative aircraft from books, tv shows, etc.)  the limited cloud cover that was there was very low (i estimate at around 1,000 - 1,500 ft.)  the object was also very close (probably not more than a half mile from me).  \r\n\r\nas i stated previously, it was shaped similar to an arrowhead and the angle of it was somewhat sharp.  it was certainly not the shape of any conventional aircraft in regard to a discernible fuselage with fixed wings.  the entire bottom of the aircraft was lined with medium sized, round, white lights.  the lights were not overly bright, but bright enough as to where i could vaguely make out the profile of the top of the craft as well, which had a very low profile.  the color appeared to be a dull metallic gray - it did not appear to give off any type of shine.\r\n\r\nif i had to estimate the size of the craft, i would probably compare it to a medium sized fighter jet.  it moved very fluidly (seemed to gently weave back and forth as it flew) and did not make the even the slightest sound.  as it flew, it seemed to hug the cloud line.  i would estimate the speed to be at around 200mph +/-, but i would leave the final determination to someone more qualified than myself.  it traveled nearly straight east until it got to the ne portion of my vantage point.  at that time it made a slight angle up into the thin clouds and very soon after, turned to the ne and very quickly accelerated and departed at sharper vertically than 45 degrees and disappeared.  \r\n\r\nwhen it departed, it was almost to the edge of the thin cloud mass in front of me.  if it was flying at any angle less than 45 degrees, it would have come out of the cloud cover in very short order.  i watched for an additional five minutes or so, and it never came out.  based on how thin the cloud cover was, i also should have been able to at least catch glimpses of it if it indeed did travel almost vertically.  \r\n\r\nthough the entire event literally lasted only about 10 seconds, i want to reiterate that this was not some distant object.  i saw it very closely, clearly and definitely.  \r\n\r\ni am only agreeing to file this report after speaking to the mn chapter director on the phone today due to the fact that i do not wish to share this information only to have it posted out on the internet or to attract any unnecessary attention.  i am merely interested in reporting what it is i saw in the hopes of hopefully getting a better idea of what it was and what it wasn't.  i am also very curious to know if anyone else saw anything similar to what i did last night.  i do not claim to know what this object was, but i got a good enough look and was more than close enough to it to definitely know what it was not.  while a bit confused and a little unsure about the entire process, i am looking forward to speaking with an investigator and learning more.  if after speaking, it is determined to be helpful that a third party is contacted, i will be open to that.  but i explicitly request that my information is shared only with an appointed investigator until that time.

it looked like a fusellage(sp?) but with no tail, no fins, no wings, no markings. i didnt even see really any windows or a cockpit windshield. the best way i can describe it is a jetliner with no wings or markings or tail mechanism. it was truly strange! i can say with utmost certainty that it was not a plane of any kind. it did not exhibit any strange flight characteristics other then it seemed to be going very very fast. i had probably a 180 panoramic view of the sky and it took this thing about 7 seconds or so to come into view and go all the way across the sky. it seemed maybe 4 times as fast as a normal jet you would see flying across the sky. i also dont think i heard any sound coming from it, and when i normally see planes at around the same appearance of altitude you can definitely hear them! i made sure to wrap my eyes around it and assess if maybe light was making the wings not visible, but this was not the case. if this thing had wings or a tail i would have beenable to see them! the jets which were at much much higher altitude were clearly visible to have wings and a general plane shape.  this thing was not a plane!!! in broad daylight no less! ive never seen anything like it! i hope someone else saw it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26528,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9751345,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11122010-0012","longitude":-77.3781776,"occurred":1289599800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289602029000,"summary":"Plane without wings, escorted by 2 jets","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/New_York","timeZoneName":"America/New_York","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Herndon, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:86436"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Waterford","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i were outside walking across the yard.I noticed a very bright light in the sky almost directly overhead.It was moving faster than an aircraft.It was totally silent,never making a sound.The light was steady until it was halfway across the sky at which point it suddenly dimmed to red.At this point it simply vanished as if a light switch was turned off.There was never any contrail from the object.There was nothing in view to gage size,but i got the impression the object was large.\r\ni hold masters degree's in physics and aeronautical  engineering and can state that this object is nothing i am familiar with.It did not behave as one would expect of an aircraft known to our science.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26526,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4034315,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08062011-0049","longitude":-72.1059103,"occurred":1289462400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312666452000,"summary":"Ufo crossed sky and just vanished.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":268,"locationName":"Waterford, Connecticut","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:86437"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Russell","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on the back patio of the evening dated above at approx 11:30 pm (0330 utc), and observed an unnormal star in the sky located approx. 60 degrees nne at an elevation of approx 20-25 degrees.  i noticed this because at this time a normal star rise occurs and this star-like object was not normal.  the object was not a star after observation, due to the steady emmited light from the object. the object was at the same elevation but approx 10-15 degrees to the north of the normal star. after about 30 seconds the object accelerated at an unnormal rate toward the normal star, and then stopped instantly about 5-7 degrees from the original star, stayed in place for approx. 10 seconds then accelerated at unnormal speed, to the eye, next to the original star; stopped and stayed in that place for over a minute. the object then seemed to accelerate away at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight in an instant.  this was very unique, and certainly did not seem normal.  the rate of acceleration was extreme, and to my knowledge there is no commercial jet, or military aircraft that can do what this object did.

never heard anything from the media. this was my second sighting, the first being in the 60s with my uncle and cousin. i was working outside this time. it was a beautiful fall afternoon with no clouds or wind. perfect for them in their process to tell us something. i was working for a construction co., driving around outside the district, maintaining heavy equipment and refueling it. we got to the ge headquarters job site got out and as i refueled something i looked up, i'm very observant, and there they were, plain as day. they were abreast but not touching and they were writing in the sky!! they were moving slowly, too slow for anything to be doing what they were doing. they were linked up it seemed to act as one. they pivoted in perfect unison as we did as sailor recruits, marching and turning, the inside guy goes slower etc. about every 30 seconds, they would again with total precision, put out a puff of smoke or something that stayed right where they put them to form letters, they had about 4 letters done and still going, it must've taken them half an hour to get to where i came in.It was totally obvious and appeared to be made to face the center of the district, i'd guess close to a mile up and a mile or so away, giant letters made of dots, hanging in the area. no human made objects could have ever done it. it seemed like i was seeing it from behind and it was angled towards the district from my view. i could make out the letters but not the word, it was backwards or they were spelling in reverse order. i watched for the time we were at that site, about 15 to 20 minutes, then my coworker/boss wanted to split. he knew what i was seeing but didn't want to look, i think he was worried about ridicule or something. even as we were pulling away i could still see it through the bare trees. millions had to have seen it. my girlfriend says they decide who can see them but i don't really buy that. my coworker said he saw \"something\" but he wasn't sure what. even

the operation was being broadcast live by cnn at the time. as i was watching the live broadcast, cnn camera crews zoomed in on the chinook helicopter as the pilot was preparing to start rescue lift operation. \r\n\r\nas i was watching this event take place, i noticed a disk shaped object moving from left to right at a very high rate of speed.  the object traveled from behind the mountain on the left side of the screen, to the right and moved behind the helicopter and out of view.\r\n\r\ni would suspect that cnn still retains the video footage of this event. i am simply letting you know. what you do with this information is up to you. i prefer to remain anonymous. however, i would like to be notified by email if mufon feels this is a very important find.\r\n\r\nas i said, cnn retains this video footage. i have looked online and at youtube for any of this footage. i have been unable to locate the actual video. i am an aviation air combat artist of 25 years as well as a graphic artist. i have put together 2 pictures that are very close to the original video i saw that day. the angle of the aircraft, mountain and object are very close too the original footage. this should give you a good guide to assist in your search. \"please do not mistake these pictures for the real thing\". \r\n\r\n

experienced were telepathic in nature and involved contact with a person we believe to be from a parallel earth via a machine with a machine brain interface, i documented the entire years experiences each time we entered the valley up until my sister made contact with the person / entity who called himself kahalt.  we both have a history of sightings and of strange occurrences over the last couple decades but nothing like this,ironically my sister relayed one of her earlier experiences to kahalt as a possible explanation for her sensitivity to his machine.\r\n\r\nwhat happened was my sister and i would get sick in death valley national park when we would go down there, we would get nausea , dizziness, and depersonalization the difference being that my sister began mumbling in strange languages and would often come out of the confused state and describe visions of all sorts of things like mummies on the salt flat or a stone shack and people in coursly woven robes, one man in particular who was very tall she says maybe seven feet. all the people have long hair about shoulder length and most have black eyes where the iris is black like the pupil of the eye. the tall man appeared over and over in her visions as well as a thing that looked like a stretched out tulip made of brass about 5 feet tall planted in the salt flat like a post with white light coming out the top and red light coming out some triangle shaped openings as if someone had punched them out of the sides with a can opener. eventually she actually saw the tall man in person in a mesquite thicket at the eagle borax works on west side road, both she and he were startled by each other and stood staring, she called out to me and by the time i got there he was gone.\r\nit was a few months later that she felt an urge to drive to badwater where she felt a presence in her mind while sitting on the salt flat eventually she established contact with the presence and could see the tall man's face from the mesquite thicket she said her name and he replied \"kahalt\" pointing to his chest as she had done in their mental visions of each other. kahalt got very excited and began rambling on in some odd language and the connection was broken, my sister got nauseous and threw up so we left. \r\nthe next weekend we came back and she again contacted kahalt, this time she didn't get as sick and they talked a while, he asked her how she traveled without a machine, she said she thought it was his machine that did it apparently he was referring to the brass tulip. he said he had never seen a traveler like her before her white skin and short hair as well as her brightly colored and odd cloths (shirt and pants verses a robe like his) when she asked how she could hear his thoughts he said the machine \"makes my thoughts stronger\" his english was very bad but got better each visit apparently thanks to the computer like machine. \r\nhe said he was descended from the people who brought the machine to the parallel death valley she always saw in her visions, apparently they were from a very advanced culture and traveled with one of these things to that place , interbreeding with the natives. eventually the bought the machine there to make it easier to travel to other \"places\" (kahalt's word) \r\nwhen they turned the machine on \"before anyone could act\" the primitives started dieing on the spot apparently the machines brain interface didn't work right with them and shut down their autonomic system or some such neurological damage was done that they all died. i am not clear on this point weather all the natives died or all except the ones who carried dna from kahalt's home world. kahalt said the people from his home world never went back, eaten by guilt they stayed there and used the machine to help the survivors, kahalt is a descendant of those early people one of only a few whose brain can operate the machine. this was the reason that he said he can't \"travel\" \r\nwhile kahalt never used the words parallel universe or parallel world etc. from the way my sister described her visions the place is almost an exact duplicate of death valley with obvious exceptions such as the lack of any roads or structures save the stone shack. tule spring is a little different and their are human remains about such as the mummies on the salt flat and some bones here and there apparently left over from the holocaust. \r\n\r\ni have kept a journal of the entire experience including every vision with times and dates etc except for some early experiences when we weren't sure what was happening. i have met one other person who said they got sick in the aria of death valley beatty and rhiolite. i myself have experienced \"machine sickness\" as far north as scotties junction and as far south as shoshone ca. apparently the machine has a kind of field like from a transmitter.\r\n\r\ni am quite willing to work with mufon on this and very curious to investigate further but my sister feels the opposite, she is terrified of ending up as a ufo case or \"kook\" etc, i must respect her wishes and remain anonymous thereby protecting her identity. \r\nthere is more detail but i can't put a years experiences here, contact me if you want to know more.\r\n\r\njoe banks\r\n(assumed

and there was nothing on my window. the object was the color of a white cloud but was shaped very differently. the bottom was squared off and the sides were straight. in the middle of the bottom there seemed to be a dark spot, i looked at this part of it more intensely to be sure. the top end kind of tapered off and had a wispyness to it. i stopped driving to take a closer look at it. the place where i stopped was next to a large tree. i was looking over my left shoulder to see the object. i kinda disregarded it after a while. almost took a cellphone pic of it but decided it was too far away to get anything decent. it was about 10 miles away. as i pulled away from where i stopped, the large tree blocked my view of the object. i looked again to where it should have been and it was gone. i then looked forward and there it was, still about 10 miles away but now it moved 90 degrees clockwise through the sky. that startled me. i kept driving on and soon lost sight of the

reported them in the past.\r\n\r\nas i watched the lights moving it went behind the tall tree in my neighbors yard. the light went behind it at the tip of the tree but came out the other side near the bottom of the tree and was much closer to the ground at this point. i observed this craft moving northward towards the mountains and eventually into oregon if it were to stay on that path.\r\n\r\njust when the lights were far enough away that i could still see the flashing lights but they were dimming because of trees and distance, it flashed brightly to where i actually pulled back and gasped because it felt like someone shot a bright light beam at me. this beam of light was felt in my left eye and not in my right eye. i say this because my left eye felt like it had looked at a welding light so i could feel the burn so to speak and slight discomfort. the weirdest part of this is that i saw or perceived an image ... a three pronged image; top and bottom with solid black in between. i had never seen this image that i can remember so i drew it so that i would not forget. some sort of ancient symbol of some sort is what i am getting out of this. . . and ancient alien symbol. i you go to http://ancientx.Com/nm/anmviewer.Asp?A=90 you'll see the three pronged symbol on the piece that was left behind as part of the debris from the roswell incident and crash. i was not aware of this until i searched for the symbol.\r\n\r\ni felt unusually tired the next two days and my eye felt some trauma but no burn of any kind was left and has since healed from the discomfort.","distance":"501

sure i wasnt seeing things. she alsosaw it and we had a discussion on what it could be while watching it from our living room window. we were both nervous but then curiousity took over and we just kept watching it. around 1` am i no longer noticed it in the sky/ i dont know where it went. the only movement it made while i was outside looking at it could have just been me moving but it wiggled a
