night (11-8-10) that appeared to be a very large glowing red light with smaller red lights moving around it. she said that it was just sitting there and then noticed 3 aircraft approaching or following it.  she then said that it started moving in one direction slowly and then stopped for a second and then moved the opposite direction.  it stopped again and then disappeared. this women is located in doney park just east of flagstaff and at the base of mount elden and the san francisco peaks. i do not know what direction in the sky this took place.  i have told my mom to have the lady report her sighting here.. so hopefully she will.  there is also a report of someone seeing 8 foot tall creatures on the mountain here on the 7th of november. this ladies husband also saw the event and had binoculars with him. he believed it to be a military exercise while his wife did not think so.  there is no military installation housing aircraft anywhere near

some time during the 1980's is a reasonable guess.\r\n\r\ni was traveling south on 525w, a road that is 7-8 miles west of columbus, near the intersection of what is now goeller blvd. it was a warm summer evening, probably near 7:30pm or so. \r\n\r\nas i approached the intersection i noticed what i thought was a very bright star on the western horizon. the horizon in this case is a very high bluff. i thought to myself \"gosh that's a bright star.\" and wondered if it was a planet. after driving another 100 yards or so i again looked at the star and it seemed much closer. the \"star\" then began to split as two like sized units emerged from the original one and took up positions to the left and right of the initial one. the two outside units then each had another like sized unit emerge from them and position themselves further to the outside. there was now a fleet of five units flying in formation from west to east. the five units were some distance apart, flying in parallel.\r\n\r\nsince there was no one behind me i got out of my car and watched as the units streaked across the sky. i remember being amazed how fast they were flying and thinking to myself that we don't have anything that flies that fast. after a short time they disappeared  from my view to the east. trees blocked my view so i could not see them disappear over the eastern horizon.\r\n\r\nthe above episode only took a few minutes. i remember thinking ufo's are for real. it was truly awe inspiring. the actual tme is difficult to estimate with accuracy but a good guess would be 3-4 minutes from the time i first saw the \"star\" to the five units disappeared to the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i had finished a short hike off of sand flats road and were returning home.  we turned east along sand flats road from a side road and were directly facing the moab rim.  i immediately saw two slowly moving objects going from south to north, just below the top of the rim and directly opposite our truck.  they attracted my attention because of their movement, and they were lighter in color than the red/orange rock of the cliffs.  they appeared to be moving very slowly at a constant velocity, slower than what i would expect from aircraft.  i thought that they were perhaps ultralights.  my husband is an ex-pilot, so i asked my husband to stop the truck, and we both got out to observe the objects.  the sun was behind rim at this time,so we were not looking directly into the sun.  the objects were flying in what my husband called an \"echelon\" formation,\" with one object flying slightly behind and off flank to the other.  there was a distinct separation between the objects.  their relative positions did not change for the entire time of observation, which we estimated to be approximately 2 minutes; however, we did not time the period with a watch.  my husband thought that the object to the rear was slightly larger (nearer) than the lead object, putting them in a right echelon formation.  i was not able to discriminate between sizes of the two objects.  my husband was certain that we were not observing ultralights because the objects maintained constant relative postions for the entire observation time.\r\n\r\nsince the top of the rim has some irregularities, i thought that we may be able to see the objects' silouettes at some point since they were just below the rim. from our viewpoint,though, the objects travelled just below the  top of the rim for the entire 2 minutes.  at one point, however, sunlight from a break in the rocks illuminated the two objects, which then appeared as two bright shining points of light, so they seemd to be metallic.  the illumination was brief, perhaps two seconds as they continued northward along the cliff face.  we were able to observe the objects until the cliff face dropped suddenly in elevation. at that point, the objects immeidately disappeared against the sky, south of the portal.   \r\n\r\nwe were able to locate our position relative to the objects on topo maps when we got home. we are fairly confident of the distances we estimated.    \r\n\r\nin summary:\r\n\r\nfeelings: we agreed that we could not identify the objects.  we also agreed to make this report because we hope that someone in the moab valley may have also seen them and could provide insight/explanation.\r\n\r\nshape of objects: our elevation in the truck was approximately the same as the objects, so we were looking from a side view.  roughly diamond-shaped, but flat on the bottom; a skewed trapezoidal shape; the vertical dimension was offset to a vertical centerline, as viewed from the side, so they were slightly assymmetric.  \r\n\r\ncolor: my husband described them as light gray.  i could tell that they were lighter in color than the background rocks but can not definitely describe them as gray.  \r\n\r\ntexture: to me, although the outline of their shapes was definitely discernable, they seemd a little \"fuzzy.\" \r\n\r\ndistance from viewpoint to objects:  approximately 4.57 miles, as estimated froma 7.5\" topo, sand flats road to cliff face.\r\n\r\ndistance travelled along front of moab rim during approximate 2 minute time period: 2.2 miles.\r\n\r\nsize of objects: we both agreed that if we held a hand out in front of us, each object would be the size of half our thumbnails.  using the distance from our position to the rim, we extrapolated tha size of the objects and estimate each one to be about 200+ feet long.\r\n\r\napparent velocity: approximately 60 mph.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

like we could catch the object. when it rose high enough that we could not catch it, we just stood in the yard staring at the object while it slowly rose and eventually disappeared. we ran in the

oldest brother (who was 17 at the time). we were about one block from home in a residential neighborhood across from a large park where we grew up playing softball and football, when a strange sensation came over me that we were being watched - followed by an overwhelming urge to look around and then to look up above us.  there, approximately 1 - 200 feet above us was a circular/disc-shaped ufo that had white lights around its circumference - along with dark circular shaped windows/openings that were interspersed evenly between the lights.  the craft made no sound as the lights went on and off in progressive fashion around the craft's circumference - never stopping.  after standing transfixed watching the craft for about 15 seconds, i looked down to tap my brother on the shoulder and to tell him to look up, and when i did - and we both looked up - the craft was gone - and again without any sound whatsoever.\r\nat the height estimated, the craft appeared to be approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and was silver/metallic in color.  no propulsion system, engines or flames were seen as it hovered motionless above us.","distance":"101-500

the triangles showed off a diffuse, subdued orange light, which was triangular in shape. possibly, they might have been reflecting back the city lights below.\r\n\r\nthey moved really fast across the

red lights flashing one at a time from right to left in rapid succession (looking west). there were about 20-24 lights and they were very large. i was awe struck because the lights were telling me the object was at least a half mile wide. i believe the lights were going in sequence around the craft (even though i couldn't see the back of it) because after the red light finished on the left side there was a delay of about 2 seconds before the right to left sequence started again. i saw this event repeat about 4-5 times and then the sky went dark. just about 3-5 seconds later it started again, but this time the lights were bright white strobes and there was not a pattern, just random.  the strobes were very bright and really lit up the night. all this time i was in awe and never took my eyes off of it.  then it moved slowly over the ocean (south from my location) and disappeared vertically at a rapid pace. i think it went in to space. also, it made no sound whatsoever.\r\n\r\nbut what was really weird was that a missile (i think) was fired from the south (in the direction of the ocean) as if to shoot it down. i've seen missile launches from vafb and they move very slow in comparison to what i saw follow the ufo. this was like an interceptor missile, very-very fast.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26470,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.4448994,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11092010-0019","longitude":-119.8232289,"occurred":1288780200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289355796000,"summary":"Saw

while outside biking with his friends. i told him he must have been mistaken as it was a warm beautiful sunny evening with only 2 or three very small white cumulus clouds visible in the sky - and that they were at an approximate altitude of 25 - 30,000 feet or higher.  he then asked me to come out and take a look for myself - which i did.  i had a couple of errands to run, so i took my oldest son who was 15 and my younger son who is 11 with me while i ran the errands.  after running two quick errands, on the way back home, my oldest son pointed to one of the small clouds directly above us at the approximate altitude previously stated and he told me to look at the cloud.. which i did.  this one small white cloud was becoming transparent as its color changed and flashed green, blue, purple, red, yellow and back to green again as is started its intermittent flashing through the cloud.  with every flash and color change, the cloud became transparent and an extremely large (my estimate would be at least a half mile long or longer) cigar/cylinder-shaped object could be seen by myself and my two sons.  we pulled into a parking lot and watched the 'show' for about 15 minutes - and in total - the event lasted at least 45 minutes from the time my son first came home to tell me about it.  after watching the event together for 15 minutes we observed a large aircraft pass under the unknown cigar/cylinder-shaped object - at which point there was a bright purple flash and the object was no longer visible and the cloud dissapated. it should be notated that the sides of the object reflected and changed color every time there was a color flash change in the cloud itself.  the object had defined perimeter outlines and alternately appeared solid, changed or reflected colors multiple times and also appeared transparent at times as well.  the object was at least a quarter to half mile long - and probably longer, as a large (and possibly) commercial airplane flew beneath the object and was dwarfed by the size of the object - which was at least 20 to 25 times longer than the aircraft beneath it.  the aircraft was closer to us visually and appeared to be several thousand feet below (therefore a lower altitude than) the object we saw.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

to his house in saginaw county, mi and were going down a somewhat country road to get there, the road had houses on it but we were the only car on the road (usually theres at least one other car we pass on the way there). while on the road i saw a light in the sky that was far away that looked like a weird star or planet or something i noticed it because of its strange colors and after he saw it we started arguing about what it was, it wasn't moving but he said it was a plane and so i pulled over to prove it wasn't moving, it then started moving back and forth so we were both wrong and we saw a plane pass below it (it was definitely a plane). i started getting a bad feeling in my stomach, kind of like anxiety and said we should go so we continued driving down the road when (and this is the part where i swear i'm not crazy, we both saw exactly the same thing) three lights in a row came out of nowhere and started coming directly towards us. it was flying very low, too low to be a plane and almost in the tree line, at this point i was the most scared i have ever been in my life, it was not stopping and my boyfriend was telling me not to stop the car but i turned it around as fast as i could and started going as fast as i could the opposite way, i was telling him to call 911 and he got out my phone and had the number dialed but didn't call and i was so scared my whole body was shaking, we were about two miles from the main road. i was near tears when we got to the main road and once we got there he tried to say it could have been another plane, so i insisted we go to the airport, once there he went in and talked to a sheriff and airport worker who said that the only flight that came in was from chicago, this all happened before 8:30pm. we then concluded that there was no way it could have been a plane, (my boyfriend is very rational and level-headed) after the airport he told me that while we were driving, whatever had been in front of us was driving directly next to us less than a quarter mile away, he got a vague look at it and said it had no wings or tail, when i was driving i was going about 70mph and slowed to about 55mph when coming to a stop sign, he said it stayed directly next to us the entire time. this was the most terrifying experience i have ever had and i almost can't believe it happened.\r\n     on a side note, earlier that evening i found out my blood type was b- and that if a woman gets pregnant and that baby has a + blood type the mom could reject it, so we had been talking about that and while looking ufo sightings today i stopped for a bit to get more info on my blod type and found a article saying that most people who are abducted by aliens have b- or other - blood types; not that i think i was abducted it was just a weird incident and that information made it a little weirder... it would be nice to get a bit more info on that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26467,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.5277965,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11092010-0016","longitude":-84.1149798,"occurred":1289275500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,

looked up and started barking more loudly. i tried calling them back inside - but they wouldn't come in. i then went outside to get them and both dogs were sitting in the snow barking at something (i thought) was in one of the trees, but there was nothing there.  then in the distance, up in the sky over algonquin, illinois a very large oval-shaped fireball ufo appeared out of nowhere, hovered in place for over a minute or so, which gave me time to further notice actual flames being emitted from the object, yet the object emitted no sound whatsoever. the longer it remained stationary, the stranger the whole thing seemed. then, and without warning - or even a sound - the object sped off at a great speed horizontally to the southeast and was literally out of sight within 2 seconds.  the object was easily a mile or two away from where i live, yet it was large enough for me to see the flames coming off it, so how large an object it was - i can't say, but it was big enough for me to see
