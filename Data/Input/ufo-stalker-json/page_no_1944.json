to his house in saginaw county, mi and were going down a somewhat country road to get there, the road had houses on it but we were the only car on the road (usually theres at least one other car we pass on the way there). while on the road i saw a light in the sky that was far away that looked like a weird star or planet or something i noticed it because of its strange colors and after he saw it we started arguing about what it was, it wasn't moving but he said it was a plane and so i pulled over to prove it wasn't moving, it then started moving back and forth so we were both wrong and we saw a plane pass below it (it was definitely a plane). i started getting a bad feeling in my stomach, kind of like anxiety and said we should go so we continued driving down the road when (and this is the part where i swear i'm not crazy, we both saw exactly the same thing) three lights in a row came out of nowhere and started coming directly towards us. it was flying very low, too low to be a plane and almost in the tree line, at this point i was the most scared i have ever been in my life, it was not stopping and my boyfriend was telling me not to stop the car but i turned it around as fast as i could and started going as fast as i could the opposite way, i was telling him to call 911 and he got out my phone and had the number dialed but didn't call and i was so scared my whole body was shaking, we were about two miles from the main road. i was near tears when we got to the main road and once we got there he tried to say it could have been another plane, so i insisted we go to the airport, once there he went in and talked to a sheriff and airport worker who said that the only flight that came in was from chicago, this all happened before 8:30pm. we then concluded that there was no way it could have been a plane, (my boyfriend is very rational and level-headed) after the airport he told me that while we were driving, whatever had been in front of us was driving directly next to us less than a quarter mile away, he got a vague look at it and said it had no wings or tail, when i was driving i was going about 70mph and slowed to about 55mph when coming to a stop sign, he said it stayed directly next to us the entire time. this was the most terrifying experience i have ever had and i almost can't believe it happened.\r\n     on a side note, earlier that evening i found out my blood type was b- and that if a woman gets pregnant and that baby has a + blood type the mom could reject it, so we had been talking about that and while looking ufo sightings today i stopped for a bit to get more info on my blod type and found a article saying that most people who are abducted by aliens have b- or other - blood types; not that i think i was abducted it was just a weird incident and that information made it a little weirder... it would be nice to get a bit more info on that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26465,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.5250265,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11092010-0014","longitude":-84.1227598,"occurred":1289275500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,

saw a very bright thing that looked like a star, at first i thought it was the north star, but it was three times the size of the other stars so i thought that it was a planet, then i realized the it was moving real slowly upwards. it seemed like it was getting closer. i looked at the other lights around it and saw three other starlike moving objects around it as well. then as the large starlike object came closer, i saw other lights on the object. the lights were red, green, blue, white, and yellow/orange in a triagular shape. as it got closer, i think i saw a triangular shape but i can't be sure. it definitely was not any aircraft that i know of, not an airplane or a helicopter or a jet. it also moved as if it were floating/hovering. after about 10 mins from seeing it, i lost sight of it. the drive from merrillville to michigan city took about 30 minutes and during that time i saw a lot of weird moving lights that looked like stars all of them changed and flashed colors atleast one point or another and they also moved in a way that planes cannot possibly move. all in all i believe i saw 8 unidentified flying objects and 6 planes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

spotted an extraordinarily bright object about 25 feet to our right slowly meandering down the road in a straight line, neither moving up or down, left or right. the object was about two stories off the ground (about 10 feet over our heads). it made no sound at all and seemed to be nothing more then a bright light. after about 15 seconds it emitted a orange flash from it's \"back\" side (the side opposite it's traveling direction) and took off in the same direction at incredibly fast speeds. unfortunately there were tree's obstructing our view so i had to jump up on the railing to try to get a better look but by then it was out of sight. due to the fact that it was so close to us, made no sound at all and had no visible physical shape we were both at a loss to explain the sighting other

seen.  i guess you would say it was round with spikes pertruding out all over and at the end of the spikes were colored lights, it really was a beautiful thing to see, and i never seen a pic that anyone reported that looked like the one that we saw that night until today which is why i am writing.  i caught about five min. of a show with a man named chris bledsoe, i think in carolina.  i think

moving and this white bright light didn't look right. we then followed it down the road a little more and this thing got very close about a 1,000 to 1,500 feet in the air and came right above us. when we got a good look at this object it was a black triangle and very big not a small object at all. it then stopped the bright white light and changed to a bright red one at one of the three tips. there was 4 red circle lights underneath it blinking. we couldn't believe what we were seeing so we turned around and this object picked up speed and disappeared out of thin air and then came back and then disappeared again but never came back. i simple can't explain this whole thing that happened but it was insane can't believe i saw this object disappear in front of my eyes and then reaper. the only thing i can think of is this object had the power of invisibility which in logic doesn't exist. plus on top of this all i live down the road from a airport and i see planes and helicopters all the time. my uncle is even a pilot so i know what i'm talking about here and what we saw was no air craft i have ever seen. this object made no sound or anything just glided across the

thought it could be a helicopter based upon its behavior; however, at one point at around 9:58pm i drove directly underneath of the object. i could see its shape perfectly. it was an obtuse triangle. the bright light i had seen on the front was actually a combination of three - one was on the tip and the other two were on either side of that bright central light. on the other tips, i could see

son's home in denver my wife wanted to go thru the hopi reservation.  during the entire three day trip we would stop the car for me to get out and take pictures.  i took hundreds but none like the ones attached to this email.  i never saw the object and was not aware of the object in my picture until last week.  after i got home i downloaded the pictures of the trip onto my computer where they will cycle thru as the screensaver flashes them up on the screen.  it was one night when i had taken a break from my computer and the screen saver was cycling these particular pictures caught my eye.  i had never notice the bright light in the center before.  what you are seeing are two photos i took of the landscape one up close and the other a little further back.  my camera is a digital cannon with a 12x telescopic lens.  what caught my eye more than anything was the bright object had moved in relationship to the clouds.  the two pictures were taken within seconds of eachother.  in truth i have no idea what it is but several family and friends have told me to send it to you to see what you think.  if you notice there was no sun that afternoon it was getting ready to storm and did later on in the day.  the sky was black.  no one, not my son, wife or grandchildren nor i saw any object in the sky that day but it is clearly there in the picture.  i was outside the car heading north on the passenger side facing east when the pictures were taken.  the sun would have been behind me if it was out but it wasn't.  so i can tell you it was not a break in the clouds for the sun to poke thru nor is a reflection of any kind.  however, the light was bright enough to cause a light ring in the camera lens as you can see.  that ring is not on any other pictures ever taken with this camera.  the camera was not moving because the rest of the picture is clear and steady.  i do believe the slight light streak behind the object is the results of the object moving.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":26449,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.8433607,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082010-0029","longitude":-110.5276998,"occurred":1271574000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289284105000,"summary":"Bright

told me to look up,just then a jet was passing by we live in a very busy flight area, and i have seen all types of aircraft, all the time, day and night..Anyway all of a sudden i looked up and this thing was flying by moving really fast,i mean fast in a northwest,southeast direction,it was long like a tube silver, in color, or metal,shiny,but not alot. it was like it just popped in the sky,very high alitude,it had to be large it might had been one inch in length from that distance,a quarter inch wide.Even though it was moving fast,as it was flying over me i was able to make this detail out.I followed it till it suddenly gone, like it just popped out.Also while i was watching the object it looked llike it had long smaller tubes, one on each side.My daughter was out side with my granddaughter,when i yelled and said look at that! she was unable to see it because i had sunglases on at the time which it made it clear for me to se it,i told her what i saw and then it was all over,could`nt have lasted a minute and a half if that...Im a emt and a fire fighter, and do not just say things unless it is what it is.My first ufo sighting,i had to share it with everyone...I was

i didn't get the film processed (it was a traditional film camera). i would guess this thing was at least fifty feet wide because the trees were between forty to fifty feet tall. i have no idea how high this craft was, but it traveled very fast and then almost stopped before it took off.  i didn't see any windows or any sign of how it was propelled.  it made no sound whatsoever until it shot up, and i didn't hear anything but the traffic on the freeway.  there were no other witnesses as far as i know because the traffic was light and no one was in the field but me. it happened around the time of the hillsboro air show, probably after the show at least by a week, but there were planes flying all over just a few days earlier if i recall, and a lot of them were military planes.  i know that
