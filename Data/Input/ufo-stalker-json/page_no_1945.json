look over there! wait, look over there! wait! look over there! they are everywhere!\" sounds comical, i know. if you were there watching us and not the sky, you'd be laughing at us. but if you were watching the sky, you'd have been freaking out too!\r\n\r\nat first it was just the flashing lights all over. glittering the sky. very similar to planes, but these were no planes. many of them hovered in one spot. some of them moved around slowly in strange patterns. but they were popping up everywhere. they were all over the place. you'd see one and then you'd see a dozen more popping up all over the sky.\r\n\r\nand then there were these strange twinkling stars. or at least we thought they were stars. until they, too, started moving. and around them you could see 'shooting stars'. \r\n\r\nif all that wasn't incredible enough, what we were about to see was mind-boggling. \r\n\r\nthere was a glowing mist in the distance. it wasn't too far from us. if we ran for only a few minutes, we could have reached it. at first we thought maybe it was just a fog and the light was catching it in a strange way. until we started seeing huge transluscent things flying in it. several of them. 2 or 3. they were enormous. they were close to the ground. they were only partially visible. they looks like ghosts in the sky. that's really the only way to describe it. it was the freakiest thing i'd ever seen in my life. my sister and i were screaming in terror and excitement. \r\n\r\nthey did there circling dance for about 15-20 minutes. it was almost as if they were putting on a show just for us. it certainly felt that way.\r\n\r\nand then one of them must have shot up way high in the sky. it was no longer a shadowy/transluscent ufo. it was saucer-shaped, glowing, and very solid-looking. and it darted to the left, southward. like it was going to land! and almost before it reached the ground (which had to have been over the town park) it just vanished. so weird.\r\n\r\nnaturally, we were really freaking out and couldn't stand anymore. too excited. too overwhelmed. i mean, it was life changing. i'd never seen anything like this before. i'd always believed. and i'd watched youtube videos, but until you see something like this with your own two eyes... it's not the same. \r\n\r\nbut things didn't end then. we were sitting down and then we saw an unblinking set of lights. light five lights. it was no plane. like i said, unblinking lights. it was like triangular/pyramid shaped. it was so hard to tell, because it almost seemed as if it were shap-shifting. and it just flew across the sky, slowly, spinning. sometimes hovering. floating. \r\n\r\nthese sightings lasted for about 2-3 hours before they started to slow down. \r\n\r\nit was amazing.\r\n\r\nif you're a skeptic, my advice is go outside. know that you're going to see something. because you will.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":26431,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.734286,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082010-0011","longitude":-96.5054,"occurred":1289196000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nebraska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Diamond,   Disc,   Fireball,   Flash,   Sphere,   Star-like,   Triangle,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289237153000,"summary":"Hundreds of ufos in the night sky!

where i am i couldn't get anything to show up, as the light was very small from where i was.  i eventually moved the car closer to the road away from the lights and tried again, and was eventually able to get some video of the light but because of zoom and the time of day there are issues with focus at times and the video is pretty jerky.\r\n\r\nafter recording about 3 minutes of video the camcorder battery was low so i put it back down in the glove box and when i looked back to keep watching the object, it was gone.  it was at this point that i knew for sure it could not have been a star.  i looked away for a few more seconds and when i looked back it was again in roughly the same spot.  this occured 2 more times while i was watching.  during the several minutes i watched it it did not appear to make any major moves in position.  i'd say it was maybe 15-20 deg. off the horizon.  there is a tree line, but since it was dark i couldn't get a good idea of relative position or height.  \r\n\r\nthe light was a bright white, and looked to phase to a more reddish light later on.  after watching 10-15 minutes the light appeared to be moving lower on the horizon, and eventually it sank below the tree line.  i believe i could still see it very low through the trees for another few seconds but eventually i lost total view of it.  i continued looking for a few more minutes but never saw it reappear, so i left here to go make my rounds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":26425,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0538831,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082010-0005","longitude":-87.2650423,"occurred":1289208600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289220391000,"summary":"Bright

on the sidewalk of w. michigan street that lead back to campus apartment housing at iupui (my college).  we usually have a lot of airplanes and helicopters around here, and at first i thought it was an airplane until i realized that it was flying way too low, but then i realized that it must have been a helicopter. i couldn���t have been more wrong i realized, as i looked up and saw a circular object flying right up above me, moving straight in the direction i was facing. it was huge, and if a full moon were out, i would have to say that from my perspective, i would have to say that maybe 15-17 full moons would be equal to the size of it. i���d like to give a better comparison, but i was in a state of shock. i did spend what felt like a long time gazing at it, although in actuality, only about 2 minutes had passed. \r\nthe sky was clear, but being in the city, it appears as pitch black because of the city lights. it was either flying really low, or it was extremely huge.  i feel stupid for not thinking about getting a picture, but i was in total shock, as i don���t really believe in ufos, or at least didn���t until now, and even now i���m still skeptical. i did, however, try my best to draw a picture afterwards, even though i���m not good at drawing. the ufo had red lights on it. if i remember correctly, i���d say about 3 of 4 of them, and i believe that red light was coming from the center as well. since i was looking up at it, all i could see was what it looked like directly underneath. it looked like the stereotypical ufo, or flying saucer, in most aspects. besides being a perfect circle, it looked like what a mushroom looks like from underneath, whereas you can see the edges of what might be a domed top from below, and striations leading towards the center. most of the red lights were towards the exterior, with the exception of the center (where the stem of a mushroom would be). here was where more red light emitted. \r\ntwo things struck me as odd that distinguished this when compared to the stereotypical portrayal. for one thing, the front of the ship had a silver section, which reminded me of a bird shape since the shape had three corners. secondly, i think that there may have been a protrusion at the base of it, which logically made me think that maybe somebody was playing a prank and it was actually some type of blimp because of how it glided forward, but it seemed much too big to logically call it this. there was no logical explanation for what happened. i went back to the apartment building and called my grandpa to tell him what i saw because i felt like i needed to tell someone that wouldn���t make fun of me. i made this call at 6:34p.M., and stepped through the back door of the apartment complex. i was partway into the conversation when i saw the object again flying over the apartment building, even though i thought it had already passed. \r\nat this point a passerby was walking down the sidewalk and saw me looking in shock up at the sky. he then saw the object too and said that it ���sure is a wide airplane���. (he didn���t see it until it was going off into the distance.) i said that ���was definitely no airplane.��� this second encounter lasted until 6:37p.M., so it was three minutes long. this second encounter took place on porto alegre street, and again the object continued moving in the same direction until it got past the river, where it ascended up and disappeared into the sky. a girl walking a ways behind me during the first incident didn���t bother looking up because she thought it was a helicopter and was busy texting, and was shocked when i told her what i saw. i was kind of angry that she hadn���t looked up and i was the only one that saw this the first time, but i extremely glad that someone else saw it the second time to prove that i wasn���t the only person that saw it.\r\nby the way, the iupui campus apartments are near the ronald mcdonald house, which is not far from the hospital. this area is extremely easy to find on google maps, however, for some reason it doesn���t show porto alegre, but the street that the ufo went across to get to the river is white river pkwy e. dr.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Insignia","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26422,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7764655,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082010-0002","longitude":-86.1570636,"occurred":1289183160000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1289206598000,"summary":"It was flying really low over w. michigan street","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/26422_submitter_file1__SCAN0009.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Indianapolis, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:87791"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Austin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Carve pro skate shop was having a grand opening event.  i was taking photos and looked up at a beautiful blue sky with zero clouds.  to the southwest a bright white object was visible at extreme altitude. the object had no winds or marks that could be identified as any conventional craft.  i snapped two photos a couple of minutes apart.  the object was very high and appeared to be moving faster than an airliner that usually has visible wings, windows, and markings.  this had none.  once it was out of sight about two minutes after the second photograph, two armed blue f18s flew right over our heads, low, less than 1000 feet above the ground in the general direction the object was last seen.

and i have had a bit of an odd day. i was looking through the videos on realufos.Com earlier today for about 2 hours. around 2:15 pm i decided i needed to stop due to hunger. i got up from the couch where my laptop was, and walked towards the kitchen. i looked out of a window that has a fairly large view of the sky through an opening in the trees and i have no explanation for what i saw. three tiny white lights, very high in the sky, moving from north to south in a slow, horizontal path. the two in front were closer together and a bit higher than the 3rd. i ran for my camera, came back and did my best to zoom in and film them but i couldn't get them. they were just too tiny and far off to capture. i then called a friend who is a ufo buff and excitedly described the whole thing to him as i watched the 3rd object move in that same direction for at least another minute and a half before it too was finally blocked by trees.\r\n\r\n  now, i am fully aware of the fact that the odds of ever seeing anything in the first place are quite slim, and then add on the odds of seeing something immediately after watching a few hours of videos on what appear to be the exact same orblike things, well it's pretty close to ridiculous. and yet, there they were. a few weeks ago i was standing in the same window talking photos of a very dramatic storm rolling in and noticed, amongst the birds flying in the high winds and leaves blowing around, that there was something else, very high up in the sky, which was not moving like either one of those things at all. this, however, was black. i watched it for about 5 minutes as it slowly drifted up and to the left, finally going into a huge storm cloud. i could not lock my camera on that either. that one i was willing to chalk up to the possibility of a balloon, even though it didn't move like ones i've ever seen in the sky before. i also saw a very similar black object in a very windy, cloudy sky over marietta, ga about 3 weeks ago while sky watching during the blue angels' practicing. that also went up high and into clouds and also, although it seems quite strange that hoaxers are letting a single black balloon go just when i happen to be looking, i chalked it up to possible balloon. but today, i can't explain away. i've never seen anything like it...Other than on these videos, that is.\r\n\r\n  while i believe that there is no possible way that earth is the only inhabited planet, i do try to be as skeptical as possible and look hard for any other reasonable explanation before admitting that i am stumped. but, i am stumped. about 10 years ago on a very dark, heavily clouded day i saw something else in buckhead that was similar that i tried reporting online to someone but they could not figure out what i meant or saw, as i had no camera with me, so there were no images or video. that one was also black, but much lower than the other things i've seen, moving at a slow, steady pace towards the east, horizontally across the sky. but that one changed shapes. it never stopped morphing as it moved. i was watching as i drove, and looking at other people in cars to see if anyone else was seeing it, but no one else seemed to. i watched it for about 2 minutes until trees got in the way for 10 or 15 seconds and when i cleared them, it was gone. i wish i had some sort of photo or video image to back up what i am saying today, but alas, i have only my report so what i have done is photoshop a shot of the same area i saw them cross, as an example of what i saw today. this looks pretty spot on, except what i saw appeared to be actual lights. i repeat, this is not an actual photo, just one doctored in photoshop as an example. i'd definitely be interested to know if anyone else in the atlanta area reported anything strange today.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time,\r\n*(wit's name

next gave me intense fear and my blood pressure dropped because in disbelief i saw a whitish disk shaped object partially hidden by a tree and brush on the left side where the lights were and sticking out to the side about 20 feet or so was a craft....I was just in awe and looking at it when a four-legged dark looking animal of some sort (later found out it was a dog because in a few minutes it came up my driveway and was just sniffing around)jumped up on the craft and started walking around....It was at that time that 4 to 5 creatures, beings or human upright type beings appeared and chased the animal off of the craft....It went to the edge and jumped off and one of the creatures, light in color but i could not see details....Only that it was fairly short about three or four feet high

and then stop and slow and then fast forward again. i was very scared at what i was seeing but i was determined to watch and decided to vent my blinds so they may not see me. i did not want to make contact for fear of abduction or something and i have a small daughter. so i just observed all night long. i thought for a moment that they were stranded. they had gotten so close to us, all the houses but nobody had on porch lights etc and were already in bed, i guess. i wondered that they were so bold as to be so close but thought they might have had craft problems. the lights were fading slowly over time like the craft was losing power....Then it looked like a signal light in the shape of three pinpoints of light forming a triangle only was left appearing....Kind of like some distress signal.  the beings were down off of the craft milling around the base and then disappeared into the woods behind the craft.  i saw some flashes of elongated laser type lights here and there like they were throwing something or striking something. i kept thinking that they may be waiting for another ship to come and get them....But what about their ship? was it going to be hauled off by some ufo tow ship? i was going to watch to find out.  i watched until around 3:45am when i noticed some more activity around the craft. no lights still except for an occasional small faint light in the upper corner of the part of the craft behind the tree side....Then it would go off, then ten or fifteen minutes later it would come on again...Then go off.  it was around four am that i started thinking they had better get their craft out or people will be seeing this in daylight. i saw that the craft looked like it was covered by some kind of tarp or something because it looked like wrinkles were in it...Very strange. several creatures were jumping around and on top of the craft and then going back in woods....And at one time sneaked or moved over to the corner of one of the houses close to me and i did not want to see it coming any closer so i put my binoculars down and closed my blinds....Really it just scared me too much.....I decided to turn on my carport light ....Maybe it would scare them off or something and they would know people were waking up etc....I did that.....And left it on for five minutes. then turned it back off and went back to observe...I fully expected the whole thing to be gone....But no it was not....Craft still there...I wanted to see it take off or get beamed up or whatever so i was still waiting.....Then about 5:30 am still no sun....It was to rise at 7:19 am., i noticed that the craft looked slightly different again....This time it had a black opening on the side like part of it opened up....Maybe they all evacuated. this is what i was thinking...It was then i looked up to the far left of the sky and saw what looked like a bright steady star....But it was moving...In a shaking hovering type pattern moving right then down some then right then down then stationary then right .....Like it was coming my way and to the forest there....I thought this might be the ship to either get them or the mother ship or something.....When it got close to the tree line i did not see it anymore. it was then that a weird shift took place with the ship....It moved or vibrated right to left but did not disappear...I kept watching until the sun was coming up just enought for me to make out that now what i was looking at was a red mitzubishi car!!! did the ship morph itself into a car? i know that i know i was not looking at a car all night....What about the lights? the creatures? i know i saw them!!! how clever of them to turn the ship into something non threatening as a car.....It seemed....Then someone can just come and haul it away....Or drive it or something. i really was wondering why the military or police were not coming out there....I was not going to call..... i did not want to get marked....I also would have loved to document this with pictures etc. but as i said was scared to draw attention to myself with flash etc. because i have a five year old sleeping in the house. anyway i did take pics of the red car. i found out later that it was my neighbors car. when she went outside to leave for work her car was rolled over into the field or placed there somehow and she did not know how.  she thought she just forgot to put it in park and it rolled there!  i was watching all night and never saw it roll out there....It was morphed there or something....The creatures tried to fool me.  i know what i saw and it was very disturbing to me and i want to know why they were here and who they are.  i also did an experiment. red cars do not look white even in moonlight....The craft i saw was solid white. i have not told but two people. it was the single most bizarre, frightening and upsetting thing i have experienced. i want to take a lie detector test to prove to myself it really happened.

object in the sky caught my attention.  the sky was very cloudy and you couldn't see any other stars, planes, the moon.  at first i thought it was a star or maybe a planet like venus or mars but then i realized it was way too cloudy and also the object was giving off an aura.  it looked like it could of be a cylinder shape and when i looked closely with my eyes it also looked like it had a red light in the center of it and i could cover it with a penny at arm's length.  i quickly jumped into my car and sped off, the object at the time was on my right side.  as i was driving down wagaraw blvd at the gas station and stop light i noticed the object was on my left now and straight ahead in the distance i saw 3 amber lights dimming in and out in the outline of a triangle.  i started to panic and said to myself it's just street lights but then i realized it was way too high in the sky to be street lights and there's no mountains or hills in that direction.  i sped off into the prospect park area, when i turned down a street that i normally take to go home i saw in the distance in front that the blue/green object was next to the triangle object (this time the blue/green object was much smaller like how an airplane would look like up in the sky, like a good 300 feet away from it and the triangle's amber lights were dimming in and out like it was communicating to the blue/green object.  again i start panicking, as i was driving down haledon ave i can see the objects still but once i got into town, the trees, lights, and buildings blocked my view and that was the last i saw of the two them.\r\n\r\nfrom the position and area they were, it looked like they could of been above the north haledon reservoir or wanaque (but my guess is wananque because of how smaller the blue/green object had gotten).\r\n\r\nonce i got outside of my house i ran out of the car into my house panicking, i couldn't sleep the rest of the night.\r\n\r\ni had so many opportunities to snap photos and video with my phone but i was too terrified to too.","distance":"Over One

cigarette.  i was sitting and reclining on my bench looking up at the sky, which was entirely clear that night.  my backyard is obscured from surrounding streetlights by homes and garages and has great visibility at night, so i was looking up at the stars when a strange triangular formation of red lights entered my field of vision at about 90 degrees elevation.  for the first instant i believed it was a meteor, before i focused on the object(s) and realized that there were at least six lights travelling in a fixed formation.\r\n\r\nthe lights had no apparent disc, although they were fairly bright. they were around the same magnitude of brightness as an average star, but distinctly red in color.  the formation was an elongated triangle and travelled close to due east for about four seconds before fading out at around 45 degrees elevation, before reaching the lower limit of my field of vision (the top of my neighbor's garage).  the object(s) passed a few degrees to the north of the pleiades, which allowed me to judge its relative size to be about twice that of the constellation. it did not appear to me as if the space between the lights obscured any stars as it passed, so i believe the lights to have been discreet separate objects travelling in formation rather than lights attached to a single object. also, there was no sound at all from the objects.  i had the impression that they were flying at extraordinary altitude, probably beyond the atmoshpere.\r\n\r\ni was startled and and somewhat spooked by the incident and remained outdoors for a few minutes after the sighting, waiting to see if the lights would return or anything else would appear.  when i returned indoors and looked at the time it was 11:50 pm.\r\n\r\ni have no idea if this will stay
