ahead.  it glided out over the freeway and then off to the right again, slightly, moving slower than the freeway traffic  (70 mph). as we were on the freeway, with other traffic, we passed by it slowly (directly underneath it, my wife,yesi, and daughter could see it out their passenger side windows).  it continued off toward the north over the hills, then turned toward the west, about a half mile north of the freeway and traveling at the same rate of speed as the freeway traffic.  as i could only look occasionally, they continued to watch it for approximately 2 minutes.  the craft was a perfect triangular shape with three bright lights shining straight down from the bottom at the corners and a small red light on what we assume is the back of the craft.  this red light was obscured by the craft itself when it turned and headed west.  it was pretty dark, but we could definately see the horizon still.  the craft itself was hard to make out except for its lights.  when it headed west, the three downward facing lights went out and the thing turned into a pulsating ball of light for 20 seconds, maybe, then it got very bright, very large, and simply disappeared.  we couldn't believe what we were seeing, we couldn't believe we didn't have the camera!  the odd and perhaps strangest thing of all is that we very recently became very interrested in the whole ufo phenomena.  we watch

am when i glanced up for no apparent reason (possibly instinct) and noticed a small metalic faceted oval cylinder cruising silently eastward. \r\n     the object was traveling in a perfectly straight line and was definately not a balloon.  it's speed was too slow to have been a winged aircraft.  it was too silent to have had a mechanical motor.  it was above normal helicopter traveling altitude and below jet liner altitude.\r\n     believe it or not, i just stopped watching the object because it was not interesting as i did not feel threatened, curious or confused by it. \r\n     it wasn't until a few minutes later that i told my friend that \"i think i saw a ufo\".  \r\n     i'm an ameteur astronomer with a telescope, and i saw a \"shooting star\" (meteor) and a satelite this morning about 5 a.M. just before i remembered my ufo sighting and decided to report it finally now an hour later.  so i'm familiar with objects in the sky during the day and at night.  ask someone if they've ever seen a star during the day (other than our sun).  very few people even know that you can see a star during the day.  i've have piloted a single engine piper cub and have flown many times in a passenger jet to other countries.  i also am familiar with mechanics and physics and i know that what i saw was not a bird, balloon, airplane, uav, helicopter, or satelite.\r\n     just for the record, although i've watched every ufo documentary in te last 30 years, i am a partial skeptic of ufo's.  i believe in the phenomena of people seeing and experiencing \"ufo's\", but i do not believe in biological alien beings from outter space.  earth is privileged to have a moon not too close and not too far, a sun not too close and not too far, an ozone layer, a \"salt water\" ocean, just the right ratio of sea and land,just the right amount of volcanic/platectonic activity, and tree with a special nut that only one creature on the earth can open it so that it can root and grow another tree (so which came first . . . the tree or the creature ?) the list of these privileges goes on and on.  the possibility and probability of any other planet having all these necessary combinations for life to survive and thrive is nill.  as is we are destroying our own planet just by our very existence.  we are destorying our ozone, forests, oceans and extincting many species of animals.  damage or destroy just one of these privileges and life will cease on earth.\r\n     what i do believe however, is that there's a global conspiracy of black projects with black funds to create aircraft for the world to see in order to create a virtual foreign invader.  humans cannot get along, but if we have a common enemy, then we will drop our differences to join forces and defeat our enemy.  a professor once told us that the world will never have peace from war without leadership. \r\n     we need a hostile common enemy from literally out of this world to get all the nations of earth to join together under a one world government.  hence, the black projects from black funds.  even your very own site mentions how president reagan told the russian president that an alien attack would get warring nations to join together.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26394,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.930293,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11062010-0004","longitude":-118.2114603,"occurred":1288281600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,

the car and stopped on the path in the front yard to look at the stars and planets for a minute.  i was pointing out to him how bright venus is in the sky this time of year.  while doing this, we suddenly noticed a very large object moving very fast from the west toward the east, almost directly over our heads.  \r\n  the object was a giant \"v\" shape (like a boomerang) and there were no lights on it.  however, there were several (i think 5 or 7) large circular shaped parts on the underside of the object that we could clearly see which looked a little like like giant headlights that would shine straight down but that were not on.  it proportion to the boomerang shaped object, the circular parts seemed to be rather large and take up a good portion of the width of each leg of the \"v\".  it was dark and we could not see the color of the object nor what it was made out of. it didn't seem \"reflective\" or that it was made of metal or glass, but we couldn't be sure because it was so dark and it was fairly high in the sky.   \r\n  it was completely silent and it moved very fast but smoothly through the sky.  it simply made a straight line path in its movement from the west toward the east- no turns that we could see. it seemed to be a consistent hight the whole time too- not moving any higher or lower as it moved along.  \r\n  it happened so quickly that all we could do was point at it with our mouths open and say, \"what in the world is that?\"  then it was out of our sight.  we quickly went inside the house and then found out that we both saw the same exact thing.  we both drew and described the same thing when we compared our perspectives on what we just saw. unfortunatly, since we were walking in from the car, we didn't have a camera with us to film this.  also, it just happened so fast that i don't believe there would have been time to film it. \r\n  we both felt very curious and a little excited.  we both had a very hard time sleeping after that, but

appeared at first appeared to be thousands of miles away and then seemed to be much closer - like an airplane with it's landing lights on - though this light seemed much too bright to be the landing lights of an aircraft that far away). then i thought that it might be a ufo and having read many accounts of people seeing ufos i determined to communicat with the object mentally (i know that sounds weird, but i have read that people have done this and i thought \"why not? let's just see what happens!\") and i \"said\" to it - \"if you are a ufo, come closer so i can take a really good look at you, but if you are an airplane, then continue doing what you are doing.\" at that point the object \"disappeared\". it didn't \"fade out\" like turning a large dc powered lamp or light off (or like a jetliner turning during an approach pattern). one second it was \"there\" and in a split second later it was \"gone\". then i observed what i will describe as \"strobes\" or quick \"flashes of light\". they were so tiny and so quick, i questioned whether i had actually seen them or if i was imagining them. there were two strobes/flashes of light. one to the left of the original position of the bright object and one to the right  of the original position of the bright object which i initially observed (and the \"flashes\" might possibly have occured at a slightly different elevation than the original bright stationary object).","distance":"Over One

skateboarding in a parking lot around dusk 7-8pm approximate area of jones and alta looking east towards lake mead (the lake). now i have lived close too nellis air force base and attended plenty of airshows so i know exactly the maneuvers and speeds that can be obtained. the four lights i saw were in a perfectly straight line they appeared just above the mountain top quite a distance from the strip they seem to have hovered for a second or two then moved very rapidly in a shaking or z shape then very suddenly disappeared. this event took place all in about a few seconds but very distinct and burned an image in my head that has prompted me to share because of the such rapid rate of movement and synchronized (spacing) of the lights at which they moved. once again it was so fast i was not sure if anyone i was with seen the same thing nor did i even mention it at the time and i have never really mentioned it to anyone since (13yrs)??","distance":"Over One

friends and have a few drinks.  as i turned onto lucknow road off of pinchum sly road, i saw three white(not bright yellow or similarly incandescent)lights in the distance.  aware that a home was in that very vicinity, i first speculated that it was yard lighting.\r\n     as i got closer, i realized these lights were over the tree tops that line the property boundary.  i immediately let of the gas pedal and allowed my vehicle to coast.  these lights were stationary there were no multiple flashing lights to suggest planes or helicopters.  these lights were positioned so that i could determine shadows (or diffusion of the light) through the limbs of the trees below the lights.  i reached a distance of fifty to seventy-five yards from the location below the closet light when all lights went out simultaneously.  i was traveling at about 25mph at that moment and lowered my window in case i could hear motors or rotors, i heard nothing but my tires on the pavement and the rush of air at that speed.  i continued to the club at a much accelerated speed constantly checking my mirrors(just in case).\r\n     i was actually uncomfortable with this experience.  at the very moment of the experience i had a terrible sense of dread.  i felt as though i should immediately go home.  i have remained silent about this incident.  i am not certain if it is from fear or the stigma attached to claimants of sightings.  in either case, this is the first and only report i have made of the incident.\r\n\r\nthank you.","distance":"101-500

room.  i look around and see 7 figures standing around me.  each of them are wearing a black trench coat type clothing or robe, and their fingers are somewhat tentacle like.  i remember starting to feel terrified for some reason as they looked at me and i was telling myself to wake up but could not.  this went on for at least 4-5 minutes.  finally, i \"wake up\" but i'm on my back, instead of my stomach, and my bed was moved an inch or so from where it was earlier.  i've never woken up so terrified in my life.  ever.  i can still remember the dream as if it were yesterday.  never been so

i noticed a bright star that was moving in an odd manner.  at first the object was moving fast.  then it slowed, sped up, and slowed down again.  after doing that for a few minutes it stopped completely and then it started to get smaller and dimmer.  not more than 2 minutes later, two military jets came into the area and circled around for about 5-10 minutes.  the star had disappeared so
