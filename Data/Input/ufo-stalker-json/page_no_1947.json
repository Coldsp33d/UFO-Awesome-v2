kind of square and had a copperish,brown color.  at first i thought it may be a kite but noticed that it was completely still and absolutely silent.  i took several pictures and zoomed in while taking them.  after a couple of minutes i continued to walk to a different area and keep an eye on the object.  as i walked around a corner and looked up again it seemed to be gone.  i continued with my walk.  but i knew i had witnessed something very out of the ordinary that evening.  i was reminded of this when i ran across an article about the object from the witnesses.  i just thought since i also observed this that i should go ahead and report it.  i will be going thru my pictures on my computer to locate the ones that i have of the object.  from what i remember they were fair and i do

extremely fast headed to the north - north west.  this would be at my 10 o'clock position through my windshield.\r\n\r\ni kept looking at it because it seemed strange, too bright and too large. i countinued looking at it and the road back and forth since i was driving. i have seen many plane lights due to hobby airport being to the south of hwy. 225 and bush international being to the north. with planes, jets, and helicopters, i have always noticed small red lights as well.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a star or a comet, but it was absolutely crystal clear blue sky - not one star, no stars, nothing. if it was a comet, the tail would have been visible. it actually looked like a small bright full moon.\r\n\r\nmy phone rang at 7:17 am and i continued looking at the light as i was driving. i mentioned to the caller what i was seeing, but since i was talking on the phone, i didn't think i could take a picture with my cell phone. then it just vanished in thin air - no smoke, no jet or plane in the sky -  nothing!!! visibility was clear for several miles - if it was a plane, once the light turned off, there was enough daylight that the plane would still be visible, but there was nothing.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26368,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.7004025,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11042010-0022","longitude":-95.2032006,"occurred":1288880160000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1288934306000,"summary":"Large

determing the actual size. there were a couple of things i noticed that were odd. one was that it was completely silent. two was that the edges were perfectly defined. you know when u see a light in the distance the edges are fuzzy, this wasn't like that, you could make out the edges. the object was perfectly round, glowed bright red but didn't light up the sky or the ground. the object moved in a northernly path for about 20 seconds then stopped and hovered for about 5 to 7 seconds. then it went east for another 5 seconds or so, hovered again for another 5 or so seconds then shot straight into the air and dissapeared. the object made a smooth path, no zigzaging or up and down moting.  my boss mentioned to me before hand that he grew up in the area and strange lights have been noticed for years, at least as long as he can remember.  i hope this information helps with ur cause. i appreciate ur time and keep up the good work, the truth needs to be known. we are ready

it was a perfectly clear nite and we had a new moon so the skies were dark and the stars were very visable. for some reason i had a gut feeling that i was going to see something strange for about 2 days prior. anyway, while looking at the stars i was thinking i was going to see a shooting star. after about 10 minutes or so looking straight up in the sky i saw something twinkling out of the corner of my eye so i kept looking even though it was very cold out side. \r\n\r\nas i looked in all directions of the sky i could not see a plane or helicoptor and noticed how calm and quiet it was outside. then i looked over top of my apartment building away from the germantown library i noticed 2 perfectly shaped triangles side by side with 3 round soft white lights one at each point in the triagle. the objects moved in a straight line. i coulc not see any metal or other detailing and there wasn't any clouds in the sky to determine the height of the ufos. it tooked the ufos only 5 to 8 seconds to cross the nightime sky until i could not see them anymore. it would have taken a regular airplane at least 1 to 2 minutes to travel that far.  \r\n\r\ni know that this was not an airplane because there was no audible sound from the craft and also the rate of speed was faster than imajinable. about 5 minutes later i saw a shooting star and 2nd white round object that made a cursive pattern in the sky. not sure what the that was. \r\n\r\nthe 2 ufos as they traveled kind of had a shadow of soft light as they went by in the night time sky. i can not explain what other type of craft this could have been. i also can not explain why i felt 2 days prior in my my gut that i was going to see something strange. it is almost like i was ment to see this phenomenal event.

this light, which did not move, but it was amber and when it became bright it was almost red, white, and then returned to amber.  i kept watching the general area, and seconds later i saw it miles

the second one moving instantly and directly horizontal, what must have been miles away, in the eastern direction.  they both stayed there for what seemed like five seconds and then they were gone.  i

a television program that described your field researchers and i liked that your set scientific and observational standards. i do not like wild speculation and absurd conjectures as i often see in deranged programs like ufo hunters or whatever it is called. i like mysteries to be approached rationally. this brings me back to the night of august 11, 2010. i have long wondered if anyone else had reported anything for that night. soon after the event, i posted an oblique statement on my facebook page ���did anyone else see that?��� simply so i would not forget the date and time. i do not jump to conclusions, but i have also failed to find a prosaic explanation for the event. \r\n\r\nthere were two other people with me who saw the strange object. i will leave their names off of here for the time being. [they live nearby, but i have not asked their permission to include them in this report.] we were standing in my driveway just after full dark. it  was likely between 8 and 9pm. checking the time for full darkness at the time of the year should some up with a very close approximate time. there was a bright moon shinning in the in the southeast quadrant of the sky. i think if it were not for that, we would have seen nothing. \r\n\r\ni was facing north toward my companions as we stood there talking. the evening was pleasant and it had grown dark. it was not unusual for us to stand outside and talk although we were about to say goodnight. one of my companions was looking behind me and saw it first. she made a gasping noise or other sound while looking into the sky behind me. i turned to see what she was looking at. we live about 20 miles from philadelphia international airport in the town of richwood, nj and frequently have large numbers of commercial airliners circling overhead. i expected something of this sort. what i saw was very different.\r\n\r\ni turned to look south and saw it almost immediately or at least the impression of it. i also said a rather surprising swear word which i would not normally use in this company.     the object was moving quickly in a east-north-east direction [toward the delaware river and chester, pa] and at first it was just a suggestion of movement because it was black against black. it was simply a different shape of black flying with no lights at all. the moonlight caught on the shape and revealed it as the sharp-angled boomerang without further detail to the surface.  \r\n\r\nit annoys me to report it as an angular boomerang shape because i know there have been many other reports like that. it was very large in the sky. much larger than the commercial airliners we see daily on their approach to philadelphia. i do not know what altitude the circling airliners are at this point in their approach, but that is probably not too difficult to find out. their windows are easily visible. this was far larger than those. there were no airplanes in sight at the time of the event. \r\n\r\nthe trouble is that for it to be that size it would have to have been either unusually low and close to us or farther away and unbelievably vast in size. the object cruised quickly by without the slightest sound or change in speed or altitude. i hoped it would pass in front of the moon, but unfortunately it moved ���beneath��� where the moon was and was quickly lost to view in  the dark. it was moving fast but without knowing the distance i would not guess at its speed. it was gone before there was much chance of further reaction. i turned to my companions and we were all equally dumbfounded. there was nothing more to do except head inside. i typed the note on facebook so i would not forget, but i also had hoped someone else might say something. it was a long shot. no one else reported anything. \r\n\r\ni have seen stealth bombers flying in the desert and they are huge. this object was at least that large, but i felt it was larger still. the stealth was my best suspect as i racked my brain, but it does not make sense. for a stealth to be that large, it would have to be too close. why would a bomber be flying so low in a densely populated area? a stealth can easily fly above local air traffic. flying without lights would be extremely dangerous around this crowded airspace even if you were training the crew in radar evasion. that part is speculation as i do not know if they even do this sort of live training. we saw no evidence of exhaust, but i believe a stealth does mask that. if it was that close, we should have heard it. i doubt that even a stealth can be that silent. \r\n\r\ni have not been able to think of an easy explanation for the object. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26350,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7226141,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11042010-0005","longitude":-75.1654566,"occurred":1281510000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1288891890000,"summary":"A very large, boomerang-shaped object tracked across the sky in a ne direction just after full dark.

pinpoint star like object very high up. at first it was stationary for the first couple of minutes than it started to drift slowly north to the sheep range/ nellis range. first thought was it was a

inside to tell the mrs and from the bedroom window on the second floor i pointed it out to her. by now it was further to the north and more at a 10 o'clock position in the sky. i noticed the winds were light out of the sw object still moving straight north. object started to oscillate going from very brilliant to almost invisible some times to other times being a sharp dark pinpoint of a dot. started to become very hard to see and than started moving straight east while still oscillating. about this time i heard the jets again and slow and low over the mountains came a couple of f22s much much lower than the object. once distracted by the f22s and the dogs barking and the mrs asking me repeatedly what the heck is that i lost track of it.","distance":"Over One

reporting it to mufon now because recent events (the national press club conference, etc.) seems to me to make it more important to do so. i am hoping it will still be helpful after all this time. here is what happened:\r\n\r\nin early 1991, i was driving to my home in morro bay, ca with my then 12 year old daughter at around 2:00am in the morning coming from atascadero, ca on hwy 41. there was little or no traffic on this route at that time in the morning. this route descends into a narrow canyon before reaching the coast. as we drove into the canyon a flashing red light caught my attention in my rear view mirror. thinking that it was an emergency vehicle approaching from my rear i was concerned because there was not really much room to pull over and let it pass. as i was watching it in my mirror i noticed that the red light was flash in a very irregular manner, unlike an ambulance or fire truck or police car. at one point the road made a large sweeping curve to the left which allowed me to look back up the canyon, which i did trying to figure how far behind me the lights were. it was then that we came upon a small turnout on the shoulder of the road and i pulled off and stopped and awaited for it to pass. when i looked back i noticed that the red light was now steady and not flashing and i realized that it was coming down the other side of the canyon slightly above and floating above the treetops. it was also maintaining a constant distance above the trees by rising and falling as it floated. there are no roads on that side of the canyon and i could see the reflection of the red glow which was coming from the curved bottom of a small (no more than 20 feet) disk shaped craft moving somewhat slowly as it followed the hillside. as my daughter had been dozing, i woke her and called her attention to what i was seeing. i also rolled down my window at this point and could tell at this time that the disk was absolutely silent - no noise at all. as we continued to watch the craft made it's way further down the canyon to a position across and slightly above ours and after passing that point it began to rise along the hillside while still moving forward until it reached the ridge at which point it went up and over the ridge and descended over the other side and out of sight. at this point it began to sink in that what we had just seen was a ufo and i experienced the hair on the back of my neck standing up. in a moment, wanting to see more, i got back on the road and sped down the canyon trying to gain another vantage point to see it again. i was not able to. my daughter was excited and agitated and kept asking me, \"what was that daddy?\", but i had no answer. we went the last few miles home in silence and soon went to bed. i know what i saw. i know it was strange, but i also know it was not some ordinary object or vehicle. as i said, to this day i have not recounted this to any but a few close family and friends. i can only hope that there is something useful and/or helpful here. i certainly will never forget it.","distance":"21-100

patio which faces north and i was looking at the stars, which i often do because i enjoy astronomy, and to have a smoke when i noticed what i thought was a big bird, for a split second, in the sky traveling from south to north. i stood up and noticed that there were two of them. then i realized that each object had six amber lights, 3 on each side and the objects were triangular in shape and had rounded tips. they were very slow moving and made absolutely no sound at all. it was at this point that i realize what i was looking at. i was in so much shock i couldn't speak and tell my husband. one of the objects was positioned slightly in front of the other. then i notice that these objects where completely blocking my view of the stars to the north. the sky and stars in that area were distorted kind of like they were being pulled towards the center of the ufo and then they suddenly disappeared. since then i guess you would say i have been in denial. i reported that same night to the national ufo reporting website and just buried that event then when my report posted on the website i discovered that another person here in hemet also seen a ufo about 15 minutes prior to me and i literally freaked out. it became real to me. i just can't believe that this is really real. i had always been a skeptic. i was curious but now i am a believer!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

the world of course. then i asked my neighbor to use her phone. as i was standing outside listening to the phone dial. the sky caught my eye and i just froze and stared at this big premises in the sky with bright lights circling around then coming together really fast. i told my friend on the phone what i had seen and he just laughed at me and called me crazy. i know what i saw. i was disappointed. i was thinking that it was a child with some crazy flash light but the circles spun so fast i new it wasn't. after i hung up with my friend i was so upset with him that i wasn't paying attention anymore so i went inside. later on i came back outside and the sky seemed very different. the clouds where red like an indian sky only in the night but there was black gas paint looking splatters that threw me off. i observed everything. that is the only clue i had. i came inside and looked some stuff up on this mysterious happening and found some interesting stuff. i love this kind of stuff and feel pretty awesome witnessing it. it's kind of a highlight of my day after how foul it was.","distance":"101-500

phone while standing in my back yard (slidell, louisiana, 30 miles to the north of new orleans, louisiana), watching my dog.  my friend asked if it was cloudy and i looked up and said no, the stars are out, then all of a sudden i realized something was blocking the area of sky i had been looking at.  it was a large rectangular craft,dark in color, smooth texture, no lights, no sound.   my guess was it was approximately 50 to 60 feet in length, not far above the trees, moving from southeast towards the northwest, so slowly i cannot imagine how it stayed in the sky.  i could not move, i was so frightened, and repeatedly said, oh my god, over and over in a frightened voice, until i heard my friend asking if i was alright, i described what i was seeing to him, and at first he laughed thinking i was joking, but realized i wasn't.  the object made absolutely no noise, not a dog in the area barked, including my dog. the ufo slide through the sky effortlessly. i am wondering if anyone else in my area saw this ufo?  it was spectacular!  i've never seen anything like it before!  wish i hadn't felt so frightened.  i watched it until i couldn't see it anymore, it disappeared behind the trees.  the whole incident lasted about 15 minutes, or less.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line
