1986. it was very cold and clear with a stiff breeze and my two younger sisters and i decided to ice skate on a small farm pond. \r\n\r\nwhen we left the house peter jennings was signing off so it was almost 7 p.M. when we got to the ice i heard some snowmobiles running down a trail about 400 yards downhill from our location. i immediately noticed that approximately 10 feet above them there were twinkling lights so i thought what kind of banner antenna thing are they carrying?\r\n\r\nmy youngest sister needed help with her skates so i began to help her but kept glancing toward the snowmobiles. they began to move through a hollow of trees and i couldn't see them and realized that the light was moving away from them, but i still thought it was being caused by the snowmobiles headlights? \r\n\r\ni asked my other sister who was skating around the pond what she thought was causing the lights. she spots a jet going overhead and informs me it's just a plane, they always look like that. we start arguing, but i don't see the lights any more...So i'm just thinking some weird atmospheric event when all of a sudden i see it directly overhead. i'm screaming there it is, run. the sister i was fighting with is all like you're just trying to scare me and skates off to the far end of the pond.\r\n\r\ni'm running off the pond into knee deep snow. i glance back my youngest sister is standing looking up at this triangle that is lit on three corners with white lights. it looked like you could see the stars through it and it's getting lower. \r\n\r\nthe sister who i was fighting with is now trying to listen to me and get off the ice. i realize there is no way my youngest sister can run through that snow with skates on. i run back onto the ice and drag them into the snow at the side of the ice. i toss a few handfuls of grass and snow on top of us and we are all laying on the ice staring up at this thing, that looks like it is going to land right on top of us.\r\n\r\ni start praying all the prayers i ever learned mostly like please help us god and mary, mother of god, the choirs of angels all the saints and people who have died before us.\r\n\r\nit hovers over us and than all of a sudden it flashes and the only thing i can describe it like was as if a big poloroid flash cube went off, the kind, where you can't see too well for awhile. the triangle gradually lifted off. it flew off over our house hesitated over the house and as it got further away it began to look like a twinkling strange reflection again.\r\n\r\nwhen it was over the house i was able to see that it was a very metal looking craft of some sort. it was about two hay wagons wide. there was no markings or anything to give it away as man made.\r\n\r\nwe all started to laugh and say we were going to be in some alien's photo album of my trip to earth. we walked back up to the house with our skates on. at this point my youngest sister asked what was that? i realized we weren't acting quite right so i wrote everything down and think its the only reason i remember it well. also jeopardy was on when we got back to the house so i don't think we had lost time.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

for a wile already, i mean for years, but its hard to talk about it with your own family, and what to say about your friends, they think you're crazy, well i have two grandkids, and since i'm always playing with them, i started showing them those spheres i was looking at once in a wile on the sky, and i was telling them they were balloons, you know they're kids, so i didn't want'em to go around and telling other kids they're watching ufos, and after a while they were the ones telling me that there was a balloon on the sky, and that wasn't moving, so we looked for it and yes there it was, it was like a white balloon just sitting there in the sky without any movement at all and then disappeared, and these is been going on for a while, and we see'em very often. but on july 24 we got to see up to 24 of them in a period of time of 3 to 4 hrs, it was on july 24 2010 from 4 pm till 7 pm. and last saturday october 30th around 1 pm, we saw another one, well i said we, because this time i got to show it to my son my wife my daughter in law and the kids, but this one was different to the other ones this one was shining and was like transforming, sometimes it was a sphere with something that looks like a tail hanging from it, and sometimes like a sphere, but there were times that it looked like a disk and was shining, and sometimes disappearing from our view, and this weekend on sunday afternoon we realized they also fly kind of low, almost ground touching, well not that low but we can say maybe a couple hundred feet above ground level. i tried to take video, but it's very hard to focus those small spheres on the sky, but i manage to take video from two of them, but maybe only for 2 or 3 seconds, also there's a web site called, earthcam, with cameras streaming live images from different parts of the world, i normally use that page to set up a live image on my computer as a wallpaper, and  the camera i normally use in that page is in chile, south america, i type in the word patagonia and it starts streaming live video, and you'll be amazed by the images you get to see  there. \"ufo\" images (you'll see'em when you less expected) and it gives you the option to save the image like a picture, i have taken a couple of pictures where you get to see what i'm talking about, give it the try and find out for your self, this is not every day, and its only when the camera is pointing to the mountains, normally from 9:00 am til noon. los angeles local time, now if you want to see those spheres i'm talking about, you can do it. it takes time but specially you have to be patient.And here in california i normally see'em from 4 pm to 7 pm its when i get to my son's house after work and i start playing with the kids at the front yard,and also at nigh they can be seen at any time, normally they're red color at night.You'll recognize'em by the way they move or fly, very different to any airplane. on day time they're normally white color, but once in a while we get to see'em on blue or red color,and some times you see'em changing color from white to red or yellow. again it takes time and patient. also i'm attaching 3 pictures, two of them are from the same object, but if you see on one of the pictures the object is closer to the edge than the other one, because it was moving up and down, and like i said the web site gives you the option to take pictures in real time while streaming, now on the other picture you'll see two objects in the center of the image, disk shaped and also two more in the right hand side at the bottom of the same image. well. if you really want to see it for your self keep looking up, or go to the web site i mentioned before. false, truth, is up to you to decide.

direction in a straight line towards los angeles international airport and at first i thought it was a cluster of thin metallic plastic party balloons which had either been released or had escaped.  as i looked closer, they seemed to look \"funny\" somehow.  they also seemed to be tumbling as a group in the sky and i realized they were moving too fast, unless there was a high speed wind up where they were.  there was no breeze or wind on the ground.  later i realized that as they had been heading directly for the pacific ocean, the wind would have been blowing from west to east, so they would have been traveling against the wind.\r\n\r\ni grabbed my camera (a canon t2i with a tamron 300mm lens), ran outside and looked over the roof of my house where i estimated the object would have have reached by then, on the basis of extrapolating its motion from my window.\r\n\r\nbut i could not see it anywhere.  i was shocked by this.  i could not believe something so clearly visible could have simply disappeared in a cloudless clear blue sky and so i carefully searched the entire sky area but had to conclude it was gone!!\r\n\r\ni then searched back to the east where i had first seen it from inside my house ��������� closer to the horizon and there it was again, apparently in the same position and traveling at the same speed and slowly tumbling.\r\n\r\ni began to try to get pictures and video of the object as it crossed the sky in about 3 minutes.  my first view of it was at an angle of about a 45 degrees to the east and i lost sight of it when it became too small a point to see or to photograph in the west.   looking at a map later i saw that it would appear to have traveled slightly to the north of los angeles international airport and then continued out over the ocean.\r\n\r\ni was able to get two sharp photos but no video.  using photoshop i zoomed the images of the object out to 300% and then cut and pasted one image next to the other for comparison.  you can see that the object has rotated.  i saved these two blown up images in one file and i then reduced the size of the original image to give an idea of its size of the object's appearance in the sky.\r\n\r\nif the object had been viewable by radar, i am sure that lax will have a clear record of its movements.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26335,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9616801,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11032010-0021","longitude":-118.3531311,"occurred":1288810200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1288828606000,"summary":"Tumbling

results. dam, republicans lost. and gold is now in limbo.\r\n  but then, i realized i could get 'coast-to-coast' on xm 165. so at 10 pm, i went to get a coffee and headed on p.C.H. to huntington beach, ca. to listen to 'coast to coast' for a couple of hours and enjoy the nice cool sea-breeze and stargaze for about 20 or 30 min.\r\n   at the news brake, at the top of the hour around 11:59 pm, i decided\r\nto get out of my truck, and check out the sky (jupiter) with my binoculars.\r\n  \r\n while looking at jupiter, facing west, i noticed four very faint and dull stars- about the width of two fingers at arms length underneath jupiter.\r\n  \r\nthough, i'm not sure that's a valid measurement- but it works for me.\r\n   while thinking about reporting this sighting, i noticed on the mufon\r\nwebsite, that there have been other sighting, san diego and northward.\r\n\r\n at absolute magnitude- sun being -30, i'd say these objects- unseen to the\r\nnaked eye (with eye sight seeing around plus 5 or 7), would have been close to around a +10 to +15 magnitude... apparent or absolute- not sure.\r\n  and since, i can't remember what the full moon is at absolute magnitude. i'd have to just say; that they just didn't give off much 'light'. the only way to see them was with binoculars.\r\n   they (the four stars) just looked like- in the shape of- an engine of a rocket looking up from the bottom- that was orbiting earth.\r\n\r\n    each one, looked like- almost large enough in size to eclipse jupiter.\r\n   after about 20 minutes of looking them, i realized, i could go to sunset beach about 6 to 7 miles away and view them.\r\n   the locations, and angles being different, but still had the objects were apparently under jupiter. \r\n   at huntington beach, jupiter seemed to be appearing over three oil rigs\r\n very wide apart. \r\n   at sunset beach, jupiter wasn't even near the oil rigs. and appeared over three other oil rigs further out.\r\n   suggesting the objects under jupiter were outside earth's atmosphere.\r\n  and since didn't have the equipment like a protractor to find the angles with me. i decided to stop at that point and get the supplies later to huntington beach and sunset beach to do a triangulation and parallax.\r\n   sounds fun.\r\n   though, i did check the 'stellarium' program and came up with a possible\r\nexplanation for the objects- \r\n         stars: hip- 9639, hip- 114855, hip- 115115.\r\n    these stars resemble the shape and were near (and under) jupiter.\r\n                    end of sighting report...\r\n  i don't think i was abducted, and the objects were still there when i left. i was thinking about a lot of this stuff below...\r\n\r\n  \r\n   but since i don't know exactly what they were, i'm reporting the \r\nsighting.\r\n    i guess i'll know for sure on november 12th when 'skyline' comes out.\r\n    i don't normally report sightings cause i don't usually see objects that i would call 'unknown' or  ufos.\r\n                     \r\n    but using the 'foia' in the early 1980's, the fbi sent me a ufo document in 1984-5, claiming that the air force had 3 dead aliens in silver metallic uniforms- referring to the roswell incident in 1947.  \r\n    i think the air force wanted the fbi to believe they had dead aliens\r\nto create an allusion. to cover up the captured of german made craft, i've seen pictures of on the internet.\r\n    one consistant thing, i've noticed, ufo's always land in the most odd places- mountains, swamps, desert areas, farms of many acres, etc\r\n   are they 'drug' running? cops never seem to catch them..\r\n     and why do they seem to be using astrology?\r\n  like the kenneth arnold chart, which seemed predict the 'challenger' disaster-\r\n 'bouncing light off the moon from the sun hits 'uranus' transit- 18 degrees sagittarius.'\r\n \r\n 'majestic 12', seems to be a horoscope of 12 ships coming into port in messina, italy ,october 1st, 1347, maybe at 11:02 am.\r\n   600 years before the group, majestic 12, is mentioned.\r\n   what? aliens gave us the 'bubonic plague'? like cortez? and the spanish flu?\r\n   and the 12 ships coming into port would look kind of 'majestic' to the people living there, up until they talked to the sailors and got sick themselves.\r\n   the horoscope has good friday- earth day, 2011 on it. so red alert\r\non april 22nd, 2011.\r\n    the chart also has predicted events of this past month, i just didn't know what they were or where, or whether to believe the chart was being used..\r\n   though, i have an idea- how that work. one way using the part of fortune, and using combinations of charts to triangulate the general day, time and location. a lot of effort.\r\n   on 9-11 the usa chart was very active, as well as the chart of japan attacking china. july 07th, 1937.  7x7 is 49.   july 1952, plus 49 years is 2001. thus 3 ufo's over andrews air force base.\r\n   and a japanese-american designed the world trade center.\r\n    \r\n   but on the oct 1st, 1347 in messina, italy chart.\r\n things like the spanish flu... \r\n     pearl harbor...\r\n     invasion of poland.. and a lot of other stuff are on it.\r\n    plus, aliens are real, they seem to be travel 30 plus trillion miles to earth, and while in earth's atmosphere, the f-16 size objects, don't seem to travel at  or near supersonic speed.\r\n   accept maybe, july 1952, when one of three ufo's traveling at 100 mph accelerates to mach 9 traveling a distance of 11.1 miles. if true, a lot of windows would have been shattered.\r\n   the speed was said to be 7300 mph subtract 100 mph is 7200.\r\n  the world trade center- tower one is complete in 19'72'.\r\n   tower two, south, is completed in 19'73'\r\n     19 terrorist' 72-73. or maybe flight

the lights stop blinking and it starts to move towards my wife and i as i started telling her this is how my dream started i had a day ja vu from that dream at that exact moment than it was as if it turned into a ball of fire and started to head closer and closer to us than all the sudden it quikly turned left and it stopped the ball of fire thing and started to blink and went to the left a plane not far at all from this object flew over the top of it. all the sudden it turned into a ball of fire and went to the right way passed the plane blinking normal blue and white and red at the wings. it shot over within a blink of an eye and started to move closer towards the rockford airport direction than my wife and i wanted to get in the car to go chase it but by the time she ran in and got the keys we lost sight of it no cameras no pictures only with our very own eyes this is not the first time we have seen these flying objects but i decided to start recording them now for the sake that people really need to know our government is hiding these ufo's and the true name of our savior is yahwey and when you start to speak his nameand pray you really do start seeing these things im not joking also you should really look at the clouds sometimes they cloak in our clouds and some can even look like clouds we really need to know the truth and that we are not alone and i think the ancient people knew that also i do believe that we do have a underwater civilization that we dont know of but you can definitely check the records of the navy of uso's. back in egypt as everyone should know we were enslaved by water like creatures and yahwey helped us escape from there clutches we built false gods and worshipped them, that is against the commandments yahwey gave us and if you

sky is very clear tonight 11/2/10. my mom said \"look that must be a planet, i wonder what planet it is?\" (the object was very bright like that of a planet no blinking lights were visible it was just a very bright white light identical to a very bright star). it was out the front of the windshield nearly overhead west of the car. i looked up at it and said \"i don't know...\" i examined it for a moment and noticed that while a star near it was stationary it was moving closer to the star but i wasn't sure if it was moving since we were also moving. next, it moved quickly across the sky towards the north, north-east on a straight path. i speculated that it was \"probably a satellite\" and at the top of the hill i stopped the car completely to watch it. we watched as it sped up and into the distance. my younger sister had her window open and heard no sound coming from the object. it then swerved severely left and then severely right and then left again and right before i saw it vanish completely as if the light was turned off (not as if it had faded into the distance). we have no explanation for it, as our initial thought was that it was a satellite, but once it swerved that had to be ruled out and the fact that it was nearly overhead and no sound was coming from it meant that it could not be a helicopter or plane. we live in a populated area so i'm hoping others report seeing
