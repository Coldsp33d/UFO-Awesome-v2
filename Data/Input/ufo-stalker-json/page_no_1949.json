event in 2003, i was not alone. i happened to look up and coming over the tall wall, a straight object moving at a slower speed than a commercial jet, was flying toward me from the north. the i told the person next to me to look, and i pointed. he and the rest of the people with me saw the object halt, while a second one came into the picture (wide open roof) and did the exact same thing, a perfect stop, right next to the other. the objects where literally suspended straight up above us for about ten seconds, while a third one came into the picture, the first one started to move forward again, moving south. seconds later, the second did exactly same, while the third kept moving without stopping. this event lasted for less than a minute. these objects were materialized, not holograms. they made no sound. the color was grey white, enough to see the shape ( sharp right angles, no curves) llllllllllllllllllllllllll\r\n\r\ni have seen other objects since, though not so formal ( pausing

had around 5 minutes before i had to start one of the last movies before a long break so i went out back just to get some fresh air.  it was dark outside when i went out and i was just looking around at my surroundings (a field, office buildings, a small back road) when i looked at the tree line and saw some odd lights in the distance above the tree line. they were four red lights forming the shape of a triangle (three lights forming the triangle and a fourth in the center of the triangle).  the lights did not blink or move, they stayed on the entire time and there was no movement for over one minute. i remember standing and thinking what could this thing be? i thought it could be a radio tower with a plane passing it in the distance.  \r\ni stood there looking at this object trying to think of every possible solution to what it could be other than a ufo until it started to move. at that point i knew it was something very different.  the object slowly turned in the same spot where it was located, until the lights resembeled a vertical straight line. at this point the object looked like a straight line with three red lights.  when watching the object turn i did remember that all of the lights stayed on the entire time it turned. there were no lights that shut off or blinked. once the object was in the vertical stance for a moment, two of the lights slowly disappeared (the top and bottom lights leaving the center light on) until the final light in the middle vanished.   i am unsure if the lights turned off or if the object flew away.  i did not get any picture or video evidence of this because my phone was on my desk inside.  i tried to think of every possible flying object or radio tower that knew of to rule out a ufo, but this was just too odd. i did not think of

 through the la live spotlights and over the roof of the petroleum building there appeared what i initially thought was just stars.  then the \"stars\" started growing brighter in clusters of two or three.  i discerned a string like pattern (almost like connect the dots) with various \"stars\" illuminating.  i did not discern any pattern, though groups of two or three \"stars\" appeared to shine with greater intensity, sometimes towards the front of the \"string\", then \"stars\" towards the back of the string would intensify shortly after the last group dimmed (but remained visible).\r\n\r\nthe whole string appeared to move very slightly, perpendicular to the lines of planes heading for lax.  i used the flag posts on the top of the petroleum building as a reference point.  the \"string\" appeared about three times the apparent diameter of the moon.  it was not a straight line, but was an almost tree like assembly of \"stars\" which seemed to extend straight then loop around at the back.  it did not appear to me that the la live spotlights were illuminating the string.  from my vantage point the string appeared two or three times higher than jets inbound to lax on the typical night western to eastern trajectory (where they typically loop around and land to the west going into lax.)\r\n\r\ni observed the \"string\" for about two minutes and concluded it could be a group of star like objects flying together, as i was unable to discern any structure connecting the independent white points of light.  what really struck me as odd was how only two or three of the stars would grow in intensity, then fade (though remain still visible) and then a few moments a different set of two or three \"stars\" would grow in intensity for a couple of seconds, with the whole lot (about 10-15) remaining visible throughout.  the \"stars\" that intensified were always clumped in adjacent groups of two or three (i.E. if the lights in front intensified, the ones ion back remained constant). \r\n\r\ni walked past the petroleum building to see if the string would be visible from a different vantage point.  it was not.  i then returned to my original vantage point but could not see the string at all.  a minute or two later two strobing red lights were seen, which moved like aircraft.  these lights flew past the area where the string had been, then looped back around (after a couple of minutes).\r\n\r\noverall this was a very odd experience.  there is always a lot of air traffic at night over downtown los angeles, but i've never seen anything like this before.  i do not think this was a single object, but multiple.  they appeared at high altitude and became invisible after a couple of minutes.  during the time they were visible, the truly odd thing was how some increased (flashed) in intensity, as described above.

in boulder sunday afternoon looking at children in their costumes. we were standing at the intersection of pearl street and 14th street looking east. i noticed several balloons were being released into the sky and i was trying to see how high they would go. there were several gliders flying around also that day from the nearby airport, and occasionally caught a few glimpses of the sun gleaming off of them as they very slowly cruised across the sky. \r\n\r\nas i was watching one of the gliders, i saw what looked like a shooting star or meteorite travel right behind the glider, as it was very bright and possibly a little yellowish in color. there was no noise. i thought maybe it was a balloon, but then thought there's no way it could travel that fast across the sky... but maybe its really windy up there. it had traveled about two or three widths of my hand across the sky in less than a second (measured with my arm fully extended out.) it was really small and hard to see, maybe like trying to look at a star during the daytime. this object seemed to fade in and then fade away as if it was a light that went out, maybe it went behind some moisture in the air but it looked as if it was gone. right after i was thinking maybe it was a shooting star, about a half second after that it reappeared and went back the direction in which it came at the same speed and disappeared again. there was no trail like i have seen on shooting stars thought. next, i couldn't tell if it disappeared or if i'd lost track of it as it was so small it was hard to see. at this point i thought a balloon couldn't have back tracked that quickly. maybe they were satellites i thought. \r\n\r\nat this point i told my girlfriend to look up at the sky in the direction of the phenomenon to see what she though, while she didn't see anything she said it was probably a balloon. as i kept an eye on them i now saw two of these objects fly across the sky side-by-side about two finger widths apart, definitely not balloons flying in formation. i pointed to the area again as one or two of them continued to move around the sky in large arcs, fading in and out and zig zagging through the sky. she said that she also saw them move quickly and zig zag and doubted they could be balloons, but refrained to say what she thought they were. i guess the range of the sky they were moving in was approximately a four foot square area at arms length, enough to need to turn my head a bit to watch, maybe a larger area as i lost track of them several times. it was a comforting feeling to me that she saw them also. towards the last few minutes of watching them they were moving at what seemed like large distances in a very short amount of time. based off of seeing the latest military jets at the local air show this summer, there's no way they were conventional aircraft. they (or one of them) seemed to get closer and further away and at times seemed as i could barely see them. at one point the object slowed down momentarily and appeared to get bright yellow-orange while it sparkled like a star, and appeared to be approximately the size of the largest star in the sky i've seen at night, at this point it kind of looked like a mini sun. they just seemed to fade away and we never saw them again.\r\n\r\nit was pretty exciting to see what ever phenomenon this was. the fact that at least two of these lights flew together makes be believe it was intelligently controlled, but by who?","distance":"Over One

down river from fremont, wi. (20 miles west of appleton,wi.). it was dusk. the sky was clear, stars were very very faint. i was facing southeast, a planet was the brightest object in the sky (venus?) it was this planet i was looking at. it wasn't dark yet (azure skies).The planet was off my 2o'clock the object came into view off my right shoulder slightly below the planet. it was as bright as the planet and about the same size. the planet was a brilliant white while the object was more like a dirty white.It moved in a straight path in a northerly direction from my right shoulder to my nose. the motion was odd, more like quickly floating horizontily then being propelled. it reminded me like letting a helium balloon go and watching it go skyward but on a horizontil plane. i watched it for 30 sec. to 1 min. it didn,t waver or strobe or flash. i wasn,t overly concerned when i saw it at first thinking it was a plane until i realized the speed and altitude were wrong then i thought it was weird (different). i continued to observe the object until like i said it got to about my 12 o'clock and it went out. it was like someone flipped a switch it just went out. it was well above the horizon and tree line across the river, no clouds or anything to obstruct my view. it didn't go up or down left or right it just went out and the sky where it was was empty. i live near the airport in racine, drive past the airport in milwaukee daily, drive past the eaa airport in oskosh almost every weekend from spring to fall, in all types of weather and different times of day or night and i have never witnessed anything like this. this is a rural area no city lights or abundent air traffic. i wasn't afraid or in awe. my feeling was that this is really weird. i didn't do anything but stand there and watch. i

california.  i happened to just look up into the sky noticing how clear and blue it was.  suddenly i saw a white sphere coming from the southwest.  i thought it looked funny because there were no ���wings or tail��� that an airplane would have.  it was small���i can only describe it as the same size as a large star you would see at night.  there was no sound or contrails coming from it.  the first white object was zipping very fast, just like a ���shooting star���, but it was flying straight, even with the horizon, not shooting down in an arc motion as a star would.  then, another white sphere came speeding from the same southwest direction right along side the first one.  the second one neared the first one, it was getting closer and closer to it���i wanted to see if they would ���join or connect��� with each other, but they disappeared behind some puffy clouds off into the northeastern distance.  by this time, i was at a stop light and the light turned green, so i had to drive ahead. these objects moved so quickly, i didn't have my camera with me, but i don't think i'd even have time to grab a camera and try to videotape them.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
