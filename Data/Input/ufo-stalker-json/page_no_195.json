crackers.  it was either 4th of july or new years eve, i can't remember.  three of my friends and i were outside on the street in hawaii kai, hi. close to the area called portlock.  while we were messing around in the street something very dark and very large came into our view, maybe 200ft above us.  as it came closer, the street lights that it passed changed from a low luminescent orange to a bright, light blue.  as the craft came very slowly above us, i became paralyzed and couldn't move my body.  i was able to move my eyes around and observed that my three friends were also in a paralyzed state, looking up in shock.  the ufo was triangular shaped and had three half domes at each end.  dark, and i remember it not having a smooth bottom, but rather complicated similar to a sci-fi fi movie. there is a brief moment of time, seconds, that i can't recall.  as it slowly passed over us, at a walking pace, the street lights changed back to their normal orange glow.  this happened one by one and down the street path as it passed.  i remember as soon as the lights changed back, i was \"let loose\", along with my three friends and we all looked at each other in terror and ran back inside to tell our parents what just happened.  our parents were drunk and partying and dismissed our story all together.  as kids, we continued the night inside and i dont remember anything afterwords.\r\n\r\nafter the incident it seemed like we all forgot what happened.  several years later i moved from hawaii and from my friends.  as life went on, that moment was always in the back of my mind, but i wasn't sure if it really happened or if it was a dream.  when i was 19 i went back to hawaii and reunited with my friends. only one of them still resides there and  i asked him if he recalled a time that this happened to all of us or if it was just a dream or my imagination.  in his hawaiian pigeon, he confirmed the incident with me actually happened, and also said he thought it was a dream.\r\n\r\nseveral more years later i went to las vegas to meet with my buddy who still lives in hawaii, and to also meet with my other two friends from the incident.  i brought this incident up with everyone and all four of us experienced the same thing and confirmed that it was not a dream.  \r\n\r\ni have a couple other observations, but this event was absolutely the most significant.  \r\n\r\nthe truth is on its way and i am waiting patiently!\r\n\r\n ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome, Patterned

in the neighborhood where i grew up.  i was alone, and had spent some time with friends on the block. i had left them to go home.  as i was walking, i heard a faint beeping sound that seemed to get more audible as i got closer to the object.  when i got within 5 feet of the object, it was already on the ground just off the roadway to the side.  i didn't see the object land, i just walked up on it already on the ground and it was beeping.  i could see it on the ground about 5 feet from me. the object was solid cylindrical shape and chrome metallic like aluminum or metal. the object was about 15 inches long and 12 inches round.  it had no holes or vents or openings.  i did not pick it up.  i stood and looked and listened to it for about 5 to 10 minutes.  i felt like i was kinda compelled to stand there and do nothing but observe the object and listen to the beeps.  the beeps didn't seem to have a pattern and they were non-musical but sounded like a very slowed down morse code.  i couldn't tell if it was a pattern.  the volume of the sound of the beeps was like when a microwave oven beeps to let you know your food is ready. this happened about in 1972 and the only technological invention that i know of that could have sounded like that would have been a microwave oven beeping.  the beeps seemed to be coming off of the object somehow but i didn't see any speakers or any openings on the object, no lights on the object, not vents. i remember thinking maybe i should touch it on the ground or try to pick it up and bring it home with me.  i don't know if it was fear or if i was somehow being psychologically prevented from reaching down for it, but i was convinced somehow not to touch it. after about 5 to 10 minutes of just looking at it and hearing the beeps, i continued walking home leaving it there on the ground.  it bothered me when i got home that i had seen this strange thing on the ground.  i wanted to tell my mother that i had just seen this thing on the ground but i didn't think she'd believe me or she'd think i was playing a trick on her.  so, i decided to go back to where i saw it and retrieve it off the ground for proof.  i left my house to go back for it after about 30 minutes of being home after i first saw it.  when i got back to where i had seen the object on the ground, it was no longer there.  years have passed since then, i've kept this to myself, only telling a few people who i thought wouldn't ridicule me, but i never saw anything like it again, even as i've seen the birth of new technological inventions come to forth.  now, in 2017, i am considered by many to be a musical genius, i have a master degree in computer science and information technology, and i've retired from working in the field of technology.  i keep remembering that moment vividly when i first encountered that object on the ground. i've told my story more than a few times to my spouse over the years when i felt like i just have to get it off my mind. i have become a sci-fi enthusiast in regard to ufos and extra-terrestrial phenomena.  it's been many years since this event, and i've tried to forget about it, and sometimes i do forget about it, but at other times the memory of it is back on my mind vividly.  i don't know if that was a life-changing event for me encountering this object. i keep feeling like i know something that nobody else knows, like a feeling of enlightenment that's been with me since hearing those beeps.","distance":"20 Feet or

i played the video back i heard the strangest sounds, i listened to it several times and the sounds were still there. i decided to take another video to check if it were perhaps an issue with the phone, the sounds were not heard on the 3 subsequent videos. on these videos i was asking questions such as \"who are you\", \"why are you here\" ,\"you need to leave\" , when i listened to the videos, all of my questions had been erased and replaced with other sounds, the only question that remained was \"who are you\" ...I sent these over to two friends who are much more knowledgeable than me on such issues, neither of them heard anything, just saw the moon and the light that popped up below, i sent them  several times,how could they not hear the audio, it made no sense, then, suddenly each replayed the video and heard all the sounds i was speaking of..... both said they heard a low guttural voice on the third video. i'm not the type to fear things, i live alone, out in the texas hill country, but, on this night, i became nothing less than terrified. i felt i was not alone, i locked myself in the bedroom with my dogs, drew all the drapes and literally hid under the blankets like a frightened child. when morning finally came, i was sitting on my back deck and noticed an odd indentation on my leg. it was about an inch across, the outer edges were deep and inside those edges there were little dots and in the very middle was another , more solid indentation. there is no way, there was anything in my bed that could have made such deep indentations on my skin. i would liken it to wearing a pair of jeans that are too tight and the button leaves a visible mark. then, i noticed 2 fresh bruises, one on each leg. i took photos of all three. later in the day, i took a look at where the indentation had been and it was gone as were the bruises...I also felt quite a bit of soreness in the leg where i had the indentation. i'm sharing all this from memory, because, quite honestly, to listen to the videos once again or spend time looking at the photos, is a bit uncomfortable.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

all if a sudden one if the clouds hanging over the river between ontario and quebec seemed to have what appeared to be a darker square like cloud under it but seemed attached. i took out my binoculars and sure enough it looked like a small dark square made of something solid bout cloud was over it. i put down the camera for a minute and when i picked it back up the sun was shining on one side of the square and it reflected as if metal. it was definitely a cube then. the sun went in and when i looked again the object seemed to have split and then later seemed to 've one again and wasn't as square ad before. actually after i took the 3 photos of it and enlarged the last picture, tjis goinh to sound odd butmtge shape reminded me if the nazi die glock..The bell that some say could time travel. it was the same shape of that bell.  all the time it hung there it didn't go anywhere..Just stayed over the river and seemed to change shape by absorbing another object or just shape shifting. i don't know if it went back up into the dark cloud or disintegrate but my guess is the former. i have had 7 other sightings of different ufis in this same area and wondered about this area being a portal. i live in the capital too though so government experimental craft can't be excluded either.  if you don't get my 3 photos of the event let me know and i can send them another

when i noticed something in the corner of my eye, so i turned around to face north, i then saw a bright white light gliding over the houses. i took a few step to look at it better(which now had me standing at the end of my building), all of a sudden, i had this feeling, that told me to turn around, when i did, i saw another bright light towards the end of my building, i then turned and started watching this light.\r\n\r\nbecause i am now use to ufos turning up over me and my building, i just thought, here we go again.\r\n\r\ni started to feel scared, which i normally don't, because they don't normally bother me, they just turn up, stop or slow down, look and then go, but this time something felt different.\r\n\r\nthis light started getting bigger and bigger and my head was telling me to move, move, i ran back to the entrance to my building, i was shaking and crying.  i then went inside my house to calm myself down.  \r\n\r\nabout an hour later, i went back outside, and at 12.55am, i saw another ufo(the reason, i notice the ufos, is because, someone is using some type of laser to shot at them, and i often see the laser first, then the ufo, it may sound crazy, but this is happening over london) and again, the light blew up in front of me, i screamed and then ran back to my entrance to my building.\r\nwhen i looked at the time on my phone, it was nearly 3am, which freaked me out, because i know i was not outside for that long.\r\nthe next morning, i had a strange feeling headache(which lasted two days) and a nose bleed, which i never ever get.\r\nthe inside of my nose is sore,and has scabbed over.\r\n\r\ni don't know what these things are,or why they keep bothering me,which has been happening for 7 years now. i just want someone to come and see what happens, every time i go outside on a clear night. its so bad, that i can't walk to the end of my rd, anymore after a certain time, i cant even cross the rd, because in the past i have been chased by these lights. i need some help with this issue. they have even turned up, when i've gone to my daughter house, how do they know,when i'm outside or at my daughters home? i have had ufos turn up seconds, after i have gone outside, how is this happening? i have witnesses, that you can interview, who will tell you, that i'm telling the truth. i have pictures, going back years of ufos over me and my building, i have videos. all i want to do is stargaze, without something coming along and frightening all the time, i just want to enjoy the night sky, without, seeing a laser fly over my head. i just want us to stop shooting at these crafts, mankind does not have to destroy everything it sees.

about a mile or so above the earth. then suddenly it moved about 20 degrees north in less than 1 second, if i had to guess, it was approximately 1-2 miles (witch really got my interest). it continued to blink a white light for about 5 minutes. then for approx. 1 minute, the white lights stopped, and two red lights appeared close together, and they did not blink. then white lights re-appeared and were blinking again for another 5 minutes. as the fireworks went into the grand finale, it stayed till it was over. it then took off north in a extremly quick streak, ( a microsecond )and disappeared. after observing what i saw, i asked an older gentlemen who was sitting nearby if he saw the lights as well, and he told me he noticed them also. it is my opinion that there is nothing that i know of that can move that fast, and can take off that quickly. and stop that fast. i believe we were being observed by this craft, and that it was possibly an alien entity. or possibly a military/experimental aircraft observing us. this experience was very similar to a sighting that i, and about 1 dozen people observed in 1978, that was only about 10 miles south of this

seem to recall having  trouble sleeping that morning, so i stepped out onto the back deck to check the weather and have a cigarette.  the deck of the house provides a  view of the nw,  north and ne areas of the sky. it is a residential neighbourhood  so a view of the stars is somewhat obstructed by other houses and some light pollution.  i recall the air feeling a bit crispy but warmer than usual that time of year. i feel it may have been just above freezing.  the sky was relatively clear and stars easily seen. \r\n\r\ni was looking at the sky to judge cloud cover and look at the stars.   when looking north i noticed movement to my right, in my peripheral.   i looked towards the nw  and saw a faint object moving in a straight line approximately 35¬∞ above horizon,  more or less parallel to the horizon.  i focused on the object about 40¬∞ to the right of north  and visual contact was only made for approximately  30¬∞ of the sky. i lost sight of the object before it was in the east.  it was very faint and, i believe, i lost visual contact with it because of light pollution and houses blocking my view. \r\n\r\nthe object itself had a slight whitish/ grey glow. it was a dull slight glow with no bright intensity whatsoever. lengthwise, it was about half the width of my fingernail held out at arms length. it was shaped like a grain of rice on its side. what i remember most is the speed at which it travelled with no typical \"shooting star\" characteristics. visual contact was 1-1.5 seconds.  i thought it may have been a meteorite  or a piece of space junk. i did notice it moved as rapidly as meteorites i've seen in the past, but with no intense glow, tail or other similarities. \r\n\r\ni delayed in reporting because i felt that, if it was a legitimate sighting, it was not significant. however, i eventually did report it because who is to say that any testimonial to this phenomena is not
