always tried to convince myself that what i witnessed was not unique.\r\n\r\ni was a greyhoung bus driver back then. this happened about 1993-1995. i was on a latenight run between phoenix and las vegas. as i recall i had left kingman and was travelling across the desert on a 2-lane highway that is very remote, thin, and a very windy roadway.\r\n\r\nmy wife was on this trip with me and she was aleep in the seat behind me. it was about 4am. i thought that all the passengers behind me were asleep. on these nighttime runs they usually are.\r\n\r\nas i came up over a rise in the highway and began coming down the other side, i noticed up ahead and on the right side of the road 3 amber lights in a triangular shape. 2 lower and 1 about 15 feet above centered between the other two, like a pyramid (larger at the base).\r\n\r\nthe object(s) were hovering approx. 15' above the right side of the road. as i approached with the bus, i knew that the sight and configuration was unusual, but i kept approaching, trying to convince myself that i was seeing the rear end of a helicopter (that is the only way i could explain what i was seeing)\r\n\r\nas we were about 30' from the object, it suddenly shot across the road in front of us and flew over next to a mountain, on the left. the object(s) accellerated from 0 to hundreds (perhaps thousands) of mph in a fraction of a second. i estimate the mountain that it shot over to to be 15 miles away and yet the object traversed the distance in (as i recall) a matter of 1 or 2 seconds.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything accellerate like this object did. \r\n\r\nas i said previously, i was trying to believe i was seeing a helicopter. the triangular lights did not turn, as a helicopter would, when they shot over next to the mountain. then the lights just hovered over there!\r\n\r\ni heard a voice from the front right seat. a passenger was awake and witnessed the same sight that i just had. he said. \"what do you think we just saw?\r\n\r\nall i could say was, \"i don't know!\" neither of us mentioned our sighting again. i never thought to get his name. as i say, i never expected to see a ufo, i spent the susequent hours trying to convince myself it was conventional! although it could not have been.\r\n\r\ni find it very strange to this day that i did not wake my wife up. i will always chastise myself for not stopping that bus and waking my passengers to experience the ufo. i chastise myself for not talking further with the passenger that saw the ufo with me. i should have at least got his name.\r\n\r\neven stranger, we just kept on driving. the object(s) were still in sight, hovering next to that mountain until we drove out of sight.\r\n\r\ni like to think that if i ever have a similar experience that i will investigate further. \r\n\r\nsubsequent to this trip, about a year and a half later, i was pulling the same duty from phoenix to las vegas. same roads, i knew them well. when i arrived in las vegas and reported to dispatch, they asked why i was so late. somehow the trip had taken a 1 1/2 hours longer than usual. i can't explain it. and furthermore, i remember not being too concerned about it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

anything. the four lights/orbs remained in place circling above the houses near the end of my street ��� where i had stopped. a few cars entered our subdivision and left it during the approx. 15 minutes i sat watching the lights, but the lights never varied or went away.\r\n \r\ni had to go to cvs to get medication for my husband and decided that i couldn���t wait any longer. started the car, went to the stop light and crossed to go south on rt. 19. the lights crossed ahead of me and were now on the right side of the road. due to lots of streetlights and business lights on rt. 19 i was unable to see where the lights were and thought they might have disappeared. then i saw them again flying along side me at about the same height. when i arrived at cvs about 1 mile from home, the four orbs now were circling over the rear of cvs. \r\n\r\ni went inside, made my purchase and returned to my car ��� the orbs were still there circling. i was tempted to call someone from cvs out to see the lights, but wanted to keep it to myself because it was so fascinating.  i felt that i had been chosen for this experience and didn't want to share it. i returned home and could not see the lights on the return drive until i got to our subdivision again. again the lights were on the right side of the street (where they originally were when i went out). when i pulled in my driveway i called my husband outside. all i did was point to the sky and ask him what he saw. he saw lights spinning and there were four. \r\n\r\nby now it was about 8:55 pm/20:55 and i wanted to find out if i could get any closer to the lights so walked toward my neighbors��� houses where the lights were. they revolved in a clockwise messy circle (not obviously attached to anything and not a particularly round circle) and retained a constant speed. i could not determine the exact color, but they weren���t bright enough to be white so i thought perhaps bright blue or green. as i watched them and the clouds started to clear, i noticed that as a light/orb passed through clear sky, it virtually disappeared and reappeared once behind cloud cover. there was no light on the ground (no flashlight effect) from them. the color may have been blue since disappeared when passing through dark blue evening sky.\r\n \r\nas i moved forward down our street toward the lights, they moved forward as well and appeared to keep a distance of two house lots between me and them. the clouds were breaking up and the lights disappeared more frequently with clear sky. i went inside at about 9:05 to check on my husband and when i came back out at 9:15, the sky was clear and there was no sign of the lights.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In 1965 i attended berwick academy, located in berwick, maine. \r\non the evening of the ���event���, i had sat in on a seminar held at the academy about ���betty & barney hill!' yes, the 'hills' re: the 'heavily documented close encounter of a third kind' 'hills!' i would like to say that it was the 'hills' who were the guest speakers but...Alas, i can no longer recall. for many years, my recollection was that it was the 'hills' who spoke of their encounter...However, i am no longer sure. it might have been some other guest speaking on the subject. \r\nanyway, on with my story. just prior to the seminar being wrapped-up, myself & two (2) other students escaped the building in order to avoid the crowd. as a matter of note, i still recall the 1st & last name of one of my buddies and the 1st name of the other. as we walked down the faintly lit berwick street looking up at the stars, we were expressing our 'wonder' in reference to the 'hills' outrageous experience, as well as how cool it would be for there to really be other intelligent beings 'out there' & how neat it would be to see somethi...And then we saw it!!!  \r\noff to the south, at perhaps a 45degree angle we saw a reddish-orange oval/football shaped light about the (apparent) size of the lincoln memorial (as immortalized on the u.S. penny) when held at arms length. this was not an earthly device! \r\nnow understand...My father was a very high-ranking usaf officer and i had been around aircraft for most of my (albeit) young life. i knew 'air vehicles' fairly well and this one spotted, was only familiar considering the seminar that my friends and i had just attended! \r\ni thought that i knew what it was...But it just seemed too much of a bizarre coincidence. the object seemed to hold its position as we approached our dorm-house. i sent one friend into our dorm to get his camera & convinced the other to call a local air force base (pease?). i was extremely excited as one might imagine and did not avert my gaze from this object for even a micro-second while my friends were gone. the object \r\nappeared to be still holding it's position as my friend with his camera bounded out of our dorm. just before he turned around, i witnessed this object exhibit a few 'minute' dynamics and then it just zipped, blurred, vanished from my sight. my buddy was devastated. a moment later, my friend who said he was going to call an air force base came back out & said that whomever he had spoken to told him that as far as he knew, there was nothing unusual out there...He too was of course, devastated!\r\nso, what could i do? my father was very strict & a hardcore usaf officer & patriot. he & i didn't seem to communicate very well. what is one to do? tell everyone and risk trouble from 'dad' and/or risk razzing from one's peers, subordinates & superiors? gaining a rep for being a bit 'off?' well, dad took care of a lot of that...He pulled me out of school prior to my graduation from the 9th grade and within a couple months, the entire family moved to europe. hummmm... long story short: i mentioned this event fairly seldom over the ensuing years because, what are ya gonna do? who's going to really listen? life goes on. i had things to do over in europe at the ages 0f 15-22, yes? well, 20yrs after the 'event' (almost an exact 20 yr anniversary date of my sighting), a know-it-all friend of mine casually mentions that there had been a mass-ufo sighting in the exeter new hampshire area back in 1965 or '66 and that it was documented. he then informed me that exeter new hampshire is about 30 miles from berwick maine. oh my god! i can't describe what my brain began doing at that moment.  there is a bit more to this account but time does not permit!

they were very far apart. and then they vanished.  obviously, my first thought was that they must be airplanes. but, they had no red lights. they were both simply white, star-like dots. and, of course, airplanes don't stop in mid-air and then start flying again. i've been a stargazer for most of my life, and know the difference between shooting stars, airplanes, helicopters, etc., at night.

delivering pizzas in the evening at the time, and i went along with him at times.  we were making a pizza delivery to a farm house (at the time), west of the palmetto expwy (826), and north of 103 street.  approaching the house via a dirt road, heading west, we noticed a big bright light just hovering silently to our right apparenlty over a field.  my father stopped the car and i put my head out of my passenger side window to look at it.  there was no noise or anything.  after a few seconds, it quietly took off almost straight up, faster than anything earthly possible, and it left a trail of colored light behind it, which lasted for a few seconds before it dissapeared.  my father and i were in awe of what we had seen and when we got to the farm house, the people that lived there were outside talking about the same sighting and we talked about our common experience in disbelief.\r\n\r\ni have never mentioned this to anyone but close friends and family, and since that day, there is no doubt in my mind that there is something out there with technology far more advanced that ours.\r\n\r\ni have always wondered if there is anyone out there with a similar experience; mainly the trail of light the object left behind after it shot up into the sky, which i remember like it was yesterday.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":26249,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":25.8664263,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10312010-0015","longitude":-80.2728357,"occurred":360226800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1288571891000,"summary":"Big

and they left all the bricks in the field on pallets. i was walking across the bricks to where my friends were. as you walked you had to look down because there were spaces about a foot wide between each pallet. i was having a hard time see when suddenly i could see individual bricks. then the bricks were lit up clear as day. i looked up as fast as i could to see a round blue light wizz over my head about a thousand feet up. some of the people in the tent even came out because the light was so bright. i just heard about mufon and figured i report this anyway. theres about ten of us that saw this light and a thought someone else may have seen it and this would add to additional reports. if i ever see anything else, i will certainly report it immediatly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

stream, and they move in and out slow or very fast.\r\nsometimes they use the very same path. the last pic i posted was near the same point this one was. there is only one in this photo, but there are many in this area.\r\nsomeone needs to be checking them out. there may be a surprising turn of events in getting the attention of someone who knows about ufo,s.\r\nlooking at the picture you will see a white dot, and when you magnify it it will be blurred, but it is not a cloud, nor a bird. with the naked eye it is in the shape of a pill, it is white, and looks like a craft of some kind. the
