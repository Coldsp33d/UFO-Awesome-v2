still on display but it was only on display for one day either friday or saturday.The display time and location was in the long beach paper. it was gone so we went to shoreline village. we were looking for a parking space and was near the end of the parking lot when a bright object caught my eye at about 4000 ft. my angle of sight put it above the queen mary for reference.The sun was at a position between the object and the goodyear blimp which was at about 800 ft. elevation, the blimp was over the city moving down the beach which was crowded with people and the object was 3 to 4 miles away both were moving the same direction down the beach.When i noticed there were no wings or engines or tail section everything seemed like slow motion i looked at my stepdad and he was busy trying to grab the parking spot and the car in back of us was trying to crowd us past the parking spot so they could park.Anyway it was probably about 500 ft long about 45 ft. high and had no windows and both ends looked the same, sloped and rounded and the whole vessel had rounded edges rather than  sharp 90 degree edges.At what could be called the cockpit section there were seams the whole length spaced evenly like it could be lengthened or shortened.When the car stopped i jumped out  and carefully focused my digital camera and when i pushed the shutter nothing happened. icouldn't believe my luck. the night before i took the full card out got distracted and put the damn full card back in, when i was intent on taking pictures of it a cloud of mist formed like a square wall that you could still see the blue sky through it that was big enough for the craft to slowly fly into but not out of.By the time i had deleted 2 pictures the end of the craft disappeared into the mist.This has really shook me up. no one believes me and if they can do what they did what chance would we have if they meant harm instead of sightseeing. that was my impression after awhile, the speed they were going was slow enough.I can't get this damn thing out of my head and i wish now it didn't happen to me.Do you guys respond to these reports?Hope you guys believe what i have said here i am not able to make this thing up.I can draw it but don't know how to put it into the computer to send to you. sorry for my lack of computer skills.

white light came on in the sky to the north west.  \r\n\r\nat first, i thought it was a landing light of an aircraft...Heading to the nearest small airport, but the object was too far out from the airport to have its lights on. so i thought it was a helicopter...There was no sound.\r\n\r\nthe object was moving slowly from the west to the east and i would guess about 1500 ft in altitude.  there was no sound, what so ever.  as the object passed i could see 9 red flashing lights on the underbelly of the craft...In a trianglar outline. along the sides were three alternating bluish lights. \r\n\r\ni live in a rural area, on the ridge of a mountain. it was a very clear night. no clouds. no city lights. i was facing the north which is cleared...So a clear view.  there are trees to the

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"   i have kept this inside of me for 44 years, and i think it's time that i disclose a ufo event, which took place in 1965.\r\n   my brother (who i will refer to as colorado) and i witnessed aliens abducting two young girls, who lived in the trailer next door. we never told a soul about this encounter, and now that he has passed. i am the only person left to recount the events of that fateful night, which changed our lives forever.\r\n   we were living near bossier city louisiana, as our father was deep underground in the air force missile silos, and he worked for days\r\nat a time, in these bunkers. he had just come home on a three day leave, and we were so happy to be able to spend time with him.\r\ncolorado and i played rough with our dad all day and we were bushed, come bed time. i slept in the upper bunk, and my brother in the lower.\r\n   suddenly, around 3:00 or 4:00 am we were both awakened by a low thundering sound, and the most brilliantly colored light display,\r\njust outside our window, at the foot of our bunk bed. i moved to the window and looked down to see colorado looking out as well. we both watched\r\na flying saucer land in the field, close to our neighbor's trailer. our family was very close to these neighbors, and the two young girls living there, were best friends to my brother and myself. i can't recall their names. but, they were approximately seven and ten years old.\r\n  we debated about waking our parents. but were so frightened, and thought if we wake them, and they start turning on outside lights, or walk outside with any weapons. there would be bloodshed, and sheer panic in the trailer park. so, we sat very quietly and simply observed.\r\n   this flying saucer was about 50 feet in diameter, and had multi colored lights around the perimeter. everything beneath the craft was distorted\r\nand wavy, as it was gently settling down in the dirt field. there were four metal legs that slid down from the craft, with round pads on each. all of the lights on the craft went out, within about 30 seconds, after it landed. but, a light blue glow started to envelope the craft, and it made the area around it glow as well. then, a ramp slid down from the craft, and a door opened up, and we could partially see inside the ship. there were dull red and orange lights on the walls, and an electrical crackling sound, emanating from the interior. then the interior lights went out, and the weird sound stopped. suddenly, a figure started to walk down the ramp, and was followed by another.\r\n   now, i think i should mention. colorado and i were never allowed to watch any science fiction shows or movies, with aliens or spaceships. i had never even seen a drawing or picture of a saucer, before this. we were allowed to watch cartoons like scooby doo, and bugs bunny. along with shows like the wonderful world of disney and mutual of omaha's wild kingdom. so, this was truly an adventurous night for us, and definitely something very new.\r\n   the first two beings walking down the ramp, made their way into the light of our neighbors yard. there was a light on the back of their trailer and their porch. when they got closer to the brighter light, on their porch. we could see that they were dressed in the same color of suits. but the weird thing was, that their skin appeared to be the same color as well. they looked human in shape and size. but moved in a way, that made them function more like robots. every movement was very smooth and effortless...As though they were moving about in water. they now remind me of the \"blue man group\", from vegas. because, they were completely blue all over. then, another two beings exited the craft, and they were green. another two, that were red. until there were six of them in all. they walked in line, up to the door of the trailer. they all passed right through the door, without opening it!...And that scared the heck out of us. more so, than the landing of the craft. we were asking each other... \"did you see that? what are they going to do with our friends?\"\r\n   minutes later, they passed through the door again, and they were leading the two girls, all the way back to their ship. the girls appeared as though they were sleep walking, and even had their eyes closed. but walked just fine, without any help from these strange beings. now, if you are wondering....Yes, the girls passed right through the door, without it being opened too.\r\n   only about five minutes later, they exited the ship and lead the girls back into the trailer. but, when the beings passed through the door, for the last time...As they were coming out. they all crouched down slightly, turned and looked directly at our window. each one did this in succession, and they smiled....And waved at us! now at this point, my brother and myself were in complete shock, and we could have let a dozen flies in our mouths, as our jaws dropped and we were also completely mesmerized!  i looked at colorado and he looked at me. but, we were unable to say a word.\r\n   they entered the ship, and as the last one went inside, the interior lights came back on. the strange noise started up again, and the door closed. the ramp slid back up inside the craft, and as it slowly lifted off the ground, the four legs retracted up as well. the amazingly colorful lights came back on, around the perimeter of the ship, and it slowly lifted skyward. until it was about 25 feet in the air. then, it shot straight up and out of sight in less than a second.\r\n   the last being standing at the door of the ship, waved at colorado and i, before it closed. i thought i should point that out as well. because, that is the lasting image burned into my memory, every since that strange night. my brother and i talked about that night, possibly thousands of times, before he passed away in 2009. but, we never discussed it with any one else....Ever!\r\n   we tried so hard to see if their was anything different about our neighbor's daughters, after that night. but, we didn't notice anything unusual.\r\n   the louisiana ufo event troubles me to this day. more so, than any other event. i have often wondered, if colorado and i were the actual abductees, and the memory of the girls abduction was planted. but, in any case......... two or possibly even four people were contacted/abducted that night. of that i am sure! i need to find answers to this event some how. even if it means going to a qualified hypnotist, experienced in the abduction phenomena. i have to know exactly what happened in 1965!\r\n   possibly on a hundred different occasions, i considered filing an official report of this incident, with some organization like mufon. i wonder if those two young girls are now going through abduction therapy, as adults. so many unanswered questions, and i think about that night, every single day of my life. i need to get this monkey off of my back, somehow...And this helps to finally tell the world about that strange night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

for me with an urgent tone to his voice. i responded and asked him what he wanted and he stated that there were three orange 'things' in the sky. i immediately ran into the living room and saw that he was scared and crying; my girlfriend and her son were also in the room and were shaken by what they were watching from the living room window.  i instructed my son to go to my bedroom and get my binoculars as i went outside, at first viewing the objects with the naked eye, and then through the binoculars.  what i observed was three circular orange objects traveling single file in a northeastern direction at a speed faster than a commercial aircraft, while making no noise, until they disappeared from view.  there were no flashing red and green wing lights that could be seen to identify it as an aircraft.  my first inclination was to suspect these objects as ufo's. this event was witnessed by all five people in the home that evening: my son, my girlfriend, her son and daughter, and myself during a time span of about five minutes.  (my son related to me that when he first saw the objects they were in a triangular formation and from what i could discern from his description of the event they were moving in a westerly direction and then made a \"right-angled\" turn split into a single-file formation and proceeded in the northeasterly direction that i had observed.) \r\n\r\nafter the event i immediately contacted the local police department through the 911 communication center.  the police responded in a timely manner and took a statement and said that they would check into it.  a while later (about 20 minutes) the police did call back and said that they had contacted the wilkes-barre/scranton international airport and were told that nothing unusual occurred.  i pursued my suspicions that what we witnessed was a ufo event got on my computer and googled \"ufo sightings in pa\".  there was one link that just jumped right out at me, it read: \"new ufo video recorded near keen lake in waymart, pennsylvania 11-oct-2010\".  we live right next to keen lake in waymart, pa and the video is exactly what we all witnessed the evening of oct.30, 2010.  there is nothing that can convince any of us differently on what we saw that evening...This was a indeed a ufo sighting.    \r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet -

thumbnail. it was too far for me to see if there was a shape to it, all i saw was a bright ball of white light and it was hovering over the treeline. it could not have been any kind of aircraft we have now, it was too bright to be so far away and it was not a star because it didn't look like a star, it was just small white ball from where i was standing. then it turned blue and then white again, then it dissappeared- just like that. i felt confused at first when i saw it, like i couldn't believe what i was seeing. then i realized this was a real ufo, it could not be anything else but that. a couple of minutes later, i heard helicopters again, so i rush to the screen door and i see three helicopters moving towards the direction of the previous ufo. the bright ball of light, ufo, is there again and the helicopters are moving towards it. and i'm pretty sure that there was also a plane near the ufo, it was quickly flashing red, blue, and white and moved like a plane in one

moving towards each other, then stopped and dissappeared. the was the last time i saw them last night.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

it to until now. a little personal background.  i was in the airborne infantry and am familiar with many military aircraft. i worked six years in law enforcement and have had training in objective observation.  i had previously seen strange lights in the sky from a long way off but the distance made any conclusive identification impossible.  interesting but not enough to persuade me they were not of this world.\r\n \r\non march 24th 2007 i saw something in the sky, close up with a lot of visual reference, which i can not explain.  i was returning home around 3:30am after a long night of poker in ashland oregon.  i was heading north bound on hwy 99. as the road heads out of ashland it slopes down for about a mile to the valley floor.   there is a stop light at the end of the slope.  when i was about half way down the hill i noticed a single very bright green light (about ��� mile away). the light seemed to be over jackson hot springs a little past and to the left of the road and traffic light. although it was further away, the light looked much brighter than the closer green traffic light.  at first, i thought that a cell tower had been built that i had never noticed before but the green light did not look like any i had seen on towers.\r\n\r\n as i reached the bottom of the hill i could see three more bright green lights in a straight horizontal line (about a ��� mile away).  the lights were definitely stationary about 90 feet off the ground.  a short distance later i saw a row of four more green above the first.  the way the lights appeared to me, leads me to believe that i was looking at a long cylindrical object. first seeing it head on, as i got closer i had a side view.\r\n  \r\nthe lights were directly over jackson hot springs, a natural geothermal spring, less than a hundred yards from the road.  i slowed down to 20mph and put down my window.  the craft was hovering less than hundred yards away from me at about 90feet above the ground. my window was open but i could not hear any noise coming from it.  if it were a helicopters at that distance, the roader noise would be very loud and the down wash would have made all the trees in the area violently sway.  \r\n\r\nthe green lights were circular and about 2.5 feet in diameter.  the light they produced was vivid green but did not illuminate any of the surrounding craft. despite being so near, i could not see any outline of the structure containing the lights.  it was very dark but i could see the trees in front of the lights and make out the darker hills jutting steeply up 200 yards away.   the green lights were spaced out about 15 feet apart with the second row about 10 feet directly over the first.\r\n\r\nas i passed the ���rear end��� of the craft i could see a very bright pure white oblong light.  the white light was about 8 feet long and 5 feet high. this light also did not illuminate any of the craft or the area around it. although i could not see any of the craft, the way the white light presented lead me to believe that it was a flat ���end��� of a cylindrical craft.  the ���end��� of the craft was about 15 feet behind the last green light.   the distance between the first green light to the white light was about 75 feet.\r\n\r\nthe lights became obscured behind a row of trees on the side of the road.  i turned the car around so i could get a good view of the lights again. the lights were out of my view for about 10 seconds.  when i could see the craft again it was headed over the hills about a mile and a half away.  at that point, i could only see the end white light. it was moving at a high rate of speed and following the contours of the hill.\r\n \r\n i had a very good look at some sort of craft and it definitely did not seem to me manmade.  i can���t explain it. is this a discription you have heard of before?","distance":"101-500

light poles, so i could see the night stars fairly brightly. as i drove north on my street, something caught my eye in front of me. i could tell it was an dark object moving towards me, but at first i couldn't make out a shape. as it came closer, moving very slow around 15mph, i could make out a trianglular shape. this thing was very large. i stopped my car at the stopsign and opened my door and got out and looked up as it passed overhead. it was very silent, but it did have a very light \"purring\" sound. i watched it flow over head and was just in awe. i knew immediatly what i was seeing and just couldn't take my eyes off it as it continued down my street and over a small city pond and off in the distance. my husband was with me, but unfortunatly, doesn't remember anything (him and his buddies pulled a good beer buzz and he was passed out in the passenger seat). i did try to wake him up when it was overhead, but he was loudly suggesting me to get in the car and take him home. i think that if he were not with me, and i was by myself that night, i would have turned around and followed that thing. what was really odd is that this object ,when overhead, blocked out all the stars and was not conspicuous at all. if not looking up at the time, i would have never even knew it was there. i think i was just at the right place at the right time that night. i have always believed in ufo's since i was a little girl and continue to have a great interest in the truth. i've told my stories a couple to time to different people when the subject comes up, but i don't really think they believe me. i don't talk about this incident anymore. my husband didn't remember anything the next morning and still doesn't to this day. i don't know if he believes me either, but i know what i saw that night. it was, without a doubt, not from our doing here in this world. i would also like to note that cannon air force base is home here in clovis, new mexico and i've seen many weird looking

walks around my college campus before the weather got cold, so i decided to take a quick stroll around campus.  unfortunately, i was alone and have no witnesses that can back up my story.  i left my apartment around 11:00pm, and eventually arrived near the school library at approximately 11:25pm.  there, i decided to take a break and relax on one of the benches while enjoying the cool night air and looking at the stars.\r\n\r\ni was facing north-northeast while sitting on the bench.  despite being near the city, there were some stars visible.  there were no clouds that night, and the temperature was perhaps in the high 50s (fahrenheit).\r\n\r\ni had been sitting on the bench for only a minute when movement in the sky at about my 9 o'clock position caught my attention.  the time was shortly before 11:30pm.  i looked up and to my left, expecting to see a flock of birds.  what i saw was three small white objects in a triangular formation heading due north, the point of the triangle leading.  birds and bats roost at the top of the library, and it was quite common to see them flying around the library area at night.  originally this is what i thought i was seeing, but there were two problems with that.  first, i noticed that the white objects were round orbs instead of bird-shaped or bat-shaped, and these things did not seem to be flapping any wings.  second, never once did these things break their triangular formation or change direction the way birds in flight would.\r\n\r\nthat was when i realized that i was not looking at birds or bats illuminated by the glow from the library, but dim white lights.  at the same moment, i realized that there was a mass behind the lights that was slightly darker than the rest of the sky.  i was not looking at three separate objects, but three lights positioned at the tips of a larger triangular object.  the lights were slightly fainter than most of the stars that night, and did not pulse or change color.  the craft was approximately the size of an airliner, and i believe it was flying around 5,000 feet.  i cannot guess the speed of the craft, but it was moving fast enough to be out of sight in a few seconds; so, much faster than any airplane or helicopter.  as i watched, i was puzzled by what i was observing.  it definitely was not a flock of birds or bats, there were no aeronautical lights that would indicate it to be a normal aircraft, there was absolutely no sound, and the lights were moving much too fast for them to be satellites passing overhead.  that was when i realized that i was observing a literal unidentified flying object.  a few seconds later, the craft and its lights disappeared into the night and the glow of the city.  at no point did the craft alter its speed or heading, make any sound, or change its appearance in any way.  the entire encounter must have lasted a mere five seconds.\r\n\r\nas i watched the craft move, i was struck by four things:  \r\n1)  i had absolutely no reasonable explanation for what i was witnessing.  i have seen countless helicopters and airplanes fly over the campus at night in the years that i have been attending school, so i know exactly what airplanes, helicopters, satellites, shooting stars, and birds or bats look like at night.  this object was obviously not any of those things.\r\n2)  i was struck by how vividly i was witnessing something that defied explanation.  yes, the lights and the triangular craft were dim, but there is no doubt in your mind when you see the dim moon during the day either.  similarly, i was completely sure of what i was seeing, and that it was real.  there was no question in my interpretation, which was the next thing that struck me.\r\n3)  the only explanation i had for this clear evidence was a ufo.\r\n4)  the final thing that surprised me was when i started thinking back on what i had just seen.  despite the speed, large size, and close proximity of the object, it was perfectly silent and drew almost no attention to itself.  had i not been looking in the right place at the right time, i would have missed it completely without even knowing there was anything around to miss.  this thing was amazingly inconspicuous.\r\n\r\ni don���t know what this object was, but i know what it wasn���t.  it definitely was not any sort of helicopter or airplane like i���ve ever seen, bird or bat, balloon, natural phenomenon, or trick of the eye.  simply put, i have no reasonable idea what this thing was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

south. first thing i noticed was that there were 2 lights in the sky. i noticed this very quickly because i like to look at the sky at all times to see whats up there. on this freeway you can pretty much see all the way to mexico. it was dusk but still a blue sky. first thing i thought was that it was a planet, but there were no stars out yet so you couldn't really see a planet that brightly. second thing i thought was its a plane or helicopter, but they weren't moving. so i kept driving home while looking at these lights. about ten minutes later i stop on a road on the way home because i need to take a picture. while i'm stopping i noticed that a plane was flying by the lights. at this time the sun was setting over the mountain so it was sort of dark but they were still there. as i looked down to get my camera and to take the picture they were gone. the plane continued on and the stars began to be visible but the bright lights weren't there anymore. if they were planets they would still be visible. planes and helicopters strobe lights would be able to be seen. i work at the airport so i see these all the time even when they are at 30k feet. \r\n\r\nthe thing that makes me wonder is maybe they were still there but we cant see them in the dark. maybe the sun reflects off of them, but in the dark they are invisible. \r\n\r\ntoday the 30th i asked around at work and my friend told me his wife saw the lights. she told him that she saw 3 of them and that they were there for about 15 minutes and they were diamond shaped. \r\n\r\nthe picture i attached is just an example. keep in mind the time of day is not the same and it is from google maps. it just to show the positioning in the sky. \r\n\r\ni also saw the lights that were skydivers a couple weeks ago. i knew they were skydivers as they left the plane. you could see them from where i was perfectly and the plane was around them on both jumps. \r\n\r\ni also saw another ufo type object on the 13th at 3am on the way to work. nothing major just a light in the sky that took off into space. was not a meteor, or comet, or shooting star. it took off at light speed. just fyi so you know that i am looking up all the time.

Unknown","city":"Glendale","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Let me first say regarding the time of this event, i had not been drinking and was most definitely not drunk, high, or anything of the sort. i had taken a break from writing a paper for my mba class and had just returned from watching a movie. it was just before 1am local time, 12:57am to be exact, and i went outside to have a smoke and star gaze since it was a nice, clear night. even with the light pollution from phoenix you can still see quite a bit out in the nw valley around the arrowhead mall area. facing s/se i saw a flash. at the exact same time i saw a shooting star so at first i dismissed it. still looking in that general direction but not the exact same part of the sky i caught it again out of the corner of my eye. for a few minutes i watched as the light would blink on then go dark. i counted the interval to myself and then confirmed it with the stopwatch on my cell phone. the light would consistently blink on, go dark, then blink back on again every 10 seconds. i was fascinated because it also appeared not to be moving. at this time of night orion had just risen over our neighbor's roof in the se section of the sky. i first observed the light slightly farther to the south and about halfway between the star rigel of orion and the constellation taurus relative to the horizon. after watching it for a few more minutes i ran inside to grab my binoculars. i looked at the clock and it was now 1:07am so i'd been watching it slowly move and blink on and off for roughly 10 minutes at this point. when i came back outside, in what had to be less than a minute, i had a hard time locating it because during that time it moved a much larger distance than what i had been witnessing. it moved some relatively large distances a few times while i continued watching it but nothing like when i went inside. looking at it through the binoculars you could see no shape and the light always appeared white/bluish-white, however, with the naked eye occasionally the light seemed to be an amber or orange-ish color.\r\n\r\nat this point it has moved almost into orion. the light didn't appear to get higher or lower in the horizon, it always seemed to maintain the same angle in the horizon relative to the neighbor's roof line. i attribute this to the earth's rotation, the stars were moving separately from the light and the light appeared to be traversing the sky in a straight line. i make this assumption because when i first saw the light it was higher in the horizon than orion and when it disappeared a half hour later it was below orion. so it actually passed through orion above the belt stars and ended up just north of e below the star betelgeuse, the orange colored star in orion's shoulder, on a path to intersect the moon's trajectory when i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\ndue to its odd on/off pattern and the lack of red and green marking lights along with its slow movement i am certain that this was not an airplane. also, i've seen plenty of satellites and it seemed to move far too slow to be that as well. when you add the fact that you could see no shape through the binoculars it must either be small, black, or very far away. the thing is i don't think it was far away, whether that be orbiting or deeper in space, based on its straight line movement. i think it was actually in our atmosphere just very high up there. the small distance it moved during the half hour i observed it seemed odd to me too...It did seem to me that it was in the atmosphere which would mean it should be subjected to gravity and fall for how slow it moved, it only covered about a 45 degree sweep of the sky during the entire 33 minutes that i observed it!\r\n\r\ni'm not sure if it actually vanished or if i lost sight of it due to light pollution or its proximity to the moon. right before i lost sight of it i texted my brother who is camping up near prescott and far from big city light pollution to find out if he could see it up there as well but never heard back from him. i'm at a complete loss. i have no idea what that light could have been??? this is the 2nd strange thing i've seen in the sky out here in the desert in the last month and a half. if anybody else saw it or has any idea what it might have been i would like to know for sure!","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:33:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
