\r\nmissed this one unless they launched this thing, or they are seriously blind or just plain lying period,\r\n  i seriously don't think they launched , as the \r\ncraft was longer and appeared wider than the airport itself much much much larger i personally have worked \r\nwith the military over the years including the skunk facility in seattle washington they claim \r\nis only a simple aircraft building facilty, wrong. stealth\r\nhidden in plain view as they put it.\r\ni never saw or even seen drawing like what we saw that night at boeing.\r\n skunk facility yes, i snooped around and saw the future to come well the concepts and a few \r\nblue prints labeled classified/mantess it appeared to be a high tech version of our current f-18 \r\nbut way beyond cooler looking!!!  there were several prints all different just laying around or on \r\ndrawing tables.\r\n we were maintenance contractors hired after the last big quake in seattle around 2006?  well boeing considered\r\n there facility high priority to repair asap so did the state??? why unknown\r\n\r\nanyway's you wont believe the size of the black craft that flew over the valley that night \r\nbetween 7pm and 9pm << this time frame is not exact as i was not paying attention to the time as \r\nwe just left the movie house and were on our way home.\r\n\r\n the first thing i thought of was the arizona lights which i for the longest\r\n time simply thought was a hoax. ?\r\nthis craft was not that same craft, i decided this after spending \r\nthe last 4 months on google reading every report on the arizona lights i could find\r\n the arizona craft was smaller than what we witnessed in my own opinion.\r\n one other fact i saw this thing so  well i \r\nnoticed there were no lights at all on the bottom or sides of the craft we drove north and \r\nit crossed our path heading south by south east then when it finally passed up it suddenly \r\nturned due east and then north east. this craft was a giant black and grey rectangle or square\r\n with a rounding side-walls with what appeared to be square top\r\nit looked kinda like a oil refineries cooling towers or fan exhaust ports ive never seen such \r\na design in a craft of any-kind this craft looked as if it was military in design if you asked \r\nme a guy who been around military bases my whole life it would definatly bring a new meaning to the word stealth.\r\n the problem claiming manmade is it's size no way any \r\nairport in cali could launch a craft of such size???\r\n unless it came from a hidden base ??? i cant explain this at all.\r\nall i know is this thing is\r\n real i saw it and watched it for what i call a real reality check in life and situation time unexplained.\r\n we are defiantly not alone.\r\n me and my girl watch it for over ten to fifteen minutes fly over us less than 400-ft off the \r\nground and not making any sound at all.\r\n the way i interpet what we saw to folk around here is it \r\nwas like a train going buy you know the one that never seems to end holding you up for 10 -15\r\n minutes, well this train seemed to be clippen along pretty good then took two big left turns.\r\n\r\n guys i saw in the windows on the front of this craft! its what got my attention in the first place not the craft itself.\r\n a green light coming right at us when i realized what i was looking at was a giant windshield with a green \r\nlight emitting from it \r\n yes it was that big.\r\nwe drove north for over ten minutes at a speed around 40 mph through town the whole time this \r\ncraft was flying over us at a slower speed my guess 20 mph.\r\n\r\ntheres more.\r\n\r\nif this story gets your attention approx 6 months later i saw something in the north skies that still blows my mind more so \r\nthan what i just told you. \r\n\r\nplease understand i would have never in my lifetime told you folks any of this if this was a one time thing but twice in ones \r\nlifetime whats the odds?\r\n\r\neven seeing one sighting i lean towards telling folks there nuts not anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nsource: *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg) no im not nutz well not yet.\r\nsorry folks no picture even if i had a good camera it was simply to black to even get a good picture sorry i would love to meet a real artist to draw this thing to scale as i got a real good look many details.","distance":"101-500

looked at 1st like headlights on a car, but when they got closer they split and went into different directions. these white balls moved around and then was gone. they reappeared a few min later in a different area again for a few secons, then was gone.\r\n we sat and watched for a few minutes and was getting ready to go back inside when we noticed a high fog coming in. not low over the water but higher up that our hotel. all a sudden an object seem to move out of this fog that was hugh. i believe it was triangle shape because i could see what i thought was the front of the object and lights that ran down the right side. i couldn't see the left side. the lights on the side we could see was white and glowed. the lights was going from bright to dim making it look like the lights was running from front to back(right to left. we watched this for about 3 to 5 minutes and it went dark. i went inside to get my cell phone to get a picture but it never lite up again. the fog slowly went back over the water.\r\n i looked down at the beach below and seen a couple standing there. they didn't move and finally sat down on the beach. i left my room and went down to the beach and talked to the young couple that was in there mid twenties. i asked if they had seen anything and they seemed to be very confussed and said they were not sure what they had seen but described pretty much what i had

because he wanted to junk it and make some money. i said sure. we went down a trail through the woods that led to the place were he had seen a couple of large copper radiators that he wanted to try to junk for money. we got to the place. we got on each side of one of the radiators and carried it a ways back the way we had came. my friend said \"lets drop this one here for now and go get the other one\". i said ok. we then put the radiator in the ditch on the side of the road.(this was at about five o clock in the afternoon in the summer) while i was in the ditch something in the bushes caught my attention. it was a rod lying on the ground. it was about eight to ten inches long and had glowing green triangles in vertical lines from top to bottom. i remember thinking to myself...Wow thats really neat looking and i reached down to pick it up. the next thing i remember is comming to my senses. me and my freind were walking down the road away from were we had been in the ditch.(the sky was starting to get dark which struck me as strange because it had been light just a few momments ago) i looked over at him and i was about to ask him if he saw something in the bushes when a bright blue flash happened. when we turned around we saw something shoot up off the ground in a red trail. we saw this very clearly. when it reached the top of the trees it changed into a green fireball and shot down across the woods at treetop level. we then turned and ran all the way to my house. we told my mother what we saw. she did not beleve us. later on when i asked my friend what he had seen in the bushes he said he had seen a rod object with glowing red triangles on it. i have no idea what we saw or what happened to us that day. i have often thought about undergoing hypnosis to find out what happened during my missing

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i was awakened from sleep a little after 3 a.M. on the morning of october 18,  2009, by something which i can't explain.  my twelve year old dog was sleeping on the bed next to me, when i was awakened by my two five month old puppies barking like crazy. the puppies, because they were so young, were crated overnight in the tiled entryway of the house. my room is at the opposite end of the hallway. as i awoke to their barking, i opened my eyes and noticed my room was very light. there are heavy, double layered light filtering shades at the bay window across my room. the light was so bright it was lighting the room as it came in through the cracks between the shades and the window frame. it also showed through the layers of material. the only time which could provide any kind of comparable light overnight would be a full moon, and this light was much brighter, and the moon wasn't full that evening.\r\n  as  i awoke and my brain began to quickly notice something was very different, my mind immediately began to race. as i lay there thinking, \"what is that?\", \"why is it so bright?\"' \"why is there no sound?\"' i was also thinking, \"don't move, don't make a sound, don't get up and look\", even though i wanted very much to know what it was outside my bedroom window.  as i lay and watched it, the constant bright light changed into a pulsing red light. the two lights didn't show simultaneously. there was one very bright, sustained white light which changed into a red light that seemed to pulse in and out at a 1-2 second rate. i'm noting that because i thought it could possibly be a helicopter, but as far as i know, the red and white lights on a helo run simultaneously.  \r\n  so i waited it out silently, without moving, and  quite honestly, feeling terrified. as the red pulsing light converted back to the bright white light, it brightened for a much briefer time, then faded with only a whoosh. the whoosh was the only sound i'd heard during the entire experience. it definitely was not the typical sound associated with a helicopter flying out. \r\n  there are some other reasons this experience seemed odd. my room is on the second floor of the house. outside, below the window, there's a swimming pool. on one end, there's a large oak tree.  about 50-60 feet away, there are some large magnolia trees. behind the pool is a tall line of cypress trees. anyone trying to come in with a chopper and searchlight would have to fly over the cypress trees, and dip between the oak and the magnolia trees to be positioned in the spot where the light was shining from. based on the angle it was hitting the windows,  it seemed level with the second floor or slightly above, but still well below the tops of the trees. that would be some fancy flying for the wee hours of the morning in a residential area.  after the light dimmed, the dogs stopped barking, but the light on the back deck remained on for a few more minutes. it's on a motion sensor, and we do have a cat, so i'm not prepared to make any connections to the other lights. \r\n  the last time i remember checking the time was 5:30 a.M., since i couldn't get back to sleep before then. the next day, after thinking about the lights a little more, i told one family member. i still can't explain it based on the information i've seen. i've tried over the last year to rationally explain it, but i can't. the experience has stayed with me, and is still as real as it was that evening. that's why i'm reporting it now. perhaps the folks with mufon can shed some light on the matter.\r\n \r\n  after the light dimmed and i heard the whoosh, i couldn't go back to sleep again for a couple of hours. the last time i remember checking the clock was 5:30 a.M.
