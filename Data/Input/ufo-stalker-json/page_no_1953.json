westerly direction. i then noticed another small craft approaching in a easterly direction, another in northeaserly direction and another from the south. at firt i concluded that perhaps they were all aircraft headed toward different destinations, but it wouldn't seem likely or make since that they would all end up in the same approximate area at the same time, but they did. i then noticed a couple of minutes later, a large bright globular glowing craft heading in a easterly direction. i stood there for a minute and then became concerned.\r\n\r\n as the large circular craft  came closer in my direction, i began to shine a flashlight that i was carring with me in it's direction. it then traveled about 500 hundred feet or more and then turned it's lights completely off. i'm not sure but i don't think that aircrafts do that. i then began  to scan the skies for the globular object but could no longer see it, but the other crafts were still in the area.  they however all went in different directions after the globular craft could no longer be seen. i hate to admit it but it frightened me so that i then went into my home and called local authorities.\r\n \r\n the police dept dispatcher stated that they did not handle those type of calls, but gave me a number to the f.A.A.  i then called the f.A.A. and the person on the phone stated that they didn't handle these type of calls either, but would refer me to another dept which was located in washington state, so they transfered me to another person who asked me for my name and telephone number. i gave them the information they asked for and then began to give a description of the details of the events that had transpried.\r\n \r\nafter giving them the information they then stated that they would look into it and someone would get back with me  i have been frightened before, but not like this. not to the point where i felt that i had to call the police dept, f.A.A and who ever else to get them involved in this. i'm tired of hearing the word fake. these things are not fake. they are real and if it is their objective to destroy us, they will easily succeed because no one will even believe that they exist. i have submitted several pictures in the past, only to have someone say that they were investigating it. but nothing has come of it. there needs to be a place where people can call, give descriptions and real investigations can be launched. i am not implying that mufon does not do real investigations, i'm just stating that from what i have seen. i can say that it's beginning to get real serious now. and until someone with some real power to do something believes these creatures are real. we may all be powerless to stop what ever objective they have.\r\n\r\n i realize that so far from my experiences they have only invaded our airspace. but i don't know why i believe it, but i for some reason believe that they have been in my home, inserted something into my body while i slept although i have no way to prove this. paranoid perhaps but if you've seen what i seen, maybe you would be

the southeastern light turned red and both lights disappeared.  my guess on the amount of time that elapsed was perhaps 20 seconds.  i thought holy mackerel, i might have just seen two ufo's.  it was so moving that i called my boyfriend on my cell phone because i felt i needed to report the sighting to someone.  i then came in the house to  my computer and did a google search to check if anyone else had seen what i had seen.  so here i am, a bit bewildered but also excited to have had the experience.  take good care, all.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

attention. i parked and got out of my truck and began watching it. i have never seen a helicopter so high in the sky just staying stationary. it was much higher then the normal police, news or traffic helicopter. it appeared to be positioned there for a reason. it looked like a military helicopter by the shape and the dark color. i watched it for about five minutes and it did not budge. then i saw them.........Directly in front of the helicopter a white oval globe or star like object appeared slowly and faded away, then another behind that one as the first one faded out.Almost in a sequence moving forward one after the other appeared and faded out moving away from the helicopter. there was four total. they appeared one at a time never shining at the same moment. the sky was clear blue and  they were bright white like a star. the objects moved west in a line away from the helicopter that remained still facing west. they moved behind some trees and my house where i could know longer see them. that lasted about three minutes. i continued to watch and my girlfriend came out to see what i was looking at. she then made the statment that it was weird to see that helicopter hovering like it was so high up. i told her what i saw and we watched together for about 15 more minutes and the helicopter never left that spot. we went in a i turned on the news to see if there was some breaking news on that side of town that might call for a helicopter to be needed. nothing happened in our area, or at least it wasn't reported.\r\n\r\ni regret not getting out my camera, but the objects caught me off guard because i was focussed on the helicopter.It almost seemed like it was ordered to stay stationary and to observe the objects. the whole thing just seems really weird and out

proximity to me which has made me a believer in ufo's ever since.  i don't believe that either of these craft could have been anything that we could have \"reverse engineered\", though i do believe that we do now have some \"home grown ufo's\" here in the u.S. which would make it hard to discern between \"theirs\" and \"ours\".\r\n\r\ni have continually \"watched the skies\" for the past 35 years and have had (to my regret) no other encounters since those two when i was a young boy, but that's all changed in the past week as i have had three separate sightings in less than a week.  \r\n\r\ni've read that ufo sightings have had a sharp increase this year. i wasn't going to report the 2nd sighting...Feeling that people would think i was some kind of crackpot who was making it up after just having reported one a few days prior (two in one week).  then, i had the third sighting and decided that i was obligated to report them all--regardless if anyone believes me or not. we're never going to get any kind of disclosure from our government if we don't speak up and tell what we've been seeing!\r\n\r\n i believe we are about to have some type of earth changing \"event\" which will lead up to \"something big\" in 2012 in regard to our own evolutionary/spriritual changes as well as a new age of truth (though full disclosure may come in stages) in regard to aliens/ufo's and our \"real\" history as a species. i think the increase in ufo activity is just the beginning.\r\n\r\nhere are brief details of the sightings i have had this past week (i won't go into detail about the one's 35 years ago, though they were quite incredible):\r\n\r\n1- 10-21/22-10?(can't recall exact day, i reported it that evening on mufon site right after i saw it late in the evening) - extremely bright star like object- silver white light. hovered silently in the sky and quickly dimmed over the last 5 seconds that i saw it. the whole thing only lasted about 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n2-10-24-10-late evening (10:30-11:30pm, est). 6-8 bright quickly flashing/stobing red and white lights on bottom of a craft that flew directly over me at an altitude of maybe 1000-2000 feet. no sound. could tell by stobing lights that the craft was either triangular or circular from the way the lights lit up the under side of it. kept it in sight for several minutes as it approached me, flew directly over and past me and then out of sight.\r\n\r\n3-10-27-10- 10:25pm (est)- this was the best one of the week!  four extremely bright white lights on the side facing me (i believe the lights went all the way around the circumference)on what i believe was an oval/saucer shaped craft, no more than 100 yards away. the lights were so bright it was hard to make out the exact details of the craft. it was approximately 50' in diameter, and it \"floated\" slilently about 100 ft. off the ground, through the tree(s) (gaining altitude slowly as it moved from (my) left to right as if it had just taken off from being on the ground). then past the tree(s) into a clearing where i saw it without any obstruction at all (though with the leaves falling off the trees this time of year i was able to see it pretty well even when it was \"behind\" them). it continued to gain altitude and speed until the roofs of the houses obstructed its view, but i observed it for at least 100-150 yards.\r\n\r\nthe evening after the 3rd sighting i was reading about the increase of ufo activity and came across this photo that a couple had taken of a ufo in ga just two nights prior (10-25-10) to my sighting which looks exactly like the craft that i last saw. i'm going to have to start taking my phone/camera with me when i go outside to smoke!\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

about 300-1000 feet above me giving off only a slight humming sound.  what surprised me the most is that a vibration was given off to me with a great sense of peace and comfort and that i didn't need to look any further.  i then went inside and waited about 20-25 minutes and went back outside on my patio and the disc was still there.  it was harder to see the outline but the absence of stars in

north 5 miles south of grand forks north dakota my friend was driving and we saw a light over a farm house it was 20 -30 below zero out side> were the only people on the road>i said zed look at that weird light and he said its an antenna and we started argueing about it than after watching it for 10 -15 minutes and me and zed a re now yelling at eachother im telling him it aint no antenna even tho we could see like a antenna gerting comming down >just than it did a turned in mid air and started comming torward us i yelled stop stop and as it got closer i yelled go go than stop stop we jumped out on the interstate and the craft went over us no more than 1000-3000 feet above us it was huge for sure it was a flying wing comming from the west at 4 in the morning this is very strange cuz we have no flying wing planes in gfafb we watched as it went over real low than we realized why he was their a huge huge craft was hovering to the east above our van it was trangle and had windows in the front like a hotel windows the next thing was real strange and we talk about it alot for years> we did the lost time thing you hear about we lost 2-3 hours and found ourselves standing on the highway at 30 below zero with no coates we didnt realize that we lost time till later  > the strangest thing to me was their was lights from trafic but the cars never came past us on the interstate this is the biggest thing that got me it;s like they were their but not comming  understand? now meny things have happened to us since this like albinos following us ya don;t laugh its real> ever see

time i was living in owl's head me. which is in knox county. my house was on the dublin road on the airport side. i was looking up at the object facing towards lucha beach and the ocean. i first noticed the object as it came over the tree line. the red lights on each point immediately caught my attention. when i first noticed the motion of the object i immediately ruled out any human craft. unless it was a top secret government craft ( i highly doubted it) i had no other explination other than a ufo. i heard no noise coming from it as it flew. the fact that it flipped and rotated as it went, i couldn't think of any propulsion system that we have that would allow for that motion. i recall it was a moonless night and there was very little light pollution. a great evening for viewing stars. the object was moving from east to west roughly in that direction. i would say it was about 60 to 70 degrees from the horizon. the object had one red light on each point. there were either 5 red lights (if it was 3 sided) or 6 red lights (if it was four sided). the object was very black. i could distinguish between the object and the background as the craft was darker than the night sky. as it moved across the sky the object would rotate and then flip, and then rotate again. it did this in a regular pattern as it moved across the sky. it wasn't moving particularly fast. it moved straight across the sky, flipping and rotating as it went. i really could not estimate its size or altitude. i can only say that i got the impression that it wasn't particularly big. if i had to guess i would say between a bus and a house, but with no references and not knowing its altitude i really would only be guessing. the only facts i am sure of is the red lights at each point and its flight pattern. i could see its motion clearly thanks to the red lights. i could clearly make out its flip and rotation motion as it moved across the night sky. i lost sight of the craft as it moved over the tree line to the west. i was amazed by what i was seeing. i knew i was seeing something not of this world and i felt like i had won the lottery. my whole life i had wondered. i'm a science buff and i love thinking about those unanswered questions. it is one thing to hear others talk about their ufo experiences and another to have one yourself. before this event i always thought that it was possible that some of the ufo sightings were real. but, you are never certain until  you see it for yourself. i am 99.9 percent convinced that what i saw was an alien satellite sent to investigate our planet. given the way it moved across the sky i cannot conceive of any alien life being on board. i got the feeling that what i was seeing was an unmanned craft sent to earth to gather data. much like the satellites we send out to explore the planets in our own solar system.

at the shore line looking northwest up the coast when there appeared a bright red-ish/orange fireball/light coming from the interior of the island. i don't remember if we were already standing down at the shore when the light appeared or whether our noticing the light drew us to the spot. \r\n\r\nthe light moved in a slight incline, maybe at 20 to 25 degrees. almost immediately after it appeared, there came another one right behind it. then two more followed (these two were very close together). another few seconds and another one, and then another. there may have been more but i honestly don't recall. \r\n\r\ni'm guessing that in total we saw between 6 and 8 of these lights over the course of only a few minutes. they didn't make a sound, although i'm estimating that they were probably a mile away from us. they moved in an almost straight line (slightly inclined as i stated above) out over the ocean (approx. one mile out) before disappearing behind/within the cloud cover. \r\n\r\ntheir light was consistent. it did not pulse or flash at all. these were definitely not airplanes, flares, or chinese lanterns. they looked and behaved like nothing i've seen before or since. \r\n\r\ni was not frightened at all. i'm not sure how my friend felt though, but i think it's reasonable to assume that he wasn't either. the odd thing was that we never mentioned it to our other two camping companions (they were fast asleep) and he and i never spoke about the incident, then or since. \r\n\r\nin fact, i paid the incident little mind until i listened to an open minds radio show hosted by alejandro rojas (aired october 25, 2010) in which his guest, keith chester, discussed his book about ufo sightings during ww2. keith mentioned how there was a definite difference between objects sighted over europe than those seen in the pacific region. it turns out the ones sighted in the pacific theater were mostly 'fireballs.' this prompted my reporting. \r\n\r\ni simply chalked the incident up as hawaiian folklore. i later read about the hawaiian 'fireballs' that seem very common out there and simply assumed that that's what i saw.
