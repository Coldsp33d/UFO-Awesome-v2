(he had been looking in the mailbox with a flashlight and missed the entire thing. it had to have flown right over his head). it pulsed a few times then started moving away again, a few seconds later it moved up and to the right and became stationary. my daughter saw it flash red three times while it was moving up and to the right. i did not see this. \r\n\r\nsadly, my husband has poor vision from cataract surgery, wears bifocals, and never saw anything. please note that my daughter has perfect vision, and that i wear glasses for astigmatism with a crizal antiscratch coating, which i was wearing at the time of the sighting. \r\n\r\nthe object was close to the horizon and we have ambient light issues from the neighboring town to the northeast, so it appeared to fade in and out of existence. we believe that at some point it actually disappeared and we started seeing dubhe, as the big dipper was just starting to rise. this entire incident took place in a very short time, approximately 5-10 minutes, but felt like a lifetime.\r\n\r\nmy husband pulled the car down to the bottom of the drive while my daughter and i walked home. it's about 180 feet from the top of the drive to where we park our car. my husband and daughter went up to the house, i stayed outside for a while to see if anything else appeared, then also went to the house. \r\n\r\nafter pulling myself together i decided to write this report. a few notes...\r\n\r\nthis was not a plane. we are on the pit-ord flightpath so we see a lot of air traffic. we also see some new york and cle traffic to the north. there are 2 small airfields within 10 miles of the house. we are also frequently buzzed by transports from the youngstown air reserve station in vienna. the ravenna army ammunition plant is about 30 miles north west of us.\r\nthere was actually quite a bit of normal air traffic during the sighting. \r\n\r\nthis was not a meteor, we watch the perseids every year. this object moved with control and intent. it did have the radiance, but not the tail, of an earth grazer, which i have seen.\r\n\r\nthis was a solid triangular shaped light, not 3 lights in a triangular formation.\r\n\r\na few cars passed us while this was happening. it was early in the evening. please, if you saw this thing, file a report. \r\n\r\nthank you for your time.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":26150,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9439477,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10272010-0022","longitude":-80.791469,"occurred":1288234800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1288248863000,"summary":"I looked up in the night sky and saw a bright, solid pure white light in the shape of a triangle.

higher than the rootops not high like airplanes, it made no noise whatsoever at all and the dogs were going crazy. it was dark, so i couldn't see it all completely all i could see were the three triangles on the back but i think it was like a long flat rectangle shape, kind of like back lights on a car, but they had little bulbs on the triangle part with red and white alternating lights..Then i could see these two circular things on the bottom, probably like jet engines or something...Anyway it went slowly over the house, i ran back in to get my phone to take a pic but by then it was out of focus. i stood there wondering if i really saw what i had just seen, i am not sure what the heck it was but i have never ever seen anything like that before. why were the dogs going nuts? we have a lot of \"scramblers\" that go over this area, it's a known drug part of town within blocks of me. i will be watching the tv and it will scramble when the helicopters go over, but this was not a helicopter, it made no sound whatsoever. when i first noticed it, i was sure it wasn't anything i had ever seen before, i called my neighbor to come out, but he was late getting there, he said i could tell on your face u saw something...Just the look on it. i don't know what i thought it was. i have no idea. just weird. it just went straight over my house in a straight line, very slow toward the

few clouds that i could see. i did not loose site of these objects, i just took the dog back in and got ready for work. surely ft. campbell ( ky) or the nashville airport would have picked this up on radar i thought. i don't believe i have ever seen this sort of thing in my entire

that looked down on a small valley. our cabin had several sky lights in the loft bedroom. it was a beautiful warm dark,clear night around 10:00 pm. we opened the  window in the loft bedroom and was settling in for the night. i was lying in bed looking thru the skylights while my wife got ready for bed. suddenly there was a flash of bright light with no sound. as i watched thru the skylight, a large, dark triangle object floated over the cabin with lights underneath the object.They were not landing lights of a plane. they appeared to be recessed lights and still no sound. i asked my wife if she saw the light.She stated that she saw a flash, but, was unsure what it was. she ran down the stairs and onto the deck at the rear of our cabin. she did not see anything unusual at that time. our neighbors in another cabin up the ridge had a dog.  we noticed that the dog was barking. then, all got quiet. we felt no fear at this time-just curious. we saw nothing on the area local news that weekend. however, upon returning home, my nephew ( who lives in central ohio) called to say that several strange lights were reported in southeastern ohio that night. we were watching ufo sightings on the t.V.  several months later and i saw the same triangle. i am unsure what to make of this encounter. however, i know what i saw that warm march night. as of this time, i have not viewed any thing

would bobble and roll as it flew,i thought it was a party balloon floating in the sky from the park down the street ,but realized it wasn't.I grabbed my video camera and i filmed the craft flying over behind my apt in my apt complex-it was 3:30pm oct 20th-2009-i was w/my friend josh.F-who eye witnessed this w/me.-the craft was flying slow,(light pole level).It would speed up then slow down-stand in place for a few seconds then keep flying.The craft flew over the gallup sports complex center where there was 3 little league baseball games going on at the time.The stadium was full of other people.The day was totally clear and sunny-the craft flew over route 602 then sped away at about 150 mph-going south /south east heading toward the gallup indian hospital(i.H.S).We made a video disk and gave the disk to ufo researcher *(name deleted--cms/sg)...(2weeks later) the craft came back during a lightning storm,flying roof top level,going back over our apt complex this time (heading west) toward i-40-going towards sander az,,the craft was perfectly round and grey-it flew between the light poles very low,,between (arnold circle and arnold by aztec st).It flew over the allsup's convenient store and kept going....I've been trying to get a copy of the disk from *(name deleted--cms/sg) since,,but haven't been able to.I did talk to him once and he said he would look for the disk i gave him.When he gives me a copy back..I will post it..I keep an eye and a camera ready at all times.Just in case it comes back.","distance":"21-100

was full and had just come up. it is a populated area so you could only see a handfull of stars and a planet much brighter that i think is venus. i noticed a bright star-like object overhead heading to the south. it was almost as bright as the brightest star it the sky (venus). it had no flashers and was a solid point of light remaining the same brightness until it seemed to fade to red and then vanished. i went inside to tell my girlfriend and her 2 kids. they came out to watch with me and the same type object came from the south headed northeast. same brightness and no flashing lights. it also faded to red and vanished.\r\n\r\ntwo nights later, 10-25-10, i went back out armed with my video camera. at about 7:30 pm i saw it again coming from the south heading to the northeast and it remained bright like venus until it vanished in or behind some high clouds. all three cases the object stayed on a straight path at about the same speed. in the video as i follow it with the zoomed in camera, it does pass some stars so you can get an idea of the speed. there was no sound for any of the sightings.

appeared on the left side in the led and seemed to be moving in a circular motion when all of a sudden this one object turned into many smaller ones that shot off into different directions. it may not have been moving in a circular motion but it was definitely moving enough for me to notice something. it may have appeared to be moving but it could have been the many smaller objects reflecting some type of light source instead. i did not see this until after i had snapped the pic..\r\nwe were driving through new mexico on i-40 eb when this happened. i was driving about 80 miles an hour and had my window down. i was looking north. i did look to see if the camera got any of it and it did get these smaller objects that seemed to just shoot out of the larger one. the smaller ones were gone in less than probably one second. it happened so fast. like i have tried to explain..I took a shot at the mesa in the background and in between the camera actually getting the shot and my waiting to see if the pic was in focus these things happened. i don't know how i even noticed them as fast as it happened. i feel like it wanted me to see it.\r\nmy camera is a fugi fine pix 1000.\r\nthe time and

on my trip because i wanted it to be correct for the pics taken.\r\nafter looking at the pic it seems like this event must have come up from behind the first or closest range and i was trying to focus on the range that appears in the background.\r\nafter seeing this i felt like i had just witnessed a ufo event and was so glad that it happened to me especially while driving through
