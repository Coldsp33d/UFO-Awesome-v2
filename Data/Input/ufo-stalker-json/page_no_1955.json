noticed a bright white light moving from the southwest going northeast. at first i thought it was a satellite, possibly the space station. we watched it move slowly across the sky at one point going directly over our heads and our house. as it went further east it never lost it's light. all the other satellites i've ever seen have gotten dimmer as they go away from the sun. this never got dimmer at all. it held it's intensity until it went behind the trees and disappeared. i would like to know if anyone can tell me that this was indeed the space station or some other satellite. i know it wasn't an aiplane because it had no binking or flashing lights at all. also there was no sound at all. we also saw two or three airplanes flying over during the sighting. they all had blinking lights and were obvious airplanes. this was solid white and looked like venus. when the light didn't fade i began to doubt that we were seeing a satellite. i am going to go out again tonight and see if i can see it again. i will have my camera this time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

been pointing out to him what i believed to be the crux constellation a few minutes  \r\nearlier so i was still looking in the sky to see if i could point out any more stars when i had noticed these two flashing lights in the sky coming towards us from the distance. the sky was fairly clear no real cloud cover to obstruct my view to much. the lights were traveling fast, silent, and in sync. if it weren't for the great distance in between them i would have believed that they were connected. these were their characteristics: they flew on a straight line meaning side by side and front and back, they flashed in sync, and they traveled at great speeds with no sound. i think it is important for me to note that when we saw them, we saw them coming an angle that would have been on their left side coming toward us. at no time did they rotate positions. as the objects were getting closer to us they had begun to turn toward the right. this next part is a bit hard to explain. when the objects were coming in our direction the were in a front to back kind of formation, where one was in the front and the other was following in a straight line in the back, but when they had begun to turn toward the right it was as if the one in the back swiveled around to the front or as if the one that was in the front had turned on an axis leaving them both side by side traveling away from me. a better way to describe this is if you were to imagine these two lights coming in to view traveling one behind the other from your right side as you stand forward, and then the whole line that they are traveling on turns 180 degrees leaving the two objects to be flying directly away and in front of you. these objects were high in the sky and traveled fast. when i first saw them i had thought they were planes but i almost instantly ruled that out because where i live planes travel through all the time and this object only had one white flashing light no red or green ones and made no sound considering the great amount of speed at which they were traveling. after initially seeing the objects felt a little bit skeptical on wether it was some sort of plane but soon became very excited when i saw and realized that the objects had very un-plane like flight patterns and characteristics. finally i would like to say that i am and was a ufo believer before this incident and that i don't and never will believe that ufos break the laws of physics or do anything that we as humans couldnt do. i believe that the answers lie in our equations and through study we may get to that point to. but mostly it just angers me that these ufos fly over our heads as if we can do nothing about it. it's belittling.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

of our house, when i noticed something moving over the treetops and pointed to my husband, we did not know what it was .  it appeared to be a black object with a tail below , and it was moving sideways slowly.  the tail did not look like typical fire, it was a glowing white substance and it would flow beneath it for a few moments and then disappear.  we watched the object, along with our children  as it sped up slightly and moved toward the east and then disappeared suddenly. we were able to take a few photos and tried to film it , but it did not show up on video.  we thought that it was over , so i went in the house to get my shoes as soon as i went in the house my son called that it was back and i ran back out , my husband said that in the few seconds that i went in the house , he was talking to the kids and then casually looked up in the air and the object was silently hovering directly over him and my stepson, it was so close that he and my son got a pretty detailed look at it and it was definitely a craft of some type, he was shocked and tried to get the camera to take a photo , but oddly the memory card was full( which has never happened) when i got outside it had already begun to move back toward the east and the tail started appearing again.  we watched again for a couple of minutes and it disappeared once again.\r\na few minutes later we noticed several aircraft (planes) circling our house in an unusual flight pattern, more planes started showing up, i was about to go into my house for a moment and my husband yelled and we all went back to the yard and looked up there was a large white,bright ball of light that was not flashing , just solid, it was moving very fast across the sky, there was a plane behind it trying to keep up and a plane coming from the other direction and then suddenly it grew dim and turned red , then disappeared.  the planes were left flying around as if looking for it. at this time there were about 10 planes in the sky.  we then saw two more \"chases\" each with a fast moving solid ball of light that disappeared. the planes started to all head south in the direction of the gulf of mexico. once in the house i had my husband and son draw what they saw hovering above them and i have included the drawings, which turned out very similar. \r\nthe strangest part to us is in a matter of seconds after we first watched it disappear, it reappeared over our backyard, like it knew we saw it or something, we live in a large neighborhood with lots of houses, and of course not a word on the news , it's as if we were the only ones that saw it, please report it if you saw this in our area.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

that we might be about to cross paths with a tornado (there wasnt much wind, looking back on the situation, but this was how severe it was), then out of no where the sky flashed a brilliant, almost neon- electric blue, with no trail of source. it happened maybe 3 times, and was terrifying to the core. the light, and color of it did not seem natural. a couple of us were asking out loud what that was.  anyway, survival mode kicked in, and we booked it. first instinct for all of us, was that it was that color could not have been produced by nature, but no one wanted to say anything. my friend described it as it being like \"someone was taking a picture of the whole world\" if the persons flash had a blue covering. what's weird is that in town, approx 10 minutes from where we witnessed the flashing, the storm had not raise remotely any alarm. now this was the same storm that terrified us to the point where we thought we were going to die. we were shaking a solid two hours after the

bright white object coming from north and heading south. i immediately thought \"how strange this object looked\".  it was a bright white yet transparent looking object. the front and back were rounded just like a long tube. there was a slight discoloration (slightly darker than the bright white/transparent color of the rest of the object) in the middle which gave it the appearance of a band around it. i listened for \"sound\" but heard none but i also know that you can't always hear a planes engine until they have passed over you somewhat. i learned this because i see a lot of commercial airliners. i knew immediately this object was different because i couldn't see any wings, tail, windows, or a jet stream. it also seemed to move with more ease like it was gliding. i can't explain why i felt that way except maybe because there was no sound. i remembered my camera was on the table so i ran in the house and grabbed it (coincidently it was sitting on my kitchen table because i had been loading my vacation pics into my laptop that morning!) when i got back out on the porch, less than 10 seconds, i noticed it had moved very fast and my nerves kicked in. i felt i needed to just start snapping photo's or else i was going to lose it. i snapped only 3 frames before it was out of sight. i only caught one good enough to show what i saw and i am pleased. i listened for the

weather moving in, and the sky was clear. i saw what i thought was a balloon at first glance, but realized was something much bigger at higher altitude. as it passed behind a mountain i realized how large it was and how fast it was moving. it was moving perpendicular to the prevailing winds in the area, from north to south. i saw it for 3-4 seconds before it passed behind the mountain. i was around 8000' elevation. the object would have been in the morning sun, so i can't be sure it was white. it may have been reflective. it was shaped sort of like an oval, but flatter on the bottom and more domed on top. there were no other details i could see, and it moved along a straight line to the south. \r\ni'm not sure if this is anything interesting or not, as a large balloon could move quite fast at that altitude. but the object appeared rigid and symmetrical. i've never seen a ufo, and don't really know if this was one. i'm also a licensed pilot, although not current. i was on family property, a place i've been frequenting almost every year for the past 40+. \r\nalso worth mention, the weather patterns up there last week were all over the place. we saw rain and hail, some snow, and systems were approaching from the east and west alternatively. i can only comment on the winds in the canyon, which can only go in those directions. winds aloft, i have no idea on that day. but my estimate of the object's altitude is around 15,000 - 20,000 feet based on the mountain it passed and the fact that i am very near it's base. the minimum altitude it could have been would be (in my opinion) 10,000-11,000 feet to clear the low parts of the surrounding terrain. even at that low altitude, the object would still have been approximately the size of a house or larger, possibly a large building. \r\nit appeared smooth on the outside and didn't \"light up\" or anything. in my opinion, the object had to be moving several hundred knots. it never wavered from its course in the brief 3-4 seconds i watched it.\r\ni mentioned it to two other people, who thought i was messing around. they are both california highway patrolmen who were also there, but did not see anything and

were falling there was an audible noise unlike other conventional general aviation aircraft. it was a deep loud rumble. the color of the flames was a golden and white mixture and was very brilliant.

into each there own oval shape. they then began to hold there elevation while traversing the sky, left to right, and then back from right to left, all the while still trailing a flame behind then as

flashes that are present when a photo is taken and at other times you can see an orange and red pinpoint of light from it. \r\nat times it appears that another light source will orbit or rotate the light . sometimes it appears that it has morphed into two lights very close together then quickly goes back to the  single sparkling light. \r\nit will power up very brightly at times and then diminish to a small light the next second. at times it will move quickly in a jerking fashion either up or down or appear to bounce around inside an imaginary box of sorts. its location appears within the same general area nightly for 3 weeks now . when an attempt was made to photograph it  new batteries would go dead and it would not appear  through the camera's view finder. \r\nnever seems to leave the  one particular area of the sky, near the airport and last friday on a very foggy night it was the only star that was actually viewable in the sky.  seems to be  a nightly sighting

caught my attention because of the size and speed. once the object passed the moon i realized it was actually two separate objects. the one in front was a large spherical amber colored orb. the second was two pulsating red orbs flying below the first at a 45 degree angle. they appeared to be no more than 30 feet apart. they appeared to be at an altitude less than 1000 feet. they were totally silent and slowly changed direction making an arching path passed my house. they then proceeded in a north west direction. once the objects were passed my location, the red orbs climbed evenly with the amber orb. they then kept this formation until out of sight.
