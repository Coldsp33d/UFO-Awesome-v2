head. object moving from west south west toward east north east. object moved about 10 miles and began to get smaller. and i do not mean smaller as in because it was getting farther away thus appeared smaller. i mean as in the light or object was actually getting smaller and smaller till a point at which its smallest it turns red and then vanished. did not vanish because it went out of sight it vanished because the light slowly faded down, turns red and then turns off. \r\n\r\ni woudl have thought it looked like a re entry except no tail nor any red color from heat. \r\n\r\nanother possibility my father brought up was perhaps a space station reflecting the sunlight as it got farther over earth, earth blocking the sunlight the light fades away. so it woudl be a good idea to research the path of orbit of the space station and see if it is consistant with this sighting. also was it over hawaii during this time and date. \r\n\r\nhowever i saw two sattlights moments after the object on an orbit from south to north and both of them clearly in orbit looked hundreds of times farther upward than this object. this object appeared to be right over head. as i said looked to me like it was between 3 and 6 thousand feet up no more. \r\n\r\nits possible it was a re entry of some kind. this would explain the light being so bright and then faiding away. though i want to make clear over the 10 mile path the light did not faid one single bit. it only began to faid after the end of the 10 miles. once it began to faid it was only seconds till it went red and then out completely. \r\n\r\nif this was a re entry i would wonder why an object woudl be re entering earth right over maui. \r\n\r\ni sure would like to see some research into the possibilities such as the

went out of our sight we came back inside and i checked the time, 7:20 pm. they did not change direction or speed, just kept going until we chould no longer see them. it was obvious they were not bolloons, esp. in the binochs. just weird. i am reporting this because i whould like to know if anyone else saw them too.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

your name and email.  i am a 58 year old man with good sense and eyesight. my cousin is 56 and has good eyesight and good sense also. please feel free to pass this email to anyone who could help me.\r\n\r\nthe event i am about to describe was witnessed by my cousin and myself and first noticed at 7:15 pm cdt on october 17th, 2009, a date and time of an occurrence that it seems i will never forget. to help me put closure on the event,  i have been encouraged by my cousin who also witnessed the event, and others to write this report over a year after it occurred. about 7:15 pm cdt on a clear evening,  just after sunset, we noticed a large bright close group of  lights to the wnw of my country home 10 miles south of hale center, texas . it appeared to be a very bright white-blue light cluster at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon.  although it was hard to distinguish individual lights, it appeared to be a cluster of 4 lights with a total brightness equal to total of 4-5 times the steady brightness of the planet venus if it were at its peak illumination period. the lights appeared very close together, almost one, with what seemed like  three very close bright lights on top, and one very near bright light on the bottom. it nearly seem to have an over all shape of a upside-down bright triangle, or what could have been an upside-down tetrahedron shape if the lines were connected between the very close lights. as i said, the lights appeared very close together from our view point and perspective and almost seemed to be one. the lights did not move, or have any  streaming vapor trails, so we quickly ruled out a jet airplane of any kind, military or jet airliner, besides it was much too bright. we have often seen jets, commercial and military, and are familiar with the point of a jet and its vapor trails.  the lights stayed at the same position and brightness for what seemed 10 minutes as we stared and commented how we had never personally seen anything in the sky like this every before in our 50+  years here on this earth. after  another minute or two, the lights seemed to dim a little, the bottom light seemed to dim very much.  then, below the three lights on top, in the position of the bottom fourth light, a small group of what appeared to be small light bluish-grey actively bubbling blob of clouds (like a raspberry shape or a round bunch of grapes) about what seemed to be the size of an english pea or shirt button at arms length.  to describe this further let me say it looked like a like a small bubbling light blue/grey-silver raspberry on which the individual seeds of the raspberry seemed to exploding randomly with flashes of light over and over again. the cloud cluster seemed to have the many bubbles exploding, also looking like boiling syrup. this bubbly mass appeared in seconds right out of the clear dark blue october sky in and below the place of the lower fourth bright blue light. the little bubbles, or raspberry seeds, in my analogy  seemed to be exploding in this cloudy mass, and it would take about a second for what would be each the seeds on a raspberry to flash, expand, bust, and start new little bubbles over and over again (like boiling). this went on for about 15 seconds or so, when the bottom  of this little cloud mass seemed to flatten out forming what looked like a bubbling half sphere of raspberry shape. the flat bottom immediately started making expanding concentric rings, like what forms when a drop of water hits a puddle. out of the bottom of the bubble mass, in the center of the expanding eccentric circles, appeared a dull red orb-like light.  it moved to a distance one diameter of  the size of the bubbling mass before stopping and hovering momentarily below the bubbling cloud mass and top 3 bright bluish white lights.   the bubble clouds had returned to their raspberry shape within seconds and was no longer flat on the bottom. then the dim red light moved down another diameter of the bubbling raspberry mass started moving erratically, zigzagging  in the small area below the mass.  after several seconds, the red light moved up again and disappeared behind the bubbling mass of clouds while flashing in sequence with the small explosions of individual bubbles, which still had its bright lights on top. the red light then re-appeared on top from behind the bubbling mass, and came out  above the top 3 white lights. at this moment there was a dimming of the bright lights and bubble cloud mass, and the red light hovered for a second or two above the white lights and bubbles.  then everything suddenly faded out within a second.  the bright top lights, the bubbling raspberry cloud mass , and the small dim red orb light, all gone, leaving only the darkened evening sky with its stars beginning to come out. there were no weather clouds in that visible area of the sky.  the time all this ended was about 7:25 -7:30 pm cdt.  all of this time, this event was in the same position, wnw, and at a 45 degree angle to the horizon, as viewed  from my house here in the country south of hale center.\r\n \r\nmy cousin and myself talked about our sighting as described above for the next week. we could not get the images out of our minds.  there was no mention of this event on the television, or newspapers about this to my knowledge.  we just could not believe we were the only ones who could have witness such an amazingly visible sight in the early evening sky. \r\n \r\nthat���s when found the mufon web sight. finally today i decided to call the mufon telephone number a little more than a year after all our sightings in texas panhandle and bordering eastern new mexico. we had searched the mufon data base and found out there were about 5-6 other people who had what must have been the same sighting, at the same time, in the same area geographically,  just from different observation points.  to see these same earlier reported mufon incidents, use only the search parameters of the event date and the state ( 10-17-2009 to 10-17-2009) and enter texas as the state. then search new mexico and event date 10-17-2009 to 10-17-2009). you can see one event observation was in clovis/portales area of new mexico, and one from hobbs, new mexico.  in the texas search, you will find another observation in amarillo, and perhaps my report will be on your sight soon.  note that the new mexico mdt times are an hour earlier than we are here in hale center, texas cdt.\r\nhobbs, new mexico  reported the incident to the ne (perhaps it could have been nne). in clovis/portales area it appeared to the east. amarillo reported it to the sw (perhaps it could have been ssw), and finally we reported it here 10 miles of  the hale center area at wnw at 45 degrees above the horizon. all of these sights point to the same area of texas.\r\n \r\nget your map out. using a little triangulations and interpolations of these sightings points of 4 other mufon reports of this incident, together with our on sighting of this same event, we can calculate using geometry, the height and distance from our observation point here 10 miles south of  hale center, texas.  we can calculate not only the distance and height about the horizon, but using trigonometry we can also get  a real good approximation of size of the this object with its bright lights and bubbling mass and even the red orb light. we can even approximate the red orb light size in addition to the top lights with its attached bubbling mass of clouds. these triangulating and interpolating all the sightings including my own in combination point to the same area on the texas map (approximately 10-15 miles ese of muleshoe, texas (for estimates use 12 miles) , texas and about  miles to the wnw of my house 10 miles south of hale center, tx).  by triangulating our sighting and the sightings of others allowed us to put the distance on the object about  miles from my house using the flat land distance to the point directly below the lights and blob. since it was at a 45 degree angle from my horizon, together with the observation triangulations and interpolations, the observed object was approximately 42-47 miles ( for estimates use 45 miles ) wnw  from my house or about 10-15 miles to the ese of muleshoe, tx). \r\n\r\n {by letting the right angle of a right triangle be directly  below the object  of about 12 miles ese if muleshoe, tx.   if the observation point at my house was at a 45 degree angle from the horizon,  it would mean that the leg of the triangle measuring altitude would also be about 42-47 miles (for estimates use 45 miles) above the earth the other leg that is about to my house.  geometrically, right triangles with a 45 degrees angles in them have equal sides, that would be altitude and the distance. i wish i was there to explain this in person, but make a triangle by connecting the points from my house here near hale center to 10-15 miles (for estimates use 12 miles) ese of  muleshoe texas as the first point. the second point of this right triangle is directly above the 12 miles ese of muleshoe. the third point of the right triangle is my house 10 miles south of  hale center, tx, and the second point is directly above first point (or above the map or earth) at the point on the ground 12 miles ese of muleshoe, texas. that describes the right triangle where i can show that the height of the object observed at 45 degrees above my horizon is the same length as the leg from my house 10 miles south of hale center to the estimated point 12 miles ese of muleshoe.}\r\n\r\nso, so far, in summary, i have proven the object was  wnw of me, and  miles high above 12 miles ese of muleshoe, texas. ( since my angle of observation was 45 degrees above my horizon). now using trigonometry we can roughly calculate the approximate diameter of the light cluster and blob, both of  which made about a 2-2.5 degree viewing angle ( remember it was about the size of a shirt button held at arms length, or about the size of a english pea at arms length) . in order for the object to be our observed size,  making a 2-2.5 degree arch, the size of the bright lights and light blue-grey-silvery raspberry-like bubbling clouds) and object by my rough trigonometry would be about 2-3 miles in diameter. that is bluish- bright white lights, and light blue grey silvery bubbling cloud mass an astonishing 2-3 miles in diameter.\r\nthe red light was small, and was not as bright as the blue-white lights. the  red orb-like light appeared a dull silvery red color. the red orb light did not radiate bright radians like the  bright blue-white lights points at the top of the bubble cloud.  using rough trigonometry the red orbs size would have to be in the neighborhood of approximately 1175-1465 feet across  by its corresponding size to the rest of the light and bubbles of 2-3 miles diameter. (if my trigonometric calculations are correct, i hope). \r\n\r\nto comment a bit further on the red orb light���s size, it did seem to be about the same size as the seeds (the individual bubbles of the mass below the sparkling bright white lights). it was about the same size as the bubbling exploding seeds on the raspberry shape.  each of the exploding raspberry seeds in the bubble clouds were about the same size as the red orb-like light that appeared below them.\r\n\r\ni am exhausted.  i must quit for a while. i would be glad to make drawings if somebody show me how to do it best. my geometry is good. the trigonometry i could use someone to recheck my figures on the size of the various shapes observed by us.  i also would like to say i am disturbed by this haunting observation, and feel like that my writing this will someday help me with some kind of closure for my mind. perhaps someone can help me through contacts using mufon.\r\n\r\nps. forgive my rambling and re-iterations.  also, you might observe i am not too good at proof reading.  i hope my descriptions make sense.  please forgive the sentence structure and grammar. please feel free to pass this email to anyone who could help me and direct replies through the dfw chapter of mufon attention state director, *(name and email address removed--cms/sg.  thanks","distance":"Over One

the night sky is real clear. i started to see this bright light light so bright you could not make out a shape.Not big probaly hovering. at the altitude of a helecopter. only it was flying in a

straght. watch it for a while then go dark. one morning in december around 5am it was to cold to smoke outside. i went to the back door proped the storm door open with my foot and held my cigarette out side. so that no smoke came into the house. while i was standing there looking through the glass it was dark. a ball of light with a dark ball in the center. started comeing down wright in front of me about 50 feet away. it coming down sort of fast steady and controlled. it was so bright almost blinding. but when it went down behind the pine trees. nothing around it would light up. i lost sight of it.I have deer cams set up in my back yard night vision and still pictures.That trip when a deer comes in contact.I have caught these balls of light on video and still pictures. they are all over my property. these things are starteing to scare me and make mad. i caught one on still photo  . this is oct 23 2010. the thing is on the ground not  lite up you can make out the ball with the

north-to-south (towards me. i'm unsure of it's altitude, as the only reference i had were the clouds, which it was below.) the sky was too dark to allow me to see an outline beyond the lights, but the lights moved in unison and gave me the impression they were 3 lights on one vessel, as opposed to 3 vessels in formation. it did seem to be traveling about half-again (150%) as fast as typical planes. after almost 2 minites, the object paused in mid-blink and, when it resumed blinking, was moving at the same speed east-to-west. i saw it for another 30 seconds (appox) then it stopped blinking. (remaining in the pattern.) it was still too dark to see any outline, and i'd figure a plane would'nt have turned thier lights off yet.)\r\n about a minute after i first noticed the object i was still assuming it was a plane, but i started to video it on my camera phone (just in case.) video is available, but i did not see anything on it.\r\n an airplane did fly in a somewhat similar path about 15 minutes after the sighting. that was a commercial airplane, still flashing it's lights (different color, pattern and sequence.) i could clearly see the fuselage outline by this time. it seemed to being flying higher than the object was, but still below the cloud cover.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":26060,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.57714,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232010-0012","longitude":-111.8576222,"occurred":1287756600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1287851717000,"summary":"Nocturnal lights, sudden direction change. odd flash pattern.","tags":["lights","flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Sandy, Utah","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:91231"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Ventura","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Husband and i just left joes crab shack ventura ca. we had the best crab feast ever (but no alcohol). we went down the hill (sanjon st)towards a dead end towards the beach. we stopped at the stop sign to turn left. over the ocean (just south of us) we both saw a large cigar shaped (gray in color) object hovering over the ocean and then it started moving towards the direction of land (semi fast). we tried to drive along the beach and track it down to take a picture, but by time we got to the beach area at seward, it was too far down to take a picture or see clearly. this thing seemed like a giant barge or something in the sky. it was huge! seemed too long and too flattend (cigar not round) to be a blimp or plane. no other aircraft was in the sky. i thought it was a cloud formation (it was cloudy) at first until we saw it moving, gliding smoothly, but a good speed twords land. this was a first for us.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i were sitting in our living room which has a lot of frontal and overhead glass.  it was dark outside, about 8:20 pm.  i was at my computer, which faces the windows.  my wife was watching tv which sits in front of the big bank of windows.  she said \"what is that?\", and i looked up to see the bright lights approaching from the south.  they were spherical balls of light with a steady non-blinking glow of very bright yellow to amber. they came at first in two sets of two, at what seemed  a normal altitude for average civilian aircraft in this airspace.  there is a small  airport, (skagit regional airport), nearby.  a military airbase, (naval air station whidbey island), is nearby.  we frequently see and hear aircraft.  military fa18,  and ea6b aircraft often, and sometimes heavy transports.  small and large commercial jet aircraft, and light civilian aircraft come and go over our home.  in addition we see helicopter life flight medical airlift activity between bellingham to the north and seattle to the south.  search helicopters work the bay and beaches several times a year as boaters, hunters, and commercial fishermen go missing.  these objects appeared different than any of the familiar aircraft. we quickly stepped outside onto our west facing deck as the appearance of the objects was strange.  they had no blinking navigation lights nor any form of visible landing or search lights.  i expected to hear engines, and at first actually thought perhaps they would turn out to be helicopters.  when we stepped out the door we both immediately realized there was no sound and there were none of the usual blinking lights seen on all other aircraft.   these bright glowing orbs, or round lights were in the neighborhood of four times as large to our perception as the brightest refinery light across the bay.  they moved steadily and smoothly with no erratic maneuvering, coming straight up from the south, and then one by one curving off to the west and nw, and then gradually diminishing in brightness, as we thought they were gradually obscured by the cloud cover.  the level of visibility decreased faster after the turn to the wnw. than the increase in brightness as they moved toward us from the south.  they might have also been climbing in altitude as they moved away.. it was calm outside with little or no breeze, no rain, a certain amount of reflected light in the sky from the refineries and the city of anacortes across the bay reflecting off a high cloud cover.  i said \"get the binoculars\", and then went to grab our digital camera. it seemed strange and unreal, i was excited, and fumbled as i tried to take a picture.  the exposure was too slow.  i gave the camera to my wife, as she had some experience taking movies.  i used the binoculars to view the second set of two objects directly in front and above to the west of us as the first two objects each turned out to the west and gradually vanished, seemingly into the high cloud cover.  my wife managed a fleeting capture of one or more of the glowing lights at the beginning and end of her filming attempt. very poor and short glimpses of light.  i could only see bright intense yellow and amber light through the binoculars. the third glowing light turned away to the northwest and  gradually vanished.  our neighbor close by  to the north came out on his deck in time to see the last of the objects .  he went to get a spotting scope, but the last of the glowing lights was gone when he returned.  it had turned away to the nw toward the georgia straight and also gradually vanished, seemingly into the cloud cover.  a few minutes after the sighting we heard and observed a commercial jet aircraft as it flew out to the nw. and then turned toward bellingham .  this craft did not disappear into the cloud cover.  making us think the objects we had seen could have been bigger and higher than we had at first thought the whole sighting lasted no more than a couple of minutes, if that.  we acknowledged to each other, and the neighbor that what we had seen could only be classified as ufo phenomena.  we decided that we should make some kind of report.  i had heard of mufon and looked up the sight on line, and this is my report.\r\n*(wit's name removed--cms/sg) 10:20
