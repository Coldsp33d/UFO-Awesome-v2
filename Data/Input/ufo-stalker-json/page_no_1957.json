we couldn't see an object because the flashing lights were so bright. i did make sure to look at the clock and it was 7:55pm. i did have a cell phone with a camera, but i was so startled that i didn't even thinking about taking a picture. my daughter did not have her camera with her. i would like to know if anyone else had witnessed this and maybe called this sighting in. my daughter & i would like to know what she & i were looking at. \r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n*(wit's name removed--cms/sg).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26051,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.742096,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232010-0003","longitude":-98.9456052,"occurred":1286333700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1287822071000,"summary":"I could only see flashing amber colored lights, in a horizontal line.","tags":["lights","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17,"locationName":"Early, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:92071"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":null,"country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"5 very faint star-like objects at daylight.  converging together.  turned their lights off and disappeared from sight.  movement - very slow but steady,  if not directly observed not ever seen.\r\n    ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":26050,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6666674,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232010-0002","longitude":-81.5108735,"occurred":1286062200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1287821040000,"summary":"5 star-like objects emerging together","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":20,"locationName":"Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:92072"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Angelo","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is response to the person in mo. who saw the large orange object.\r\ni saw the very same thing in san angelo texas on 10/10/10 sunday at 8:30pm. it was very bright orange and pulsating. it was about 900 ft above my  house. it went over my house and my neighbor's house behind my house. it did not make a sound at all. this was not a plane, helicopter, or balloon. it flew from the south heading north. this was the strangiest thing i have ever seen. i wonder what this was?","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":26049,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.4720223,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232010-0001","longitude":-100.4299275,"occurred":1286767800000,"potentialRelations":[25814],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1287817548000,"summary":"Large orange pulsating object","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":12,"locationName":"San Angelo, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:92073"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Alabaster","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My friend and i were sitting outside drinking hot chocolate, and we were looking at the stars. she noticed that there were colorful lights flashing in the sky. at first, i thought it was a plane, but then it just shot off really fast. then, we saw another one just staying in the same spot for a duration of about 30 minutes. it would occasionally just shot a couple of feet in different directions.It would flash colors of blue, green, pink, and red. i kept looking around and i noticed that six of them went all in the same direction within a five minute time period. a few minutes later, one caame really fast shotting right over us, then slowing down. i do belive that this sighting was a ufo.

and i was leaving. a bright red orb slowly hovered over the woods across the street. i turned and looked at her to see her in shock. we had both seen the same thing. my next encounter was on my way back to my girlfriends town house where i currently reside. i witnessed the same red object only this time it was following me. it disappeared after about ten minutes. when i first witnessed witnessed these object i thought that they were some form of heat lightning. since the night of october 14 i have been up late for work. i sit in a living room overlooking a vast range of the appalachian mountains. at first i started seeing a few lights at a time blinking irradicaly. i thought that they were planes until taking a better look. i had a feeling as if i was being watched and i ended up staying up the entire night. from that night on i have seen them every where in this county and i even contacted local authorities. they assumed that i was just seeing things and that they were most likely helicopters. the night of the 16 i was on my way home when i came up on a single police car and i saw a minor wreck. this is after i tried driving though the mountains to find one these crafts i saw from a distance. i stopped as the officer dealt with the civilians and then i saw a glimmer. there were two orbs 20 feet down from the officer moving in ways i have never seen before. i filmed it all with my camera and jumped back in my car overwhelmed with fear. within ten minutes the area was completely shutdown with law enforcement every where. for the next two nights i witnessed these crafts in the mountains and floating above. i have pictures of them moving in ways that defy physical laws of this earth. i decided to come forward with this information after last night...I had been filming them for the third time at a scenic view here west virginia. this night was different as i heard odd pulsating noises. i got scared for my life and left immediately. that night i woke up at 3 am and felt as if i was being watched. i saw these lights again from my window and took my camera out and began rolling film. the first thing that scared me to death was the moon had a red holographic image coming from the side that i have never witnessed before. i filmed this as well as the lights blinking and lighting up forming a triangle. one of the objects actually came down and sat hovering pulsating lights. i have no desire to make these events up and i am a man of my word. i have roughly 8 hours of film all together and about 200 pictures. i believe this event will change

the sky above was perfectly clear. since the sun had not yet risen, i took a moment to marvel at how beautiful the star filled sky was. after looking north to locate the big dipper, i turned to look at orion. while scanning upward, i saw two stars that appeared to move a bit. my first thought was, \"that can't be right.\" i watched the two stars more closely, and in fact, they were moving slowly across the sky in a southerly direction. first i tried to figure out why two aircraft would be flying a formation that open, and how they could maintain such a precise separation in a formation that loose. after i figured out that what i know about aircraft just didn't fit what i was watching, i thought that it might be possible that the lights two pointss on a single object. i selected a relatively brite star that the trajectory went near and attempted to move so that the lights would pass on either side of it, relative to my possition. unfortunately, i could not move far enough to get that angle, so i settled for picking a dimmer star that was directly in the path of the lights, and would have each pssing on either side. as i watched them move accross the star i picked, it was obscured btween them. the lights then passed out of sight beyond the tree line.\r\nit is difficult to say how high the object was, but it was far enough that moving a distance of about 80 to 100 feet made no significant change in the apparent angle relative to the stars. there may have been a third light, equidistant between the two and slightly forward of them, but the moment that i thought i saw it was so fleeting that i am hesitant to state with any certainty that there was really one there. from the point at which i noticed the lights until they went beyond the trees was two minutes or less. they travelled roughly 35 or 40 degrees of arc across the sky in that time.\r\nthe time of sighting above is plus or minus about two minutes. if any other reports are received for this time frame i would like to know.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the door with glass window when a golf ball looking light very bright pops up and is followed by 3 more in a perfect sequence; like the lights are being turned on one at a time. lights were coming forward as they came on in perfect sequence with the fourth one a little more forward than the other 3 that were evenly spaced. once they came on the lights did not move. then they all went off at the exact same time. i got up and went out the door telling my friend what i was seeing as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th lights were coming on. i told her what i was seeing was very strange. i stepped out on the deck of house as the 3rd and 4th lights came on. the moon was full with a planet in conjunction to the south of the moon almost above my head. there was no sounds, no breeze, and the night was cool. the lights were southeast and about 45 degrees off the horizon. the event lasted no more than 1 minute. my friend quickly noted the time for me as 9:40 pm eastern. after the lights went out there appeared to be a small plane with a red light moving from the southwest to the southeast which crossed over the area where the lights had gone out. the plane proceeded to the east and disappeared in the distance. the white lights were a lot larger than the red light on the plane as that red light was about the size of a ink pen tip and the white lights were as large as a pencil eraser if held at arms length. the lights were perfectly round like golf balls and the roundness was very pronounced.The lights did not have a star shine halo; instead they were perfectly round like a flash light turning on and then turning off.\r\ni continued to talk to my friend on the phone while walking on my deck and trying to see if anything else seemed unusual. sky was clear without clouds and very light outside due to the full moon. no other lights appeared and about 10 minutes later i went back inside still talking on the phone to my friend. hanging up the phone i then explained to my husband watching tv what i had witnessed. he had seen me get up saying to my friend about the lights and had watched as i went on the deck to observe them closer. he is handicapped and did not attempt to get up and get into his wheelchair but waited to have me tell him what i had seen.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":26021,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.5133273,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10222010-0001","longitude":-82.8425354,"occurred":1287722400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1287732301000,"summary":"Golf
