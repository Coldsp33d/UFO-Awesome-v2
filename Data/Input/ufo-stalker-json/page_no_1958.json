shih tzu.  i went into the south facing bedroom to start closing drapes for the evening and over the unoccupied farm next doow, hung a huge disc.  i was alarmed, but felt somewhat entranced even more.  it hung there with the colored lights around the center blinking.  the colors in these \"windows\" were primary colors.  i called friends who lived approx. 20 miles north, but who's house was up on a hill.  they could see it too over the tree tops.  it stayed for about 5 minutes then took off in a flash south towards the town.  it lowered straight down below the tree line.  i continued to watch and it cqme back to the farm next door and stayed for another 10 minutes or so, then headed slowly south until it was gone.  it did that for about 3 nights. one of those nights it went slowly over a semi-pro baseball stadium about 30 miles south while they were playing and was seen by those there.  it was reported to be a \"meteor\" by some \"authority\" in the paper the next day.  on the 3rd night of it's evening appearance, i had gone to bed around 10 p.M.  it was a queen sized bed and my little dog was on the right side near the foot.  all of a sudden i couldn't move.  i strained to break free and could not.  i vaguely saw some moving objects around me on three sides that looked like gargoyles to me.  i was terrified of the way they looked and kept trying to break loose.  one on the right put it's head lower towards me and then back again.  though scared almost to death, i felt nothing physical.  then they were gone, instantly.  i couldn't move my head but could cut my eyes over to my dog to see if she was aroused.  she was still sleeping undisturbed.  then they were gone and i broke free.  i was afraid i'd kick her and kept thinking about that, but i didn't.  i got up, grabbed her and went in the other room and sat up for the rest of the night.  something did happen, but i just can't figure out what.  i believe i was conscious throughout but couldn't swear to it. several days afterward, a black lincoln town car drove past the farm in the morning with about 6 men in black suits and black dress hats.  they all looked alike and were looking forward.  they came from the north going south on the dirt road that came out of the woods and turned into a hard surfaced road at the entrance to my farm.  they were so out of place in that location or even in town or in the nearby city, that they really stood out.  it's one of those things that's imprinted in your mind forever. that was years before i heard about \"the men in black\".\r\n\r\nin the early 60's i also had an experience were i couldn't account for a space of time that has always haunted me. i've had a number of sightings and experiences that might be of interest to you.  i've never told anyone for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nif a third party is going to contact me, please have them email me in advance so i know to answer the phone.  i don't want to confuse them with a solicitor.

strange features that i noticed in the picture upon closer observation. a very strange cloud formation that appears to have the shape of a perfect triangle with trails coming off of it. it also

i can describe it). my neighbor came outside to smoke a cigarette, and i asked her to look at what i was seeing because i thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me. she confirmed what i was seeing,

on my camcorder on my phone, but couldn't get it to show because it was too dark. my neighbors went in, and i sat on my front step watching it get closer and closer. then out of nowhere this very big black triangle glided from across the street and right over my other neighbors house only about 40 ft. in the air (heading towards the direction of the group of lights). it had absolutely no lights on it, and made no noise what so ever. i literally stared at it for about 5 seconds. it was moving slower than an airplane and i couldnt believe what i was seeing. i jumped up to try to keep watching it, but could no longer see it. it had white or grey markings on its bottom that were not numbers, or letters but half ring shapes. at first i thought it was like a stealth fighter, but it was moving entirely too slow, and made no sound what so ever. i know my eyes werent playing tricks on me because i was no further than 50 or 60 ft. away from it, and had to turn my head in order to follow it. i was very scared and banged on my neighbors window, but it didnt appear again. i continued to watch the group of lights for a little over an hour after the triangle appeard. they didnt move any further in the distance, but were very high, and almost above my neighbors house. this isnt my 1st encounter with unexplained objects and lights in the sky, or other things i have experienced as a kid, but it is my 1st time seeing the black triangle. i researched it online today, but some peoples description of it doesnt match what i saw. it was almost like it was made not to be seen in the dark. but i

approximately 9:45  approximately a dozen-or-so patrons were outside and one man said they were watching a ufo and pointed it out.  it was west of us in a small area of sky outlined by trees.  the shape and colors were not immediately distinguishable to me.  it was a full moon.  i saw a bright star and asked what that was.  someone said it was venus, and then the object appeared.  it was brighter than venus and maybe about 5 times the size in appearance and it appeared closer in.\r\n\r\ni watched it for what seemed like 10 to 15 minutes moving about or meandering non-linearly.  it took me a few minutes to distinguish its shape, which looked like a plane with a neon body and neon orange wings that sometimes seemed to spin around the neon green body.  it was not very big and seemed to be as close in as a plane would be.  a young lady captured it with her cell phone camera and showed it to me, but the image on her phone was only an indistinguishable spec.\r\n\r\ni immediately thought it was either a genuine ufo or a black ops maneuver.  i watched for it to dart about erratically, but it seemed to gracefully move or meander about and hover, occasionally disappearing behind the tree scape. i was very excited to see it, especially when it seemed to move closer and waved and beckoned to it, to no avail.  there were two young men standing beside me.  one commented that he thought it was an unmanned craft, and the other commented that he thought it was a remote-controlled glider and that he had seen something like it before.\r\n\r\nwhen it disappeared behind the trees, everyone dispersed.  i walked west several blocks and, on my way home, i ran into a couple lingering, who explained that they were watching a ufo.  this was around 10:15 or so.  it was still there in the same general area as before, only from where i was standing it was more up overhead and slightly to the east of where i was standing.  i only saw it briefly at that time before it disappeared behind the treeline, and a large low-flying plane became visible, which the three of us speculated was patrolling the sky for the object we had just seen.\r\n\r\ni was surprised at myself and my feelings of actually wishing it would land.  for all the things i had heard about aliens being hostile, this was not what i was feeling.  i felt a strong desire to have contact with other intelligent beings in the universe.  at the same time, i was skeptical, and still am, that this could be a black ops, governmental, or some other kind of attempt at mind control.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then

2010. we were staying in a small camper on my uncles land, the door was facing the west where we had a good view of the treeline and the mountains in the beyond. at about 2 a.M. we were watching through the camper window (looking out to the west) and noticed a small cluster of red, blue, and green lights. the object seemed to be just above the mountains in the distance. flying in a circlular motion. after a few seconds it would seem to \"jump\" and begin flying in circles again. my friend had gone to bed but i stayed up to watch the strange object. i pulled the curtain back on another window in the camper, and looked toward the mountains in the northwest and noticed several green lights flying a darting around above the treeline in different directions. jumping up i opened up the door to the cool night in order to get a better look at them. then i woke my friend mike and told him what i had seen off in the northwestern sky. he got up and came to the camper door and we watched as the numerous green lights flew around and at time hovered above the in the night sky above the mountains. a couple times the hovering lights would seem to almost \"drip\" what seemed like a green light. mike was exhausted and after watching the display for 5 or 10 minutes he went back to bed. i was fascinated too excited to think about anything but watching the lights in the sky. i went into my uncle's house where i woke my mother and got my uncle's binoculars. my mother and myself walked out toward the camper and using the binoculars i got a better look at the green lights/objects. they were elongated hexagons and i could see lines that looked as if they formed some sort of panelling. my mother was sleepy, cold, and didn't have her glasses with her. after a few minutes she went back inside the house, back to bed. i stood outside watching them through the binoculars until i got cold, then i went back inside the camper and kept watching them through the westward facing window for about another 2 hours. just before dawn i noticed yet another object in the sky that looked at first like a star, except that it was moving and was far too big to be a star. looking at this third object through my uncle's field glasses i saw a white rounded octagonal object. i woke mike again. he looked at it through the binoculars, at first telling me it looked like a star he acknowledged at last that it was no star, handed the field glasses back and went back to sleep. in the predawn twilight i studied the white object until it disappeared off to the west into the sky. by this time the green lights had also disappeared and the first rays of the sun had begun to appear in the east. with my head filled with thoughts of the things i saw that night i went to bed. i tried to sleep but instead lay there thinking until finally drifting off to sleep around 10

723 leaving bellbrook and entering centerville. at approximately 4:50 pm, my eyes saw something in the sky, and my first thought was a plane was on fire and it was going down. then i thought it might be a meteor. then i noticed a smaller object beneath the larger \"falling\" object. using depth perception and reference points, i was able to determine the \"falling\" object wasn't falling at all, but was in fact remaining stationary. the \"smaller\" object i first thought was a jet, the kind that leaves behind cloud-trails. it had a \"flare tail\" but it didn't leave any kind of cloud trail behind. it ascended at an angle and proceeded to travel rapidly up, beneath the larger object, and into the sky. the \"falling flaming meteor\" remained in the same position for the next 10 minutes, until i reached my job and turned a different direction, and lost sight of it. as i live next to wright-patterson afb, i dismissed it, but the following day i saw news footage of strange lights seen over el paso, and they were almost exactly the very same thing i saw on october 17th, only during the day instead of night. i was so disturbed by this that i contacted the dayton daily news, and considered contacting wright-patt afb, but decided not to. ddn couldn't confirm any other reported sightings. a co-worker tonight said they had explained away these multiple sightings, but an exhaustive net-search pulled up nothing. i'm not a ufo nut, and living next to an air force base, especially wright-patt, i'm used to seeing multiple aircraft of different types in the sky. i am able to identify them. this object was unidentifiable. i only made the effort to contact the newspaper after seeing the el paso video, which at that point profoundly disturbed me. i know what i saw wasn't

answer the ringing phone. it was my wife telling me she was going into the store for groceries, then she would be home directly. at this time it was still daylight.\r\nwe live beside monterey bay in california. our apartment is very close to the ocean and we have a limited view through the trees from our bedroom and deck. i could see that the marine layer (fog) was thickening with a very low cloud cover. really, a pretty normal day for around here. i did notice that it was very calm, not a breath of wind. \r\nthe next thing that happened was our power browned out. my bedside lamp became very dim and the cable, internet and phone went off. yet our overhead lights came on, but were very dim. the lights would respond to the on/off switches, but would come on very dim, kind of glowing. i remember thinking that it must be a u.F.O. overhead, which was kind of a strange way for me to react. i lit a candle and decided that a transformer or something must have blown.\r\nat roughly 6:10 p.M. my wife got home with the groceries. she was in a flustered state. she came into the bedroom and said \"good, i'm glad to see the lights doing this here also.\" yet, ours was the only apartment in our building and complex (around 100 apartments with a pool and beautiful courtyard surrounded on 4 sides by the complex), that was experiencing any brown out. she noticed that our porch light was flickering but none of the others in our building was flickering, all were normal. then, she dropped the bombshell.\r\nwhen she was in the grocery store, checking out, the lights browned out and the clerk lost the screen on her cash register. however, she was able to process our debit card though it took much longer than usual to go through. there were several people around and most remarked that it must be a brown out. she then got into our truck to come home.\r\nin our neighborhood, you can go through the middle of town or drive right along the ocean. we almost always go the ocean way. as she got to lover's point, she saw what she perceived as a ball of fish stirring up the otherwise eerily calm water. so she pulled over to watch for dolphin, which is usually the first species to react and feed on a ball of fish. in face, it it usually the dolphin who round up the fish and force them to the surface. it is something we see quite regularly as we are avid ocean watchers.\r\nsuddenly, the water became completely calm much more rapidly than usual. by this time she was looking through binoculars that we keep handy in the truck. she saw the water calm, then a beam of what she described as pure light energy, similar to a laser, came up through the water at a 50 degree angle. this caused absolutely no disturbance on the surface of the bay. this light shot up and at the top of this beam, she saw an egg shaped object that was extremely bright, yet she said she could see the clouds through it. apparently it was clear yet solid, a bit like a light bulb. there was a very small space between the beam of light and the object. this beam and object were a vivid sea foam blue and the marine layer around it glowed a tangerine orange color she described as kind of like a halo.\r\nthen the object shot off to the north at a crazy rate of speed while simultaneously the beam retracted back into the water. both things happened in a split second and once again the water which the beam was entering was undisturbed. \r\nh","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then

there was no light at the rear. it was producing the same type of vaporization type of contrails. could not have been more then 8000' elevation and las vegas is roughly 2000' where i was at. literally no more then 5 miles away either, no sound no noise what so ever. the only reason i was able to see the \"contrails\" is because the moon was in view behind it and lit it up. otherwise i believe it would have been invisible. this craft was literally passing right by the air force base. but it did not take off from the base, also it only had one light on it a solid white very dim light. it was also incredibly small. if it had been a fighter jet or something of that nature i would have seen the outline that's how close it was. i saw it moving from north to south on the eastern side of vegas along the \"sunrise mountains\". it crossed the entire las vegas sky from nellis air force base to past henderson in around 45 seconds. thats around 50-60 miles i would say before it was no longer in sight. if it had been a jet i would have heard the sonic boom or engine noise as fast as it was moving.","distance":"Over One

beautiful, clear night with a bright moon. as i crested the hill i noticed, through my left (driver's window), just below the moon in the se sky, three very bright stars - what looked like jupiter at the top and two equally bright stars just below and to the right and left of jupiter, forming a triangle with jupiter at the top. i was amazed, but had to glance away to the road ahead and a stop sign. as i turned left, i looked back up through my windshield at the moon, and in the few seconds that had transpired the two bright stars under jupiter had dimmed to half of their brightness and then were gone. i tried to rationalize - could they have been reflections through the window? airplanes flyng in my direction that turned away in unison? i have no idea what these two bright lights were, and how long they were there before i saw them, but i checked this morning and was excited that someone else reported seeing the same thing, albeit from another part of the country (mi). although that gentleman reports that the lights \"dropped away\" from jupiter before disappearing, i didn't notice them dropping, just fading, perhaps because i had turned away and was in a moving car. anyone looking up at the sky around 6:55 pst would have seen this amazing sight, so i'm surprised that there aren't more reports.
