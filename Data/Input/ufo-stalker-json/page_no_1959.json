massachusetts institute of technology (mit) when i saw a large group (20 or 30) mit students standing next to the kresge auditorium staring mesmerized at the western sky.  \r\ni stopped to ask what they were staring at and one pointed at an object which to me looked like a long vapour trail. the sky was clear except for some clouds in the western horizon which were slightly reddish as it was near sunset. i mentioned to others that it could be a vapour trail from a jet plane but i was told that this was not possible as the object changed directions very rapidly and it was clearly solid. in effect, as i stared at the object it suddenly flipped 90 degrees and it started to slowly move in our direction. it was difficult to judge the distance of the object since we could not tell its size but if it was 200-300 meters in length then it may have been over brookline ma or perhaps further west at an altitude of 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon. \r\nas we stared mesmerized over a period of 5-10 or minutes the object suddenly again flipped 90 degrees at such a speed that the eye could not follow the movement and it started to move more rapidly towards the north. the object was now closer to us but while it was still impossible to judge its distance (perhaps over harvard university?), one could clearly discern that the pencil-shaped object was indeed solid and metallic looking with a slight golden tinge. the object disappeared behind some tall buildings in the cambridge area. suddenly to the south two usaf single engine propeller planes appeared in close formation obviously to us in pursuit of the object which was no longer visible. \r\nto my knowledge we did not report our observations but there were reports from other witnesses in the boston area as reported by the boston daily globe newspaper on 22 october 1957. unfortunately, the observers quoted all appeared to confuse the object with the discarded sputnik rocket, which was clearly impossible to have seen in space (the launching had been earlier that month). attached is a clipping of the boston globe report. also attached is a copy of a letter from the usaf dated 22 october reporting a sighting of a

water faucet i looked toward the western sky and noticed a tiny blue light between a break in the clouds. i dismissed it as a star at first but after turning on the faucet i looked back in that direction and realized it was moving. it then got lost behind a cluster of clouds. i then thought maybe it was just a plane. the more i thought about it the more i thought maybe it wasn't moving and it was just the clouds changing direction and moving fast. i thought it was kind of weird for the clouds to change direction that quickly but there have been stranger things to happen in the weather. so i kept looking in that general direction to see if i happen to catch a glimpse of it again. about 2 minutes later i see a much brighter solid blue and red lighted (blue on its right side and red on its left side) object headed east so i figured it was a plane and not the same thing i had seen just a couple of minutes before. that object started in the same exact circular pattern, veering to the left, as the last object i had seen and it went from a solid blue and red to a lighter blue and smaller light. as this light circled around in the same exact path that it had done just minutes prior it remained the light blue light. i took notice that there were no blinking lights on this craft at all. in fact there were a few planes in the sky at the time of this event and i noticed there was a significant difference in size, speed and lights. this craft would make this exact circular pattern occasionally ducking behind the clouds for about 1/4th of the rotation. after the craft's second rotation i viewed i immediately called my wife out to see if she had an idea what the object could be or if she could witness what i was witnessing. something strange thing that my wife and i had noticed was that there was a cluster of clouds that a plane had gone through and we lost sight of for a few minutes as to where this object went through the same clouds and was completely visible. the object was definitely within the cloud because there was obvious distortion but we never lost sight of the object in those particular clouds due to its brightness. however the clouds further west that were much wider we lost the object for a couple of minutes. when the craft made its circular motion and headed back in the opposite direction the light blue light remained. the only time the red light was visible was when it was in a head on position. again...I saw a few other planes around the area when this event took place and they look nothing alike. in fact i live near phoenix sky harbor airport and i can assure you this looked and acted nothing like any plane i'd ever seen. this craft made this circular pattern for just about 30 minutes (roughly 5 to 6 rotations at about 5 minutes per rotation and what i would think was at least 15 miles in diameter and if my math is right 47.12 miles in circumference) from the time i started viewing. note that this is a rough estimate and that my calculations could be way off...But i do know that this object was moving much faster than any conventional aircraft and covering a significant amount of distance in a short period of time and much too precise to be any man-made craft i'd ever seen. eventually the object went behind the clouds one last time and as i looked to see when it would come out again i seen 2 fighter jets shooting straight through that exact airspace. i waited around for about 8 to 10 minutes to see if the object would come back and circle the area again but it never did. the time i noticed as the jets came through was 11:02pm arizona time. i had no real significant feelings other than disbelief that i was seeing this strange happening. i did however attempt to video tape it but my camera which was previously fully powered now had a dead battery and my digital camera couldn't catch an object that far off in the darkness. i do have to say though just as the object ducked behind the clouds that one last time one of my dogs who is deaf began focusing toward the east and barking and howling like crazy. my other dogs just sat & stared at him as he did this. that isn't typical as where if one dog starts barking they all would usually start barking.

(not exactly, but i believe it was around 9:05-(9:10). laura grabbed abbie's phone, and decided she was going to call her mother in total shock of what she'd just seen. there was no service on the phone. i suddenly felt rather ill. extremely fatigued, my face felt like it had been doused with boiling water. i mentioned it, and abbie and laura both agreed they felt the same.\r\n\r\nafter contemplating what to do, we decided to follow the ufo. it wasn't soon after that it disappeared from all visibility behind a very thin cloud. the aircraft that were pursuing the ufo looked as if they were circling around the cloud. we were sure it'd disappeared, when they began forming a triangular shaped pattern near this cloud. seemingly out of no-where, this bright orange tinted light suddenly appeared through the cloud, and the ufo became visible once more as it sped past the aircraft.\r\n\r\nthe ufo once again passed near the moon's light, and then began to turn, which granted me the ability of gauging the craft had multiple dimensions and was indeed soft-featured. once the craft completed it's turn, it began a slow diagonal ascension.\r\n\r\nat this point, all disbelief has left the three of us. we're intrigued, but tired. rather distraught, but morbidly curious.\r\n\r\nwhile still following the craft, we turned back onto the main highway outside of collins. we all watched in disbelief as the ufo disappeared yet again. we watched as aircraft began swarming the area it'd disappeared in. we made it back to my fiance's mother's house around 10:00. the three of us decided to ensure no one was lying, we all decided to draw it and not show anyone until we were all finished with the sketches. sure enough, the sketches were all identical.\r\n\r\nthis morning, i woke up earlier than usual, feeling extremely tired and beat. i felt as if i'd been beaten with a bat. it took my fiance' a while to finally coerce me out of bed. she wasn't feeling well either.\r\n\r\nabout 1:00 p.M today (october 19th, 2010), abbie called us, saying she'd missed her class because she couldn't really move this morning.\r\n\r\nwe all decided this needed to be reported.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":25978,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.1813013,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10192010-0009","longitude":-82.1090083,"occurred":1287459600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1287530673000,"summary":"Arrowhead shaped ufo was being chased by military aircraft above reidsville and collins georgia.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Collins, Georgia","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:92603"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Charleston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside lowering a flag. i glanced at jupiter off to my left.  it was visible in the southeast sky at about 70 degrees. i immediately noticed two stationery star like objects in the sky visible near jupiter.  i knew these had not been visible in the sky previously because i work outside in the evenings and had been watching jupiter all summer.  i looked away, thinking i would get out my astronomy app later to identify them.  when i looked up again, one had disappeared and the second was fading as i watched.  i watched it until it was no longer visible.  both lights were bright white, star-like and not moving.  they did not reappear.  i started to post this after that time but did not.  i'm posting now because of similar reports on 10/18/2010 in nevada and oregon.  seeing these marks my fourth ufo sighting in 10 years living in east central illinois.  i am always curious about these and i was curious about this as well.

rock and hit the bottom. it came directly over our heads and made no noise. to this day i remember it had no noise, but a sound that sounded very much like bass in a car. not the loud noise, but the vibration. my brother, who was older than me at the time, was screaming at this thing to go away. however, i remember jumping up and down and screaming, \"come down,come down\". its amazing how i can still remember how it felt as though this thing was playful. as i write this, i just cant believe it happened. we watched it fly over the house, very close to the top of the house. its hard to believe but i can remember thinking,\" wow, my parents have got to see this\". one of the things that sticks out the most was those 4 huge domes on the bottom. they were glowing a milky white, like really hard to describe. my brother and i never talk about what happened that night. we both acknowledge that it happened, but strangely dont talk about it. this thing was so close, that being 6ft tall now, i couldve stood on top of the house and touched the bottom. it was about 20ft off the ground and directly over my head. to this day i have no idea what that was, but i am 100% sure that i did see a circular craft just feet over my head. sometimes i go back to where it happened in that house i use to live in. the back yard is a lot smaller than i remember, but those cherry trees are still there

approximately at the same time.  at about 7:20 pm i heard our dogs barking outside, and after several minutes i was prompted to see what was provoking them.  so i stepped outside my front door, the dogs have stopped barking, and i didn't observe anything in particular they were interested in.  the sky is very clear tonight, no clouds around, and i turn my head up and see three air planes flying over head in different directions.  since it was so clear, i walked around my little apartment to gaze in the direction where my boyfriend and i had seen the ufo on the 8th.  the location of the first sighting is due south from my position and tonight it was clear, but just to the south-east i caught sight of the brilliant, awesomely bright orange star that seemed very similar to the one that had caught my attention 10 days ago. for almost a minute this object did nothing, no movement, no twinkling, just stationary, when all of a sudden it quickly began to ascend into the sky gaining altitude, then the orange bright light was shut off, it disappeared for a split-second and then the white and red blinking lights in the erratic pattern began bringing it back into view.  it continued to ascend for only a few seconds more before starting off in a north-western path which this time, brought it directly in a flight path over my home.  the object was triangular shaped, has only one red light with several white lights that blink in irregular patterns around the parimeter of the object.  the solid part of the craft appeared to be medium to dark grey.  this object makes no sound, leaves no trail and moves rapidly.  it continued on the north-western path until it game to what appeared to be another bright star which was twinkling multi-colors, came very close to this multi-colored star before changing course into a south-west direction. from there i lost sight. what is stranger is that the large multi-colored star that the object changed its course by, disappeared shortly after that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

was driving down dante avenue of vineland, nj with a friend. as we were driving down said road, i happened to look out of the passenger side window and survey the sky. as i was doing this, a large silvery white object appeared seemingly out of no where, at exactly the spot to which i was looking. at first, i was caught off guard and did not know what to make of such a thing. the whole encounter lasted about 5 seconds, during which time the unidentified flying object stayed in its set position, and then disappeared into itself, leaving nothingness behind besides from the stars glistening in the sky. the object never moved while i was looking at it, but instead stayed in its exact positioning as i have stated above. it was almost eye shaped, with a domed top and bottom which met at the sides in points. it did not look as if it were too close, but it did not look that far away either. it wasnt a bright glow, not something that would have created a flash. but instead was a dull white silver glow. at first , i was in awe and shock as to what i was seeing.. because common sense told me that this is not something that i really should be seeing. immediately i had the sense that this was not something from this planet, and is not something man made. after the object disappeared, and it disappeared by sucking into itself almost going away from the middle out, i turned to my friend and said \"i think i just saw a ufo\" to which she replied \"shut up, you're buggin.\" but i know what i saw, and it was not something from this planet.. of that i am sure. this is my first close

upwood, england with my air force parents during fall of 1991 to loring afb several years before they closed it down to military.  winter of 1992 when snow on the ground was making it more difficult for me to continue riding my bmx bike to school, i made it to the top of the bike path that cuts through the edge of a wooded area and parallels a road for vehicles.  both roads go down a rather steep hill then the bike path curves left and leads straight to the school grounds.  more specifically, the bike racks. the paralleling road t-bones left and right where the bike path only goes left. going further left down the vehicle road passes the school on one's left then one would arrive at an entry/exit gate. \r\n\r\nafter struggling to the top of the hill i stopped and checked my watch.  it was about 10 minutes to 8 a.M.  i looked down at the bottom then cocked my head up and looked at the mostly cloudy sky.  this being a monday and my hatred of school, i looked up thinking aloud that i hate mondays and just want this week to hurry up.  \r\n\r\nwhile looking up i noticed a large, smooth and silver disc floating in the sky maybe a half mile from me across the vehicle-road-going-left, past some trees and above what i think might have been base personnel housing. the object had 2 black lines. 1 line dividing the object horizontally around the center and the other dividing the bottom half. the very bottom section was rotating at a steady pace clockwise if one were to stand underneath it. even with these lines sectioning off the craft, it still seemed flush.  the object was keeping position yet had a slight wobble to it.  when the sun could break through the clouds, it caused a reflection off the top area of the object.  this object was silent in it's hover and was only several yards away from the roof of the 2 story building.\r\n\r\ni neither felt any sense of fear nor happiness.  just wonder and amazement.  i knew from watching cartoons that this is what's called a ufo and knew this wasn't a regular plane; no tail nor wings.  i knew i had little time left to get to school on time but wanted to get a closer look so i went down the hill as fast as i safely could.  i had to keep my eyes on the path because of branches and very wet snow finally making it to the bottom of the path before it curves left and looked up at where the object was and it wasn't there.  i scanned as much of the sky i could but saw nothing.\r\n\r\ni hurried to school just making it to homeroom on time.  i felt nervous and was eager to tell anyone but class started.  i finally told a friend during recess but he just listened and didn't comment on it much.  i knew things like this wasn't normal from what i saw in cartoons so kept it to myself.  i tried searching online of other witness account but to no avail. i did however find out that there were some 1975 sightings on that base where it hovered over nuclear storage and from what's been reported through a lot of recent tv shows, ufos have always been attracted to nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\ni may have seen 2 other ufos early september of 2009 flying from las vegas, over colorado on my way back to st. louis. i should probably report them as well.  although since it happened over colorado, it's been suggested to me that they were probably planes or jets from the nearby military bases.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
