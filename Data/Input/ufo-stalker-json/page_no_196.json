at 9:30pm on 07-08-17 fireworks started to go off near my apartment.  my girlfriend and i went outside on our deck to watch.  these fireworks were extremely close to our apartment (basically right across the street but on the other side of the block).  i always skywatch and have only seen strange things or possible ufos twice before in the 15+ years i have been doing this.  tonight would be the third time. \r\n\r\nas soon as we went outside i noticed a red light hovering in the sky.  at this point it was about the size of a star but it was below the could cover.  i pointed out the strangeness of the light to my girlfriend who immediately confirmed that she saw it too. i thought maybe it was a plane that was coming towards you because sometimes that can give off the appearance of hovering.  right as i had this thought, the light brightened considerably and dived straight down and appeared right above the tree line.  next, the red light shot straight up back to its original location in the sky.  it repeated this behavior several times.  then while it went back down towards the tree line it moved over to the left and then over to the right.  after that the light went back to the original spot again. \r\n\r\nthe red light then moved left in the sky.  all of these movements were faster than planes move but did not leave streaks in the sky. the red light was solid for all these moves but now it began to blink about once per second.  the light then began to move side to side, while blinking and did this for about a minute or two before moving left some more, then behind a large tree that blocked my clear view of it.  through the leaves i saw the light stop and hover some more, still blinking.  then the red light faded out and i was able to see a much smaller blue light in its place. the red light came back on.  it did this two more times before moving left and out of sight completely.\r\n\r\nsecond ufo - about 30 seconds later we observed another red light in the sky, roughly around where the original one was. again this light was starlight sized except this one was blinking already and in between the blinks you could see the smaller blue light. this one dived straight down and climbed back up.  this is where it hovered for the duration of the fireworks (about 4-5 minutes).  as soon as the fireworks ended this second red light got brighter (about as bright as the first one did).  it then moved left past the tree which blocked the view.  i lost sight of it then but my girlfriend saw it shoot off at a high rate of speed leaving a streak in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe whole encounter lasted about 10 minutes and the lights were over the western part of union county. it was really strange as this second light seemed to stop doing what it was doing to watch the fireworks and didn't resume until they ended.

was on guard station in small building in iraq in 2003. from the samarra cmoc i looked out toward the tigris river and saw what looked like a fire ball. it looked exactly like some of these fireball orange pictures of the sun but was maybe anywhere from 30-60 foot in diameter. a solid sphere of fire. it raised up from what looked to be the tigris river and moved very slowly and smoothly. it hovered maybe 50 foot off the ground then started moving parallel to the ground still very slow and smooth. moved maybe 100 foot then started on an upward direction.  it then almost vanished but looked like it took off straight up at a very high speed. i have been all over the world and was in the army for 7 years. i have never seen anything like this ever in my life. i reported it and it was quickly dismissed. but a team, including myself, got put together within 20 mins and we went out to investigate. nothing was found but the vegetation was very dense with very tall grass, probably about 10-15 feet. never got an explanation and never seen anything like this again. this was around september 2003 in samarra iraq. i was on the front gate guard post around 10-11pm local time. it was very quiet with no one around anywhere since there was a curfew\r\n i am unaware of any type of ordinance that can do that as slow and smooth the object moved, maybe no more then 5-10 mph and very smooth. no noise was heard from it. i was within 100-300 feet or so of it. if you look at a map of samarra and find the police station next to the cemetery, just over the main bridge and into the main city. i was looking from the front gate at about the front gates 10 o clock direction and toward the tigris river.  i would be willing to discuss this and possibly be willing to disclose my identity. would really love to know what i saw since it's bugged me ever since.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

out 2 hours later and it was still in the same position. if it was a star it would have moved with the earth's rotation. 4 hours later it was gone. one of my friends witnessed this ufo with me as well. it's too far away for me to get an actual shape. if you watch the video you will see what am i am talking about. it constantly morphs shape and every now and then you see it straighten out into a 3 to 4 light strip. unfortunately i have a crappy phone and the video is not all it could be. i have been having bizarre dreams that warn me that something very big is going to happen in august
