send the dog down so i could walk her.\r\n\r\nas i walked out the back gate (facing due south), a commercial jet caught my eye, it had lights across the entire span that were red/white/blue.  and it was rather low, i would estimate it to be no more than 1000 - 2000 feet.  as i watched it, and it passed over me (it was moving north east, coming from the south east - likely taking off from midway airport), another thing caught my eye moving pretty low, and pretty fast from the north west.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was birds flying in formation - but then i noticed that it was moving much too fast, and actually had a solid shape to it.  the rear portion was actually blocking out the few stars you can see in chicago, and the sly itself with blackness.  so it did appear to have mass.\r\n\r\nit was a shape much like that of a b-2 stealth, but more boomerang shaped.  the object made no sound, had no lights, and left no comtrail, nothing really.  i am guessing that the only reason i was able to see it was because of the moon and bright stars illuminating it.  the moon i think was likely crescent or similar stage, but it was very clear that night so it was bright.\r\n\r\nthe object was under the altitude of the passing airliner, and likely 1/2 mile in the distance (where as the airliner flew directly over me).\r\n\r\nthe object moved from the west, and out of view in the south east horizon, within 10 - 15 seconds.  \r\n\r\ni did have my iphone in my hand as i noticed the object, and i was able to snap 1 photo - but all you can see is a faint \"\\\" shape in the top (a little over half vertical) left (around 1/4 of the way left).  you can kind of make out the top portion of the shape, but again it  really a bad photo and like i said - the object did not give off it own light as far as i can tell.\r\n\r\ni have also included a second copy of the photo, which explains the flight path, direction, and points out the location of the object in the photo.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

out of nowhere i see this fireball round pulsating object come slowly down to my field of vision. immediately, i tried to rationalize what it could be and it was like nothing i encountered. then the object stopped and held its position for about an hour and 30 to 45 minutes. i closely watched the object out of my room, and it would move from time to time, like zigzagging and slow moving, however it maintaned its position. i realized it was too close to be a star and that i never saw a star there at night, it felt out of place, plus it was too close to the ground, about the height of a helicopter would be in flight. i immediatley got my samsung vibrant smart phone and began trying to record it; however it would not show up when being recorded, the light wouldnt show up.So, then i switched to camera, and i got the object to show up on camera, so i focused in and took several shots. i was tired so went to bed thinking my head was playing games on me, however i felt like there was something they wanted me to know. the next day when looking at the pictures, i increased the magnification, and to my utter amazement, the object was a metallic disk, and it seemed that there was this weird energy that the camera picked up and its semetrical on each side  of the photes.. its dots around the disk like object....Im willing to do anything it takes to get these photos analyzed,

triangular but only the lights were visable. the lights formed a triange, first 2 lights behind 3 more lights in perfect form like how bowling pins are set up. i couldn't see the body of the vehicle because it looked invisible but i absolutely seen what looked triangular even though nothing was at the front, i could see a pointed image. it's white lights were diffused almost as if a cloud was in front of it but there were no clouds. it flew quite low like when a plane flies towing a banner. it was very eerie, there was no sound and it looked as if it tipped to its side as if to see me on the ground. it flew in such a way that i can only describe it similar to a  hummingbird, it was very fast and extremely large compared to the moon. i could compare it's size because the moon was in my visual with this vehicle. i could see it slow down and speed up. i couldn't believe what i had seen so i called my husband out to watch with me. i was freaked out because i just saw a ufo and it was like nothing i've ever seen before!. he stayed out a few minutes and went back inside. about ten minutes later i seen what looked like a shooting star and following that i saw my second sighting which looked like a fireball. it semed like a shooting star because it's path was similar to one but it looked strange. it was two circles hooked together and wobbling back and forth and moving like a shooting star.  it had color to it not just white but red and white. i called my son out to watch with me and within a half hour we saw another sighting together. it's shape was different also but it followed the flight path of the first one. it appeared out of nowhere as if it came through a black hole. it was round in shape and had 3 distinct lighted parts inside which i thought looked round but each had jagged edges and my son described it as having holes in it. we were both freaking out and we called my husband back out to watch. within 20 minutes all 3 of us saw another object which looked like a boomerang shape. it was invisible looking because we all agreed we could  see through it. it was lit up but very different then the others. it's shape could also be what you include in in above

for the tree tops, i know there alot of electric lines in that direction. it was shortly after 8pm and lasted for about 40 minutes . then it rose a bit and seemed to go away from us very slowly and

to look ufo's. i thought he was joking at first. i am 33 by the way. i looked up and saw an amber glowing disk flying fairly low. it had no recognizable faa approved flashing lights. the entire craft appeared to be glowing. i just caught a glimpse of the first one flying ahead of three others that were tightly close together. when i saw that three of these object were coming into view from behind a tree and the neighbors house. i immediately recognized these were not regular jets/planes or helicopters and moving faster than a glowing balloon would. i immediately climbed a fence around the pool equipment on the side of the house to get on the roof so i would not loose sight of the craft from the neighbors trees. as i got on the roof three of the objects were flying in formation one behind the other. with one of the four about a half mile in front of the three in formation one behind the other then one more was behind the three in tight formation. similar to this     .   . . .   .    in that formation one behind the other. they appeared to be a glowing amber color very similar to glowing hot metal. they were circular disk shaped. i would guess to be maybe 100 to feet in diameter. i would estimate there distance from me to be when at there closest to be 1 1/2 miles. and flying at an altitude of between 1000 to 3000 ft. they appeared to be moving the speed of a slow moving plane. i was very excited to see something like this, this close. i live close to two airports for over 10yrs now and have never saw anything like this. my step dad was a skeptic before tonight. my 30 yr old brother wittnessed it too. he doesn't know what to think. he said it is the first time he's ever wittnessed something he can't explain. my yougest brother 22 climbed up on the roof near the end of the sighting. he said they looked like balloons with fire in them. but doesn't think that is what they were. i watched them traverse, jugdging from there positions over the ground. from west to east parrallel to me i would say they travelled 6 miles in 2 min. which would mean they were doing 180 miles an hour. impossible for a balloon. with almost no breeze or wind. the whole thing lasted till we could no longer see them about 4-5 min. i called air traffic control from a number on the internet since information did not have the number in sanford fl. he said he has not noticed anything unusual between 7:45 pm and 8:00 pm. i then asked him if there were any airtraffic flying in formation that he had noticed. he denied that there was. we did take a couple of pictures but i'll have to upload them at a latter date because i do not have the camera with me. there no that great though because of the low light condition but there are some weird anomalies. with the photographs and his camera malfunctioned many times trying to take the pictures which he said has never happened to him before. my mother also witnessed the event. now my whole family has started thinking. were going to buy a

was monday aug 30, 2010. 11.15pm when i saw it. i'm living in the cork city, suburbs, ireland. beyond my house is fields, so pretty dark. it was a clear night. stars visible. i popped out the back garden for a cigarette (no funny stuff - too old) my wife was watching tv inside. then i saw this, i dont' know what to call it - craft??! ship? appeared low, and came almost overhead. flying from north east to south west. the whole thing lasted 3 seconds. i'm a graphic artist by trade, so i've taken a photo of the portion of sky and roughed up closely what the object looked like. please note: this is not a photograph of the object!!!. i couldn't get the middle section right tho. the middle section looked... like, have you ever seen an oil slick in water? or the rainbow colours when you blow those kids bubbles? i'm sorry, i can't give a better description, it looked like a transparent blur of slight colour. just bizarre. the body was clearly black against the sky, though the sky \"was\" dark. and it had 2 rings of dim orange/white light on either end - which i could plainly see the sky through. overall - it didn't emit much light. and sounded exactly like someone exhaling slowly and gently. in fact i'm not sure it even did make a sound, but i thought i heard a breath. it could well have been my own. i am, however, 100% confident in what i \"saw\". i spoke to my wife and parents and tried to figure it out - to no avail. i didn't have any time for photgraphing, and if i was standing there with the camera on - it probably wouldn't have occured to me. i was quite shaken. i'm an amateur backyard astronomer. i know my planets, stars, satellites & meteorites. i've seen a lot of odd things in the sky, all explainable - but not this. i was going to contact the local airport and ask if anything showed on radar, but to be honest  - i feel silly discussing this with anyone. i know there's life \"out\" there, the universe is beyond infinite. but to see something like this, so close - is pretty much life changing. i've spent the last few weeks searching ufo's online, but i haven't seen anything the same \"shape\" as what i saw. what i saw was almost \"wrench\" shaped. i've purchased a good lense and camera, and spend about 3 nights a week in my back garden, but i doubt i'll ever see anything like this again. \r\n\r\nhave a look at the attached graphic, it's as close as i can recreate (bar the centre). i'd love to hear your thoughts on this and if anyone else has reported anything similar. this is my first time reporting anything - so forgive me if i've left any details out - just ask.\r\n\r\nps. im not sure if this is of any relevance. but my father rang me the next day and say there was a large power outtage in my area about 30 minutes before this happened. probably nothing to that really, but that's all the info i can think of.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25941,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.898407,"location":null,"logNumber":"IE-10172010-0007","longitude":-8.475399,"occurred":1283235300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"County

i-44 e, i rounded a bend after about a half-mile and saw what seemed like an extremely bright star low in the horizon, but a bit bigger than stars. i realized that it seemed to be slowly moving alongside westbound i-44 similar in height and distance off the highway as a traffic helicopter might be. i knew it wasn't a star but had never seen a light on a helicopter so bright before. it was moving much too slowly to be a plane, i thought it might be about 300' off the ground and 300' to the opposite side of the westbound lanes, i now slowed down and rolled my window down in the eastbound lanes.\r\n\r\nas it got close the light appeared to be more elliptical in shape, longer horizontally. i started to notice a small red light just to the right of the big white light as it got closer. i am driving on a 4 lane interstate highway, but i get into one of the rightmost lanes and slow down to about 50, glancing at it while i'm realizing i want to try to take note of what i see. when it was exactly perpendicular to me it definitely had three sets of three balls of light. each set emitted a particular color. two of the sets stayed the same color and never change intensity, one set white with green balls and the other red with red balls. the trailing set as regularly changing. they would go off for a second or two and come back on, usually red with red balls, but sometimes white with white balls. i couldn't keep looking as i passed it, and lost it that way. i saw it for a least a minute, and a good 15 seconds where the three sets of three balls were quite distinct, and fascinating.\r\n\r\nthe balls where solid circles of their color, although the green circles in the front where very light green inside and light green at the circumference, but strangely emanating a white shimmering light. the green balls were a bit smaller and set further apart from the other sets. the other sets were solid circles emanating shimmering light. i was fascinated with the lighting configuration where it was similar to lights seen in the sky at night on conventional craft, but distinctly different. i am quite sure of these details as i have never seen anything like this in my 50 years, seeing lights in they sky, at least what i remember. i've never seen pictures of anything conventional like it at all. anyone, please contact mufon and reference this case if you can send them a picture of a craft that this could have been, with this lighting capability. i could not hear a helicopter, but there was highway noise, but it didn't appear to be far away, and was moving far too slow to be a plane. please see the attached created image for the lighting configuration and pattern.\r\n\r\nwhen i had been on i-270 approaching the interchange, i did notice a bright star. it was a few times brighter than any other star i could see in the sky, about 30 degrees off the horizon but just a pinpoint of twinkling bright white light, not seeming to move. so, after the, whatever it was, flew by me i started to tremble uncontrollably a little, it was obviously something very different than usual, and was a bit disconcerting to me. \"it\" seemed like it was wanting my attention, that it wanted to make sure that i saw it, but maybe it was just coincidence. it was definitely going slower than the traffic on the westbound side of the road that it was on. there were others on the road and someone looking up on that side at that time could have seen even more detail than i did, but would have come up to it and passed by it. based on how fast the traffic was passing it going in the same direction it was, it was going perhaps 30 mph. it would have been almost the length of my thumb in relative size if i had stuck it out while driving and glancing at it, but glancing at it more than several times while still driving safely.\r\n\r\nso, i exit i-44 about 5 minutes later at laclede sta. rd. and take a few turns and about 2 minutes later i enter one end of the river des peres parkway at the shrewsbury metro link station. as soon as i take a right on to it there almost straight ahead at treetop level i see a very bright white elliptical shimmering light, about the relative size of a thumbtack head. the parkway is a bit curvey and has some trees though sparse in places. the light seemed to be getting closer as i drove on, but i'd loose it it the tree tops. when i'd loose it in a group of trees it would sometimes come out the other side than i expected, and this happened a few times. by the time i had reached a longer straight stretch of road, it was just to my right, slowing moving right at about 15 high, still a a clearly elliptical shimmering white light but having moved off a distance, about half a thumbnail size from the half a thumb size when it was getting closer while i was winding through the parkway. i noticed that i had started to shake at that point, but i had calmed down when i saw it further away. as i was nearing the end of the straight, it passed behind a large tree in the distance. i expected it to come back out from the right having entered from the left, but a small red light with a while strobbing light came back out from the left where the elliptical light had entered. it continued at the same pace, like a helicopter about 1 mile away at 500' feet, moving left. small white lights seemed to become apparent as it moved, similar to seeing the lights turned on in an airliner cabin close to the ground at night. i turned left onto gravois from the parkway and glanced two more times to my right at the object as it seemed to be going in a northeast direction, moving diagonally away from me. i glanced two times and each time it seemed to strobe a red light that created a red \"halo\" around it. i lost site of it in the trees and buildings.\r\n\r\nlast, then went to the supermarket and was walking back out to my car about 8 minutes later, about 100 yards from where i'd last seen the object, if it was the same object i'd been seeing along the parkway anyway - a helicopter flew directly over my head, perhaps 200' feet, and was far quieter than the helicopters i hear land at the hospital facility where i work. the helicopter had one red steady light and a strobbing white light that seemed to be on top that was perhaps reflecting off the rotating rotors. the helicopter was in the process of slowing down, and was heading exactly towards where i'd seen the object leaving. the helicopter seemed to be slowing down as it continued on that direction when i got in my car and left for my house.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25938,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.5862162,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10172010-0004","longitude":-90.398015,"occurred":1287119280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

(from very bright to extinguished). they were in close proximity to one another and maintained their distance as far as i could ascertain. \r\n  this window i was looking out of faces roughly south, and the objects were moving in a south-west direction at a leisurely pace. i would estimate that the distance from my location to the lights to be 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile. also, i would estimate their altitude to be 1500 ft or less, and that did not change for as long as we could see them.  i immediately told her that the objects were airplanes or helicopters, and slid open the window to prove my point. \r\n  however, to my surprise, there was no discernible sound coming from the direction of the lights. no thup-thup-thup of helicopter rotors, roar of jet engines or sound that prop planes make. (i am fairly familiar with the sound of most aircraft, more so military than civilian. i did two tours in iraq with the army infantry and saw all kinds of aircraft in action. kiowa \"little birds\", black hawks, fighter planes and a-10 warthog ground attack jets, etc., and i've ridden on black hawks and chinooks. i feel secure in stating here that these lights made no sound and as far as i am aware, there is no publicly-known military aircraft that is 100% silent.)\r\n  around the time i slid open the window, she had gotten out of bed and walked over to the window to join me in watching these lights. she remarked that she didn't hear them making any sound, as i had noticed already, and we watched in silence for a few minutes to see what they would do.\r\n  after about 2 minutes, the lights moved behind some trees that obscured our view for approximately 30 seconds. at that point i noticed that there were two other aircraft within my view, both at much higher altitudes, both moving much faster, and in opposite directions. (one moving roughly west, and the other east.) these aircraft had the common blinking red and white lights that i have previously observed at night on commercial and private planes. i assume they are running lights or marking lights. the difference between these two obviously normal aircraft and the two brighter, bigger, and pulsating lights was immediately apparent to myself and my wife. i remarked to her at that time that the lights were not the same in appearance, and she agreed.\r\n  at this point, my attention was drawn back to the first lights we had observed, as they were coming back into view, as they were clearing the trees which had obscured our view. it was then that we both noticed that one of them had either gone out, been shut off, or had changed direction and it had moved out of our sight when behind the tree line. this now singular light was moving roughly south-south west for approximately 30 seconds, at the same speed as before. \r\n  i was wondering what had happened to the second light when it suddenly reappeared and was, as far as i could tell, at the same distance apart from the first light as it was before. (this occurred well after the first light had cleared the trees, i.E., the treeline was not obscuring the second light from our vision. i thought this extremely odd, and my wife did as well.\r\n  we watched these lights until they moved out of our line of sight from our bedroom window (by that i mean the lights moved past where we could see them from our window, still in the roughly south-west direction). for some reason we did not go outside to try to observe them further. at this point my wife said something like, \"what kind of airplane is that big?\" until that point i hadn't speculated about these two lights being attached to one object; i was viewing them with the assumption they were two separate and distinct objects. but once she said that, i realized that would explain the precise distance separating the two lights, and their matching speed. \r\n  while this sighting was going on, my strongest emotion was curiosity. i was not fearful of what i was seeing, merely perplexed. my wife stated that she had a \"weird\" feeling while watching these lights, and i could say the same, as would anyone when seeing something he/she cannot logically explain. after the lights had left our view, we both commented on how strange they were and how we both didn't know what they were.  \r\n  i am still at a loss as to what the light(s) were, or what object(s) they were attached to. \r\n\r\n(side note: neither myself or my wife drink alcoholic beverages or use illegal drugs. at the time of this sighting we were both fully awake and sober).","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":25936,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.384769,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10172010-0002","longitude":-93.380806,"occurred":1287117900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1287304979000,"summary":"Observed two large white blinking lights,traveling together, slow moving, no sound, ","tags":["sound","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Bonnerdale, Arkansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:92676"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Springfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Going down north part of springfield mo. at intersection of dale and kellet streets and going north of kellet towards the baptist university.\r\nmultiple orange orbs flying across the sky. three going soutwest to northeast flight pattern and we filmed it. then there were three more coming across following the others by about two minutes between the pack. then a final three coming behind those as well a few minutes between. other people at the university in a pickup stopped and about 5 or 6 other people got out and we all watched these orbs fly over. they were about 1 or 2 thousand feet in the air. very close and visible. you could tell it was a spacecraft in the orb just a bit, but the orange glowed brightly and at times you could see there was something under it but not just for sure what. it was flying without any noise. so silent. the time was between 9 and 10 pm on saturday night october 17, 2010. they disappeared into the horizon and we followed the i-44 corrider going toward strafford mo just looking for them but nothing was found. has anyone else seem these this night? please let us know that we were not the only group who did. thanks. email me if any more questions can be answered.\r\nthanks\r\n*(wit's name deleted--cms/sg.

home, becuase it was is the weekend, i decided to bring out my telescope and do a little star gazing. i had been observing for about probably 30 minutes or so when i noticed something in the sky that appeared to be an orange egg shaped object making no noice maybe about a quarter of a mile away. it was extremely low. it got closer and closer and i begin to freak out. i ran in my house and looked for my camera but could not find it. when i returned out, the object was actually hovering above my yard about 30 feet in the air. i have no idea how it was able to fly. it then proceeded to hover into my back yard and land. i thought maybe i should dial 911 but did not due to the fact that i may have not been believed. i ran into my backyard after debating whether i should approach the object or not. i went into the back and stood crouched down by a large bush for the next five minutes or so. the object did not move. it had no windows on it, but had two orange lights on it. one light on either side of the spacecraft. the object had four (metal im assuming) legs that it had used to land on. it was about 8 feet tall and 5 feet wide. after watching it for 5 minutes it slowly lifted of the ground. i watched it take off and then go down in a nearby field. i assumed it had landed again, so i went back inside to search for my camera which i still could nto find so i got my cell phone out of my truck, but by the time i got to the field, the object was no where in sight. there is no evidence that the craft landed. it was just a very odd, surreal expirience. im just very
