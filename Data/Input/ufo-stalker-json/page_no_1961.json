eliminate the helipad as the helipad does not flash green.  i then ask my cousin to view the object and it starts saying its a plane its a plane its a plane and as soon as he said it it started showing more colors.  the colors were purple, pink, white, red, blue, green, magenta, yellow,  it was a awesome display of colors.  by my knowledge and location i believe the object was towards lake

width above the treetop line in the e/se sky.They were larger than a starpoint of light,smaller than jupiter looks with naked eye.Not sharply defined with an edge so i call them orblike lights.Seemed a bit orange in color.We are very used to seeing aircraft lights and the stars in our sky area and have a very good view of them as we are away from city lights and have a great dark background for them.These lights were clearly not aircraft or common stars and bright and unusual enough to grab my attention.My thought was that i was seeing something very much out of the ordinary that i wanted to try to identify.  i grabbed my panasonic lumix dcm-f18 and got 4 photos.1 pic each of two of the lights, and 2 pics of the third light.Do not know for sure what order or which are the pair.Was rushing and pretty much going on autopilot for pics and was getting them in frame and holding the camera on them to focus. looking at this page as a clock face 1st was at 1 oclock a 2nd at 7:30 and a 3rd at a point halfway between the center point and 6 oclock.The light at 7:30 was close to a hand width above the treetop line with the others progressively higher and spreading up and to the right.They were stationary and did not move around the sky.They may have moved slightly in their part of the sky if at all but i was really too busy to stop and evaluate dead still or not.I just got the photos and the lights went out pretty much at the same time as one another but there may have been a slight stagger. again i was not able to take in every detail of this aspect as i was focusing on the camera and a little bit flustered as well. but the lights did seem to just go out like you would turn off a lamp and they did this closely in time.I was excited to see these lights and be able to take photos of them.I put the camera in review mode and was hardly able to see more than a tiny bit of image/light in all the black background.But by clicking up the mag function i saw some strange stuff.Got even better when i loaded the memory card into the laptop with a bigger screen.I wondered if anyone else had seen this display and decided to call the local tv station wwmtv in kalamazoo.I spoke with the weather guy and he said it could be a couple of things weather related and agreed to look at the photos.He mailed me back and said he eliminated the possible causes he had initially thought of and said he had never seen anything like this before.He asked if the objects were moving or still and i told him what i have stated here.We talked about there seeming to be shape/structure in the images. i am hoping to hear from him again to see if he can share any info that might shed light on this event. my memory of mufon from a tv program led me to this site.I will try to attach photos.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

sighting is my first, and i am not sure if there has ever been such an event reported anywhere before, both in intensity and in duration of observation. thus, the detail of the sighting.\r\n \r\non 10th of august me and a friend of mine went camping in the central part of the stara planina mountain, a mountain that divides bulgaria in the middle, starting from west and ending near the black sea to the east. the exact place where we had the sighting is in the central part of stara \r\nplanina, right where the troyan-kurnare passage road lies, which is one of the main passages connecting the northern and southern parts of bulgaria. at the highest point of that passage there (1565 meters above sea level) is a big monument from the communism times before 1989 in bulgaria, it is called beklemeto. the closest town is troyan, from the northern side, it's about 15 kilometers from beklemeto. also, close to the monument, around 30 minutes on foot from our camp there is a small group of hotels.\r\n\r\ni met my friend up in the mountain, he came from southern bulgaria, and i travelled from the capitol city sofia to the place from the northern side of the mountain. we met there at around 12 o'clock at noon, then we walked a few of kilometers from beklemeto taking a dirt road towards east (we had no vehicle, we both travelled by hitch-hiking) and after awhile we reached a good place for camping (it's quite windy because we were on the highest point of the mountain in the region and strong winds are not something rare there). the exact coordinates of where we put our tent are:  42���46'20.73\"n  24���39'7.46\"e facing north-east, the view is towards the northern part of bulgaria (i got the exact coordinates thanks to google earth). also there were no trees on our altitude, forests were lower than us, the closest being about a kilometer away.\r\n\r\nthe weather was changing really fast during the day, first it was sunny, then clouds appeared at our altitude and covered everything from sight. at a certain point i started having a terrible headache and went to sleep \r\nfor a few hours, i woke up at around 10:30 pm. i went out of the tent, me and my friend sat and talked for about an hour. the fog of clouds from earlier was now completely gone and as it was new moon, we could observe a breath-taking view of the milky way and also the perseida meteor showers which was originally the idea of our trip to the mountains. \r\n\r\nat around 11:30 pm i looked to the north and suddenly noticed some sort of a light source far away (probably 5-7 kms away from us) but yet, on the same altitude as we were. i instantly yelled to my friend \"look!\" and as \r\nwe observed the light flying really slowly without changing direction we started guessing what it could be. the light wasn't flashing at first, it also didn't make any sudden changes in direction the first five minutes or so. not until it decided to suddenly change its direction to the exactly opposite. some seconds after that, really close to the first object, another one appeared from nothing and both started an amazing series of flashing (which i guess was how they communicated) and flying in the sky. \r\n\r\nand i'm talking about some serious mind blowing manouvers, that i personally can't assign to any known (or even kept as a secret) human aircraft or natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nthat's when we realised something out of the ordinary was happening. the lights were making sudden changes of direction, sometimes they faded away for a couple of seconds, just to get brighter afterwards, it was more than obvious they were communicating to each other. and then we started looking at various regions of the night sky to look for more objects and it didn't take more than a minute - that's when we realised it - these objects were all over the place, they just didn't caught our attention at first. we have no idea how many we've observed throughout the night, however, at a certain moment we managed to count 25 different objects being present at the same time on the night sky. all of them were behaving as nothing known to or being produced by man. we didn't manage to see more details regarding these particular lights, as they were some kilometers away from us, and were simply everywhere we looked.After probably an hour of observation of these lights, we saw something that gave us a chill to the bone. we looked to the east and that's when we saw just above the closest hill, really close to the ground, a white light hovering over what appeared at first 10-15 meters above the surface of the hill. in the beginning we could only see that light, however, after thirty or so seconds of staring we could very well distinguish its shape - it was flat disc shaped, it had a bright constant light in its center (the one that caught our attention at first), around the edge of the disc there was a ring of red light, slowly pulsating (it was much dimmer than the central light), and because there was no moonlight, we couldn't see the body of the craft in detail, however, when looking carefully, we could depict the flat and round shape of the object by being much darker than the sky behind it. the most interesting thing about this particular object was the way it was moving - first of all, when realising the object was disc-shaped, we understood that the lowest part of it actually was no higher than 2-3 meters from the top of the hill it was hovering above. that's because the position of the disc was not horizontal, as in most cases, but it was vertical according to the ground. the most amazing part about it was that while moving horizontally over the hill, the object was slowly rotating having it's center being the center of the rotation, and it wasn't rotating in one specific direction only, but it was changing the direction constantly.\r\n\r\nthis was the time when we decided we should try and make contact. i took the flashlight and started flashing towards the large disc. it completely stopped moving for more than a minute, hanging over the hill. then, it just\r\ncontinued hovering, and not more than 2 minutes later, something flickering in the top of my eyesight caught my attention. it was a small white light looking almost like a star, but it continued getting brighter and brighter. the light was constant, not flashing, only slowly getting brighter and larger and then again to its original state. also, from time to time every 10-15 seconds it vibrated very strangely - it rapidly moved from left to right for a tiny fraction of the second. the distance between the most left and most right points of its movement when it vibrated was around 4-5 centimeters in my eyesight, so, taking in consideration it was away from us for some distance (although we can't be exact as only a light was visible and no obvious body of a craft) it moved amazingly rapidly... and this is the only object we managed to get on photo - both me and my friend only had telephones with weak cameras and only because of its brightness did it came visible on the photo, unlike the other dimmer lights in the sky.\r\n\r\na little bit later, we saw a second easily distinguishable in shape and design object. first, it appeared as a small, pale dot, that was right above the disc shaped. my assumption is that it was at least a kilometer above the disc. it was really strange, as this pale red dot copied perfectly the movement of the disc on the horizontal, it seemed as if it was one whole object. it continued doing so for about 10 minutes, when it suddenly stopped (while the disc just continued whatever it was doing over the hill), hung in the night sky for some seconds, and then started moving. it flew directly west, meaning it actually passed right in front of us, not more than 200 meters away, at about 45 degrees according to our point of view just to disappear in the distance. as it passed, we could very well see that it was a flat triangular shape, with a bright white light at its center, and three red lights in the angles. again, it wasn't as typical sightings describe these as horizontally positioned, this one was vertical and was flying in horizontal direction meaning it had no problem at all with the forces of air resistance. the greatest thing about this object is that we could really clearly see a very specific characteristic about its way of movement - on equal intervals (i measured them to be around 5 seconds) the triangle simply rotated on 90 degrees around its center, changing the positions only of its angles, as the center light being stationary, and this rotation occured just in the matter of tenth of a second, continuesly, as the object was flying away from us until it disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe last object that was showing specific characteristics and was visible enough to make out details, was at almost our altitude. it appeared at around 4:00-4:30. it looked like a disc again, but we couldn't make out a body of the craft, so we're not completely sure. what we could see were 5 lights (not separate, definately connected to each other making one whole object). they were one next to another, and made the object appear as horizontally positioned. what was kind of scary was that it was hovering right above the hotels i mentioned in the beginning, but we didn't see something more than that.\r\n\r\nit all ended at around 5:30 am in the morning, when out of nowhere, clouds appeared and again covered everything. we went in the tent and at that time with the fog outside, although we were very scared, we somehow fell asleep. we slept until 7 o'clock, and when we got up, there was no sign of the objects.\r\n\r\nnone of the objects produced any kind of sound. completely silent! neither me, nor my friend felt anything strange during the sighting, except for the adreanaline rush the first 2-3 hours, we wanting so much to communicate with them, shouting from time to time in excitement, yet baffled what on earth were these things, considering and discussing the possibility they were man-made, what they were doing there etc. after we calmed down little by little, we started thinking rationally, and i personally got scared because i didn't know what their intentions were, and i trully felt the harsh reality of me and my friend being all alone there in the mountain, in front of our tent surrounded by tens of these lights. a smashing feeling, that is, of being so ridiculously small and defenseless.\r\non 11th of august in the morning when we woke up, everything has changed, i was so stressed from the experience that i didn't want to talk about it for at least a week. i only told the people closest to me with very little detail, at first. we didn't even feel an urge to go to the hill the disc shaped object was hovering above to see if there were any signs left. all i was thinking about is how i was going to get home and not go outside for awhile.\r\n\r\nalso, another important detail is that the whole mountain was echoing of shepperd dogs barking.\r\n\r\ndon't get me wrong, i've been wondering about ufos and et life for some time, much before this event happened. i was an enthusiast who up to that point had no personal experience on the topic, only observations and theories. and being as open-minded as i consider myself to be, i have no idea why this has stressed me so much, all i know that my view of everything has become completely different since then. it took me 2 months to fully overcome the stress from the event and to gather will to sit down and make this story reach other people. also, since then, i haven't felt any need to convince anyone who has heard and not believed this story and i still don't. from what i saw i simply believe we're not that far from the moment this phenomenon will become publically acknowledged by everyone. something i think is important as well - after a week passed after the event and i started doing research, i found out that every fifth citizen of troyan claims to have seen such lights in the distance towards the peaks of the mountain.\r\n\r\nnote regarding the photos - i'm uploading three photos, two are originals and the third is the one of the two photos but after some enhancing a friend of mine did on it. bear in mind that this is a photo taken by a phone camera towards the night sky - it was new moon and the whole milky way was visible, and yet no stars appeared on the original photo, well, not until it was edited and brightened. the reason for me to say this is to take in consideration that fact, because it will help when trying to find out how much brighter the object was in the sky than the stars. as for the reddish areas that appear on the enhanced photo, some of these are most likely camera artifacts, and the small dots of light are showing exactly how the phone camera managed to photograph the stars in the night sky in comparison to the bright object.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

horizon and because of what just happened to him, he called me. he had been driving north back to the dallas area and was just south of corsicana on i-45 when he observed a huge object in the sky

have time to take it all in, i see for myself; three glowing lights hovering/flying in unison.\r\n\r\ntoward the western sky is where i saw it, it appeared to be flying west\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a squad of fighter jets, because we live close to fort bliss, and that's commonplace around here, but soon my doubts were silenced when i saw the three lights starting to hover around a central point. i ran inside, to get my mom to come outside and see for herself, when i came back outside it had moved further into the horizon, and a fourth light had appeared above the triangle of lights in the center, forming a pyramid-like structure, and i had to climb onto my dad's unused car. i urged my parents to do the same so we could see it as well. we just stood there starting at it, it continued to move slowly to the west, constantly rotating as it moved.\r\n\r\nthat was when my dad said he wished we had a camera, so i quickly jumped off the car and ran inside to grab my digital

we set it up, he climbed up first, and i followed, but when we got up there, it was gone. no trace of it was left, it just disappeared from the sky. it couldn't have flown further away, because at the speed it was already going, it would have been in our view for another 10-20 minutes. with it still fresh in my mind, i decided to sketch what i saw to the best of my ability, i went back inside and

my field of view is 9 o'clock on my left and 4 o'clock on my right, it was approximately at 11 o'clock. seamed bigger and brighter than your regular stars. when i see things in the sky that i'm not to sure of, i try to look at it and a inert object (the white frame of my door in this case) and stay still, to determine if it's moving or not. my conclusion at that time: i'm looking at a ufo slowly moving north (toward 4 o'clock). \r\n\r\na bit exited about this, i get up, open my door and take my head a bit outside to see the stars i normally see at this hour are there. everything seams to be in place. so after i opened the door, look at the sky and look back at the object and i see that it's still bright but slowly dimming and accelerating. no erratic movement up and down, it's simply staying at the same altitude and traveling in a linear fashion toward north. i didn't get the feeling it was getting closer or farther of me. at the moment the light dimmed to about half of the initial size, i start to see a flashing light behind it. it seamed like the initial light was the headlight of the ufo and this new flashing light was the tail light. the head light had the same initial color (less brighter) and the tail light was white. the tail light blinked a bit like a normal airplane, but the frequency was a bit wrong. i couldn't make out any solid in between the lights \r\n\r\nthis flashing tail light really confused me. i said, at that time, to my buddy: \"it's maybe a airplane\" and he's like \"yeah your right you were overreacting at first, it's a plane\"... of course he was skeptical. i could say that the rest of the sighting was it simply going is way, accelerating and still dimming its light (like if it was going through a cloud, but there's no cloud) until i lost sight of it behind a building. the final position of the object was about 10 o'clock, using the clock system i described earlier. the overall speed of this ufo was a bit slower than airplane at first, but was definitely faster than a conventional airplane at the end. \r\n\r\nafter the sighting, i said to my buddy: \"yeah maybe it's a top secret military airplane, but i never saw a airplane with headlights this bright\"... now, when i think about it, there's no ambiguity, it was a ufo (extraterrestrial or not).\r\n\r\nthis sighting hasn't surprised me. disclosure is near. this isn't my first encounter with ufo, but it's my first sighting report to mufon. why bother submitting it? because i think that october 13 2010 was a special day.

deck, when i glimps up onto the sky i noticed a star-like object moving from east to south west in an approximately 45 degree angle. as this object moved it was slowing down and a small tail started to form. it came so low that the object looked bigger as it was decending. at this point i said to my wife \"look honey is a shooting star\"; when she looked up she said honey shooting stars fall thats going up. at this point i looked up along with my wife and observed how the shooting star look alike object had no more the meteor look alike tail, instead it was a big ball of white light moving upward back into space. the event took approximately 10 to 12 seconds. i was stunt when i saw this event but i was even more concenrned when i heard 2 military jets motors been scrambled. i waited for a few more seconds and whent and picked up from my room a pair of 50x100 binaculars and followed the fly by area that the f-18 flew, and for my surprise they climbed from the east toward

ago.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the only sounds i could hear came from the compressor station down the road. at first sight, i would estimate the size of them to be about the size of a small baby pea, although i have no idea how far away from me they were. they were gliding slowly, like they were in no hurry, to the west of me. they were heading in a westerly direction. there are trees all around where i live and i had to move a few times to keep them from becoming obscured by the branches in the taller trees. i watched them as they continued to get smaller and farther away, then i ran inside to email my friend who saw one a few days ago. i would have called her but its late and i know her husband has to work in the morning and didnt want to wake him. she lives 80 miles west of me and they are headed right for her! \r\ni'm guessing she is already in bed, too, as if she were up and on the computer, my phone would have rung by now.\r\n\r\nafter sending my initial report, i went back outside to see if i might get to see anything else. \r\nthe only thing i saw this time was a plane flying in the exact same direction as the 2 orange objects. i watched the plane until it went out of sight. the plane was much higher in the sky than the 2 orange \"orbs\" as it never even got near the tops of the trees and i didnt have to move to keep sight of it. i would say that the plane was flying faster than the 2 objects i saw because it flew out of my range of vision faster than the the the 2 \"orbs\" did.","distance":"Over One

equalization headquarters in downtown sacramento on 5th and n streets on a cigarette break when i first witnessed the objects. it was about 3:20pm when i noticed it, not long after i got outside to smoke. i remember hearing about the manhattan ufo sightings from the day before, and as someone who is curious about the ufo phenomena i decided to look up into the sky. the object looked like a white/orange star hovering next to the wells fargo center building across the street on n street, the tallest building in sacramento. it appeared to hover there, like a star would, but then i noticed that it was moving, very, very slowly down as if towards the horizon. it wasnt a star because it didnt move from east to west. it was to the north-west, slightly more west. at first i didn't know what it was, though i immediately assumed that it was not an airplane. there were no contrails, not exhaust, and was small enough that i it was a plane i would definitely see contrails. it moved too slow to be a high elevation plane. i am very familiar with aircraft. i build scale model airplanes and am an amature aircraft identifier. i use a jane's modern aircraft identification, military and civil book. it was unlike any aircraft. simply like a star. it ever so slightly moved, i noticed, straight down as if towards the horizon, like an aircraft moving away from you. there were very thin, slightly puffy clouds out that moved to the east. it began to slowly move into the path of one and i thought i would lose it behind the cloud. however, once it crossed the cloud's path i could still see it clearly. i then assumed it was below the clouds. i watched to for several more minutes when it came into the path of a tree. i walked a bit down the block to a clearing and saw the object there with another, exactly like it; a white/orange star. the second object was below it an slightly to the left. the two objects did not move at this time. they hovered there for a moment. then, they began to move together towards the sky, as if moving straight up, still very, very slowly, as if they were hovering. i asked some other boe employees if they could see it, but they all ignored me except for a young lady who said she couldn't see it though i pointed right at it. she thought i was crazy. i then noticed that i was out there for 20 minutes, which is over the 15 minutes allotted for my break. i didn't want to go back upstairs, partly because i was fascinated, and because my office faces the south. i was so angry with myself for leaving my iphone upstairs at my desk, because i wanted to take a picture of it. i came back downstairs about 45 minutes later and tried to find them but the objects were gone. after work i immediately rode my bike to the sacramento river levee where there is a clear, 360 degree view of the sky, but could not see anything but planes taking off and landing at the airport and some birds. when i came home i called the local news channel, kcra 3 news and asked if anyone had reported a ufo sighting. they told me no and told me they were not interested in a ufo story. during and after the event, i felt a strong sence of fear, joy, confusion and curiosity. mostly confusion and fear. my muscles were shaking and could not get the thought of the objects out of my head. i was not very productive the next hour and a half at work. i still have feelings of fear now and chills go down my spine thinking about it. curiously, i had a dream about seeing a ufo the night before, and when i woke up i noticed that my watch, which is analogue and tells you the day and the date was incorrect. i compulsively check my watch, and it did read thursday, but instead of the 14th it read the 15th. it read wednesday the 13th the day before. i don't know if it is a sign of something or it was just some kind of funky mix up with my watch and coincidence i dreamt about a ufo. i am still frightened and confused and have this strange compulsion to look up onto the sky to the north-west. i cannot explain what it was, or why no one else noticed it. it was so clearly visible. it was real.","distance":"Over One
