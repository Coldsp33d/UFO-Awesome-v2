was about 10 pm on maryland's eastern shore. i was finished working for the evening and went out to my truck. it is exceptionally dark in this part of the country and even more so as i do not recall a moon last night. so there was an bright star which at first seemed stationary. it was far too bright to be anything i've ever seen in the sky, so i went in to get my binoculars. by the time i got it in sight i discovered it was moving, but rather slowly.  it passed low, probably 1000 feet, directly above me.  it was a large triangle with no tail red lights on one side green on the other, in the rear. the front had a huge spotlight that seemed to be able to shine down on the land. it was a warm light. it was relatively quiet for how close it was.  it sounded mostly like wind sheer. then it was out of sight. then i looked back in the direction i had originally seen it and i noticed a red light orbiting, almost dancing around, much higher but in the same general part of the sky. through the binoculars the second craft seemed oval or sphere shaped with rows of pulsing lights, blue, green and red. then i saw the first object headed back in the vicinity of the second object so that they were both in view if the binoculars.  the triangle craft passed the hovering craft.  the hovering craft continued to nimble around almost as showing off.  this was no helicopter. i assumed it was a training exercise on some new technology with nasa or something. i should have watched longer but was tired so went home to sleep.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25895,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0478249,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10142010-0027","longitude":-76.6344012,"occurred":1286953200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,

playground when i had this impulse to look up.  when i looked up and to the se, i saw what appeared to be an object made up of six connected reflective spheres in a molecular type configuration.  the object appeared to be roughly 40 feet in diameter and was tumbling while travelling to the west. it was a nice smooth movement from east to west.  \r\n     i was still on the swings while watching the object move.  i yelled to my wife to look in that direction to see it, but she didn't see anything. there was another parent there with their child and neither of them saw it either.  i was staring at it for about 30 seconds while i was on the swing with my daughter. there was no sound of any air traffic. i stopped so i could point it out easier for them, but when i stopped and took my eyes off of it for 3-4 seconds, it was gone.  their wasn't anything in the way to obscure it and its direction of travel didn't have a place for it to be hidden.  it was just gone.  \r\n     i was frustrated since no one else saw it and i know i did.  we then stayed at the park for another 5 or so minutes and decided to head home to the south.  while riding our bikes home we heard a low flying helicopter and looked towards the east south east and saw a green military helicopter in the exact same area doing a hard bank with its skids towards us.  it went down behind the trees towards the east south east in a quick manner.  the bank was so tight that all we saw were the panels on the bottom of the heli.  we have never seen one of these helicopters this low and in a bank in the metro area. \r\n     i haven't thought much of the event since, but last night when i saw the abc news affiliate in nyc had filmed objects over the city, one of the videos shows the exact same object i saw.  i was completely floored when i saw the object in ny.  i woke up my wife and showed her the video of the object.  without \"leading the witness\", i asked her what the object looked like.  she said, \"it looks just like the object you described a few weeks ago at the playground\".  i have watched the video many times now and i am convinced it is the same thing i saw. the abc footage is on youtube at

even more unusual that they initially were not flying fast.  they were flying toward the west.  when i got onto shawnee mission parkway heading west, there was a bright \"sphere\" in the west that

was not moving in an easterly direction because it did not get any closer.  i kept trying to figure out what it was and to rationalize what it might have been.  my thoughts were all over the place

noticed what i at that moment thought was a plane or a helicopter, judging by the lights as it was dark out. we see several types of aircraft in the area because of the local air force base and airport as well as helicopters from the local hospital. i was having a conversation with my son and every few seconds looked back up at the lights, after several times, i decided this had to be a helicopter heading south(my same direction)toward the hospital and it wasn't moving fast away from me. at the end of the road i have to make a left, go down through a hollow and make a right onto belmont ave. heading south again. just after we got onto belmont ave. i looked back up and realized this thing is not moving because i'm gaining ground on it. i asked my son to look at this thing out the side window. neither one of us could figure out what this was as we drove up to it. i slowed down and we drove under this thing hovering in the air, both looking out the side windows. my best guess is that this object was 150-200' off the ground and at that height was about the size of a bus. it was cigar/blimp shapped, had a red \r\nflashing light at one end and a blue flashing light on the other, which up to this point seemed like normal aircraft lights to me but this thing had 3 square bright white lights through the center of it. when we were driving under it i couldn't decide if they where white lights or windows lit from the inside, so i asked my son, and he thought windows. we agreed with each other this thing was dark gray or black in color as we could just barely make out its shape against the dark sky but it seemed to be made of metal and we didn't notice any sound coming from it.\r\nthe lights from the business signs lit it up a little.\r\nthis thing was hovering in the same area for several minutes as i drove up to it and belmont ave. had traffic on it as well as rt.80, which crosses over belmont right where this thing was so someone else had to see it. \r\nthe strangest part of this is after we had gone under this thing going about 25 mph. i looked for a place to pull off the road, we traveled about 20 yards and pulled into a parking lot, we both leaned over to look at it through the passenger side windows and it was gone. \r\ni live just down the road from were this happened so we flew home, got out of the car and scanned the sky for a few minutes again and saw nothing. we went into our house and told my wife what we had just seen and went back outside. my son and i stood facing north scanning the sky and comparing what we noticed about this object and he turned my attention to a cluster of bright lights in the distance to the north. they looked a lot like the lights i believed to be an aircraft earlier. i got out my cell phone and called my dad because they seemed to be in the area of his house, the lights were brite enough that he would definatly see them. i told him to go outside and look north in the sky for these lights, they seemed to be hovering in one spot. he put the phone down and as we waited for him to come back the lights descended as if they were landing, straight down slowly, till they disappeard behind rt 80. he came back and said he saw nothing so they must have been south of him, so in between our houses. \r\nmy neibors noticed us and asked what we were doing so we told them the story and we all stood out in the street looking around and noticed there was a road crew working up on rt80 so its possible that they saw this thing or things if the second can be considered out of the ordinary.\r\nafter talking with the neibors about it for a few minutes i decided to check the time and it was 9:55pm.\r\nwe also noticed a few minutes later that there were quite a few planes in the air to the north, in the direction of the air base and they seemed to be circling the area north of rt 80 flying low.\r\ni had my son draw a sketch of what he saw and i drew one of what i saw.","distance":"101-500

cigarette in the backyard of my house in clovis, and began to gaze up, i noticed a star-like object in the sky as i looked to the south east. it was flashing many different colors. (red, green, blue, purple, white) not only was it flashing colors, but it was pulsing, dimmer, brigter, dimmer, really bright, dimmer etc. at this point i knew i was definately not looking at a star or any type of airplane or helicopter. then i saw it do something i will never forget, it moved! it didn't just move it zig zaged down, and then shot up at a fairly rapid pace. i don't know of any man made aircraft which can hover, stop, and instantly change direction. it also could go from a very high rate of speed to a complete stand still. when i got over the intial shock, i ran inside and woke up my roommate *(name deleted--cms/sg). i was so excited i yelled and shook him rather hard. when he woke up he was terrified and upset that i woke him up so abruptly when he had school early in the morning. after he heard what i was yelling at him we both ran back out in the backyard. he even noticed the object moving and changing color without his glasses and turned right back around to run in and get them and a pair of binoculars. i stayed to keep an eye on it and he came running back out and was even more shocked when he saw it with his glasses. we both took turns using the binoculars for about 45 minutes and that's when we spotted the second one. it was more to the east than the first one we noticed. it was doing the exact same thing; pulsing, changing color, and making very erratic movements. however, this object seemed to be higher up. at about this time i had *(name deleted--cms/sg) go get the fresno air terminal security phone number. i called and spoke with a young man named **(name deleted--cms/sg) who said he could't get outside to see but he would phone the tower. the two officers in the tower did admit they had seen some strange blue/green lights, but they did not think they were threatening so they didn't investigate further. *(name deleted--cms/sg) had to go to bed because he had school so early. i continued to watch as i proceeded to call anyone and everyone of my friends and family to try and wake them up so they could see. unfortunately, nobody woke up and my webcam wasn't good enough to see anything on. i continued to watch for another hour then called fox 26 newsroom at 3:45 or 4am and spoke with a young lady. i was hoping they would have a camera handy, they did not. (i found that hilarious) about this time i noticed something even more shocking, i could see many more that were farther away (not higher). in total, i counted at least 9 or 10 different objects. the next day i contacted mufon and learned a local police officer had reported seeing the same thing! i felt so validated when i heard that, and that made up for all the crazy looks i'm gonna get telling this story. this was the most incredible night of my life, and i will definately never ever forget it. i know some people i talked to last night and today might not have completely believed me, but both (name deleted--cms/dr) and i know what we saw and we will tell anyone who will listen! we have a video camera tonight so bring it on!

just about level with the star that marks orions right heel. i then noticed a bright star in the orion constellation. when i looked i saw a bright orange-yellow star just below the center star on the

australia about half an hours drive west of the city of newcastle having a drink with friends at a hotel in the outdoor drining area that overlooked vineyards to the north with friends. \r\n\r\nabout 9.50pm we notcie that ohtrher people were staring at a light up in the sky above the vineyards.\r\n\r\nthe object objecting in the sky was a blue to white light and also seemed to have smaller lights around it. we watched it for maybe 5 minutes then i went down to the car and got my camera out.  i filmed it in the video mode on my camera which was lumix tz10 for about 30 seconds, then stopped because it was hard to film becasue it was off in the distance above the vineyard and when i zoomed in it was hard to hold may hand steady so it was pretty shaky. so i stopped filming video to try and take some still photos to get a better picture of it. a minute or so later it had shot off really fast up into the sky. t was seen by about 30 or 40 people who were there out teh front of the hotel. i i never got to film it shooting off because i switched from filming video to taking photographs on my camera then it was gone. i have attached the best photo i took.\r\n\r\nbut it looks like someone elsee who was there got some video of the same ufo and caught it shooting off fast and has put it on youtube. it's hard to see but have a look at\r\n\r\n*(link moved to additional evidence section

after having my usual hair cut at supercuts.\r\nwas driving on the highway at about 45miles/hr.I see this object the size of a sesna , still in the air , across the highway , in the wooded area.\r\ni see it from some distance so i slow my vehicle to take a look and might be at a speed of 20miles/hr.\r\nmy vehicle dont have tinted glasses. so i was observing the features of the object in great detail. it did not occur to me that it may be a ufo .\r\nbut i looked at the object in great detail. it was not a chopper.\r\nthen i thought it may be a fighter jet standing still in air..But as i drove past it, i find the shape to be amusing. it has features extending below its body like a stand ,several of them.And there were lights around them.\r\ni am certain that it was not a fighter jet due to its peculiar shape.\r\nafter i passed this object, i immediately realized it may be a ufo.\r\ni took a u turn at the next signal. 15 seconds might have elapsed .\r\ni took u turn and am back on the highway, but this object was not to be seen. i even had my cell ph camera turned on to capture any unusual sightings. \r\nthen i turned back at next signal to get back home and passed this section of the road . there was nothing significant. but could see some sparks like flashes , very faint ones. just like electric sparks. but that was it\r\nafter i got home i spoke with my friend and sister about this.\r\ni tried to convince myself that it is not a ufo.\r\nbut having seen this object in such great detail, makes me feel it is not a usual flying object . \r\nthe area behind the highway is some what wooded. and there is no way a human operated vehicle could fly or stay still in air at such a low elevation\r\nthe elevation being 80% the height of a street light.\r\n\r\nyou may contact me on my email provided. but i dont think there is any traceable evidence.\r\nbut i would be curious to see if anybody has reported such sighting on same night. and btw this area is adjacent to few homes so it is very possible that someone living in those houses might have seen something and just ignored the fact\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n*(wit's name
