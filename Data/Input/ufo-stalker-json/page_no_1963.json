called my wife who was also outside and she also said it looked weird, unlike any jets that we see passing over and to the south of us each day. we watched for about another 30-45 seconds until it simply faded away. i continued sitting there and watching in the same general direction and another one as bright as the first one was coming from the west to east, crossed under the sun and shortly (probably 10 seconds) after crossing the sun it too faded. we have lived in this house for 24 years and observed many aircraft and as stated above, a main east west corridor is directly to the south and we often watch jets as we sit on the back porch, these two objects just seem so high i thought maybe it was the space station but checking online it does not appear to be crossing this area and

report this.  it was 1977 at dusk, around 7 pm, during the summer. i was walking my dog on a leash and i was barefoot and wearing a summer teeshirt and shorts. i was 15 yrs old at the time.  this was in york, pa in springettsbury township.  i was walking on a parallel street to s. marshall street. on my left were houses, on my left a church and then the main highway.  i happened to glance up at the sky at a distance and i saw a faint object. as it very quickly flew towards me it got larger and larger. then it was hovering right along side me just above the church parking lot.  it was mammoth size. it was a silver disc shape. there was a dome at the top and then in the middle were red blinking lights circling around the disc. then below the red lights was the silver disc part that came out. i noticed a hmmming noise and i looked down at my schnauzer and he was looking up at it with his ears perked back. that's how i knew i wasn't imagining it. he was hearing the humming noise too. the humming noise and the red lights going around the disc were the most unusual features about it. i couldn't figure out why it was just hovering in that spot. after about 5 minutes, it then went up quickly about 100 feet and then it started going back towards the location from where it came from. as it flew away it got faster and faster to the point where it looked like it was dissipating. planes never look like they're disintegrating from going to fast. that was my experience.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

home sick from school today so my whole family was just sitting together in the living room watching tv and we kept hearing large helicopters outside.  we had a twin rotor military helicopter fly over our house at least seven times in an hour.  we do live very close to cak, but it's 10/13 so i decided to go outside and start taking pictures.  the helicopter flew over only once while i was out there and i took a video of it on my cell phone...That was the last time i saw it at 3:01 p.M.\r\ni took the photo with the unexplained object at 3:47 p.M.  -- there were no helicopters in the sky at that time. choppers are noisy, my husband and i would have noticed helicopter noise. it was quiet, only the two of us talking to each other.\r\n\r\nwe were looking at the jets in the distance, ****nick noted how they were moving across the sky faster than normal commercial jets, so i snapped a few pictures.  at the time ****nick and i were in the back yard alone.  we heard no strange noise, we saw nothing out of the ordinary.  it was only after we were looking at the pics on the camera that we saw the object.  at first i thought it was dirt on the lcd screen so i went to the next pic and the spot disappeared.  i went back to the last picture and the spot was back, so i put the memory card in my lap top and zoomed in.  the dark object on the right of photo dscf1956 is clearly not a bird or a plane or a helicopter. i honestly do not know what it is and i can't figure it out, which is why i am making this mufon report.\r\n\r\ni also snapped some pictures of a normal helicopter flying over hours later, and it does not look at all like the object i captured that i can't explain. \r\n\r\ni don't want to jump to a wild conclusion.  i was admittedly out in my back yard purposely looking for something out of the ordinary.  i honestly never expected to find it though.  and maybe it really is just wishful thinking.  i'm trying to be skeptical about this.  i don't know what it could be in the picture with the unidentified flying object.\r\ni didn't even notice anything out of place when i took the picture, which is what totally boggles my mind.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":25860,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9528998,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10132010-0012","longitude":-81.4778114,"occurred":1287010020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

quads and laid on my back with my leg under me. as i stared up, i noticed how clear the sky was, and i could see the moon perfectly. then, as my eyes scanned the sky, i noticed an object that i jokingly pointed out to my friends as \"a russian spy-plane!\"\r\n\r\nas i stared at this strange aircraft, i noticed that it was extremely high, and was white in color (against the blue sky), with the shape of a \"z\". the closest shape above would be compared to a boomerang, but one side of the the object was facing the opposite direction of another point, giving the object a \"z\"-like appearance. it was common knowledge that no regular aircraft took that shape or could fly at such a high altitude, moving so unbearably slow across the sky away from the moon (moving southwest). also, the object made absolutely no audible noise, nor did it emit any type of visible exhaust. we discussed what it could be, while staring at this incredibly high, white, object. right before our eyes, it began emitting a white light out of the western-most side of the object. the light did not flash, blink, or flicker; it was a constant white beam, but it was not bright, and was still barely noticeable.\r\n\r\nafter about 3 minutes of staring at this object, it had vanished right before our eyes. my reactional thought process was \"there is no way...That could not have been a u.F.O.\", as i tried to think of logical explanations for the sudden complete disappearance of this object, in the cloudless sky. i truly believe, after thinking about it all night, that this must have been a u.F.O.... no aircraft known to man would hover at such a high altitude, moving incredibly slowly, and vanish

around me, but one by one, they would quiet and just stare.  the crowd got larger.  a man with a camera started to take photos.  when he zoomed in, they seemed to be yellow in flat but rounded shape.

no particular flight pattern.  they were going in strange directions.  they would fade, i'm assuming because they were getting higher and higher and too small to see.  they looked like flying

it definitely was not a plane as no blinking lights usually seen when a plane is ascending or decending, no dark part as you would see with a plane - it was solid white bright light.  it appeared to be elongated, but could have been the edge of a disc as seen from my vantage point.  it was moving in a northern direction and seemed to be slightly decending.  there is no airport in the direction the object was moving.  i watched the object until it was out of sight. i have no photos.\r\n\r\nit was dusk, temperature about 75 degrees, no wind or moisture.  it was a clear day.\r\n\r\ni can't

just pulled up at my home in a area of cumberland county tn called homestead.  as soon as i exited the truck i leaned with my arms on the bed of the truck an looked to my left in a area that's a long valley between sum good sized mountains and my mouth absolutely hit the ground. i could not take my eyes off what i saw.  my girlfriend asked me what was i lookin at and i couldn't even respond all i could do was point. she looked an said holy $%!*  is that what i think it is ? i still couldn't answer. only laugh in disbelief.  we were staring at three rectangular verticle lights that were flashing a quick red blue green an everyso often white. i can judge the distance fairly easily maybe a 1/4 mile at the most.  these lights would start into a certain sequence flashing. there was no noise no balloon no nothing. these lights started turning from left to right rockin like it was on a center. it was maybe 75 ft off the ground and slowly  going north towards crab orchard. by this time it had started well into dusk and it started slowly upward. by this time some stars started showing an this thing became like a pulsar star. flickering to match the stars. now by this time we were histerical as both of us could not believe what we had just saw.  this thing stayed. now this is where it gets even more exciting. we by all means were so curious as to what this thing was going to do that we could not take our eyes off it.  this thing got really bright started flashing red blue green with each rectangular light designated to a certain color an i be damn if here floated another one. they both flashed at the same time as to signal or communicate to one another. by this time its around 11 pm. after a few mins it did the same thing. it became like a star. well after 30 mins these things started flashing again and damn if they didn't slowly shift locations went approximately 1/4 mile and flashed again an stopped. became like a star once again. well 15 mins go by they started signaling again. here comes a third one from the west. does the same thing flashes then becomes like a star. this goes on for at least an hour. they would b star like then all of a sudden the flashing an then slowly change location. over the next 4 hours 5 more come in. by this time we were so histerical we didn't know what the hell we were seeing. they would all flash together an slowly change location. well now its around 430 maybe 5 am. i'm watching 9 of these things making sure i know which \"stars\" to watch. its slowly becoming dayliight. these things started up with the flashin an the one that was over homestead started decending to the ground an disapeared below the tree line. i was hysterical my girlfriend was freakin the hell out as was i. i could not believe what we were watching. so maybe 15 mins go by an once again the flashing then slowly the one that decended came back up an they all started to move. they only moved a little distance and became still. the strangest part was they faded like the stars do when morning comes. when the daylight came they faded away unnoticed. i had to drive my girlfriend to her parents house cuz she was in tears. i still cannot believe what we saw. i had to tell this. i've had this on my mind for a long time ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

on the very edge-cars would come to the end of a parking rd & they turned right 50 yards or less from my camp site-keeping me up most of the night. i kinda gave up & exited my tent for a late night snack, hoping it would help me finally sleep. it was quite dark there was no one in my area awake (no fires nor lights on) in the family section behind me-the neighboring camp site had left the tiki torch on closest to my site. i was sitting in my fold out chair when a beautiful glowing orange orb came towards the tree line near me- the trees were tall ne tx pines. i may have been looking toward the noisy campsites or gazing to see if it was another car coming towards me/my site, i sort of thought the glow of their fire was enhancing brighter then thought some sort of light was beamed @ me as if from a car --there were none for approx 5 min. at 1st it appeared that it was coming @ me but didn't make any quick turns that were obvious to me it just glided with ease. almost unapparent to the eye it lined up with trees & made a slight degree shift. the orb traveled the length of the adjoining field on the other side of the trees from me. the height was 3-5 ft from the tops of the trees, floating in a perfect line. i followed its movements until it was gone from my sight i looked a second time rechecking if it were still there-the trees became thicker @ the point of disappearance. i imagined that no one from the revel fires saw it - they were screaming, shouting, drumming, dancing & well partying a lot! if they did i would guess they were too wasted to be sure they saw anything.  i got really spooked after being in complete awe just seconds before. realizing the torch was on near me i figured \"it(ufo)\" saw me. i quickly moved into my tent. i told my sleeping partner of the situation & she told me, \"they were not interested in me-they were there for the other camp area(or something that imparted/reflected that notion)\" this was almost comforting for i had that sense prior to waking her. approx 15 min after, to max 2 hrs-i saw lights glowing orange not red & @ another point around then was white lights near tent. i was kinda freaked out & was worried it was back & i was trying to sleep so much it all became a blurr once in the tent. \r\n  the orb was a brilliant perfect deep fiery orange- at the round edges/the points rounded away from me it had a shadowy quality or sort of slivery  dark element. warp effect yet remaining perfectly spherical- this shading was within the object. there was absolutely no sound emanating from the object or any where near me. the revel fires were approx 2 football fields away.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at ann morrison park with my 8 year old son and a family friend of ours playing frisbee golf.  as we finished one of the holes and began to walk our family friend asked me what that was in the sky.  i saw something in the sky just kind of hovering there.  \r\n   i am a new resident to boise and my wife who lived here in the past always asks me if i have seen any hot air balloons since we moved here.  when i first saw the object i assumed that is what it was, a hot air balloon.  but then, as i looked more closely i saw that what i was looking at was not a balloon.  it was angled on all sides.  i noticed shadows on the side of it being cast by the setting sun.  i immediately began to walk towards the object.  i noticed as soon as i started walking that whatever this was, wasn't far away at all.  with every step i could see that i was getting closer to it.  when i was, what i approximate to be 40 yards from the object, which also in my approximation was 200' off the ground, i stopped and watched.  it was shifting what appeared to be just a few feet from side to side.  not a rocking motion, but a deliberate shift with a pause and sometimes up to a minute in between shifts.  it would also on some occasions move quickly from one side to the other.  there was absolutely no vertical movement whatsoever.  also, the object made precise rotating movements.  the only way that i can compare it to something that most people are familiar with is the way that gears 'click' in a clock.  only the sudden movements would go a 'click' or two in one direction and then one 'click' back.  followed by, for example, 3 right-1 left, etc.  i stood (40 yards approx. away) for 20 or so minutes watching and trying to rationally to figure out what this thing was.  i worked in the aviation field for 11 years before moving to boise and i am very familiar with airframes and propulsion systems.  the only thing that man has in the air that could even remotely resemble this object would be a satellite and even that bears very little resemblance to this object.  it was pewter in color with a bit of a shine on it.  there were black markings on the object.  there were also two circular patterns (?) on either side of it.  there was no sound.  \r\n   after the 20 minutes or so had passed, i started walking towards the object with my son and friend.  we continued slowly until we were standing directly underneath it.  we stood there for roughly 5 minutes.  while standing there, the object made a split second 360 degree rotation.  this happened from a still position and immediately following the rotation, was dead still again.  we continued on the path we were on walking straight from the spot we were originally watching from until we were 20 yards or so behind it.  the craft wasn���t symmetric on all sides.  the sides of the craft seemed to be the same, but what i refer to as the ���front and back��� of the craft are only relative to what it seemed to be.  the ���front and back��� of the craft were not the same.  it had different angles on these sides.  we then slowly proceeded around the object, on the west facing side, keeping our 20 yard distance, until we were at our original vantage point approximately 20 yards in front (where we stood for 20 minutes upon first approaching the object).  \r\n   that is when things started to get creepy.  before my eyes, i saw an orangish/white light come on the bottom of the object.  as i am wondering what i am seeing, the craft seamlessly turned from this angled three dimensional shape into an oval, egg shape.  it still hadn���t moved and made no sounds.  my son and friend started to get scared so we began to walk away.  i kept my eyes on the object as we walked away and as we walked it changed again.  this time to a very slim boomerang shape with the rounded end facing skyward.  the time the object spent with the egg shape and boomerang shape was probably 60 seconds to 2 minutes.  when it changed to the boomerang shape we again stopped and watched as it began to ���flex and wobble���.  it still hadn���t moved since we first saw it.  at that point, approximately 30 seconds into wobbling it looked as if it disappeared into a cloud.  i thought that was odd since the sky was clear for the most part.  how did the object travel from 200��� off the ground and seem to enter a cloud and disappear without any obvious movement?  \r\n    if you���ll notice the date of the sighting and the date i am posting this, you���ll see some time has gone by since the sighting.  i have been researching what this could���ve been and it appears that what i saw was a ���probe���.  i am posting the crummy pictures that i was able to make with my cell phone.  zoom in and you can see that the entire time i was watching the object it appears, in the pictures at least, to nearly constantly change shape.  the light that appeared orangish/white looks red in the photos.  many other people witnessed the sighting with me at the park.  at no point during the sighting did i feel afraid.  the word that i would use to describe the way that i felt was ���awe���.  whatever this object was had technology that so far surpasses our own that it is indescribable.  it wasn���t until i got home and was able to sit and think about what i had seen that an eerie feeling set in.  \r\n    the object was first observed at approximately 7:20 in the afternoon on 9/26.  it disappeared into a cloud at approximately 8:00.  i even mapped the spot on google earth:  43���36���38n, 116���13���15w.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:40:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

driveway. one of my children came running in, and told me \"hurry you have to see this, there is something weird in the sky\". i walked out and looked east to see several (15-20) bright red lights in the sky which continued to rise higher with no specific pattern. they did not move as one object would. the lights did not create any specific shape, and seemed each light had its own movement. the highest point had a few red lights and the rest seemed to follow those at the top. i ran to get a camera and could only find my cell phone, which i was able to capture a photo at the end of this unusual phenomenon. it only shows two lights. the others were disappearing so quickly i was barely able to get a photo. my children and one of their friends were witnesses. a gentleman at the end of our street was also standing in the middle of the road looking up in the same direction and i can only assume he witnessed this as well. \r\ni was very excited after this and quickly went to a neighbors to see if they had seen it. they did not however their daughter claimed to have seen the last few. i then went to our other neighbors who is an officer to find out if any reports had come in. the officer called and stated that dispatch had several reports of odd lights in the sky. unfortunately when i tried to find the reports in the local police activity report, i was unable to find any specific report. he also had a friend contact a brother who is an air traffic controller, to verify there were no military exercises that evening. it was confirmed, there were none. we did see airplanes still flying around directly after. the lights were not blinking, they were solid and as bright as a star, there was only 1 star visible in that direction on this evening.\r\nduring the sighting i was in utter awe, and confused. i have never seen anything like this in my entire life and desperately want some answers. after the incident i have not been able to stop asking people if they saw it. i need clarification for myself and my children. this took place between 7:51-7:55 pm. i will upload the photo later as i need to get cable to upload it from my phone. i wanted to post

going to the mufon website to see if there were any reports on it as we talked. there weren't. my boss and i teased him gently, and he joined in the fun. he wasn't upset by us. he was curious about it that's all. we all talked about the story of the century and such, asked if anyone landed and got out, had he been drinking, you know, the normal b.S.Ing guys do, and then we all got back to work. about two or three nights later, \r\ni was asleep in bed when i was awakened by an extremely loud, sustained whooshing sound over my house.  it was not moving like perhaps a low flying jet from kirtland air force base with the after-burners engaged. it was not whomping and buzzing, like the blades of a circling helicopter, nor was it the sound of a helicopter hovering in stealth mode where the sound is suppressed. this was a sound loud enough to wake the dead! it was like the space shuttle was taking off right outside my window. in fact, i was surprised my wife and daughter weren't disturbed by it, even though they're very sound sleepers. as i look back on it now, i am surprised the dog wasn't awake and barking. it was so loud and steady, i was afraid to look out the windows or go outside to see what it was. i lay in bed too terrified to move. the sound continued for what must have been 10-30 minutes or more, and then suddenly decreased in volume and was gone. my first thought after it was over was that a factory nearby was releasing some kind of gas pressure, because it slowly settled to a slight hissing sound and was gone. looking back i remember there was no light outside, like the searchlight from a police copter. being a radio news reporter, i am familiar with those sights and sounds. this was something i've never heard before, or since. i talked with **(name deleted--cms/sg) by telephone today,(10-12-2010),  because it keeps nagging at me,\"what the hell was that!?\" he urged me to make a report, so here it is. if it was a factory, why haven't i

contrail which confused me. i wondered if it is possible to see a satelitte in the daytime because i have seen them at night and that was the way it appeared to be moving to me  i did not have time to

on computer reading about the world news on the cnn page lastnight around 11:30pm,when i decided to look out the front door which is beside the desk i was sitting at,and all of a sudden an eggshape fireball appeared in the treetops at low altitude and flew very fast from one end to the other,id say within 8 seconds or less.\r\nextremely fast object.This is the 4th night in a row that i have been seeing strange objects flying fast in the sky.A few nights ago i also seen a light so fast that left the rainbow colors in the dead of night \r\ndark red,purple,and i think a strange golden yellow were present,went so fast i was unable to see how many colors were actually in it..It also had 4 trails,not just one trail following behind that one.So four colors.Decided to report because it seems this is becoming an every night thing.The nights are colder now and the sky has been very clear here in cape breton,i have a very large view of the sky from my area.Very open and rural.Is it me or is something about to take place we don't know about?Because it is very busy up there i must say.\r\n\r\ni do not like reporting much because i reported a story on this website in the past,and the night after i posted an abduction story a black helicopter flew over the house at middle morning around 2:30 am, with a very bright red light attached to the end that did not blink.I heard the helicopter loud and clear because i was on this site reading other stories at the time.And it was defensibly military,and i live in canada remember not the us.I truly think this website is monitored in some way by some sort of agency,and i think that the black helicopter phenom may be  connected with stealth monitoring programs in some way or another..I don't really know,but just a warning.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25837,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.1449699,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10122010-0008","longitude":-60.185864,"occurred":1287037500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nova

estimate 10-15miles i'm not real good with distance. but i do know what we saw.In the time that i gave the bonoculars to my wife it went up at an angle into the cloud above. when she looked at the

to tend to the wedding party as they got out of the vehicle. at this point i saw something in the sky, it was south-west from my perspective. after making sure that everyone was ok and on their way for some photos, i went back and watched the object further.\r\n\r\nat first i thought the object might be a balloon or some sort of helicopter because it didn't move from where it was in the sky. as i watched it, i noticed that it didn't look like any aircraft i had seen, nor a balloon or kite. the thing that stood out to me about most was that it didn't move from its location in the sky at all. i watched it for about 10 minutes, photographing it two to three minutes after i first noticed it.\r\n\r\nthe object was fairly small in the sky, it didn't look like a huge craft. it was black, saucer shaped. it was at a good distance, so i couldn't make out any details, but the profile i saw reminded me of a woman's brimmed hat.\r\n\r\nas i watched it, i noticed, as i said earlier, it didn't move, at all. i felt amazement and disbelief as i was looking at this thing. i think i was the only person looking at it in the immediate area, no one else seemed to notice it. as i looked at it, the sun was to my right. getting in the shade of the trees made it easier to watch. i would walk away from time to time to see where the wedding party was. \r\n\r\nafter about ten minutes i got back into the car for a bit to rest my eyes. when i got out of the car after about five minutes, the object was gone.","distance":"Over One

something unusual now. as a rule, it's airplanes that use strobe lights so it it blinks, it's probably one of ours. i generally take a closer look if the light is constant regardless of direction or if it pulses slowly brighter/dimmer as it moves.\r\n\r\nlast night was one of the strangest. it was only a light, reddish, very dim and was way too high up to distinguish the shape behind it  but it was the motion of the light that first caught my attention.\r\n\r\ni was standing at the back of my house in bridgwater (somerset uk) smoking and looking up at the stars. i always look up while i'm out at night, as i say, i've seen plenty of interesting things before so i keep an interested eye open.\r\n\r\ni noticed it first directly above me moving from over my house in a westerly to easterly direction. after a few seconds, it changed to southerly, not a gradual turn or banking movement but a right-angled jerk to the new heading. a few seconds later it was going easterly after another jerk to change direction. and so it went on. every few seconds, sometimes just after one second, this dim red light danced it's way across the sky, generally 'stepping' left then right, north then south. sometimes a wobbling motion was visible and sometimes, more remarkably it just blinked out, then re-appeared a short distanced away, jerking and jumping as it moved on it's way.\r\n\r\neventually, it blinked out and i lost sight of it as it headed south. i'm not sure whether it just didn't blink on again or whether its low luminosity made it just too dim to keep up with.\r\n\r\nthat's it - nothing spectacular to look at, but remarkable to watch with its erratic, sudden direction changes, wobbling movement and constant disappearing/re-appearing. i can't say how high up it was - too difficult to gauge but it was completely silent as it went.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
