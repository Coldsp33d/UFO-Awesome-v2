the center of it. i see it when i take my dogs out, and the nights my mother picks me up. i thought it was the space station, but when i heard on the news you could only see it on their day mentioned, i was like, well guess it's not what i'm seeing. because i'm seeing it all week,lol. hopefully it's a

to one of these passing jets if it continued along the same path that i last observed it following.  at first i thought it was just another airplane because of it's apparent altitude and speed which i

them, there was a random white orb in the cloud. i didnt think anything of it at first, i just thought it looked cool, so i kept the picture. then, one afternoon sometime in september 2010, i was laying down on my trampoline looking at the sky. a white orb was gliding, and zig-zagging across the sky. it came out of one cloud, and glided into the next one. i was rather curious, so i stayed outside and waited to see it again. when my mom came outside, i told her what i had seen, and i showed her the picture i took a when i first got my phone. she was stunned. she said for me to be careful. \r\n a week ago, we were having our fall break from school, every day of the break, i noticed an odd white light outside my window, in the sky. i just ignored it. then last night at 3:30am i woke up in the middle of the night and saw the light outside my window. i waited until it disappeared, and  then i tried to go back to sleep. out of no where, i hear this loud noise, that sounded like a car revving up to 100mph, i thought it was coming from the road, but it sounded too loud to be. then it started making a warping noise. it was steady for about 15 seconds then it warped for another 15 seconds, like vrooooooooommmm, voom, voom, voom, voom, voom. it was one of the craziest things to ever happen to me. i was completely still, and tried not to make a noise, up until 4:00 then i ran

listen to her for a while wondering if i needed to intervene and go into her bedroom to comfort her.\r\n\r\nwhile i was waiting i went out onto the back porch of our 2nd story apartment (in a two flat building) as i often do when i can't sleep, it was about 2:20 or so at this point.  we live in san francisco where it is very hilly.  i looked over the hill that borders our neighborhood to the southwest and i noticed 3 bright red lights (similar to led lights) with a third blue light moving in a very strange way around the sky above the hill.  i am a professional pilot and i know how conventional aircraft move through the sky.  this was nothing like that and i knew it immediately.  the three red lights were (from my perspective) in a triangle formation and were equidistant from each other and moving in unison.  the third light was blue.  it remained close to the red group (so close as to be considered all part of the same formation) only it seemed to move independently of the red lights.  \r\n\r\nthe movement of the whole group was more similar to an insect than any aircraft i've ever seen.  it moved at random around the southwest sky for about 30 seconds.  if i had to estimate the distance, i would say at least two miles and possibly much more depending on the actual size of the lights.  from my perspective they were no bigger than pen lights but were very bright in that led sort of way.\r\n\r\nafter about 30 seconds they descended behind the hill and i could no longer see them.\r\n\r\nduring the time they were visible i called to my wife through the window to open the shades and look out but she did not wake.  i am, therefore, the only witness i know of.  \r\n\r\ni am wondering if anybody else in the area reported the sighting.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over

east of wendover, utah, at about 5:00 am, i always look at the stars when i stop just out of habit i saw a star that i had not seen before low in the southern sky, i whatched it and it started to move so i looked closer i watched for awhile it looked like it was trying to maintain it's position kind like wobbling! then i asked it to give me a sighn that it could hear me, it blinked off then on real bright then back to were it was originally, it moved up and down and side to side then the clouds rolled in and i lost sight of it around 5:30 i have friends that say they saw one that morning about 2:00 am flashing red,blue and green and white lights they watched it for awhile as well it was moving upand down. it was high in the southern sky, we think that it is the same one that we saw last night that looked like a planet.\r\nthat night on 10-8-10 and 10-9-10 i drove up into the nearby mountains to get out of the clouds and lights of the city, i saw three of them in the northern sky far apart from one another, i whatched them as they moved around and blinked red, blue white and green lights, it was about 1:00-2:00 am i was listening to ian pundant on coast to coast am, i whatched them for about an hour and got tired and went home.\r\nthe following night 10-10-10 i saw one over salt lake it was disquising it's self as a planet just like the one i saw friday morning, then saw four more in the northern sky, i called my friend that said she and another friend saw one friday morning, she and i went up to a place called little mountain just east of salt lake at the top of emigration canyon, a popular place for star gazers, we were amazed there must have been at least thirty to fouty of these things in all areas of the the sky they were all moving like they were trying to maintain there position, then ocasionally they would shoot off to another position.\r\nthe one that was the most amazing was the one right above us that was just one white light, it was the one that looked like a planet, it was the closest to us, we looked at it with binoculars and could see windows on either side of it, oval in shape it was setting off center on a 45 degree angle it would move when we asked it to and it would change it's light intensity from time to time.\r\nwe got tired and went home about 2:00 am i am suprised that not one thing was said on the news or radio, i think that they choose who they want to be revealed to, we were not scared in any way it was a feeling of kindness, i am writing to you not out of concern but out of curiosity i know you take this stuff seriously and am not going to criticise us as the media may do. i would like to have someone with the right equiptment and know how to look at this in a non judgmental way, if i had more powerful binoculars of a high intensity camera i could have seen alot more detail.","distance":"Over One

as i turned to get the groceries out of my car, i noticed a light out of the corner of my eye.  at first i thought it was a helicopter flashing a search light down towards the ground, but noticed it was completely stationary and silent.  it was in a slightly cloudy area and there was light beaming down from it, spreading out in a triangular fashion.  i felt afraid for a moment and took a few steps back, thinking i might be abducted by e.T.S, but then thought it is far away and motionless and that i was safe and should take the opportunity to observe it.  after a time (30 seconds, a minute?) of being motionless, it disappeared without a trace.\r\n\r\nbelow are my notes written on september 25th, when the event was fresher in my mind\r\n\r\nthanks mufon, for doing this important research work!\r\n\r\n*(wit's name deleted--cms/sg).\r\n====================================================================\r\n\r\nwhat i saw\r\n\r\non saturday, september 19th, 2009, at about 7:55 pm eastern time, i pulled my car into my driveway in asbury park, nj.  i opened my car door, got out of the car, and turned around 180 degrees as i headed for the trunk of the car.  as i looked up to the sky in the sse direction, i saw a distinct light.  in the first half second, i tried to mentally process whether it was a star, an airplane, or a part of the moon peaking from behind a cloud, but realized in was not anything i had seen in the sky before.  the light was an elliptical shaped object, and beneath it was an illuminated area.  the object had about the same luminous intensity as the moon and was a soft white, maybe with a slight peach tint.  the shape of the illuminated area resembled the shape mades by a directional lamp, pointing downward, against a wall, a somewhat parabolic shape.\r\n\r\ni simultaneously felt apprehension and curiosity.  i took a step back, but then starting walking towards the light.  considering how is moved in relation to nearby objects as i moved, it was at minimum a half a mile away, but could have been light years away too.  the object seemed to be completely stationery.\r\n\r\nin a fraction of a second, the light faded into nothingness.  i had seen the light for five seconds, maybe ten.  the sky had just a few scattered clouds.  the area where the light had been was cloudless, however, there was a mist where the illuminated area had been.  the mist was not as thick as the clouds and was much smaller than them, from my vantage point.  \r\n\r\nalso, in the same sector of the sky was an airplane.  not sure if its size or if it was closer to or further from me than the object.  it had both a flashing red and white light, but no idea if it was commercial or miliary.  from my vantage point, the elliptical object was probably similar in size as the airplane.   i wondered if they had gotten a better view of what i had just seen.  \r\n\r\ni looked around the neighborhood, hoping to find another witness.  about 200 feet away, i found a young man, who said he had not seen it and obviously had his mind on something else and had been looking up in the sky.\r\n\r\ni went inside, think about those few seconds of my life and what i could have possibly seen.  the time on my kitchen microwave was 7:58 pm.\r\n\r\n(written sept 25th, 2009)","distance":"Over One

planet and it was hidden by cloud. suddenly from behind the clouds a delta winged aircraft appeared. i know it was delta winged because i study different aircraft as a hobby and subscribe to aviation magazines regularly. it appeared to be at a great height and could possibly be at space station height. it was golden or yellow coloured and there were no lights visible and nor was there any sound whatsoever. it stopped briefly in the sky and i was looking directly up at it. it then spun around quickly in a counter clockwise direction a full three hundred and sixty degrees and then immediatelty spun in a clockwise direction. it then flew away at great speed the way it had come and dissapeared  behind a  clouds. it appeared to bounce in the sky. it was the strangneness of the movement that i found most amazing and i dont know of any aircraft or aeroplane manufactured in this world that could move like this. it lasted approximately forty-five seconds. as i didnt have a video camera or anything else with me i have no visual evidence unfortunately. i found the whole experience amazing and i feel it is hugely important to report this. what i found most amazing was the movement of the

comes in our direction and turns on these search lights so, my fiance turned off our flash lights and duck close to the ground but i panicked and took off running so, the airship starts following me so, the ship is following me, then i stopped and turned around to come back and get my fiance so i end up going where im covered by the trees and... i think the ship lost sight of me and.... it disappeared...Just vanished in thin air...Im even freaking out just typing this story up now.....So here we are going to my house and we look to the right of us and there was one of the air

evening, mid-50���s.\r\n\r\nspotted several satellites and aircraft throughout the evening plus one meteorite so had accurate comparison of speed, altitude, luminosity to other objects.\r\n\r\n8:16 pm spotted an object on a nearly perfectly north to south heading, passed directly overhead, appeared to be either in orbit or at least 100,000 feet msl, much faster than previously sighted satellites or aircraft, on a direct heading with no deviation or erratic movements.  similar in appearance to previously observed satellites with star-like appearance lacking any navigation or anti-collision lights that would appear on aircraft, but the luminosity of the observed object pulsed at approximately 4 or 6 second intervals during which time it burned/shone brightly for approximately two seconds, gradually fading to nearly invisible to the eye, then flaring up and brightly pulsing again, almost appearing larger in size during the pulses as the change in luminosity was so great, observed it over approximately 4 cycles before disappearing from view on constant southerly heading.  object traversed the visible arc of the celestial sphere over my head for a distance that i would define as probably 1/8th of the portion of the full arc of the visible sky, was completely out of sight in less than 60 seconds when it was no longer visible after it was just slightly beyond the apex of the sky, estimate velocity in the hypersonic range, 5,000 ��� 10,000 knots, suspect pulse detonation wave engine or other advanced propulsion system or possibly a rapidly rotating orbital body that was reflecting bright sunlight at regular pulsed intervals, however the velocity appeared to me to be easily 10x greater than previously observed high-altitude civilian aircraft and satellites of the evening.  the light emanating from the object did not to appear as distorted from atmosphere as previously-observed satellites, from that i draw the conclusion that it was lower in altitude than the satellites but at least double the altitude of the airliners i observed earlier which i had estimated to be in the neighborhood of fl 350.\r\n\r\nthe reason i am reporting it is due to the far greater velocity at which it traveled relative to other common nighttime objects and the brightness that, when at the apex of a pulse, was at least as bright as the clearly-visible planet to the east (bluish tinted planet, believe it to be venus or saturn).  it struck me as advanced terrestrial technology rather than advanced-civilization technology as it had no erratic movements, did not suddenly appear/disappear, did not hover, did not reflect multiple colors, but rather moved with the straight-line determination of an orbiting body or (an exceptionally high) high-altitude aircraft.  since it was on a n to s heading, also reason to suspect military program material, as such an orbit would transit the us and former ussr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?\r\n\r\nback yard, rochester, monroe county, new york, usa.\r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n\r\nstargazing and watching satellites and meteorites, bright flash caught my eye, followed the object to see that bright pulses were regularly spaced and faded over an approximately 2-second period from maximum brightness to base brightness, followed by approximately 6 seconds before the beginning of the next 2-second bright-to-dim phase.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\nsatellite, due to the high speed and star-like appearance, but exceptionally fast compared to satellites with brightness that was at least as great as comparable planetary bodies visible the same evening.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions.\r\n\r\nstraight-line, no deviation.\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n\r\nbecame keenly alert to this object as it clearly was something unusual - i have been a stargazer, aircraft-watcher, and satellite-watcher for some number of decades and have serious credentials in both military and civilian aviation including time at government entities that describe themselves with letters, as specific as i am willing to get on a public disclosure.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n\r\nobject made its last pulse/fade cycle slightly beyond the apex of the dome of the sky, would estimate that the closest recognizable constellations to the path of travel would have been lyra and cygnus, likely passing through a portion of cygnus.  no sound emanated from the object during the entire event, not unusual as it appeared to be very high altitude or orbital.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

visiting with my mom.  he decided to stand outside to smoke, when i noticed what appeared to be mars in the night sky.  \r\n\r\ni asked him, \"matt, is that mars?\"  at first he wasn't paying attention so i asked him again, \"hey, is that mars?\"  he agreed that it was.  i said, \"wow! you can see it so clear tonight.\"  we haven't had any rain in several weeks and there wasn't a cloud in the sky that night.  needless to say, after observing it for a few more minutes, i turned my attention back towards him and was talking.  all of a sudden he says, \"hey, find where mars went?\"  \r\n\r\nturning around sort of puzzled i did look in the exact spot where mars had appeared to be only a few seconds earlier, but it had dissapeared.  so i started to scan the sky and finally found it travelling in a north-east pass over us.  at the moment that the reddish-orange ball that i had thought only moments earlier to be the planet mars was parallel to our position, it shuts off the red-orange light and a series of three smaller bliking lights became visible. two white, one red and they appeared to rotate around the what now appeared to be triangular object in an irregular pattern.\r\n\r\nthe object was moving very quickly and silently and we watched as it sped off into the far distance, but before it completely dissapeared, i am almost positive that i observed it make a sharp dart downward, than back upward.  my boyfriend however had a hard time seeing it at this point and i think mostly because of the glare of our security light.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

toward the philadelphia airport and were just east of the delaware river when i noticed a close object, approx. 100-200 yards from the jet that looked like a metallic soccer ball. it was sort of sparkly as it flew and i thought that it was very odd. then i thought my eyes must be deceiving me and tried to think that maybe the sparkly look was due to a bird flapping it's wings... but would need to be too big to be a bird at even 100 yards. the pilots must have seen this thing... one could not miss it if they were looking out the window.\r\n\r\nwas watching a show today that mentioned mufon and did a search for soccer ball looking ufos were i read about a guy in ne arizona... his description sounds very similar to what i believe i saw. when i say that it looked like a soccer ball, it appeared to have flat spots in the same sort of configuration as a soccer ball. i could not tell whether it was going in the same direction as us but it appeared to be moving slow as we moved past it or it was going in the opposite direction. it was flying roughly in the same east west direction as us. the object was in my view for what seemed about 10-15 seconds.","distance":"101-500

of stars had am red glow thinging it was a planet i kept staring in amusement, shortly thereafter the cluster started going in a circular motion, but first drifted to my left which would be west towards cape kennedy.Then it stopped and began to circle a fairly large motion no way to tell how,believing at first it was planet i have no knowledge of astronomy or mathamatical literacy. just a common joe. i then looked at otherstars believing i might have morning hallucinations. none of the other stars moved at all.The tight cluster kept circling,then went left in a straight line then right and circled again almost felt like it was playing with me again looked at other stars and no motion looked back at\"planet\"??? it kept circling till dawn then dissapeared in the light. had to let you know i never seen anything like this in my life of 63 years i truly believe this was not a hallucination of any sort it was too explicit in it's motion signed *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg)don't bother
