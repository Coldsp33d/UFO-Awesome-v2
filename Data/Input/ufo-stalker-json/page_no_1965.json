7th. at approximately 8.55 pm i was sitting outside with my wife looking at the nighttime sky.It was a beautiful starry night.We brought two chairs out to the patio and place them in a south east direction.We even turned all the lights off in the house which made a big difference for viewing the sky.We were not outside 5 minutes when i laid my head back against the chair when a huge v shape craft silently and almost invisible flew over the house in a se direction!!I couldn,t beleive my eyes.The v was red.It was very faint,almost transparent, it wasn't a perfect v it looked like somebody took a red can of spraypaint and made a sloppy v (or it seemed to be changing shape,i'm not sure)inside the arms of the v were orange balls i wouldn't call them lights i can't say they gave off any light.It also blocked out the stars.I felt a bit unnerved at this point because i realized it must be huge.It covered the whole sky in about 4 to 5 seconds.I don't know if it went out of my field of vision or just disappeared.Iws very excited after seeing this object,it was as if i had a revelation i thought to myself all those people that have reported something like this can't all be crazy.I had to tell somebody, so i called my brother. i wanted to report this to the police but my wife talked me out of it until today october 10 2010 .I googeled v shape ufo.Turns out this exact craft was reported fly above the kennedy space centre in florida.This person describes exactly what i saw.\r\n\r\nalso about 3 minutes after the sighting a helicopter flew into the same area,just like the case in florida.The hair on the back of my neck was standing up when i compared my notes from the other night to this sighting in florida.\r\ni would love to hear from anyone who might have seen the same

north of burnsville to spend vacation and celebrate new years there. my husband and i always stayed upstairs in this a-frame home facing the river and the train tracks that were 2 or 3 hundred yards down hill from the cabin.  well it was always something we did with the kids, that is, we would meet in our room and tell stories at night. i know what your already thinking and that is why i have just dropped it even though it comes up often.  we were telling a story and we had it dark and we were all sitting around on floor and bed. we were all facing the big sliding glass doors which faced out over the river and train tracks. as we were talking we all noticed this red light, from that distance it was the size of maybe a small baseball, down around the track area.  we knew it wasn't a train because there was no noise, however we thought it might be one of those pump carts where a person checks out the track, but we didn't see any other lights, so we watched it. it seemed to glide at a pretty smooth consistant movement like it was going around the track but then on one side of the tracks was or is a very high bank which goes all the way up to the main highway that goes up and over the mountain. all of ther sudden it started darting up the bank and then down again and did this about 3 times, then returned to its smooth movement around what we knew as the direction of the track.  you go so far and then it makes a turn around to the left and goes behind some trees for a short distant where we lost track for a few seconds then it cleared the other side and continued on around for a few more seconds and where we would have lost sight of it completely, all of the sudden it shot like an arrow up in the sky like a bullet and dissapeared. we all just sat there for a moment in disbelief and then it was like the shock hit us and the kids and us said \"oh my gosh did you just see that\",  we were overwhelmed with what it could have been and the kids were scared wanting an explanation and we couldn't give them one.  i remember telling my husband we should tell someone and he like myself said they would think we had lost our minds and no one would take us serious anyway. what made me tell you all about this is, listening over the years and it seems more over the past 4 or 5 years maybe, that i hear people in their ufo sightings refer to a light of some sort just appearing and then disappearing suddenly.  i know this is a very small sighting of sorts but was watching your story today on *(name deleted--cms/sg)and bless his heart i know how i felt on a very small scale, so i know what he has gone through trying to report what he saw. the unknown is so intriging and interesting but when something does come up and is unexplainable, no one wants to really hear it. just thought i would share this for location sake and to see if it might have been something you have heard before. i certainly hope i have not wasted your time, but when we still talk to those kids whom are now yougn adults, that is still the question we all have.  what was that?  thank you for any info you might be able to share *(wit's name deleted--cms/sg).

then started to blink white and red and then it disappeared.  i went in target and came back out within 3 or 4 minutes and the object was gone.  but, in the sky as a black helicopter in the same area

sighted the object that i see nightly and have photographed for months.  i also talked with a neighbor across the street who verified that the object has been in this area for the five years since

( the direction of the tree line is towards  rt 1 which leads down to this resteraunt) i was out on the back porch yet again watching the fireworks and noticed the bright orange ball in his normal spot just hanging out like usual when another one had floated our from behind it and it seemed to be trying to get a better position to watch the show from. they both sat there the 'main' one never moving but the other one would bob and switch sides every now and then. they wnt on for about 20-25 minutes and after they were over, the 'mover' circled the 'main' ship and left in a instant boost of speed normal crafts are not capable of. the main one sat about another 10 minutes and then did his same old flashing deal and then vanished like every other time.  haven't seen them since because i moved to an apartment about 10 minutes down the road.

usually do on afternoon breaks.  i was watching 3 eagles soaring and riding the thermals. they were so high and it was a awesome sight.\r\n\r\nabout 2:47, i know because i frequently check my watch or clock on my cell phone to be sure that i do not stay longer then 15 minutes.  anyway the eagles had moved towards the west.  something some motion,  caught my eye, so i transferred my gaze a bit towards the south.  all the sudden i could see one very bright star and i thought, that���s strange, a star in daylight.  then i saw a 2nd one come in and that was followed by a 3rd, 4th and so on till i was sure there were 15-17 objects total.   at first i wondered if some balloons had gotten away, but that thought was quickly discarded when i saw the objects doing all kinds of movement, this was deliberate movement so i knew they could not be balloons, also i was pretty sure they would not reflect sunlight that brightly and they would have had to be hugh to be seen at that elevation. \r\n\r\nthey would move out, come back, form a circle or a triangle.  they formed regular triangles and then elongated ones.  they would sit totally still and then start moving all of them at once and keep their distance from one another.. then they would stop etc.\r\n\r\nabout this time, 5-6 minutes into the sighting, i got out of my car and stood by it in the parking lot to get a better look, i was not able to see high enough, sitting in the car, so when i got out, i could see all the objects.  what i did not understand was how or why when people were walking by, no one seemed interested, or cared. they saw me looking up and glanced up and then just kept on walking.  i was so excited to be able to see something like this, i wish i had tried to take the pictures before, but it did not cross my mind.\r\n\r\nabout that time a manager in the building walked by, i asked him ��� do you see those objects? ��� his remark was no.. so i said ��� come over by my car ��� he did and then he said ��� oh i can see them ��� i said what are they? and his answer was ��� they are not planes, they are not birds and they are not balloons ���   and he added ��� but if i had my gun, i would shoot them.  ��� i thought,  just what we need, a trigger happy witness ��� \r\nabout that same time they all disappeared but not before i was able to snap two pictures with my canon sx 200 is x12 camera.   the sun was so bright, the camera lens blacked out and i was not able to see what i was shooting at.. i just pointed in the direction of the objects.  \r\n\r\nthe total time of the sighting was 12-13 minutes.\r\n\r\nthe time was 3:01 and i had to go back inside.  i shared the sighting with a couple of co- workers but they were not that all interested.  so i took my camera and thought i would check and see if there was any thing on the 2 pictures i took.  yes��� there was an unmistakable bright star on the picture, the 2nd picture did not have any noticeable points of light showing against the blue sky.\r\n\r\nso when i came home that night, i tired some enhancing software on the computer windows 2003 xp. what i saw was more confusing than the sighting itself.\r\n\r\ni know the photos do not show much, but if you enhance or zoom on them, the objects do show up.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path

the object was obviously in front of the sun, yet it did not look dark or shaddowed. the sun was around 10 o'clock in the sky and the object was around 11 o'clock. i also felt it could be a plane traveling in in a manner that made it seem still. however, i did not see any vapor trails. it appeared very far away. i was looking at thinking what kind of plane would be so bright. i figured it was a planet. then it moved. it was no longer bright white, it was black. it moved fast. all three of us watched it go north. i figured it was heading for lake michigan. it moved like nothing i know. it crossed the horizon and out of view in less than 5 seconds. there was no vapor trail. if it was a jet fighter, there was no sound. i just keept saying it's moving to fast to be a jet. it just moved
