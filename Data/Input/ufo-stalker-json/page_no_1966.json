all again. it's 8am as i type this and fb let's you know how many hours ago you typed something on there, so i will  include that info to give you a rough estimation on when i typed it.\r\n\r\n i am ready for the ufo this time. i figured out the telescope and put it on a tripod. if it comes tonight i will get a good look at what it is.\r\n12 hours ago \r\n\r\nyep! i have my sights on one already! green and blue pulsating spiked thing. looks like a tiny star in the sky but it''s pulsating green and blue! it's really really high up. even with the telescope, it's tiny\r\n12 hours ago ��� \r\n\r\ni got my neighbour guy to come over and look through my telescope and tell me if what i am seeing is correct and he saw the same thingand said he's never seen anything like it. it is like a white circle in the middle with a black circle around that. and then emanating from that, radiating, is laserlike bright green and red spokes. but they are not in a straight line. it's almost like one of tesla's electricity orbs. and they alternate red and green and they pulsate randomly.\r\n11 hours ago ��� \r\n\r\nok, i sat out with the telescope and looked at other stars to compare. 1st of all i can say that as a telescope for nighttime astronomy watching, it sucks. it would be better suited to see a bird in a far off tree, for example. when i look ...At other stars through it, it has a tendency to want to stick a red and green halo around things and it's really difficult to focus, or know what the right focus is for a star. so i think this telescope enhanced the red and green that was already there in the object i watched. but with my naked eyes and with my binoculars it also looks pulsating red and green, and the neighbour guy said he thought so, too.\r\ni'm not sure now if i had the telescope focused correctly on the object. i may have had it out of focus a little so it seemed like the spokes radiated more than they did, but i'm not sure. what i can tell you for sure is it does pulsate weirdly with the naked eye. it moves weirdly, very faintly again tonight. more of a very small up and down back and forth movements that were hardly detectable. it starts out in the sky really high. it is super high up there. it is super far away. like when an airplane is a dot kind of far away. it looks different from different angles. but basically if i had to descibe it it is white in the center, then green, and red on the outer rim. but my telescope is probably distorting that. there is definitely something pulsating and spiky about it. it looked like a firework or the top of an umbrella opening and closing, if the top of the umbrella had a laser light show going on it. at one point it looked like a spinning top. if it was spinning, it was seeming to move clockwise. i'm not convinced that i had the focus right to see it correctly. i can say it doesn't seem \"normal\". i don't know what kind of thing would behave in this way. starting out each night at the same time in the same place and basically going the same route, while not remaining in a complete staright line like a star or satellite. and having irregular pulsing, not blinking. tomorrow, if it shows up again, m will be home with me finally to see it and i can get his opinion on it. it sucks to not have any other witnesses to this thing (except my enighbour), so i can't be completely sure if i am seeing things correcly or using the telescope correctly. \r\n9 hours ago ���\r\n\r\ni can't imagine that someone has been launching the same led light kite or balloon each night and managing to get it that high and managing to make it go exactly in the same pattern and behind the same tree each night to the point where it ...Goes behind the same spot of the tree. that would have to be some pretty exact flying. but i don't fly balloons or kites so i don't know. there also hasn't been any wind these past few nights. for the record, the deer and the dogs were not jumping and barking tonight. things were calmer. oh, and the sky has been perfectly clear all 3 nights\r\n9 hours

long, and no sound at all and too low. i kind of laughed and thought it almost looked like a satellite not a helicopter. it seemed to have an aurora, if you will, around it. its position as is in the

motionlessly at a very low altitude. it was while the bus was going westbound over the west seattle bridge. it was getting late in the afternoon, but it was still sunny out. other planes were visible in the sky which was not unusual, as there are airfields in the general area (such as sea-tac), but none were close by the object. the object did not appear to move at all or interact with anything. it just remained stationary near an antenna tower. if you are familiar with the west seattle area, the tower was the one with the blinking red light on it that is just a little bit taller than the elevation of west seattle, and is the one visible from the bridge over the duwamish river. the object appeared at the same height as the blinking red light, and if you held out your hand, the object was about half the length of your index finger to the right of the red light. i could tell the object was hovering stationary while in my line of sight (unlike a distant plane flying straight towards or away from you) because my perspective of the triangular object appeared to be from the side. it looked like it was as big as a 700-series boeing plane, though a little more massive due to the fact that it was triangular in shape (rather than the usual thin tube with wings of your typical commercial passenger plane, which can easily be spotted at any given time in the skies above seattle). i only saw it for about a minute and a half due to the fact that i saw it while the bus was traveling over the bridge; after crossing the bridge, the object was no longer in view as the bus went behind a hillside as it continued on its usual route. i kept looking back as we came around the hill to see if i could spot the object again, but it looked like it was now gone. i never actually saw it move, however, such as entering or leaving the area. nobody else on the bus seemed to notice the large dark object, and i didn't want to point it out to anybody at the time, due to fear of ridicule (even though it was plain to see it was there if you looked right at it....I take this bus every day, and don't want the people who see me daily to think i am crazy). i am not sure if the object made any noise or not, as i was riding inside a noisy bus over a busy bridge. the triangle appeared to be pointed westward and its flat bottom evenly level. it was fatter on the east side of the triangle than on the west end of it, with its \"backside\" or aft forming approximately a sixty degree angle within the triangle. the only reason i happened to notice the thing at all is just because i happened to be looking out the bus window at the right place at the right time. the moment i noticed it, it was immediately apparent that it was peculiar-looking; i couldn't help but instantly think \"ufo\" when i first saw it. although i felt self-conscious about seeing it, i did not have any other intense emotions at the time. i just kept watching it, occasionally taking my eyes away from it just to glance around the bus to see if any other commuters were seeing what i was seeing.

in mid turn. i walked in and said nothing. i don't know what time it was when i got back, but it couldn't have been to long. after that i had a small circular object in my right ear lobe that wasn't there before.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

night from san antonio, texas. on the drive via interstate 37 south, i did noticed a blue/white/red light up at about 30 degrees from the highway flying ahead of us at about 20,000 feet. having just finished a previous ufo investigation the week prior, i took this light as an aircraft flying to corpus christi so i ignore it. after taking the port aransas car ferry about 12:30am, 5 october, we park our suv passed the end of the paved road of east cotter ave were it becomes the entrance to nueces country park. we park our suv tail end right next to southwest side of the waterway pass as marked on figure 1.\r\n\r\n5 october ��� approximately at 1:30am we finish setting up camp and go to bed. one hour later i wake up for no apparent reason, i decide to step outside of the suv to have a smoke. my brother has been sick so any noise or movement did not wake him. the gulf breeze was blowing to the northwest so i moved to the north side of the suv near the front passenger seat. the sky was partly cloudy with the clouds moving also to the northwest from the southeast at a very slow rate. \r\n\r\n2:30am ��� at an angle up from the horizon about 60 degrees facing northeast, i see what looked like a fast (grey in color) shadow move just above the clouds over my left shoulders into another cloud. thinking this was either a large bird or my tired eyes playing tricks, i ignore it. \r\n\r\n2:45am ��� after finishing my smoke, i make my way around to the passenger side of the suv and i am now facing southwest parallel with the nose of the suv. i happen to look up at three very large clouds and see once again this huge grey shadow move from the top of one cloud on my right to the next cloud to the left. i open the suv���s driver door and start to reach for the camera under the seat. as i am reaching for the camera (i am totally blown away on seeing this) a massive super-ship quickly moves from the middle cloud to the third cloud on the far left, see figure 1. wishing this would be just a peaceful fishing trip, i start memorizing eye-witness reporting attention-to-detail facts. i quickly raise my right hand and simulate the shape, color, direction, size, speed and duration of the ufo event. using my outreach right hand (about 6 inch long at 20 inches away from my eyes) and estimating the lower end of moving clouds to be 20,000 to 25,000, i measure this super-ship to be 7,500 feet long, 3,750 feet wide, and 1,250 in height. the overall shape (note, it move so fast i did not see the front very well) resembles a between an archery 3 blade broad head arrow tip crossed with a star war���s imperial battleship (see fig 2). at the very back of the ship looked like two very large dome (think tops of football field like the metro dome in minneapolis). this machine looked extremely old. along the sides of the ship were two rolls of blocks that resemble the tops of old castle walls. absolutely an unpractical design for aerodynamics and it was the dullest concrete grey in color. in fact, it looked like it was made of concrete with no smooth surface, no windows, and absolutely no sound. it flew from cloud to cloud as if was trying to hide. in the open between the clouds it would almost fade in with the stars above but as soon as the ship jumped near to the top of next cloud, it would fade back into view, it is possible that the chemical composition of the earth���s cloud may have an undesirable effect of the super-ship���s ability to stay invisible (think sun hitting falling rain to make a rainbow). the second direction it moved was about a mile west, 85 degrees up of my location and jumped to the last large cloud at about 75 degrees southwest at a speed i estimate to be 5 times a crj-700's 860km/h (535 miles per hour) or 2,600 miles per hour or i would estimate it jumped 45 miles in ��� of a second. \r\n\r\n2:50am ��� with the interior light of the usv off and with the driver���s door open, i finally find my camera. i turn my body back out to look southeast and i see a white/blue round probe/or a decoy (fig 2) with a little red blinking light on top of it. this ufo drop down from a huge cloud father south from where i saw the super-ship last. this probe is hovering just below the cloud at about 20,000 feet and about 60 miles from me. it is blinking with an unrecognizable rhythm. note: the following morning at 7am i noted 5 to 6 oil tankers moored between me and the hovering probe, if a crew member was up between 2 and 3 am working the oil transfer rig that is about 20 miles out from port aransas, they should have seen all of this.\r\n\r\n2:55am ��� seeing the probe blinking and changing color from white to blue with a smaller un-rhythm red blinking light on the top of it, i turn on my 1 million candle watt power floodlight and flash three quick flashes to it as this pratice has been advised/tried by the local san antonio, texas mufon members when they are trying to make contact in our local ufo hotspots. as soon as i flashed the last of the three flashes, the probe completely vanished from sight.\r\n\r\n2:56am - within a minutes, and what i can describe as my first uso (unidentified submerged object) encounter, a tall (maybe 100 feet in height) super bright white double cross (fig 2) uso, rises out of the ocean at about 25 miles due southeast of me in line with the far right oil tanker. this new structure is completely lid up. it stays right on top of the water and i start filming it (see attached film). at the beginning of the film, i try to get a reference by using the stationary oil tankers, and then pan the camera to the right to focus on this uso. within a few minutes, the uso slowly sank out of sight.\r\n\r\nunknown if any other event happens that night. unknown why this is would be my fourth night (in two months) seeing and reporting events. but it has to be reported.","distance":"Over One
