first saw a light bright enough to be a low flying commercial airplane, but the light was not traveling a straight line like a plane, instead it was hovering and rapidly dashing from one point to another with no pattern, just random darting side to side, stalling then redirecting, sometimes moving upward or downward.  there was another planet behaving similarly - the red planet in orion's bow.  i reported to pickens county sheriff's office but they had no interest.  i also reported to ufo hotline out of oregon.  he called back to tell me i only saw stars, but today, i was told about the cow mutilations that took place at cooper's farm in hall county, ga over the weekend, and hall county was very much in line with the area i was viewing.  i live on a 3,000 ft elevation mountain (tally mtn) and i can see all the way to atl from my mountain.  it was a very very clear night when i saw this activity.  i never lost site of the objects/hovering stars, but when i went out in the yard on

still.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

death valley (ft. irwin, ca.) and turkey as well back in the 80's. i've spent many hours looking up into the stars and with little to absolutely no light pollution to obscure the dimmest of stars.\r\n i've been star gazing all my life and always liked searching for satellites crossing my view.\r\n something i've noticed, which brings me to my report, is the fact that there are now \"things\" going on that i never noticed back then. not that they did not happen, it's just that it seems to be something new and increasing.\r\n what i mean and, simultaneously, my newest experience ( as all of my experiences). the \"satellite like\" objects that traverse our space. not our regular, man made satellites but ones that stop, change course and light up seconds at a time and then disappear.\r\n i just saw again, on the morning of 10/06/2010 an object, which looked at first like a man made satellite but it crossed the sky in less than one minute! our real satellites take 7-8 minutes and never change course.\r\n this is something i never saw years ago but now, is virtually a daily thing.\r\nthese objects stop, disappear and send \"morse code\" like signals in the form of flashes. whereby, others flash back.\r\n i just wanted to state that i am aware we are being watched and visited. i am not afraid and i accept it. i find it exciting. i have never experienced any personal encounters. no black triangles hovering, no disc with lights. just these high altitude craft. perhaps because we live on the gulf coast and there is little of interest here for them. i don't have a very good view except due east over galveston bay. maybe there is more activity closer to houston.\r\n i would really love to see one closer.

in 1 of 2 places. as we watched it it would move around. so we used the edge of a small pine tree for reference to make sure it wasn't a trick of the eye. sure enough the object moved back and forth in and out of sight(i lined the object up rather closed to the edge of the outline of the tree to get a good reference). it soon started going up and then hooked a 90 degree left. we watched for a time more and saw some other incredible maneuvers. after watching for awhile we started to head back to the porch and i noted a bright star(at the time i thought it to be a bright star that was around in the fall due to it appearing around early august)and we watched it for a minute when my friend noted he thought it may have moved. we watched for a little longer and saw movements. again thinking i may be the dark/eye trickery, so i used another tree and as i would watch and see it start to move my friend would call out the movement he saw and it matched what i was seeing. for another 30 minutes or so we would watch it and back and forth call out what movement we saw just to see if we each saw it. after wanting more proof we called up several friends and had them come over. we all witnessed a moving bright object. one friend had his camera and bi-pod. we set up the camera(note my friend is a photographer using a high end rebel, not an average house hold digi) we took several 30second time lapse pictures and the object would move almost fully across the image. on several images the stream would move in different directions(again on a bi-pod stationary). the camera zoom didnt get close enough and i wanted to try to get a closer look at the image, so we got out the spotting scope are started trying to fine the object. i was able to pin point the object and get a focus on it. once i got a clear look i was shaken. i was able to see the bright light that i was drawn to at first. i was also able to see another 3 lights in a perfect line and a 5th light directly in the middle of the 4 up making a perfect almost equal sided pyramid. me and 5 others all looked at the object and saw the same thing. at one point i watched the object in the scope for about 2 to 3 minutes and during that time it moved from the left to right and out of sight of the scope while turning itself about 90 degrees before i had to readjust to see it again. this isnt the first time i have seen ufos around my area but this is the first time i have been able to get multiple people to see the encounter. to even the playing field i even called a non-believer over who was skeptical and they admitted they were unsure of what they had just witnessed. i have for a few years thought this to be somewhat of a hot spot but until recently announcing such would have been thought crazy. it was an experience for me as for everyone else who witnessed the event. i think by the end of the night the other 3 skeptics were unsure of what they thought and open to anything at that point.\r\n\r\nmessage to admins of

four distinct lights, two red and two green. the red and green lights were quite brilliant in color, not blinding, but also hard get a good \"fix\" on. there was a faint white shimmering light that was accentuated around the red and green lights, which were also shimmering themselves. the four lights and their relative sizes and positions where quite discernible though difficult to discern their exact shape, more like small columns of light than spheres of light. i actually laughed when i saw it in that configuration the first glance, thinking it was a joke on the faa. also the red and green lights that i saw until those glances where much smaller and dimmer, when it was almost like the full moon in white brightness between them. at these few close glances, there was no clear white light source but a dim white sparkling shimmering light about it.\r\n\r\nwhen it passed me i noticed that at least three other cars had slowed down with me, perhaps they saw it too. when i got a little past that i looked in my driver-side rear-view mirror and could see a row of five lights circling back behind me. the there were two larger brighter lights with three dimmer lights in a row, dim-bright-dim-bright-dim. these lights followed me at my left side at about 10 degrees over the horizon perhaps for five miles until i exited the highway at laclede station rd. the lights on the craft remained steady but one would flash every one or two seconds, different ones at different times. i exited right and came to a stop light about 100 yards off the highway.\r\n\r\nstopping at the light, at about 45 degrees off the horizon i saw a  line of lights in the sky, about the size of a dime. there were five lights in a row, the middle one always red and the others usually white but sometimes green or red at the ends. the end lights would change color every few seconds, but none of the lights flashed nor changed intensity. all these lights also had a shimmer to them. i had the impression this was the second \"craft,\" since i had just last seen the larger row of white lights about 15 seconds before that had been pacing me at the opposite side of the sky. anyway, i turned left at the light and this light seemed to then descend to about 15 degrees over the horizon and get a bit closer. i could easily see it for a few miles staying to my right. it didn't seem to move much more in the sky until i got about 2 miles from my house in st. louis and slowly moved out of sight behind me.\r\n\r\nas i had wondered six nights before, and a few nights before those - what's up with these weird mocking lights flying around? personally, knowing about the rumor of public disclosure by the \"aliens\" later this month, it's something that makes me go \"hmmm.\" yet, has disclosure already come to many, even if the minority?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25716,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6326425,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10072010-0001","longitude":-90.1936842,"occurred":1286341800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Square,   Rectagular,   Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1286437795000,"summary":"One of two \"stars\" comes close to car on interstate and changes lighting","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/25716_submitter_file1__20101005221000.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"St Louis, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:95537"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Mt Vernon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I'm reporting this for my father and his girlfriend who reported this event to me this evening.  \r\n\r\nthey were outside on her porch the evening of 10/5 in the vicinity of west elementary on the west end of mt. vernon.  they report first seeing what appeared to be a glowing cigar-shaped object hovering almost directly over her home for several minutes.  after several minutes the object quickly disappeared.  following the initial object they report seeing three (3) round or spherical objects fly in which \"bounced around\" for several more minutes.  reportedly a neighbor came out (or arrived home, i'm not clear) and saw them looking at the sky and asked what they were looking at.  my father's girlfriend directed her to look up at the area they were looking at and tell them what she saw.  apparently she also saw the same 3 objects.  \r\n\r\nthey report hearing a loud noise associated with the objects, which was also heard in other parts of town up to 2 miles away.  the sound was described as a loud \"rhhhhhew rhhhhew\" type sound.  after my father returned home he continued to hear the noise and thought it may be coming from a local refinery or roofing plant, but having lived in the area over 60 years does not recall a similar noise.  they speculated the noise may have also been coming from underground.\r\n\r\ni'm not clear on the size or distance of the objects, and they were reluctant to make the report themselves.  she (my father's girlfriend) did say that she'd spoke to a local resident who is a ufo enthusiast/investigator (again not sure) who had told her there had been a lot of activity in indiana recently.\r\n\r\ni can provide names of the two main witnesses upon request as this is all 2nd hand information to me.

beautiful day today, not a cloud in the sky. as i was approaching a break in the trees, something shining in the sky caught my eye. my very first reaction was knowing that it was not a plane. as i kept glancing at it for the next 20-30 feet, i found a place to pull over. it wasn't moving. just sitting there hovering in the sky. it looked to be about 200 feet up. my windows were down and cars were driving by, but i couldn't hear any kind of sound out of this object. i sat and watched it for about 20 seconds and then it just disappeared. it didn't fly off or move, just vanished. as i searched the sky for it, i noticed an actual plane going by in roughly the same area and i could hear the plane pass and noticed that the sun wasn't bouncing off of the plane like it was the previous object. i pulled back onto the road and drove to the redlight that was 1/4 of a mile away from where i pulled over, while watching the sky to see if it popped back up. as i got to the redlight, with my eyes on the sky, i noticed something appear out of nowhere further off in the distance directly ahead of me. i sat and watched it. it appeared to be the same object (or another one of the same thing), except it was further away and this time, it moved very slowly to my right for about 5 seconds and then, again, just disappeared. when the light turned green, i made my left hand turn and kept glancing towards the sky. i didn't see anything else on the way home, but i know what i saw and it was a ufo. now, i want to go out tonight and search the stars to see if i can find anything else.

(it occured to me just now that i should have tried to count their number, but i did not.  the lights were flashing in no repetitive pattern that i could discern.)\r\n\r\ni described the object as triangular in shape for the twinkling lights, at the very least, were arranged upon the object in a loose, morphing triangle of sorts.  i viewed the object with binoculars but in terms of structure i was unable to discern anything but a shadow with decidedly indistinct edges, perhaps on account of the many flashing lights, whose shape appeared to be shifting. \r\n\r\nmy husband and i agreed that we had never before seen any aircraft behave in this manner.  it certainly was not a helicopter or airplane. there was no sound coming from the object that we could discern.\r\n\r\ni am only reporting this incident because of news report that made the local headlines in nearby montreal last weekend.  a very respected obstetrician/gynecologist was coming home from the hospital late one evening and reported a strange sight in the sky.  i was astonished to discover that he appeared to be describing the object we saw to a tee! i am convinced by his description that we may have seen the same object, or perhaps two very similar objects, in close geophysical proximity, in the span of a month. (my cottage is about an hour's drive away from montreal.)  here is a link to the story:\r\n\r\n[link moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\ni realize i probably should have reported this earlier (this would have given my sighting greater credibility no doubt!) but it didn't even occur to me to make an \"official\" claim.  i just thought it was interesting, if somewhat alarming.  in my gut, i got the sense that this was a \"scanning probe\" of some sort. this is pure speculation on my part, and i cannot even identify precisely what lies behind this association in my mind.\r\nperhaps it is due to the slow, descending, side-to-side movement of the object.\r\n\r\nincidentally, my husband and i are amateur astronomers who own a 10-inch dobsonian reflector, which we carted out onto the deck only to realize with great dismay that it was impossible for us to obtain a viewing angle from our vantage point on the balcony!  (we toyed with the idea of hauling the telescope downstairs, but by this time the object had descended very low upon the horizon, disappearing from view shortly thereafter.) we are very familiar with many of the objects in the night skies.  we know what satellites, stars, planets, constellations, helicopters and planes look like, and this was certainly none of those.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":25702,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5162999,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10062010-0003","longitude":-73.5500725,"occurred":1284102000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Quebec","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1286364251000,"summary":" a morphing  triangular object with indistinct edges descending slowly upon the horizon. precise shape of object hard to determine on account of twinkling blue and red lights.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"EST","timeZoneName":"EST","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":26,"locationName":"Montreal, Quebec","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:95548"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Collingswood","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I honestly don't know where to begin here. putting this up is a little scary for me, because all this stuff really happened. but it's been close to 5 years, i'm getting older and it's time to come forward with my story. let me also say i'd much rather talk to someone about this than type it all out, but i'll do my best.\r\n\r\non saturday may 27th 2006 my girlfriend was away for the day, and i had our apartment to myself. i spent some time playing a new videogame, and had a long phone conversation with my mom. it was probably the deepest conversation we ever had, and she told me a story about my birth. i knew we were both sick when i was born and that she had to have an emergency c section, but apparantly her heart stopped for 45 seconds while under. when she woke up to my father holding a newborn me, all she could do was tell him about the dream she had. she was aboard a flying saucer with a higher power, or jesus, looking for others. but for some reason no one else was ready, or able to board with them. this kinda blew me away, she hesitated my whole life to tell me this because of my profound intrest in the subject.\r\n\r\nok so we finish up the conversation, it's 7:20 pm  and i try to go back to my new game. but instead i put down the controller, got up and looked out the window of my 7th floor apt. and see this white egg shaped god-knows-what right out there. it was about the size of a minivan, maby a small bus and it was so close i could have hit it with a rock. it immediately began moving away very quickly and i noticed two black dots, one on either side of it. they started swirling around the egg and would 'splash' in and out of it, causing it to shimmer black and white so fast it looked silver. it looked kinda like a molecule. \r\n\r\nok now here's where it gets tough....\r\n\r\ni only saw it up close for maby 10 seconds, it flew away pretty fast. but i kept my eye on it and could still see it as a black speck against the clear sky for a good 2 mins. then it started blinking out, and i said outloud \"no! come back\" and waved it back and this black speck zapped me. it felt like i jumped into ice water and had my brain ripped in half. the sky turned a bright purple, i wanna say ultra-violet and against it were hundreds of different sized transparant white circles, or 'orbs'. like a polka-dot sky. it brought me to my knees and i urinated myself. \r\n\r\nok here's the part that really scares me, i wouldn't bother coming forward if it weren't for this. when i finally managed to shake it off i heard what sounded like chaos outside- all the car alarms in the whole parking lot, several sirens and what sounded like a fire engine, all blaring loudly for 30 maby 45 seconds. the clock on my cable box said 7:23.\r\n\r\nfirst thing i did was try to call my mom back but the phone was dead for 10 minutes or so. at her advice about an hour later i called the local fire dept. inquiring about the alarms but got some bs answer- a \"system alarm test\". also i found some neighbors who heard everything at that precise time, but no one saw anything.\r\n\r\ni had several other related paranormal experiences that summer, but i'm done typing about this. as i re-read this i realise there's several details i'm leaving out, but i'll always remember that day quite well. i feel mufon is a trusted orginization so please feel free to contact me if you'd like to know more. thank you.
