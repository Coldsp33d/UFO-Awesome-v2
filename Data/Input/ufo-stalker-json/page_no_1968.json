away but i can see a big circle that was just stationary facing south it was like over silver it was almost white but was silver and the sun was refelective on it at the top was a redish orange color hard to tell because of the sun.The thing that was strange there were no planes in the area i mean i look up all the time and there are always some planes flying by. but the sky was empty i had to make a left towards my house and looked up the sky was empty if it was a plane on a clear day i would still be able to see it going in some sort of direction it was gone.I would say it was about 10 miles south of me.I have never seen a ufo before but have been intrested in the subject for quite some time .My wifes cousin son saw one when i went to pick him up from a teen party he saw 3 red lights moving very fast we were on a bridge driving over water but it was the same area about a year ago i did not see them because i was driving. again the thing that was most strange there were no planes in the area  espically for a saturday but there were none for like 1 hour in the area,also the entire sighting took place in about 30 to forty second but i know what i saw .\r\n\r\ni was driving south on fisher blvd\r\ni do not know what it was but it looked like if you took a blimp and looked at it from the front only with no scck-pit and left it stationary.\r\nit was just

shaped object approximately 15 degrees above the horizon due west, it appeared stationary, but it was tilted at a 45 degree angle, the northern side higher then the southern side. the sky was clear, the sun was setting but it was not yet dark enough to see even the brightest stars. the object was highly reflective, like light shining off polished metal or a mirror. the color, shape, and size of the object rules out anything that we \"officially\" know of as humans. it was far off in the distance, not close enough to be designated at a close encounter of the first kind, but i deffinately know what i saw, i observed the object for 1-2 minutes. i was completely transfixed on it, i up untill this event i was one of people that said, \"why didnt they grab a camera and take a picture?\" i had my cell phone with a camera in the seat next to me, while observing the object, taking a picture was the last thing i thought of. i've always believe in ufo's and aliens, but i've never seen anything personally untill today, i felt and reacted with an \"i knew it\", the reaction you get when you discover something you suspected, but could never prove untill that point. i lost sight of the object when i swerved to avoid rear ending a car that i only saw at the last second because i had been staring at the object and not the road. in the process of avoiding a collision, i slamed on the brakes and swerved to the right off the road, getting a flat tire in the process. when i revovered from my near accident, and looked up for the object again, it was gone.","distance":"Over One

an airport and, frequently, see planes and other aircraft in the skies around me but this looked different. this appeared as just an orange-ish, spherical light. it was moving very very slowly across the sky above us. there were also very brief moments where it's speed would grow tremendously, moving in just a second , seemingly, as far as it had in the previous 10 . we,initially, saw the object while heading south and then turned and followed it for about 1 mile to the east, another 2-3 miles north, and then 2 more miles to the east again. people see lights all the time and i understand that. but what made this event different to me were two main things. a few minutes after we saw the light, we saw a black helicopter seemingly following it in the same direction. we then saw another, and another, until finally there were about 7-8 of these black helicopters following the orange light gaining ground as it went slowly and losing it after the light sped up and so on. the path all the craft were taking took us down a road east, as i mentioned, and we gave the chase up once we came to an area of the road which was blocked off by numerous police cars with their lights flashing. we drove around the area a bit and saw that other points around this large neighborhood area were blocked by lit up police cars. i'm a professional firefighter and a paramedic and i have been on a lot of scenes and calls where police are looking for someone and have an area closed off like this but i have never seen this many police cars used for such a purpose. it certainly could have been just the police searching for someone, but the fact that the area was much larger then i have seen in that situation, and the number of police in the area(probably at least 20 police cars) add that to the fact that this neighborhood was under the path and around the point where we lost sight of the lights and helicopters and the, ever infamous, black helicopters made this event stick out in my mind and help me decide to share this story.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25693,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.0457654,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10052010-0011","longitude":-81.9476742,"occurred":1235808000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

taken october 4th 2010 and posted on youtube here: *link moved to additional evidence section below--cms/sg.\r\n\r\non september 29th at 1am montreal suburb cote saint luc residents reported seeing a ufo hovering over the cavendish mall. on october 2nd at around 9:30 pm i was putting my son to bed and felt compelled to look out my bedroom window. right away i noticed an abnormally bright \"star\" that i had never seen there before to my knowledge. it hung in the sky at what looked like double the altitude the planes were flying at. i live close to dorval airport and there is an aerial landing path on either side of my house. plenty of planes fly by constantly. the star-like object captivated my attention. my son got out of bed and we both spent a good forty minutes watching it move across the sky slowly in a southern direction and an upward trajectory. it was moving slowly away from us. \r\nthe strangest thing it did was it moved in reaction to a plane that was flying somewhat close to it, it moved up and away, also south really quickly compared to its other movement. otherwise it's movements seemed to be hovering and gliding over. i noted its position in the sky before i went to sleep at midnight. \r\non october 3rd the same object became visible as i was walking my dog with my son at 7:30pm. in an effort to distinguish this light from the stars, i actually noticed another similar strange light object. i pointed to what i assumed was a bright star, (had we been inside i would have only seen this from the front balcony) and said ���see there that is a star.��� except upon closer inspection it was much like the other light, but farther away and it too was moving. it appeared to be a 2nd identical intense bright ball of light hovering in the sky. that 2nd light moved across the sky rather quickly, i kept checking on it and it moved in a northeastern direction but maintained a very high altitude. again i noted its position in the sky before i went to sleep at midnight.\r\n\r\non october 4th i was ready to video the object, worried it wouldn���t come back or not be visible because of the cloudy weather conditions but sure enough at 8:30 pm it was back in its regular spot, and i had my tripod and hd camera pointed at the sky outside my back balcony. \r\nthe video shows the object, which is essentially a ball of intense light. it looks to me like it could be rotating. the object is white light and the light radiating off the edges changes from bluish-purple to green.\r\nmy boyfriend witnessed this light with me and agreed it was very strange, saw that it moved positions and couldn���t be a star, satellite, plane or spotlight. it appeared to be hovering in space just beyond our atmosphere. we woke up at 4:52 am on october 5th as the sky was beginning to brighten and looked out the bedroom window, same view as the back balcony, the light/object was still there except it was much closer and lower in the sky. i wasn���t able to record it, technical issues to due clouds and light, impatient to get back to sleep and overtired.\r\nalso i wasn���t able to video the 2nd light/object last night. not sure it was the same 2nd object i saw the night before. it looked like it might be, it was in the same spot as the night before but the cloudy conditions and the distance made it impossible to videotape. \r\ni���ve been scouring the internet for similar reports and notice lots of similar images out there. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering

cms/sg.\r\n\r\ninstead of just copying and pasting what i wrote before i'm going to try to remember again from my memory best i can.  \r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?  i was with my girl friend in my ford expedition.  we were leaving our house in lake las vegas traveling southwest on lake mead drive about a mile from the entrance of lake las vegas.  i was traveling about 50 mph at the time.  we were going to eat at fiesta casino in henderson.  immediately after the incident occurred i looked at the clock in the car and on my blackberry.  both said 8:03 pm.  \r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?  i was looking at my girl friend who was sitting in the passenger side and i started to notice the ambient light above the car go from darker shadows to lighter shadows fairly quickly while we were driving, i remember thinking to myself what the hell are those shadows.  as soon as i thought that in my head, i started seeing these bright neon green orbs flying around the inside of the car.  \r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions.  the best way i can describe those lights was that they seemed like the size of tennis balls or ping pong balls, its hard to tell because it was like a light source but they seemed to be flying around in the car.  i was looking at my girlfriend in the passenger seat so i could see the rear of the car with my peripheral and it looked like the lights were dancing around in the back too.  i specifically remember the lights passing over the tops of my thighs and the center console of the expedition.  it almost felt like it was scanning the car.  the green lights moved quickly, so fast they left those lit up optical traces you see when a light moves fast in the dark.  the color of the lights was a deep green type of light.  almost like the green light of a stop light but much a much richer and deep green.  this whole incident maybe lasted 2 seconds.  i honestly can't say if i remember seeing the lights on the outside of the car.  because the lights were moving so fast and were inside the car my head was concentrated at looking inside i forgot to notice if the lights were outside.  my girlfriend says she saw the lights from outside but she's not too sure.  her perspective of it was she was looking through the side view mirror and she said she could see the lights dancing all around the inside of the car.  a part of me wants to say i saw some lights in a light purplish color but this may have been an optical illusion at the way the lights were flying around.  but me and my girlfriend both agree that we did see deep green lights.  the lights were bright, like i was staring into a neon sign but it didn't seem to bathe the car in that green light.  i mean the car was lit up but it didn't seem to paint the inside of the car a specific color but it was hard to tell.  as soon as the lights came they just all shut off and it was gone.  the reminds me, the way the lights first happened it wasn't like just 1 or 2 and slowly more.  it was right away a lot of lights and very fast movement, then gone, it was back to darkness.  after the incident i slowed down hard on the breaks and yelled \"what the hell was that\".  i immediate looked over head but saw nothing.  \r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.  when the lights first turned on in the car i immediate thought it was a toy or some kind of electronic had turned on in the back of the expedition.  but when i started to notice the lights shining and dancing around i knew it wasn't a toy and i got goose bumps all over my body.  i slowed down and went to the next place where i could make a u-turn and wanted to turn around to see what it was.  my girlfriend said she was scared and freaked out and just wanted to get out of there.  we went to fiesta henderson and ate and saw nothing else.   \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

prepared for what i was going to see but i always hoped for as a young kid that i could very well see a ufo and be able to record every movement of the object. upon arriving to my bike while drinking and my head tilted to the sky i noticed a silver oval like object moving real slow with silence near a pet-smart store at approx 19:44hrs. i then wondered is this what i think it is because it does not have any lights like an airplane and it was not leaving any air dust like jets do. i then thought maybe a weather balloon but it couldn't be because the movement looked completely different. i immediately pulled out my 4th generation iphone and started recording and noticed no one else was looking at what i was looking so i felt weird but i didn't care because this is the moment i have been waiting for. i then saw it leaving my view and proceeded to my bike to follow the object. while on my bike i then noticed two objects flying parallel to each other in some formation that would cause a regular airplane a accident. i got off my bike shocked and tried to focus for my second recording of the now second object in visual but they were to fast and left with such speed out of this world! i immediately text my wife and told her \"you will not believe what i just recorded\". upon arriving home i screamed for my wife and said please look at this and tell me what you think? she said is this what i think it is i then said maybe but i got to analyze and zoom into the recording for further details. i then proceeded to my computer and went to work and took some still shots of the recording and noticed i had two ufo's in sight. i started zooming into the actual recording while the object was moving and saw the actual shape of this object. i was never more in shock ever in my life until i saw this. i was more in shock for joy then anything over what i had just seen! my conclusion of these two objects can only be classified as my first kind philadelphia ufo.

towards chicago. it looked as if it went from a quick moving low lit cloud to trying to resemble a formation of birds, but i could tell they were not birds because; it made no noise, no out of sequence normal bird bobbing and flapping, it was glowing dimly and remained in perfect formation as the double vv flew over, this all happened in a matter of 10 to 20 seconds. again it looked nothing like normal birds in formation. i would assume if someone happened to look up and see the low lit vv fly over they would probably think they were just geese in formation but i saw it form from a mass of nothing describable to the clear vv. it looked as if the object tried to blend in to fly low over the city by camouflaging itself into that specific shape. i had my camera with me but the event happened so quickly i could only just witness it. since 2009 over forest park i have seen tumbling dark orbs fall from the sky, dark spheres play hide and seek in the clouds, daytime high slow moving star like objects, night time high zig zagging stars, a light reflecting diamond shaped object, a copper colored orb, crescent shaped craft, orange orbs, a red orb, other craft that have resembled birds, and low lit v formations but this is the first time i have seen a low lit quick moving cloud of discoloration form into a double vv formation. all of this is happening over my house with some consistent frequency, i am not sure why its happening but to me it is pretty amazing. below is a generic rendering of what i saw fly over friday october 1, 2010 hopefully someone else saw the same thing i did. peace \r\n\r\n\r\n              o             o\r\n    o     o    o           o   \r\n     o   o       o       o\r\n       o           o   o\r\n                     o","distance":"501

Wayne","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the evening of september 30, 2010 i was at snider high school, filming the marching band for a video project i am working on. i was also with my friend. it was around 7:11 pm and as i was filming, a few of the band members point at something in the sky in the distance above the school to the west. the sun was setting in that direction. it was a fairly bright stationary object. i got curious and decided to zoom in all the way on it. let me also point out that i was using a sony handycam dcr-sr42 camcorder with 40x optical zoom and 2000x digital zoom. it was an object with 2 lights and as i watched it the lights would flash green and red over and over. since i was zoomed in all the way, the camera would shake with every tiny motion i took, so i decided to deploy the tripod i was using. as i was messing with they tripod, i tried to draw up an explanation to what the object was, but i drew a blank. after my friend and i fumbled with the tripod we lost sight of the object for just a few seconds until it finally reappeared in a different location in the sky. i zoomed in again and it was the same object. after about a good minute or so the object disappeared. about 2 minutes later we saw another object, but this one i did not video tape, this object was in motion and was flying around in a smooth pattern, staying in the same part of the sky, while that was going on, we witnessed another object appear, but this one was stationary. i turned on the camera and zoomed in. this time it was a single light that was flashing green and red. at this point we had thought that the first single object had split in to 2 separate objects. the object in motion disappear without us realizing it. so we kept watching the stationary object. that object then dimmed out and disappeared. after about 5 min we caught sight of yet again another object. except this one was considerably larger or closer and lower on horizon. i zoomed in on it and right as i did it seemed to grow about twice it size and it glowed red. then it dimmed down and started to move. as i was recording i managed to get some trees in the shot as a reference to track the motion of the object. it moved to the right slowly and as it did, it suddenly stopped. then is started moving again, stopped, moved again, stopped once more and when it started moving it did some kind of loop. it continued to move at a constant speed and got dimmer and brighter as it moved. until finally it disappeared behind the school building. at this point it was 7:30pm and the band's late night rehearsal was ending. the band members who saw it were very puzzled and excited at what they say and watched the videos i had taken. after practice i said goodbye to my girlfriend, and told my friend that was with me to keep his eyes peeled for anything else. at this point the sky was almost completely dark. i got in my car and started driving home, the commute to my house is only 3 minutes since i live in the neighborhood behind the school. with the objects still fresh in my mind i looked up in at the sky hoping to see something and to my amazement i did. i slowed down the car to make sure i was seeing things.  it was an object with 3 lights in a triangle formation traveling southeast towards the school i just came from. it was traveling at a constant speed, and was not very high up, i could not physically see the object since the sky was dark, but as it flew over some stars, the stars disappeared behind the object. there were 2 lights in the front and the light in the back had a white strobe on it. i was about 7:56pm when i saw it. i thought that it might be an aircraft. i looked around and actually saw an usual concentration of air traffic to the west where the first objects were spotted 30 minutes previously. i knew that they we're aircraft because i am quite familiar with the light configuration on conventional aircraft since i am an aviation enthusiast. i can even identify different types of aircraft such as the make and model. i stopped my car in front of someones front yard and started filming. i got in a kneeling position to hold the camera steady and took two videos of the object. i watched it for about two minutes until it disappeared behind the tree line still traveling southeast. freaked out at this point, i called my friend i was with while i drove the rest of the way home through my neighborhood. i told him what i just saw, then he told me that he was still at the school and that he saw a very bright white light in the sky in the same direction the craft was coming from. then it disappeared. i finally got home, very spooked, and watched the videos i had just taken. all of these events took place from approximately 7pm to 8pm. in the same area between my house and snider high school in the neighborhood of glenwood park. there were about 11 to 15 witness on the first objects. and only one or two for the triangular object. the photos attached are frames taken from the videos taken that evening. i am unable to upload the videos since they are to large. the next day i also learned of a sighting of 13 objects exactly like my first sighting in west chicago, illinois on the same day at the exact same time.

trail on brandon parkway in brandon, florida. as we were walking by a pond on this trail we heard a splash which startled us as alligators are known to eat dogs, so we are always on guard when walking our dogs near water. the noise wasn't an alligator but only a crane landing in the pond. this scare caused my wife to look up to the right of us which caused her to notice something in the sky. she then asked if i saw what was in the sky. i then looked up and didn't see what she was talking about at first but shortly afterwards i noticed it too. about 30 yards in front of us and 40 feet up in the air was a luminous/shimmering flying object that appeared to be slowly gliding through the air. at first i believed the object was a giant unknown bird however it had no features a bird would have and got more unrecognizable as i stared at it. the object was completely silent and had a slight bend to it looking like a fingernail sliver or the moon in an extremely thin waning gibbous. the object appeared to be anywhere from 10 to 20 feet long. the object was traveling we estimated around 15 to 20 mph. and it flew very smoothly gliding effortlessly through the air. the object was gliding straight past us and then made a twenty degree turn. we slowly watched the object in awe as it slowly flew out of our sight. my wife and i watched the object fly past us in amazement and confusion. the entire sighting lasted from 30 seconds to 1 minute until the craft disappeared from view. at the time we lost sight of the object it was heading west towards tampa. as outlandish as this sounds the object's luminous/shimmering appearance seemed to resemble a \"cloaked starship\" in star trek or the cloaked predators in the predator movies. it did not have the herky jerky flying motion of a bird or the loud sounds a plane or other recognizable flying craft would make. seeing this defied all logical explanation to my wife and i. it has now been 2 hours since the sighting and i am in awe thinking of what it could have been. i'm reporting this hoping that somebody else out there in hillsborough county, the tampa/st. pete area or anywhere tonight saw this obeject. if anyone else saw

in my system, only nicotine and diet coke ... and some cheetos possibly. the night was very clear, no wind, visible stars ... very peaceful outside.\r\n\r\ni sat down on my deck chair, and i was looking up eastwards at the sky. i immediately saw, what i thought was a shooting star, going from the north to the south. i have seen a couple of shooting stars before, and they have always gone in a downward motion - and from a great distance. what i saw this night was not that. \r\n\r\nit appeared out of nowhere and then traveled from north to south in about a 30 degree upward motion. it was very quick. and it wasn't \"as high\" as the stars. it appeared to be around the same distance as a plane would be flying. by this i mean not as high as when planes reach their cruising altitude. the object was around 3/4 of the way up from cruising altitude. but it was definitely not a plane. also, there was absolutely no sound whatsoever. if it had been a plane, i would have heard it ��� even if faintly. and, i would have seen a plane continue on its path. this did not happen at all.\r\n\r\nwhat really threw me through a loop was that it had a vapor trail that appeared a few milliseconds after i saw it shoot upward. the vapor trail appeared ���*almost* at the same time as the object appeared but not quite.\r\nthe vapor trail went the same distance as the object and disappeared immediately, as did the object. unlike when i have seen military jets or even passenger planes fly overhead, they emit a vapor trail that stays in the sky for a few seconds to even minutes. this one disappeared immediately.\r\n\r\nof the shooting stars i have seen in the past, i never have seen one with a vapor trail. real shooting stars were always so far up in the sky that i wouldn't be able to see a vapor trail if it had one. add to the fact that of the shooting stars i have seen, they last a few seconds longer than this one did. and i could follow their path easily with my eyes. this object, and its trail, came and went almost at the same time ��� it ���popped��� out of now where and then *poof* it was gone.\r\n\r\nafter i saw this object, i sat there quite stunned. i thought to myself, ���did i just see what i thought i saw? no way! but i saw it. with both eyes wide open. and no one is going to believe me.���  i sat outside, still staring up in the same direction, hoping to see a glimpse of it again. nothing ever came.\r\n\r\ni blogged my encounter on facebook and had a couple of friends ���console��� me stating they have seen unexplained objects in the sky before as well.  i was hoping someone in tulsa had also seen what i just saw. no one did, or if they did, they ain���t opening their mouths.\r\n\r\ni contemplated just chalking this up as an encounter for just me, myself and i. but i have had this nagging feeling to tell someone who wouldn���t think i am crazy or, more importantly, had other witnesses in tulsa on the same night and time, report a similar sighting.\r\n\r\nthat���s what i saw, that���s how i felt/feel and that���s my encounter.
