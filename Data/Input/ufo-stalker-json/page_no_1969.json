one less bright, slightly larger red light in the center. it emitted a sound. though only slight, it was something of a metallic muffled hum.  also the way it moved was pretty disturbing.  it didn't swoop like what an aircraft usually does. it kind of shook. almost like balancing a magnet on top of another. it looked like whatever was keeping it up was not jet propulsion. as quickly as it passed it disappeared behind the tree line a mile off.\r\nafterward i was excited, almost a little upset that i didn't get to meet these beings, if at all they were aliens, but a general feeling of uneasiness befell everyone. my reason is, i've never heard of a pleasant abduction by a triangular craft.","distance":"101-500

the sky, and so there were no strange shadows from the sun and clouds.\r\n\r\ni was sat on the left side of the bus on the back seat next to the window and so i could see perfectly what was outside. the bus had started to climb a steep hill out of a valley, and my view was blocked by a tall hedge on the left side. when we reached the top of the hill the hedge ended and then there is an open dirt track, and then just as i was looking down this dirt track as i do every day, i glimpsed upward as i saw a small glint. \r\n\r\nagain, it was a very hot and clear day and so i know that i wasn't just seeing a strange shadow of some kind, and i make this journey every day and so i know what is and what isn't out of the ordinary. \r\n\r\nonce i had noticed the glint of the reflection of sunlight, i immediately looked up and saw what appeared to be a sphere that looked very metallic in appearance. i was amazed at it as it was not moving at all, and i knew that no technology of today is sophisticated enough to be as still as what this object was, so i straight away dismissed the fact that is was any kind of aircraft that i knew of, it was definitely not of this world as far as i know. when i looked at it i noticed that there were no ropes or anything that would be holding it still, so i also dismissed the fact that it was a weather balloon of some sort. it was just perfectly still in mid air- hovering. from what i could tell it must have been at least 80-100 feet up in the air above the dirt track. from where i was, it looked about the size of a wrecking ball, but i know that it wasn't a very small object. (in my personal opinion it could have been some sort of probe or reconnaissance object) \r\n\r\ni couldn't understand what or why it was there, and i know for a fact that the day previous to the event that it was not there at all. as the bus drove further away and into a nearby village, i continued to look at the object as i thought that it might vanish at some stage but it didn't. when the bus drove into the village i could no longer see it as there were houses and trees in the way. the bus continued through the village and we eventually came out of the village the same way we came in, and so i was expecting it to still be there, but it had now vanished. i looked around the area where it was and also the surrounding area to make sure that it hadn't simply moved to another place, but it had vanished and there was no further sighting of the object at all. i haven't ever been this close to an object that i am unfamiliar with, and i was very intrigued to find out what the object was. i am not a ufo skeptic at all, and i am very interested in this subject.  \r\n\r\ni would like to thank you for reading this story, and i am intrigued to find out if there have been any further sightings of objects similar to this.","distance":"21-100

however a similar event took place the following evening, which this report describes.  the important difference in this second sighting is the unusual effects on my camera and on the pictures taken of this second object.  on the evening of on september 23, 2010, my dog began acting as he did on the 22nd (extremely concerned to go out) so we went outside at about 7:45 pm. this time, i took my binoculars and camera. in the west, without binoculars, i saw a dim red or orange light just above the tree line which is a thousand feet away. i do not know the distance of the object from my position, but its size when viewed was about the size of a planet. i took 2 pictures (sony cyber-shot 14.1, auto-set), then it just disappeared. once again, as soon as the light vanished, the dog behaved normally, no longer stared toward where the object had been (an action he also took on the 22nd), and was content to go back inside and remain there.  at no other time has my dog acted in the manner that he did on these two nights.  the effects on my camera and on the 2 pictures i took once downloaded were most unusual.  from the camera playback, picture one seemed just black; picture two seemed to show only low clouds lit up by the moon. when scrolling through the pictures on the camera, several times when the second picture should have been displayed, the camera has a blue screen that says ���file error���, and each time the pictures were viewed through the camera, the dates on these two were off by one day for the pictures taken on the 22nd (camera says 21st) and the 23rd (camera says 22nd).  i downloaded the pictures immediately after taking them, and a very faint orange light could be seen on both pictures. when this first download was viewed the second time, the orange light had turned black; on the third viewing the object was dimmer, but still could be seen, but on the fourth viewing, the object was gone entirely. i then downloaded the pictures a second time, and only a black object could be seen on both pictures. when this second download was viewed a second time, the black object was dimmer but still could be seen. upon the third viewing, the object was gone entirely. in these two downloads, the black object was in the same location where the orange object previously had been.  the next day, i downloaded the pictures again, but no object could be seen on either picture. the background of these two pictures never varied in any download, only the color of the object and its subsequent disappearance.  these events have been disturbing to me because at no other time has my camera malfunctioned in any manner, and never has an image of anything altered after download in any way.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

my driveway laying down listening to solar fields - air song(ambient space music) on full blast on my computer speakers i had set up outside just having a great day, relaxing and socializing when i caught a glimpse of an odd white dot in the sky silently ripping across the sky headed south at an incredible speed.\r\n\r\ni had pointed it out the them, (they couldn't believe their eyes either) and amidst our confusion, it just disappeared out of plain sight...Needless to say we were a bit freaked out...I kept telling myself it was a piece of drifting cottonwood in the air, but the next sighting completely knocked that idea out of the picture...\r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes later we managed to calm down a little, the kids went back to playing around, i kept looking up and around laying down on my back, when i noticed another one flying south at i guess 3500-4000 miles an hour, and it disappeared behind the white haze in the air(it was a clear blue skied day with a wierd fuzzy white haze in the air, possibly the effect of aerosol chemtrail spraying)\r\n\r\nthis happened over and over again in 10, 15 and sometimes 20 minute intervals apart, one craft at a time, and at some points in between i caught \"blinks?\" of the same crafts zipping in and out of sight like they were exiting and reentering some kind of portal in the atmosphere...It happened so fast that i had to ask one of the kids if they saw it too and indeed they did,(some were still watching the sky with me) so that confirmed that it wasn't just me who witnessed it...It got so bad that i had to go and get my pellet gun to look through my scope to get a better look, and it helped me to not misidentify a regular aircraft from a ufo, and to my best effort, i couldnt spot one in time before they dissapeared(they did that quite a lot)\r\n\r\n\r\ni had also taken note of the local regular aircrafts' cruising speed and altitude and they were nowhere near the speed/altitude of these said crafts...It almost dumbfounded me that i was witnessing such a phenomenon and i almost couldn't believe myself and what i was seeing, nonetheless i did see a ufo...And it was just about the most unsettling thing i have ever seen in my life,

by when i saw a blue streak cross the sky above. i thought at first that it might have been a comet, or a shooting star, but quickly realized that it was far too low to the ground, and seemed to be falling. as it got lower, i noticed that it looked like it was on fire, the actual object looked round and seemed to be engulfed in bright blue flames, and was followed by a cooler, orange trail. the object was quite large, perhaps the size of a quarter if you held it out in your hand against the horizon. it watched the object as zipped by and descended lower to the horizon. i was expecting it to collide to the earth, but before it reached the edge of my viewable horizon, it seemed to blink a couple of times before it disappeared entirely. the entire sighting was fairly short, perhaps only two seconds or maybe even less. when it was over, i stood watching the sky in shock for around five minutes. i was so distracted by what had happened that i noticed that my cigarette had gone out while stared i dumbly at the horizon. i also noted that after the object had vanished, more dogs around the neighborhood started barking. eventually i got too cold to keep looking at the sky, so went in side, grabbed my computer to search for any astronomical events over the michigan sky for the night, and found nothing that would account for i had just seen. i am still unsure of what i saw, and am

celestial phenomenon, the like of which i had never seen before.  i will describe this event so it becomes part of the historical record of such events which occur and might be explained if other people also observed it or know of events or occurrences which can identify or explain it.\r\n\r\nmy home is located in the town burlington, wi some on bushnell road.  my lot is about 3 acres in size and has treed and open areas, along with my house and three other outbuildings.  from many places of my lot, i have excellent visibility of the sky in all directions.  i can easily get to all of my lot from any of my structures in just a few seconds.\r\n\r\ni returned home from work approximately 6:30 ��� 6:45 pm and entered my detached garage with my automobile.  immediately, after entry, i let 2 of my dogs out of their kennels to get their evening run and spend time with them.  after about 15 minutes i returned them to their kennels in the garage and gathered items from my automobile and garage to bring them into my house.  i entered my house through the attached garage service door and put my items down on the stair landing in the garage.  i then let out my pup from his kennel in the attached garage to have his run as well.  again after abut 10 ��� 15 minutes, i returned him to his kennel and then i brought my things into the house.\r\n\r\nknowing i had to look for something in my detached garage, i returned to it and quickly found what i needed and set it aside to use later.  it was approximately 7:00 ��� 7:15 pm as near as i can estimate since i did not look at my wristwatch at that time.  when i left the service door in my detached garage i happened to look up in the western sky.  i observed a red and white flashing light and figured i had seen an airplane and this was through the trees.  however. i did not see it emerge from the trees and so i kept watching the sky above the tree as i was walking to my house.  suddenly, i saw the same light phenomenon as i reached a point when i could see a large expanse of the western sky.  \r\n\r\nthis flashing light group appeared to have red and white flashing lights some short distance apart on both sides of what i will describe as a horizontal access.  it also had white flashing lights at either end of a vertical access.  my cartoon of this description is attached.  at first i thought this was simply an airplane heading approximately nw according to my position of observation.  suddenly, this thing stopped moving and seemed to hold its position in the sky.  i continued walking westward and cleared any trees and other high obstructions to my view of the westward sky.  i was in my neighbor's yard at this time.\r\n\r\nthis thing made horizontal tracks in the sky in each horizontal direction.  i will designate this as right and left directional movement.  it moved at least 10 of its lateral width's to the right, back to its original position and then at least 10 of its lateral widths to the left and then back to its original position.  it could move quickly ~ 1 second for the complete right or left directions or very slowly ~ 10 seconds for the same movement.  it could also do this vertically, which i would designate in the up and down directions.  i watched this for about 15 minutes.  then this thing seemed to fly off in a nw direction and stop again.  i watched it do the same maneuvers and started scanning the skies to the north, west and south which were visible from my position.\r\n\r\nto my surprise, i saw several of these objects in the sky!  they were all doing similar maneuvers and as i counted them, i was sure i counted approximately 8 to 10 of these things.  the were positioned from the southeast to the northwest from what i was able to discern.  all of them were able to make the same movements as i previously described.\r\n\r\ni was moderately excited to have observed these things and i went inside my home about 8:15 pm to rest and recall what i had seen.  as i said, i have no idea what these things are and i first thought maybe the military has a new flying object and was testing here in wisconsin.  also, could these things just have been air traffic in some kind of holding pattern for chicago ��� o'hare or milwaukee ��� mitchell airports.  i heard no sounds coming from these things as well but i will also state, these were quite high up in the sky and maybe inaudible to me.  i cannot think of any other information to put into this short report.  below is a stylized layout of the flashing lights i saw on that night.  \r\n\r\ni made sketch of what i saw in the sky, which are the flashing light positions.  the crossed lines are for my reference to draw the ���thing��� to some degree of scale as i can remember.  if there is an explanation, please let me know what it is.  thank you.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

 \r\ni'm not quite sure if it was july 17th exactly.. but it was definitely in july 2010.. honestly, i have seen three definite ufos this year alone, i managed to catch the other two on video - but this one was more amazing than those two, in the way that this one was lower; not just lights. i could see the shape, colour, flight patterns, and even the detail on the metallic surface. it had a 'hatch' on the bottom - and im only calling it a hatch because i can think of no other word for it.. that place where the aliens walk out on a ramp from in the movies, and also where the 'abduction ray' comes from.. around that, were three lights, and three lines, as if seperating the craft into three seperate sections - or maybe just for design. \r\n\r\ni was sleeping in the attic which had been converted into a bedroom, in my cousins house. both of us have trouble sleeping so i was looking out the skylight window when this event occured. it was around 4:30am (gmt)and i was staring at this object the whole time while it hovered slowly accross the night sky.\r\n\r\nas soon as this ufo came into view, i thought to myself \"now there's a classic examply of a flying saucer - just like the typical interpretation\"\r\n\r\ni had a camera phone right beside me, but i didnt want to miss the opportunity to watch this ufo for as long as i could. when i say \"ufo\" i do not mean \"unidentified flying object\" - i mean an alien spaceship, because i only use the term 'ufo' when i know thats exactly what it is.\r\n\r\ni was happy to see it so clearly, in such detail.\r\ni have always believed in aliens, and that they are here on earth. recording this on my phone - where videos could not be faked, would've proved it to everybody who got to see it.. i wish i had recorded a video of this ufo passing above me, but i was too pre-occupied with watching it to even think about picking up my phone.\r\n\r\nmy cousin said \"what did you see?\" when he saw me stare.. i replied \"oh.. just a ufo..\" as if it was nothing to me, but it was.. i only replied in such a way because i had seen several ufos before, and already known of their presence.\r\n\r\ni will report the other ufos with video foorage, and the exact time and date. i just wanted to start with this one. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

and general star gazing.\r\n\r\nat about 10:45 i noticed what looked like a star in the north western sky at about 15 - 20 degrees above the horizon.  it seemed to be about a magnitude 2 in brightness.  the reason this caught my attention is because i am very familiar with the night sky and this \"star\" didn't seem to belong in that part of the sky.\r\n\r\ni immediately looked at it through my binoculars but it simple appeared to be a star.  it was not moving and it was quickly changing colors just as a star does when it is low in the sky.\r\n\r\ni still felt that this object should not be in the position it was if it was a star so every couple of minutes i would check it out again through the binoculars to see if its position had changed.  every time i checked it was in the same position.  i did this for about 15 minutes at which point i knew if it was a star i should have been able to tell that it had dropped a few degrees lower towards the horizon due to the movement of the earth.  it had not moved at all.\r\n\r\nit was by this time, being interested in and believing that there are objects in the sky that are unexplainable, i began thinking to myself, \"if you're not going to move down, move up.  then i will know you're not a star.\"\r\nstill no movement was noticed.\r\n\r\nafter about 15 minutes of noticing this object, i looked at it again and it finally looked like it had moved.  i once again looked at it through the binoculars and it was finally moving in an easterly direction.  it still looked exactly like a star until it had moved far enough to be approximately nnw of me. i could then start seeing that there were 3 distinct light on this object. there were two orange lights that stayed lit continuously and one red light in the middle that pulsated.  i did not see a green light or a white strobe light like you would expect to see on an airplane.\r\n\r\ni followed the object using my binoculars all the way across the sky from west to east until it got in the north eastern sky until it was close to the position in the sky very close to the constellation auriga.  at this time it was like someone just turned out the lights.  it was if there was nothing ever there.\r\n\r\ni then began checking out the rest of the sky again.  i noticed something to the north again traveling west to east but after looking at it through the binoculars it appeared to have the lighting of a traditional aircraft.\r\n\r\ni then looked back to the ne where the unidentified object had disappeared and didn't see anything.  at the same time a relatively bright orange light was seen moving north to south at about the same elevation in the sky as the original object that i was tracking. i looked at it through the binoculars and appeared almost identical to the original object but the separation in the three lights was not as noticeable.  i have no idea if this was the same object but considering the timing and the location in the sky i would assume it was.\r\n\r\nthe next night i went to this same spot wanting to watch an airplane traveling near the same path as the object i had seen the night before thinking that a plane my appear also as a star like object from a distance near the north western horizon.  i was fortunate enough to see one close to the same location.  i was able to distinguish it as looking like an airplane until it was very close to the horizon.  even then it looked nothing like the object i saw when i first noticed it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

driver in front of me started to drive out of his lane.  i thought he was drunk, so widely went around him. i looked at him while passing and he was turning his head looking to the right/ahead of us.   i then noticed what he was looking at:  lights in the sky about 1- 2 o'clock to our right and far ahead. there were two red lights diagonal to each other on the left side and a whitish-greenish light to the right.  the white/green one was not in alignment with the red ones, but had a similarness that it appeared to be associated with the red ones.  i remember recalling that they were in the distance, yet pretty far apart so how could they be \"one plane?\"   but then i thought that due to the colors (red and greenish) it must be a plane.  but these lights were far in the distance (15 miles??) and pretty far apart,  yet stayed in the same place for about the one minute i could see them while trying to drive.   i wanted to stop but i was on the freeway near the merge with 680, was tired,  and didn't want to risk getting hit from behind should someone else not be paying attention to the road while looking at these lights.      \r\n\r\nthen i thought they might have been lights for a concert in the hills or something but realized it was about 1 o'clock a.M.  i believe there is a curfew.   also i thought their location was higher than any hills around the area.    i saw a plane a minute or two later to the left of me over martinez and it clearly had lights that were closer together, even though the plane was closer to me that the lights had been.  \r\n\r\ni saw a 747

of red lights at about 15 degrees off the horizon traveling west to east, my right to left. the lights were fixed and appeared to be on a craft like a helicopter but didn't have faa helicopter navigation light colors nor blinking, all the lights faded and brightened in unison about once a second. it seemed like it could have been a large helicopter traveling adjacent to i-44, an east/west highway that intersected with i-270 about a mile or two from where i was when i first noticed it entering my field of vision. as i traveled and exited on to i-44 east, the object appeared to move in a southeast direction as i was getting closer to it. it was about the \"size\" of a dime at the closest i then saw it. i was tempted to stay on i-270 to possibly catch up to it as i was getting closer to it, but i continued on home - i don't go chasing ufos or possible ufos. after merging onto i-44 i started to see if i could yet see it in the distance by glancing to my right while driving. i didn't see anything for about a mile, there also being some small hills at that side of the highway that blocked a closer perspective. after clearing the last of these small hills there was suddenly, fairly close, the same incongruently shaped triangle of lights, but now all white and not blinking but keeping a constant brightness and much closer. i traveling east, the craft was at a 45 degree angle to my right just above the windshield while i was driving, so i could now only glance up to it once in a while. while i glanced up at it, it quickly had two of its lights flare up to a brighter white while the \"back\" white light went out. every time i got a chance to glance up to it while it was slowly passing in front of me about 45 degrees above me now, it was about the \"size\" of a dollar coin. it's lighting configuration had dimmed but stayed all white but also was slightly changing each time, additional lights coming into view when i would look up. by the time it passed at about 45 degrees to my left, about 15 degrees off the horizon, it seemed i could see a very black indefinite triangular structure that had four evenly spaced white lights on what from my perspective was its back with its point facing in the direction it was traveling away from me. there was additional lighting along a possible bottom and edges, those not so symmetrical as the four \"back\" lights. the craft appeared to be moving slower than a plane could. i could not tell if there was sound from it for the interstate highway noise.\r\n\r\ntwo of the previous three nights i also saw lights that didn't appear to be on conventional craft while i was driving, each not far from a point i saw tonight's craft, but i could not view them long enough to figure out what it was or wasn't. so, i'm making this report as tonight's craft did not appear it could have been conventional by its lighting color and configuration changes. it's weird to me that 3 of the past 4 nights i've seen strange lights as i was traveling somewhere along the same route each night between my home in st. louis and a place in des peres. last year i had several mufon reported sightings and pictures of day and night craft, clearly unconventional. this year i've had a few clear unconventional night sightings, but a lot of sightings that have kept me wondering what it was i saw, and i'm wondering what's up with that

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A group of us were coming back from an scca car race at sears point, ca.  the group was divided into two vehicles.  the lead vehicle was a pick up truck which was towing the formula ford race car on an open trailer.  in its cab were three of us; all friends of about the same age..Approximately 22 to 25 years of age.  the railing vehicle was a late model bmw sedan in which there were five occupants.  we were headed south on highway 5, returning home after a long weekend of racing.\r\n\r\nthere was very little traffic on the highway (it was lightly travelled at the time) and we were probably traveling in excess of 60 miles per hour as the old truck just didn't have much torque; the motor was tired.  approximately 70 or so miles south of the junction of the ..... and the 5 we noticed far in the distance the presence of several 5 or 6 oval shaped, intense blue lights moving erratically from east to west across the highway.  the lights moved in random directions, up and down and sideways, orbiting each other at times but with no specific discernible purpose or direct linkage.  at first site we remarked that it had to be a police helicopter.  an interesting observation is that although two of us had flight experience and knew aviation well, we nevertheless described these lights as belonging to a helicopter.....In reality, no helicopter would demonstrate this peculiar behavior.  it was almost as though at not being able to describe what the lights were, we unanimously decided that they were a helicopter.  what follows is a glimpse into just how cognizant the human animal is regarding the unearthly aspect of this phenomenon.  this ascribing of an explanation is the beginning of the panic.\r\n\r\nthe lights slowly crossed the highway from east to west until they were off the road to our right, (west of highway 5).  they stopped their east-west movement and waited until our vehicles were abeam of their position.  how far they were from us is difficult to estimate as the night was pitch black and there were no reference points visible.  you could just barely make out the outlines of the rolling barren hills that wind their way to the west of the highway, behind the light sources.  they continued to orbit and move in random directions.  at once we were gripped with a sudden and inescapable realization that what we were witnessing was not from our planet.  it was intuitively obvious that these lights were under some form of control and their behavior was not of this world.  all three of us in the cabin of the truck began to scream and to urge the driver to speed up.  we didn't know that the same form of hysteria had possessed the occupants of the car behind ours.  the best recollection i have of the physical manifestations of these objects/lights was that they behaved as luminous objects that possessed a brilliantly, almost incandescently lighted exterior envelope.  it is as though the skin of the object was intensely luminous, giving out an incandescent blueish light, very similar to the light emitted by an electric arch tig or mig welder; that kind of intensity and localized focus. the color was constant across the oval; it did not differ in shade.  the edges of the light were not sharply demarcated but \"fuzzy\".  \r\n\r\nthe objects/lights followed us for a few minutes, staying abeam of our vehicles but maintaining their random pseudo-orbital movements.  i can vividly remember the sheer horror of the experience and the panic inside that truck cab.  we were smart kids who knew about flight; this was no ordinary man-made machine.  this was from out of this world and we just knew we had to run away.  almost a limbic response to the stimulus.  odd.  i remember that for a brief period of time the objects came marginally closer to our vehicles (closing the distance by half or so) and they then suddenly separated and flew in widely different directions westward and at low altitude; almost in a terrain following mode.  in a few seconds they had disappeared.\r\n\r\nthe crush of the last few minutes of sheer horror slowly subsided and we began to slowly disengage (best word to describe the feeling) from the event.  we talked about it in questioning tones for a few minutes and then silence until the next gas stop.  by the time we were half way home we had stopped talking about the incident.  when we arrived in los angeles all of us spoke maybe a few words about the incident in the driveway and that was it.  for the past thirty-five years we have never touched the subject.  ever.  all of us except for the driver of the trailing vehicle who passed away some time after the incident, have remained in constant touch and we see each other regularly.  we have been the best of friends for all of these years.\r\n\r\nwhat is extremely interesting is that i have wanted to broach the subject with my circle of friends on multiple occasions and something holds me back.  i don't know what it is but it is a powerful subconscious force at work.\r\n\r\nthe events i have just listed occurred exactly as i have described them.  i have done this to the best of my recollection and abilities.  none of this has been dramatized or embellished.  the events remains deeply etched in my memory.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

in the night sky, i looked up, and saw a red or orange glowing light that looked odd as it seemed larger and brighter than ones i see marking planes and helicopters. it resembled meteors i have seen in it's shape and color, but seemed larger and was moveing quite slow, a bit slower than most of the airtraffic i usualy see. i pointed it out to my wife, and i jokeingly said \" check out this ufo \". my wife laughed and said that it was just a plane, then she noticed that it didn't apear to have any of the small, flashing lights one expects on a plane. she suggested the possibility of a meteor, but we both thought it moved much too slow, and didn't have a tail like a \"shooting star\" it began to glow brighter and my wife got excited and opened the door to the living room and shouted for our son to come look. after a moment, my our son appeared just as the light seemed to dim and go out. we all talked for a moment about how \"cool\" it was to have seen it and what it could have been, when the light seemed to come back on. it was very dim at first, then it returned to it's origanal brightness. it continued to travel at the same speed and in the same direction it had previously. it appeared to be in the sky to the south or southeast of our home. it moved from west to east and appeared to be traveling in a straight line, approximately level. i couldn't say how large it was or how far away it might have been. it looked like it was somewhere over gwinnett, but may have been further south. after a moment it became obscured by trees and left our view. the entire sighting lasted for about a minute and a half, it was witnessed by myself, my wife and my son. the object didn't appear like a plane or helicopter or anything common, it was similiar to a meteor in some ways but it seemed to fly very slowly and it appeared to maintain a level course, it didn't seem to be falling. i have seen the international space station cross over at night before, and it wasn't that either. it appeared to move slower and to be lower in altitude. i surmise there is a mundane explanation for it, i just don't know what it might be. it was an \"object\", it was \"flying\" and i don't know what was.  i did a google search to see if anyone else might have reported anything, which is how i came upon your websight. i feel that this sighting probably has a mundane explanation, and i hope you would be kind enough to share it with me if possible.","distance":"Over One

. at first i said nothing to my brothers just incase i was imagining things , but the object just kept zipping around the sky so i pointed out what i was witnessing . first jeff noticed then anthony , we could not believe what we were seeing with our eyes . this red light was moving so fast that it was , at times hard to keep up with it. within 5 mins of watching. another two glowing objects , one glowing green and one glowing a kind of yellow appeared out of nowhere and began to dart around the sky around the first red light . the entire event lasted up to 20 mins , but the last two lights were only visible for the last 5 minutes or so . the strange thing was that they seemed to be trying to chase or scare away the red light and it worked because all 3 lights just simply took off at a crazy speed and were all instantly gone , just like that . to this day whenever we all catch up , that event always comes up in conversation and still amazes and confuses us to this day . how could anything travel that fast , come to a complete stop with no inertia at all , then take off at a completely different angle at a phenomenal speed without being held to the laws of our physics ?
