early june of 2017,\r\n\r\ni suffered a headache at around 11:00 pm so i decided to go to bed. i entered my bed room and my head began to feel heavy and eyes began to hurt with a intense pain. i got into bed and almost instantly i fell asleep. what seemed like seconds later i heard the tv and the playstation 4 turn on down stairs, upon hearing this i thought maybe my wife was home from work. i realized that couldn't be possible because she didn't get off until later that day. fully aware of what was going on (but obviously still tired) i tried to get out of bed but found myself unable to move at the slightest. sleep paraylsis had been common for me throughout life so at first i wasn't too worried but this was different.  i began to panic and try to force myself out of this paralysis but everytime i used energy i heard a voice inside of my head tell me to stop moving and sleep. i knew the voice wasn't my own because at the same time i was talking to my self in my head (almost yelling) saying \"wake up now!\" this battle with the other voice, that almost seemed to control me went on for about 15 minutes until i finally had enough. i said a quick prayer and promptly rolled over onto my back trying to catch my breath when suddenly i saw it! \r\n please be aware: the incident below happened in a matter of seconds so i am trying to describe as best as possible.\r\ndirectly in front of me on my window sill was a small figure, if i had to estimate it was maybe 3 feet tall. i did not see any eyes because the room was pitch black, but the silhouette of the figure was clearly visible  because of the light that shown through the blinds. i believe it had its back towards me, one hand was raised and there was a bright blue almost white light that was casting through the window onto it. a quick flash was emitted and the being was gone, almost instantly that the being had left that my headache, eye pain, and fatigue also left.\r\n\r\nthis experience has truly, truly changed my life. i have had other incidents in my life that now that i look back on after doing more research i believe we're other visitations and or abductions. i appreciate you taking the time to read this and if anyone could offer me help or insight , i'd be very greatful.","distance":"20 Feet or

window left opened to let in some air. aroung 3:20 a.M., i head a thump noise coming from outside. having had a bear on our street looking for the garbage bins twice already that night, i thought this noise was the reappearance of this persistent bruin so i went to the window to look. fortunately, it turned out to be the closing car door of the newspaper guy making his early morning deliveries. \r\n\r\nfrom our bedroom window looking above my neighbour's house, something caught my eye. it was an extremely  bright light over burke mountain. this light was way too big and bright to be a star or a planet. i looked at it for a few minutes and found it to be unmoving, just sitting there hovering. it was definitely in the sky and not on the mountain itself. i could see some stars in the sky as the night was fairly cloudless. it was not a plane, helicopter or drone, did not have any flashing lights. i see aircrafts all the time landing or taking off from yvr and this was definitely not anything of the sort. \r\n\r\ni stared at it for a few minutes then went to the bathroom and when i returned to the window, the light had not moved, it was still there. i thought of taking a picture or video with my phone but decided it would amount to nothing close to depicting what i was seeing. it was simply too far to take a good photo of it. i then took the binoculars and what i saw mystified me. with the binoculars, this light was not one but five round lights side by side in a row. the middle light was the largest and most powerful. next to it on each sides were two others also round but not as big and therefore not as powerful. they each emitted their own beam of light powerful enough to be radiating above, below and on each side of this row of lights. \r\n\r\ni stared at it for a few minutes more then around 3:45 a.M., as they simply continued to beam, went back to bed. it did not move but remained stationary the entire time i was looking through the binoculars. these lights reminded me of very bright stadium lights, giving off a powerful bright white light, meant to illuminate a large area. the lights were most definitely above the mountain, and not on it. i've lived in the area for many years and this was most definitely extremely odd and out of place. even if these lights had been on the mountain itself, there is nothing on that part of west burke mountain but trees. by the time i woke up at 7am, it was gone. i woke up my husband who had been sleeping downstairs, not wanting to deal with a hot bedroom. when i explained what i had seen, he casually replied that i had seen a ufo. later on that day, i told a neighbour what i had seen. he suggested that it could have been someone or something on quarrie road. but this was impossible. that road is on the east side of the mountain and these lights were most definitely on its west side and above the tree line, not on it. besides, who would have such powerful beams and use them in the middle of the night? why bring them there to shine down on the city below? from the way they were pointing, it looked like they were aimed at somewhere near surrey and the u.S. border.\r\n\r\nthe whole time i watched these lights with my binoculars, i had a feeling that someone or something was watching. but what or who? what sort of technology could hover, and stationarily beam light on the ground in the middle of the night and for what reason so close to a major population  centre like metro vancouver? who was behind these lights? something or someone certainly was. and they were to close for my comfort. this experience left me mystified, perplexed and most definitely questioning not so much what i saw but why were these powerful lights there, who were behind them and to what purpose? july 2nd was a sunday on a long holiday weekend, the day after canada day, immediately after the fireworks. it didn't make any sense at all. it's been a few days now and i still carry with me an unsettled and eerie feeling of what i saw that night.

afternoon (1:30pm cst). i saw a cigar shaped, light colored (white?) object heading south from the north toward a cloud. i then see a dark object heading from below, assuming from the east, but definitely from below, toward the same cloud. i was thinking the dark object was a large bird, just gliding. the objects were similar in size from my viewpoint. i just assumed the white one was further away, since i thought it to be a plane. i saw the white object enter the cloud. i then see the dark object enter the cloud. i then see the white object leave the cloud back in the direction it came from, back toward the north. i continue to watch for the dark object, and do not see one. i glance back to the white object, it is continuing on. i look back to the cloud, and watched it dissapate as it blew it's way south over the next few minutes, never seeing the dark object again. i did look to the direction the white one was headed in, but i didn't see anything. what i viewed for rate of speed for the white one was seemingly no different from first site to end of site. i can only say i thought it was a plane for the rate that it was going. i informed the person doing yardwork with me of what i had just seen. since they were not looking up, they had not seen anything. they stated, \"they're always watching.\" i was amazed i had seen something during daylight hours. i am sure that was not an airplane or a bird i had seen. i then immediately typed a note so as to not leave out details. in hindsight, it was odd to not hear sound-for as many planes that i see at what appears to be that high of an altitude, for the size that it was, there was no 'plane' noise. considering it went into a cloud, the altitude was much lower than i had assumed. i'm realizing how many wingless planes i've seen over the years.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path

attention thinking it was about to explode and begin a nearby fireworks show. to our amazement, the \"firework\" stopped dropping and sat still for a few seconds while still shining bright. i pulled out my phone as we both wondered out loud what the \"f\" it was that we were looking at. \r\n\r\nthe object began to move horizontally from its fixed position while emitting a trail of what looked to be sparks to one side. i captured a short video where the orangish trail is visible. \r\n\r\ni can't remember why i stopped filming but a few seconds later i resumed filming and as i zoomed into the object it took on almost an orb shape on my video due to not being able to focus. a few seconds later an identicle object in the sky appeared above and to the right of the object we had been filming. i was very focused on my video but my friend was watching the whole time with his naked eye and remarking about how extraordinary it was and can be heard in the background (language is nsfw).

phone. at 10:15 pm est my wife and children noticed a orb come out of the tree line to our direct south. the orb was giving off its own red and orange pulsating light (like a fire, but more red). my wife and kids did not think anything unusual at first, as the neighbors were lighting off fireworks (some of which were quite large). the orb continued on a path traveling directly toward us for a duration of a minute or two.\r\n\r\nat that point, my wife and kids started to seriously consider this \"firework\" may be a ufo. my wife sent my youngest son in to get me, he walked in and told me a ufo was outside and i needed to come out now. i was still in conversation on my cell but walked out to see.\r\n\r\ni walked outside and saw the orb, at first glance i thought \"this is just a flare on a parachute\".. i even said that to my wife. then i realized it wasnt a small flare, it was much larger. i believe it to be around 4-10 feet in diameter and at a distance of 300-400 feet away.\r\n\r\nthe orb continued to nearly hover without moving for about thirty seconds. i rushed to get off the phone so that i could video it. i started to video the object within about a minute of getting outside. by that time, the orb had continued east and started to ascend. it then continued on a steeper path up and directly to our east. within another minute, it disappeared into the clouds.\r\n\r\ni regret i did not get off the phone faster. by the time i started filming the orb, it had moved away from its closest point to us (300 ft or so) to a distance of a half mile

any known aircraft, and thee is no possibility it was a planet, as the sky was cloudy, and covered in city haze (even normally seen stars and iss not visible). also in the vicinity is a major casino with lights that are often reported as ufo's, but they look nothing like what i saw, along with being a few miles to the west of where this object was. slowly as i approached my home the object seemed
