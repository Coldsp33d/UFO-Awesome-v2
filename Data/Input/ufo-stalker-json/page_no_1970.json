remember that on that particular night the weather was very misty and light rain would fall. that night i had a wierd sensation that something was going to happen. 1 hour later i entered a cafe/bar and ordered a drink and sat with my best friend viewing parc avenue north. then all of a sudden i noticed the first ball of fire descending from the sky over the town of mount royal. it was very obvious that the ball of fire suddenly lit up while it was descending below the misty clouds. seconds later the second ball of fire descended in the same fashion as the first. these objects lit up only when they were descending close over the town.The entire town of mount royal was illuninated in orange/red light. because it was greek orthodox eatser night i thought at first that it might be fireworks. greek orthodox kids often light up fire crackers celebrating the resurrection of jesus christ but i personally have never seen them throw flares or fireworks but i guess i was trying to find an explanation to what i saw. however the theory of these balls of fire being fireworks was flawed because fireworks do not light up as they are descending from the sky and these balls of fire came downwards in a very shaky way resembling a falling leaf or as if gliding downwards. this event took place at least 3 miles or more away from me so after witnessing the balls of fire eescending i could no longer see their activity but only the glow over the town. i had no car to drive there to investigate so i left it to that. the next morning i read the local newspaper and there was a story about ufo's over the town of mount royal descrbed as red/orange fireballs hovering silently all over the town as witnesses described it. only then i fully realized that what i witnessed was not fireworks but an actual ufo phenomena and that what witnesses describe about the characteristics of it are true and accurate. i have pondered since a little child to discover the meaning of these ufo's as we may call them but have only clouded theories and no solid answers. these balls of fire seemed intelligent but what on earth were they doing that night? what are they? too many

yellow,and the sometanks on there backs and another bag.They didn't have fingers but kinda web hands that look like to a bow and arrow.Their body were thin,and scaley,and legs also then,their feet had

all the sudden another alien came of the ship. he was much bigger then the others and seemed to give the others orders. tippi again began her barking and the alien closes to our house seemed to be

the the sky as i walk in because it's that nice time right before the sun rises. i was looking at the sky above the woods the turned my head towards the gym/pool building, which is to my left when i was it, it was a diamond like shape and it seemed to be glowing, it was white with a very very small hint of yellow, it looked aboout as far away as a plane would be but was much larger than a star or a plane light. it didn't flicker at all and it just sat there, i watched it as i kept walking wondering what it was, it didn't move or sway at all it just stayed still.I began to wonder if i was insane, suddenly i heard a russle in the bushes to my right i quicly looked at it hoping to catch sight of the rumored racoon that hangs around in our creek but saw nothing. i looked back to where i saw the diamond and it was still there, i looked around and no one else seemed to notice it. then i just kept staring at it in wonder, and it still did not move at all, i was starting to get a bit freaked out when i triped i looked had to look away to balance myself. i imediatly looked back to the area in the sky where i saw the diamond and it was gone, it just vanished, i looked all around the sky and didn't see it at all. now i was really freaked out and i wasn't about to tell anyone incase they might find it

out of view as it went behind the tops of trees and houses along the street. then it began to pick up speed so we accelerated until we were doing 70 mph going up that hill. then it went faster and faster until we couldn't keep up and it disappeared. every time my husband tried to look at it, it went behind a rooftop and he didn't get to see it. there were no other vehicles on the street at the

sitting outside in a fold out chair for about half an hour. i made sure to be real careful and preserve my night vision as best i could by putting the neighbor's light to my back and staying out of the reflections from the windows. this time i had brought a crappy little digital camera that had video too hoping to get some kind of proof.\r\n  right at 8:58pm coming directly overhead from the north i saw the same shadow against the stars i had before. i got alot better look at it this time, it was more of a boomerang shape than a triangle and had five to six pale yellow lights that looked like they wrapped around the craft from the bottom to the top with small spaces in between them. as i snapped on the video camera the screen partally blinded me and made it hard to focus the camera on the object. as it got right on top of me i just watched it with my naked eye while holding the camera in that general direction and praying i caught something. i closed my right eye so the lcd screen would be shut out a bit and kept my eye on it as it made its way south. right before i lost it i clicked over to the regular camera and snapped several pictures.\r\n  after the event i went directly inside to check the camera and after playing with the settings i found all i caught were stars though there was one anomaly that i couldn't really make out. i think i was moving the camera and it was zoomed in. i just don't have the equipment needed to catch this thing. it moves fast and again made no sound. \r\n  attached is the video i took as well as two pictures. i have three more that i could send as well. \r\n  like i said before if anyone in the houston, huntsville, corsicana, or dallas/fort worth area has seen a like object contact me at *(wit's email address deleted--cms/sg) i can almost guarantee it will be back tomorrow night.

in 1978 or 1979 (i never could remember the year). i was traveling from east to west as i turned onto little mack ave. it was a friday. i thought that it was a reflection off the wing of a plain or something, and remember it was just dusk at the time and there was still a sunset to the west. just ahead, at matin rd., i saw it coming closer, so i turned west onto martin rd. at the intersection (i could never remember if i had to stop at the traffic light there at all, but i know there is one at that intersection), and then i turned directly left into a church parking lot. the disk like craft came down directly over the church/rectory and hovered about 20 ft. above it. i just couldn't believe it. it was silently rotating with bright lights coming off the bottom ot it. it was disk-like with a very wide band of windows around the middle of the thing. thinking back now, the wide band of windows must not have been rotating with the rest of the craft. it was very early spring time, and i had some young chilren in the back set of the car. i sat parked and looking up at it right straight out of my front windshield. there were people/beings (?) looking down at me. it looked like some sort of open spaced mess hall inside with them sitting around squarish tables. two of them then were standing up and came up to the windows, and they just started down at me and the car. others at the tables then turned their heads as if to notice my car. they had shoulder length light hair. their hair styles reminded me of the old page-boy style from years ago. they seemed to have on some sort of jump-suit. i remember thinking that one of them must have been female. i knew they could see me, and it felt really weird to me that they could see me and knew i was there. i can't remember if i'd turned my car engine off or if my car was still runnig (i've always wondered about that). i could see right into their craft. it was very brightly lit up inside. i don't remember seeing/hearing any other traffic lights/car noises or anything. it just seemed totally dark out, and there was no noise at all. i remember i had my hands on the steering wheel. then all of a sudden the craft went right up about aprox. 100 ft. (maybe less), and it veered off to the south-west slowly at first, then it went at lighting speed till it was just a pin prick of light in the sky. i thought that someone else must have seen the thing (no other cars were around at all, no traffic nothing), and i wanted to see where it went. so, i left the parking lot by it's exit onto a side street, whick i took till i got to 11 mile rd. but, by then it wasn't visable at all. i turned left (east) onto 11 mile rd., and i considered going to the police station there at jefferson ave., but thought they'd think i was crazy. i noticed some traffic then. so, i didn't stop at the station, but just turned and contiuned on. i don't know why i just went home, and i didn't think/talk about it at all that night, nor all weekend. also, i didn't phone or tell anyone about it that night either. the children in the back seat were to young to remember what happened. it's possible it may have taken place early in the spring of 1978. i could never remember the date/year at all, but have tried to often. for some reason i can't, but my best guess is that it was in 1979. i know (i'm positive) it was a friday near dusk when i saw this. i didn't feel afraid, but there was some mild fear when the two figures were at the window of their craft looking down at my car. i think i felt this way because i had young children in the back seat of my car with me. i was also in awe that this thing was hovering so close by me over a church/rectory. i didn't have to streach my neck up or back to see it out of my front car windshield at all. it was just like watching something on screen right out of my car windshield. i remember it was totally black out as i watched this thing from the driver's seat of my car. i've wondered about it being totally dark out then, since i could see the sunset when i was turning south onto little mack ave. just a little bit before. i also never took noticed of the time when i got home. the next tuesday, on the car radio i heard that there were sightings of ufo's over northern mi. i've never talked about this with anyone. i'm an educated person with advanced degrees, and i want to remain totally anonymous and not be contacted by anyone. i felt i had to tell mufon about what i saw and i hope that it may be of some help to you and also others. the above phone # and email address are not mine, but bogus i'm sorry to say. i had to put somethng in those areas so i could submit this to you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25608,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.50205,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09282010-0016","longitude":-82.889864,"occurred":289036800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1285716846000,"summary":"Rotating with lights behind central band of  windows-tall blond people?? beings  looking down at my car","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11535,"locationName":"St Clair Shores, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:96969"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Houston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"     this event happened in 1992, in houston, texas. intersection of edgebrook and balcones.  exact date unknown. it was approximately midnight. i was 22 at the time. still living with my parents and attending college.  my mother and i decided to get out for a midnight snack. we headed to the convenient store about a mile away. we crossed over edgebrook into the median. before crossing to the other side we noticed this large disc-shaped object with white lights all around the outside of the craft.  it seemed as though it were about 30 or 40 feet wide. it hovered over our car for about 45 secs.  we were in total disbelief. it seemed as though it were really low. like perhaps 100 feet above us.  we looked at each other after both viewing the object. then looked back for about 10 secs at the unknown craft. there was complete and utter silence. the craft made no noise.  then it simply disappeared at a high rate of speed. the object was truly a ufo.  i have never seen anything that closely resembles what i saw before or after that night.

to bed we decided to take our dog for a walk since the rain had stopped.\r\n\r\nthis was at about 8:30 pm.  as we walked the sky was strange.  it was as if the sky had been split in two as the low pressure system and dark clouds took up half the sky while the other was crystal clear with a blanket of stars.\r\n\r\nsince all of the street lights were out the clear part of the sky was incredible.  i paused for a minute and looked up.  what i saw was a small white light traveling extremely fast through the sky.  it was apparent that this light source was extremely high in the sky.  \r\n\r\nat first i thought it might be a plane, but it was moving at a speed much faster than a plane in the sky.  it was a single white light with no blinking red or other colored lights. i watched it for a second or two then commented to my son and husband about the light.\r\n\r\nmy son looked up and immediately saw the light.  he agreed with me that it was traveling at a much faster speed than any airplane you could see in the clouds.  several seconds later my husband saw it as well.\r\n\r\nwe watched it go on a trajectory from west to east and it probably only took about 30 seconds to completely cross the night sky.  we lost site of the object when it appeared to cross lower in the sky.  the light faded in intensity.  this could have been due to the storm clouds that were still in that portion of the sky.  it was as if it faded away.  as long as we were able to see the light it continued at this incredible speed.\r\n\r\ni���ve seen lots of airplanes in the air.  i���ve seen the shuttle take off from the cape in florida.  i���ve never seen anything move that fast in the sky.  it was completely unexplainable.\r\n\r\nthis was not a shooting star or meteor.   it had no tail or anything following it.  just a single point of light traveling at incredible speeds.\r\n\r\ni never felt threatend.....Or afraid.  just mystified about what i was seeing.  there were planes in the sky

it on the clear starlit night we had last night.  the lights on the wings were very pronounced.  i live behind the monterey airport and see aircraft all the time, and this was no airplane or jet that i have ever seen.  i was blown away, spooked but also very intrigued, when it made its 1st pass i called my wife outside and she saw the subsequent passes.  our airport is a regional airport and

last night and they most closely resemble the photos or drawings of the phoenix sightings of 1997, i am attaching photos of what i found online that match it.  it was clearly not like anything i have
