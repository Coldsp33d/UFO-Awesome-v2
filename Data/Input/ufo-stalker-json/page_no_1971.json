[first name removed/cms/dr] says he thinks the one the night before was actually brighter than venus but just didn't have the star things poking out like venus does - it was just a glob of light like this one was too.  \r\n \r\nwell, we're watching this thing approach, fly right over us and we turned around to follow it's path.  as it got closer to the east, it suddenly went up! and completely faded off in a second.  we both saw a couple small, faint flashes but not plane light flashes as it changed from the level flight path to the straight up one.  we could not believe it!  we even burst out laughing like you do when something is so strange and so completely unlikely to happen to you.  \r\n \r\nwe were in a state of shock, not knowing quite what to think.  so about 1/2 hour later, we went out again, and this time, there were planes in the sky which we could easily see their white, red and green lights blinking even the one that was probably about 15k feet or better so the two things we have seen were not planes plus there was no comparison on size - the planes were like 100th the size as the light blobs.  the second one also made no a sound.  now we did see what was probably a regular satillite and they are much, much smaller and much higher.  either way, we are shocked.  we have noticed both sightings were when there were no planes in the sky at all.  either time.  we are on a flight path from points north - portland, seattle south to la or the bay area - and they usually follow the mountain ranges or i-5 with the flights on pretty much hourly schedules.  very interesting that this second one was coming from west to east at sort of a southerly heading cuz there are no flights coming from that way ever.  there is nothing in that direction but the pacific ocean.  my husband estimated the first light at about 10k feet and the second one at maybe 15k feet.  we live in a small town without interference from city lights so our view of the night sky is good.

there was also a cluster of brilliant white lights on the underside(ground side) of the object.  it would remain motionless for 5 minutes or so and then veer off either to the north or the east.  returning after a few mintues.  there was no sound.  the sky was clear at the objects altitude but the was a layer of light fog below below the object to the ground.  we took several digital pictures and i tried my night vision scope for a better look.  the nvg image was washed out by the brilliance of the white light.  i could make out no further details as far as shape thru the nvg.  overall, i estimate the altitude as not more than 1,000 feet, and the object appeared to have more of a diamond shape than anything else.  at times, all of the lights would blink out, returning a few seconds later.\r\nmy final impression was that it may have been a kite, but i could see no one along the shoreline or on the bluff above the beach through the nvg.  there was no way i could determine the

stassney from 35. i saw to my right, over the city, a bright light that appeared to be floating. it was brighter than any plane i'd ever seen. i pointed out to my friend who was driving and could only catch glimpses of it as per trees, but noticed immediately that it was too far away to shine as brightly any typical aircraft. i considered shortly that it may be a helicopter with a spotlight, but it was a very well balanced light source that shone like a prism, not a spotlight. we pulled into a left turn lane and stared at it, where we watched for about one minute. i was only able to take one photo from this point, my camera would not cooperate. we turned, pulled the car over and quickly jumped out. the aircraft hovered for another two minutes or so while we repeated our bewilderment to each other in the street. \"what is that? no way\", \"that's a ufo, this is incredible\", over and over. i snapped two more photos. my camera was responding slowly and i gave up on taking photos to pay better attention to the aircraft, but the two photos were taken when it dimmed it's light to a red shade and moved toward us. more graceful than any helicopter. this is when i gave up taking photos and watched. it passed above us heading southeast. it was very dark in color when we saw the underside of it. like that of a stealth aircraft. it was almost rectangular in shape with one corner leading the way. it passed silently over us, speeding up as it passed and sending a few faint pulses of light. i don't know what to think, but i've encountered people in this town that i've felt absolutely zero human connection with. i don't know what to think about that. i've seen mysterious lights in the sky before but never anything like this, and i had a close friend by my side that saw

often, but have not previously had a sighting and wasn't thinking about it when this took place. i wouldn���t have noticed these objects at all except for a bizarre incident that happened first, so i���ve described that as well.)\r\n\r\nyesterday was a beautiful sunny sunday morning with a clear blue sky. i was out walking southward around 10:00 a.M. on a fort collins street, warming up for a run when something very strange caught my eye. about 40-50 feet above a house across the street to the west was a gigantic group of large birds, moving circularly in a tight funnel, wider at the top and narrower below. this house has been under renovation the last few weeks, so my first impression was that they possibly were buzzards that had found something upturned from the construction. \r\n\r\nthe pattern of their circulation and thermal-riding was somewhat like the vultures-above-man-in-desert clich���, but i dismissed that notion as unlikely to occur above this urban house, and there were far too many of them. there were at least 40 birds, maybe even 50 or 60. moreover, it appeared to be not a homogeneous flock of crows or other single species but a mixed group with variable sizes. this included a number of large birds that were clearly raptors, with big wingspans and brown feathers. any one of those would be noteworthy in this area, but very odd in that quantity and nearness to each other. i realized this loose ���bird tornado��� was actually slowly moving eastward and not staying above the house where i first noted them. as the still-circling formation started to pass over the street toward me, small numbers of birds peeled off and flew over my head eastward. \r\n\r\nit was while looking up at these smaller bunches of birds flying overhead that i saw two clear pinpoint lights above and beyond them to the south. one was white, and the other was red or very slightly pinkish-red. the white one was brighter and steady. the red one initially fluctuated a little in brightness but wasn���t blinking. as they moved farther away, the red one appeared steady also.\r\n\r\ni stopped looking at the bird funnel still passing over me and tried to figure out what those lights were. they were moving, but very slowly. they were not planes or helicopters. there was no sound except low ambient city noise (the birds were silent also). they had the clear bright quality of light-emitting sources, unlike reflected light off a balloon. if it weren���t the middle of a bright sunny day, they might have passed as stars. i���d say when i first saw them they were at about a 50��� angle from my vantage point, at a very rough guess 400-800 feet up. they were initially close enough to overhead that i automatically associated them with the birds��� strange behavior, although nothing logical warrants that. \r\n\r\nfrom that point on, i barely paid attention to the birds as they travelled eastward, although the last time i glanced, the funnel was breaking up about a block to the east. the two lights were slowing moving south and upward. their positions relative to one another changed, but the distance between the two objects didn���t. first the red light was to the upper right, then moved to lower right and possibly behind, then back to the upper right. \r\n\r\nrelative to my position they eventually dropped slightly in the sky (40��� or so) and shrank as they moved southward, but stayed more or less in the same spot in the sky as they diminished because of increasing altitude. i tracked them into the brilliance of the blue sky for about five minutes; they were faintly visible to an extremely long distance away.\r\n\r\nthere is the possibility that these were flares of some kind lofted by balloons, but i have several problems with that theory. although the distance was tricky to judge, initially i think they were close enough that i should have seen something supporting them, and there was nothing. they also would have to be linked together somehow to maintain that consistent distance. there would have to be a substantial and consistent linear north wind at their altitude to move them, but yesterday was a very still day, at least on the ground.\r\n\r\nas i said, i can���t help but link them with the birds��� anomalous behavior, although i have nothing logical to justify that other than their proximity.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the time i did not know what the heck i was seeing, only that i saw the cloudy mass on a similarly clear night while walking my dogs. in my report i said that my dogs were shaking and clearly freaked out by what seemed to be a black cloudy mass that was blocking out the stars.I was also taken back by what i saw because i couldnt tell how high up it was but it was huge and seemed to change shape.\r\n\r\nnow, for what happened last night. i have video and i have still photos as well.\r\ni was outside getting some fresh air as i often do at night.I am a night owl as it were. when im on the schedule i work the 1900 to 0700 shift outdoors as part of my job and im always looking up, a habit i got into after that experience described above.\r\nlast night was a strange night, the moon was very bright and nearly full.\r\nhowever their were intermittent cloud banks that were occassionally partially blocking the moons light.\r\nokay here is the weird part. when i saw what i am going to describe i had to wake my 25 year old son up to come outside to verify that i wasnt losing my mind. this similar black cloud mass was coming in front of the moon and blocking the light of the moon, but it was making an arc and returning to the same place in front of the moon repeatedly.\r\ni took my cell phone (iphone) and took video of the moon and its strange cloud mass and on camera i noticed a round white circle that would appear and disappear near the moon. it was at a 45 degree angle to the moon and\r\nappeared to the lower left of the moon.\r\nif this does not seem weird yet, read on.....I could record the episode on video and catch the phenomenon on still digital photos but, you could not see the white circle with your eye. what i mean is that my son and i were taking video of the object and could see it clearly on our video screen but if you looked just with your naked eye, their was no white circle at all. i thought at first that maybe its my phone camera malfunctioning, so we used my sons identical (iphone) and got the same results. now even stranger was the fact that over to the west of us was a star or what we assumed was a star that was very bright and when we pointed the camera at it we could not capture a picture or video of it.\r\nit was 50 times brighter than the white circle we were viewing to the east\r\nbut we absolutely could not capture it on camera.\r\nthe small white circle that was by the moon at times would be completely\r\ncovered by the cloudy black mass but we were able to film it as if it were not even covered by this cloud mass that seem to stay for awhile and then appeared to drift to the east only to reappear west of the moon and it would start all over. i watched this for over 2 hours and took several videos of the sighting that could be seen on camera but not by the naked eye. it was and is puzzling to me. it just makes no sense at all.\r\nhere we were looking at the monitor with one eye and getting clear video and stills and looking over the camera and seeing nothing at all.\r\nwhen we decided to call it a night we noticed that the bright star to the west was gone. it should have still been on the horizon but just over a bit like the rest of the stars. your starview changes as the night goes on, thats just the way it is, but it was gone.\r\nthe moon was still bright and the white circle was still clear as a bell on video but gone if you looked by eye.\r\nhey guys what the heck is going on here on cape cod. did anyone else see it? i hope so, because it would really mean alot to us if someone else experienced what we did. im happy to share the videos and stills with you but it will only show you the moon and its cloud mass and the little white circle, but i have no way of proving to you that we were not able to see it without the camera.\r\nlisten, i wouldnt bother reporting it but i am baffled and a bit frightened by the whole experience.\r\nmy son and i have been having the worst unexplained anxiety today.We both woke up very early and sat quietly in the livingroom sipping coffee just looking at each other without talking about it. it is physically impossible to have this happen isnt it? we have been trying to talk about it, but it just makes no sense at all. so after deciding that we were not going to make sense of this episode, i decided to write mufon.\r\nmaybe their is a reason and we just dont know enough about it.\r\nthank you for reading this long drawn out mess of a case.\r\nwe would very much appreciate any light you could shed on our sighting.\r\nif you can instruct me on how to get the video and stills off my cell phone and to you i will do so, im afraid i dont have alot of experience\r\nwith this (iphone) maybe i can email directly off of the phone to an email address of your choosing. call me if you are interested in the footage okay!!!\r\n\r\nregards\r\n[names

attached to a radio controlled airplane. i did not see anything when flying the rc plane. but when reviewing the video i found it twice, approximately in same location in sky as the plane did 2 pass's. \r\n\r\ni was out looking for a downed rc airplane i had lost earlier this week. i attached a video camera to my plane to circle over the area to see if i could find my downed airplane. looks like debris at first until you see the video frame by frame and then see it in same spot as plane circles around for next pass. \r\n\r\ni have tried to debunk it but the video is clear and movement of plane shows the dot is actually in the same area above the rc plane. you just have to see it the video for yourself. i know you will think it is just a flake of dust at first like i did but then see it frame by frame and see that it is by far not dust but an object in the sky. \r\n\r\nlike i said i did not see it in sky when flying the plane. i also did not pay much attention to it at first, instead i blew past it thinking it was debris and went looking for my rc plane in the video. i found a couple of white specs (thinking they could be my downed plane) and went back out to the field, turns out the specs were plants and a plastic bag. but when i was out there i noticed a military helicopter flying over. i didn't pay much attention to them. i went back home to do a slower closer look at the footage (still looking for my rc airplane.) and that is when i seen it, i was surprised asked my mther to come see it, she didn't know what to think, i then moved the footage forward to see if the second pass may have found my rc airplane and there it was again.\r\n\r\nthat is when i knew i caught something significant. i sent a email to you guys and took video camera back out to field. 3rd time out at field i found a couple of teenagers who had been out there during all of this making out in there car (they are in video)i decided not to bother them. i then seen another helicopter, flying really low and slow, i cought it on video!\r\n\r\nthe pilot looked at me turned and look at passenger and looked back at me the copter almost turned around but instead kept going.\r\n\r\ni sent my plane back up, i didn't catch anything in sky this time, but when i landed the plane the kids were leaving. i waved them over and talked to them i told them what i found on the video and asked them if they seen anything they said they didn't, then we herd a boom. it startled us they said what was that i wasnt sure but thought it may have been the plane because i smelled

up but the video was still rolling. \r\n\r\ni figured i would watch that footage and see what happened when the esc exploded, and that was the funny thing, there was no boom recorded! the video shows the smoking from it overheating and that's it.\r\n\r\ni am not transferring this video over the internet.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

what appeared to be an egg shaped object over hwy-59 in tomball, tx. it did not appear to me to be a hellicopter. occasionally it would flash a bright red (similar to a flare). i watched the object for almost 10 minutes as it went through some cumulous clouds. as it did, the clouds seemed to 'open up' arround it. i took photos with my cell phone, but after enlarging, i was un-able to see the object. today (9/26/10) at approximately the same time, i was outside and noticed 5, and the 6 egg-shaped whitish/silver objects travelling in a group. again, i took cell phone photos, but they were at such an altitude (at first approx 15,000 ft agl, and then later 30,000-40,000 ft agl) that they again did'nt show up. this time i had a flight attendant that was at my hous at the time, and i asked her to look at it with me- which she did, and verified that these objects were spreading out, then joining back together. as they reached a higher altitude as they floated south, they seemed to line up perfectly from north to south. they either were changing shape from round to oval, or were oval and simply wobbling. i also contacted the mufon tx state director as i watched them, but he was at another area of town, and could not locate them. in my opinion, they appeared to be under intelligent control. i am a military trained aerial observer. the closest possible explination would be weather balloons, but it would not explain their apparent seperation, and then re-organisation flight characteristics. please- if anyone has knowledge of balloon activity north of houston, let me know. if anyone has the ability to enhance these photos- also let me know.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25574,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.9701088,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09262010-0013","longitude":-99.8951431,"occurred":1285542600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1285548862000,"summary":"Grouping

winchester (one tenth of a mile before the hill/dilely road exit), when i spotted the object. the object caught my eye out of the 10'oclock position (nnw-north northwest). it was in plain sight maneuvering in an unfixed pattern, about 200' off the ground. it appeared to be located about 500' west of the hill/diley rd exit bridge, hovering over an empty field and partially the road.\r\n\r\nthe object itself was unlike anything i have ever seen. it was sort of egg shaped, without wings or other definition. however the luminosity of the object was the most prominent characteristic. when i first sighted it, the object was an extremely bright (mega-led bright) blue. after a few seconds, it gradually faded into an equally bright red color. it was not the standard blue and red lights of faa regulations common on all commercial/private aircraft. these lights were extremely bright and the source of the colored light encompassed the entire object. \r\n\r\ni estimate the object's size as being relatively small at about less than 4 feet in diameter. it never changed shape, morphed into individual lights nor did it have any dimensional shape. it hovered in a gliding pattern, lowering its altitude, however i never seen it land. i had direct visual contact with object for about 10-12 seconds max. i actually pulled the car onto the highway berm and came to a 5-10mph crawl, in order to soak in what i was seeing. other traffic (10-15 additional vehicles) going in both north and south directions on rt. 33, did not seem to be affected by the object (no one else stopped of slowed down). \r\n\r\nthe weather was partly cloudy, dry and the lighting was dusk.\r\n\r\ni might also add that 10 minutes prior to the sighting, i noticed an unusual amount of increased outgoing air-traffic originating from rickenbacker air base, located about 6 miles to the west from the sighting location. i saw several (5-7) separate large cargo aircraft depart the air base within a 5 minute span. this occurred 10 minutes or so before i was even in the area of the sighting.\r\n\r\nin closing, i have never seen anything unusual in the sky before. i am a fairly avid astronomy buff and am constantly looking into the night sky. this was certainly an event/object i can't seem to get a grasp on. i'm not sure if i really believe that extraterrestrial aliens are visiting the earth. i lean towards \"no\" due to the immense distances between even the closest stars, however after seeing this object, i am close to at least believing that the object i saw is beyond what mankind can/has produced.\r\n\r\nif anyone else seen this object at this time/date, please contact me at: [email address removed/cms/tg].\r\n\r\nthanks!","distance":"101-500
