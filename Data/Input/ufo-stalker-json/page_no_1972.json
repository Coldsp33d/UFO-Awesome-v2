character, and sanity. at approximately 11:30 pm edt on 9/19/2010, while standing on his south west facing porch,( if you look at a map of richmond, va. his house is on the north side of the 2300 block of grove ave., in the middle of the block. while standing on the aforementioned porch, he witnessed the 6 amber lights moving slowly, in a westerly and upward, semi-circular pattern, as the lights moved up, and to the west, he saw a commercial jet that was in a landing pattern heading ne towards richmond international airport. he estimated the lights to be at an altitude comparable to that of a helicopter, yet moving in total silence. when the jet flew over, he heard it's approach, and also heard it moving away, but that was the only sound he heard. the event ended as the lights, still in an upward, westerly, symmetrical semi-circular pattern, moved higher, and further toward the west, and then disappeared one at a time. of course he would be able to explain what he saw better than i. my friend is a very private person, and i told him i would get the ball rolling, so to speak, as to making an initial report, and find out if anyone else had reported the incident. being a person who is open to the possibility of technology, whether black ops, or extraterrestrial, his story left me very intrigued. a. flares don't move in upward formation. b. no known aircraft,(other than gliders) move silently. c. my friend is very intelligent, very mechanically minded, and beyond reproach. if you choose to investigate any other possible sightings of this event, and do find that it was not just his sighting that was reported, please contact me, and i believe i'll be able to get him to speak with you directly, as i know second hand information is fairly useless. i would also like to add, that he said that the incoming passenger jet, seemed to be at an altitude which would have made it likely that the flight crew would have witnessed the event. i hope that this is of at least some help, and as i stated, if you choose to investigate this alleged sighting, i firmly believe that i can get my friend to come forward. because this information is second hand, i see no purpose in signing a third party release. if the mufon network decides to follow up with the actual witness, i give my permission for anything i have submitted to be used by representatives of mufon, in order to arrange contact with the aforementioned witness. if i didn't think it was an actual sighting of something anomalous, i would not be wasting my time!\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n[name

for a cigarette, an avid ufo follower i always take this opportunity to look to the skies. on this night sunday 26th of september at apx 7:13pm, i saw something a solid white light to the north just coming into view over my neighbours roof travelling in a sth east direction at an estimated height of around 10,000meters and looked to be much bigger than an airbus at that distance, it made no sound at all in the extremely quiet area i live in, it looked to be slightly zigzagging and didn't move at a consistent speed though this may have been an illusion of staring at this light object from this distance, it was in view for around 2 minutes in total on a clear night.\r\ni ran inside called my 10yr son and grabbed my iphone but it was useless in these conditions, my son verified what i was seeing and he too was questioning what it was, the difference of navigation lights to this solid light and why there was no sound.\r\n\r\nit was not an aeroplane of any sort as there were no

like something falling off of something else, like an airplane, etc.  but it was not a shooting star, my sons are sure and i am nearsighted and had no glasses!  i am not a great witness but i hope someone else in california witnessed the same thing and can explain.  it gave me the feeling of a meteor, etc. but everyone said said it did not show characteristics of that or a shooting star.  it was much slower than a shooting star.  but could it have possibly been some rock or something that hit our atmosphere and we saw a small piece that had broken off or something as it entered our atmosphere?  anyway, it is driving me crazy.  i believe in aliens, etc but doubt i saw anything like that, darn it, lol.  did anyone else in my area see this or anyone have comments?  thanks, just curious.  ps  it did not look like a light, it looked very much like part of it was a fireball or had fire on it but not light.  there was also a very bright moon. a few minutes later, the fire seemed to go out or lessen and my nearsighted eyes could not see it but others could.  it seemed to fade and fall more.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\ndarn it  just realized no pictures but again, i hope someone who saw it did take photos, etc and can share more.  thank you.  i don't know if this helps, but it really seemed to be falling, not flying or moving around

was just as bright but the craft was moving away from me so it wasn't a landing light, i saw no other lights. it was on a curved path towards the south and increasing in altitude so it couldn't be a

(the whole event lasted only a few seconds.)  i was looking straight ahead when a movement on the distant skyline caught my eye.  a very bright, kind of \"star-like\" object was moving across the sky. it was round, very bright, and circular in shape.  it was moving so fast that it was out of my viewing range in a couple of seconds.  it moved at a steady speed, no jumping around.  it moved in a straight line, horizontally.  i ran as fast as i could down the street, hoping to get more of the sky in my view (we live in a suburb area, trees and rooftops were blocking my view of the sky).  when i came to an area where i could have seen where the object went, it was gone.  i asked my husband if he saw the object, and he did not.  he would had to have been looking exactly where i was, at the same exact moment, in order to have seen it.  we were both excited, that is for sure.\r\n \r\nwhen i saw the object, a bunch of thoughts trying to comprehend what i was looking at went through my mind.  falling star?  nope.  (stars fall vertically, this object was moving horizontally.)  a plane or jet?  nope.  (way too fast, no flashing lights, no distant motor noise.)  a comet or meteor?  nope.  (no trail behind the object, no flashing, and it was traveling at a very high speed horizontally, and also it had too steady of a movement.)\r\n \r\nin fact, on our way home from our walk, we saw an actual jet in the sky.  it did not even compare to what i experienced earlier.  it was so slow when i compared it to what i had seen.  also, we could hear the jet, and see the familiar shape as well as the flashing lights even though it was far away.  the object i saw earlier made no sound that i could hear from where i was standing.  there was only the bright round shape, no flashing lights, and silence.  it just zoomed past in a matter of seconds in a straight line. \r\n \r\ni asked my husband what words i used after seeing the object.  he told me i said, \"brighter than any stars in the sky at the time.\"  \"waaaaay too fast to be any plane or jet.\"  \"it was definitely being \"piloted;\" it looked like it was definitely going somewhere.\"  \"it was on a straight horizontal course.\"  \"i wish you had seen it, too.\"  \"someone else had to have seen it, i couldn't have been the only one.\" \"it was traveling too fast to be anything man-made.\"\r\n \r\ni lost sight of the object because it was too fast, and i couldn't get to where i could follow it in the sky fast enough to see where it went.  i sure wish that i could have.  seeing it was very intense.  i haven't been able to think of much else ever since.\r\n \r\ni have no pictures, no video, and doubt i would have had time to capture this object on either one.  i apologize for only being able to tell you what i witnessed.  i am an honest person and know what i saw.\r\n \r\nthanks for giving me a chance to share my u.F.O. story.  i hope that someone else experienced what i did and comes forward.  i would love to know just what it is that i saw.  \r\n \r\nlastly, i have \"instincts.\"  my instincts tell me that i witnessed something incredible.  when i'm not sure about something, i go by them.  so, here i

what i took to be a jet, but really a lot lower than a jet that big has ever been around here.  then i noted that i couldn't see either wings or a stabilizer.  so i got my son to look at it and said, \"that could be a ufo.  what do you think?\"  he looked and said, a bit subdued, \"i think it's a jet..\" but he was not at all sure.  (he has since decided that it was a ufo, and this has scared him.  he asked me not to tell anybody in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them to think we are weird.)\r\n\r\nthe object was so close, we surely should have heard it.  there was a lawnmower going on at a neighbor's house, but this should have been louder than the lawnmower to us.  a little later, we heard a jet very loudly even though we couldn't see it.  we definitely should have heard what we looked at if we could see it.\r\n\r\nthe part that struck me as the strangest was that the object's size shrank over 8-10 seconds, from what would have been about two inches if you held your fingers out in front of you, to too small to see.  it appeared to be going in a straight line, so this did not fit with a jet banking away from us.  and even if it was a jet banking away, i've never seen one get as far away as that in such a short time anyway.  again, we never saw wings or stabilizers.\r\n\r\nabout twenty

universe, of course, so they are always a possibility, but no more than winning the lottery seems to be a possibility.  i am not a person who has ever been fascinated with aliens, extraterrestrial life or cross-galactic communicative efforts.\r\n\r\nhowever, last night i left my apartment for work at 8:33pm and headed south on my street for a half block, then turned east at my nearest southern street.  halfway down the block, i saw a man standing on the street, holding his phone up toward the sky.  this was when it occurred to me that last night had been a harvest moon, and, not ever having consciously remembered seeing one, i looked up into the sky, thinking perhaps the pedestrian neighbor had been taking a photograph of what everyone seemed to revere as a unique moon, as many of my friends had commented on it through facebook.  i looked up at the moon, which appeared to be at least almost full, if not entirely full, and i was disappointed that it seemed to look like any other full moon i had seen.  as i drove down the block, i regarded it closely, looking for unique markings that would make the view special, but it was just another full moon to me.\r\n\r\nit was then that i saw it.  from my vantage point of the sky,several visual inches away, approximately between 30 and 60 degrees from the the moon's placement in the sky, was a flashing of lights from an object that initially i assumed was an airplane, becccause i saw, peripherally, flashing lights and gradual movement.  \r\n\r\nas i came to the stop sign at the end of the block, however, having been studying the sky for evidence of some breathtakingly unique moon, i noticed that the object in the sky was giving off lights in a manner and pattern that were both incongruent and seemingly gratuitous to any commercial or private aircraft i had ever seen or heard of.  \r\n\r\nas i approached the stop sign in my residential neghborhood, with no traffic behind me, i stopped and regarded the unique and discombobulating lights from the craft.  as i watched, there was a series of lights which seemed to \"trail\" around the circumference of a disctinctly disc-like shape.  this was my first indication that i was witnessing something otherworldly, or at least confusing.  like the lights of a trailing marquis that follows around the perimeter of a mass, the lights, all red and orange and yellow and white, seemed to distinctly outline the object as they traveled around its perimeter.  and, i can't say for sure, as i do not know what distance lay between me and the object, but it was at least dc10 huge.  it was huge.\r\n\r\nat the same time these lights went round and round the widest central exterior of the craft, there was also a white/blue light, even brighter than the trailing lights, that seemed to mark the northernmost point of the craft, much like a lighthouse or air traffic control beacon.\r\n\r\ni stopped my car at the stop sign and regarded the lights for several minutes, eagerly awaiting the moment when my persepctive would shift, i would come to my senses, and i would realize it was a helicopter, an airplane, a military jet come down from edwards air force base, perhaps, or maybe even a dirigible or even (though i have never seen one in my ten years in l.A.) a hot air balloon drifting at night.  \r\n\r\ni wanted to grab my cell phone and attempt to take video or a picture at least, but the combination of knowing that my cell phone has marginal quality regarding video or imagery (especially from long distances, and especially in the dark), as well as the extreme fascination i felt at witnessing something so bizarre that made me reticent to look away from it for even a second, i did not attempt to attain documentation in the form of a picture.\r\n\r\nthen... while waiting for what i was sure was a mirage or a trickery of perspective to illustrate to me how i was foolish, that it was a ghetto bird or a unique aircraft which i'd never seen before, the craft moved in a way that man-made crafts are, to my knowledge, incapable of.  the craft initially seemed to be moving with jet-like speed further away, but then moved, in a fraction of a second, to the right (east/southeast), and then vertically (how many meters/miles vertically, i can't say, but noticeably and rapidly), and then hovered for a solid minute without betraying any movement, not in distance, not vertically or horizontally - it appeared to be \"standing\" in the sky for a full minute without any perceptible change in perspective from my stationary vantage point.\r\n\r\nthroughout this entire time, the red/orange/yellow/white lights \"followed\" eachother around the circumference of the craft, as if to illustrate and underscore not only its mass and form, but its mere presence as well.\r\n\r\ni had rolled down my drivers side window to get a less obstructed view of the seemingly ethereal craft, and there were pedestrians moving through the crosswalk, confused by my deference to their passing.  i pointed at the sky and asked, \"am i crazy?  do you guys see an airplane or a ufo up there?\"  well, i live in a predominantly russian neighborhood, and while their eyes followed the direction which i pointed to in the sky, they said something to me in russian which i did not understand, and bustled their way down the sidewalk.\r\n\r\ni stared at the anomoly in the sky for another minute, attempting to make my brain accept that it was a plane or a helicopter, and couldn't do so.  then, a car came up behind me and blew its horn in frustration for being held up, and i was forced to go along my way., where i lost sight of it in the obstruction of trees and buildings.\r\n\r\nthis is not something i have ever believed in.  i always thought those people who said \"i saw a ufo once\" were crazy.  and now *i'm* one of the crazies too.  this witness has changed the way i feel about everything - from society to politics to religion to concerns about my own human and basic biological self preservation. i don't know who we are, as a country or a world.  i don't know who god is- i don't know a lot of things - and it simultaneously stimulates, rejuvenates and terrifies me. \r\n\r\ni'm scared.  and i'm elated.  i'm faithful and faithless all at the same time.  this may be the most all-encompassing profound revalation any human can experience.  if i get the enlightenment, i'll take the opinions that i might be crazy.\r\n\r\ni don't believe in god - i never have - but this may be the closest thing to divinity.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

experiencing some line problems. while i was fishing, he was doing his repairs. he said \"hey look at that!\" i looked up and over a nearby ridge of pine trees i saw what looked the lights you'd see at a baseball game above the tree tops. they were large bright white lights in a straight line. i didnt really think anything of it and continued fishing. he then said again \" hey! what the hell is that?\" i looked again and now these lights were in the shape of a slanted 7 then an almost cross and then a jagged line. i could feel what i can only describe what it must feel like to be between to magnets turned to opposite poles, it was very strange. i also noticed that my thought pattern was disrupted, i couldnt think clearly. i could not see anything but these lights. and at the time my brother first noticed this, it was dusk; still a bit light out. this thing, whatever it was floated over us and i only know this because i finally realized i couldnt see the sky any longer. i could not see any sky from left to right at all. this thing made absolutely no noise. it was just above us. after looking up at what was essentially nothing but black sky for a long while, this thing turned slightly and i began to be able to see some stars and then i realized the size and shape of this thing and was instantly terrified. i grabbed my brother and pointed out the shape of this craft. it looked like a 55 gallon drum that was cut down the middle from top to bottom and then laid flat and it was massive. i have no way of estimating the size. i had never seen anything like this before or since. my instinct was to pull my brother to the ground and lay as flat as possible. i remember scanning the woods and road looking to see if something was there that was potentially threatening. we continued to watch this thing for quite a while and watched it ascend slowly until we could no longer see it. there was no ultra fast movement, no unbelievable lights, no noise, just this massive thing in the sky above us. we left right away, amazed and in shock. when we arrived home, i called the redding p.D. at the behest of my family and asked the officer who answered if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the sky that night; he replied no. he asked if i wanted to file a report, i declined. i am finally writing about this all these years later because i know what we saw, i also know people tend to think that those who observe these craft are lying. to this day, 22 years later, i look at the sky constantly, i wonder what the hell this thing was and why we saw it. it

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"[note: this is a preliminary report. supporting documentation will be sent in a follow-up or submitted directly to mufon headquarters]\r\n\r\nat 1925 my wife was letting the dogs out our back door when she noticed some odd lights moving over the city of fort collins, co.  she called me to look at them and we walked, together, onto our deck.\r\n\r\nto the northwest from our deck, there were two lights, one red and one green, both unblinking and not exactly the color of standard, approved airplane navigation light configuration.  let me be specific about this: these lights neither strobed nor rotated.  there was also not the requisite strobing white anti-collision light required on an aircraft after sunset. \r\n\r\nthis is significant because not only are all aircraft manufactured after march 11, 1996 be required to have strobing or rotating red and white beacons, but there was no white light/beacon on this object.\r\n\r\nthe shape of the object was indeterminate.  at the time of this sighting, the sun had set and the backdrop against which the object was seen was black with moderate lighting from below.  this made it impossible to determine the shape of the object and only the above-mentioned lights were visible.  the appearance was of two lights attached to a similar object in fixed locations on that object.  they did not appear to act as to separate entities.\r\n\r\nthe object moved from east to west and back again several times.  sometimes it appeared to move north and south, but always with the east-west or west-east movement.  we could tell that the object moved from north to south (directly to- and away-from us) because the distance between the two lights would gradually increase or diminish with a corresponding change in the general brightness of the lights.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to \"swim\" as it moved first showing one light and then the other and, at times, both lights.  this is what drew our attention.  the object moved with a continuously perpendicular z axis (i.E., neither rolling nor yawing) and did not appear to significantly change altitude.\r\n\r\nthe motion was similar to a situation where two lights were mounted on opposite sides of a circular disk with a rod piercing through the center of the disk at a 90-degree angle to the central plane of the disk.  then, if one holds the disk by the center rod (forming the z axis) at a fixed height and spun the rod 150 to 180 degrees in either direction slowly, maintaining height and only changing the yaw of the disk.\r\n\r\nthe object did not appear to either pitch or roll during the entire incident.  the best way to describe it would be to say that it moved along a set altitude from one location to the other in what appeared to be a swimming motion.\r\n\r\nit was also difficult to determine exact distance because we were unable to determine either shape or size.\r\n\r\nwe did not hear any sound from the direction of the object at the time of the sighting.\r\n\r\nafter approximately 4 or 5 minutes of watching, the object moved to a position that was blocked by trees in the neighborhood.  at this time, we both went back inside to find a pair of binoculars and a spotting scope to try and get a closer view.   we were gone approximately 1 minute and were unable to relocate the object upon our return.\r\n\r\nat this time, we decided to move to a location that offered a clearer, wider view of the sky in that direction.  we moved approximately 1.5 miles to the north east and viewed the sky for another 30 minutes, seeing numerous other identifiable objects, but could not relocate the original object.\r\n\r\nwe did make note of several identifiable landmarks for directional indicators and will be printing up maps with area of view extrapolated from the original sighting location along with drawings attempting to describe the motion and movement of the object. \r\n\r\nin response to point 4:  the general feeling was that this was not an object that was maneuvering or operating within an accepted or recognized profile of a \"normal\" aerial craft.  this led to a sense of puzzlement and curiosity and a desire to determine what, exactly, it was.\r\n\r\n[note 2: we are willing to speak with mufon investigators, but are not willing to have personal

orange and green alternating, visible colouring to the naked eye.  the object was moving in a west-northwest direction.  the rate of speed that it was travelling at made me think that it was a plane of some kind.  i aimed my telescope (specs: 8\" f/6 dobsonian skywatcher, 10mm plossl lens) at the object.  while i was expecting to see a plane, which i have seen through my scope, what i saw was more like the star betelgeuse, except that it was travelling through my scope faster than any planets that i have observed.  it lasted until i lost it after 26 mins of observation, after which i lost it behind some houses.  apparent altitude was less than 1000 feet.  no sound was heard nor any electronic or magnetic

sept. 22-24. my son does not watch shows associated with ufo's because his mother won't let him nor do i do not talk to him about ufo's.\r\n\r\n     after i picked him up today we spoke about the camping trip and shortly after the conversation began he told me that he thinks he saw a ufo. he told a friend about it but he did not believe him. *(name deleted) explained to me that the object in question was triangular shaped and he could tell this from the lights illuminating the object. he says that the object rose above the treeline similar to the way a helicopter would point its nose down, ascend at an angle, level out, then move away quickly. this does sound like an actual helicopter but he was telling me the lights looked close enough that if it was a helicopter he would have heard the sound. according to william, this made absolutely no sound whatsoever. right before the sighting, he was with a group of students and a teacher and they were looking at constellations. after the group was walking off, *(name deleted)  remained behind a few moments to try and locate a constellation. he says that's when he saw the object rise and take off. he ran down and around the cabin to see if he could get a better look but it was gone by then. he says he felt confused, interested and scared all at the same time. by the time he went to tell a friend he says he really didn't know what to think. from what he told me, he initially thought it was a stealth fighter. only later did he think about what he saw and really question it.\r\n  \r\n

be on top of the mountains of east tucson. they were red and flashed in an alternating sequence (went from dim to bright). it was hard to say how manny lights there were, maybe 6 or 7 total. uppon pulling over the car to take a better look, i observed that the lights were in a stright horizontal line in a cigar shape, the bottom row much dimmer than the top row. looking on the ground beolw it, i saw 2 bright red lights on the ground in the distance, much to bright to be stop lights. \r\n\r\nthere was no sound and it seemed to move slightly in every direction slightly. it was definetly within the valley that the city resides in the south east part of the city. my wife and i stared at it for about 3 minutes before moving on. i would have watched it longer but it made my wife very uncomfortable and she was scared to get out of the car and told me to stay in the car as well. neather of us could say what it was but there was not a doubt in eather of our minds that it was just an airplane. it was not traveling accross the sky and they lights were very differenty than an aircraft. we had no idea what it was but it was not something we had ever seen before.  \r\n\r\nthe next day i did a net search for \"strange lights over tucson\" and found, as i suspected, we were not the only ones who saw it. the paper listed several quotes from witnesses that got a better look than i did.
