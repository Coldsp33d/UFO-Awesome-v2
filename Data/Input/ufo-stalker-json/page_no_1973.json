nearing sunset and the sun was bright orange,so i looked to my left to see if the sun was above the tree line( which would explain why the object was orange) or below the tree line,then i looked to my right and the object had vanished.I scanned the sky around us and it was gone.There were no clouds in the sky at that moment and it just disappeared.The sun was above the tree line,we were on the highway.It took maybe 4 or 5 seconds when i looked away from the object on my right side ,to look on my left side to see if the sun was above the tree line or not,and then look back to the right to look at the object again,but it had vanished.This was only the 4th daytime sighting i have had,but have had many nightime sightings over the years since 1991.I have reported every sighting to hbcc,but

leg and letting it fly around me. when i let it go, it began to fly around. as i watched it flying, i also noticed something else flying in the air. there were black looking planes a dozen or more flying in some kind of formation headed north against the backdrop of the setting sun. i didn't give them much thought, but i did realize at the time that i didn't hear any noise comming from their direction. being a kid i didn't give that much thought either. after growing tired of playing with my bug, i decided to let him go and go in the house. i continued to play in the living room until time to go to bed. while playing i decided to look out of the front window. what i saw scared me. there was the head of a person pressed against the glass. i screamed and ran over to where my mom was and told her that there was a man looking through the window. she looked out while trying to calm me down and said there was no one out there. still crying i told her yes there was. after some prodding she finally got me to look out and i didn't see anyone either. she then got me ready for bed. i was still scared bug went to bed anyway. i lay there for more than an hour before finally going to sleep only to be awakened by something pushing on the back door. so i started crying again hopeing that it would wake my mom and she would come and see about me. but that didn't happen. but what did happen i will never forget. even with my head covered i could see through the sheet a small crafg about 2 to 3 feet in diameter brightly lit. in fact it lit up the whole room. i could hear the latch on the door moving and see the door opening as the light grew brighter and brighter. i was trying to stop crying so that who ever was in the room would not hear me and perhaps go away. but instead i could see it hovering about 3 or 4 feet above my head and the lid or top was opening. i then covered my mouth and tried not to make a sound and eased the cover back just far enough to see the object and hopefully not let it see me. once the hatch was open a small person raised its head and appeared to smile at me or atleast in my direction. i was still scared and i think now that it could sense that. so the hatch closed. it went back out the same way it came in and closed and latched the door. when i finally got brave enough jumped up and went and told my mother about what had just happened and she told me that i had a bad dream. and for 50 something odd years i have been trying to convince myself thats all it was a dream. but now i'm not so sure! it seemed to real. it still seems real. except now it is real. i seem to be getting visits from some of these (for lack of a better word) creatures. when i was in my twenties i believed that i had another dream. while laying on the bed after comming home from work, i dozed off to sleep or so i thought. problem was i was paralyzed, but could still see, hear, and sense everthing around me. then the impossible happened. i was lifted from my bed and and could feel something examineing my body. touching my back one area at a time all the way to my neck and then back down again. i don't know how long i was in that position but it felt like an eternity but i believe it was only a few minutes. and then i was lowered back down on the bed and after a few minutes allowed to move again. as soon as i could get up i ran out of the house and did not go back in for several hours. these may be dreams, but now just 2 weeks ago after seeing all sorts of creatures. i wake up and my foot is bleeding and there is a small hole there that i can't explain. i have so much more to tell, but i'll save it for the investigators. but for now just know that in all of my encounters with these creatures to my knowledge i haven't been seriously harmed atleast not physically. however they do seem to like to play head games. they do also seem to know alot more about us then we will ever know about them. i also can't explain why so many of them fly over my home, hover in my front and back yard, attempt to hide behind small clouds and just observe you. i've seen alot in the last couple of years that i have been seriously observing them. the orbs seem not to be crafts but living creatures, not smooth but several textures and many types. i have seen several types of probes that leads me to believe that more than  just 1 or 2 species are studying us, but several. they appear to have the power to control gravity and not require air to live nor does it (air) seem to affect them adversly. oh and one more thing; they don't seem to exhibit any emotions, fear, expression,anger. atleast not the one that came within 5 feet of me. but allow me to qualify that statment by stating for the record, i don't know what this thing was. it didn't appear alive nor dead, it did'nt look like a probe of any kind, and it did'nt try to communicate atleast not with me.  you folks already have my number. i'll set up something with one of your investigators and we'll see what i've got. and perhaps maybe some one can shed some light on whats really going on.  thanks. for atleast trying to sort it out.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25535,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1026165,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09242010-0001","longitude":-94.5741567,"occurred":1245567600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,

the first. since the first sighting, i tend to keep my eyes to the sky a bit more. today, it paid off again.\r\n i was at work a little early, before 8:00am cst, and this morning looked to be stormy with the chance of some rain. the clouds were broken, and moving north, with about 60 to 70% broken overcast, and wind from the south about 20 mph. the clouds were very dark west of my location. approximately 8:05 i stepped outside to take a look at the weather, and noticed that commercial flights from dfw and love field were being diverted to the north/northeast around the heavy cloud bank to the west. i saw a southwest airlines plane going north east and saw an american airlines going south toward love field or dfw. both planes were around 2500 to 3000 feet agl.Both aircraft generated broken contrails due to the fairly cool air and high humidity.\r\n through a break in the clouds i observed a gray \"cigar/cylindrical\" shaped vehicle. it's path was to the north west. it had no wings,or tail surfaces, and appeared to be about 2 to 3 times longer than the southwest airlines plane. i believe the soutwest plane was a boeing 737-400.Both of the commercial airliners were moving through the broken cloud layer and the other vehicle was well above the cloud deck, and i estimate it was at 5000 feet agl.It didn't create any contrail at all.\r\n from my vantage point, the southwest airplane looked to be about 3/4\" long and it's bright orange paint was highly visible. the vehicle i saw looked very similar to the shape of a stretched medicine capsule. long and thin, and my angle of view was from from its left rear and below.It had no lighting of any kind. no landing lights, marker lights, or anti collision strobe.\r\n i actually had a digital camera on hand, but as luck would have it, the batteries were dead. i had spare batteries, but i didn't manage to change them quickly enough to get any photos before this machine was obscured by clouds. everything occurred in a matter of 3 to 4 minutes.\r\n i was ecstatic to see something like this again, but when i realized my camera batteries were dead,it was a very quick emotional letdown to say the least. maybe the third time will be the charm for me\r\n \r\n \r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

(trash night) my family and neighbors have seen these very bright orange and red and sometimes white lights. sometimes they will come in groups of 2 or 3, one at a time, 3-8 minutes apart. they are completely silent, which leads me to believe its not a typical aircraft. also they move in unusual patterns; typically, they'll come straight up, then travel straight, and either move farther away and disapear or move left or right and then slowly disapear. it looks like they can make paths and turns at swift 90 degree angles, and other patterns and movements that normal aircrafts cant perform. \r\n\r\nthe first time i seen these lights i was at trenton, mi fireworks (around july 5th), they were on the detroit river, and during the fireworks myself and friends, along with the people surrounding us, witnessed these lights travel by right above us, we almost thought it was a hot air balloon, but then realized they dont go that high, or that far. we all were very curious and had no clue what the lights were, but i didnt think much of it at the time. then, a few weeks later, my dad seen the lights while taking out the trash, the same ones i had seen in trenton. this time i was kind of freaked out, i can't think of anything logical to describe what these lights could really be. they have now become almost a weekly phenomena. from where i am, in lincoln park, mi, the lights appear to be coming up from around taylor or romulous, mi, but could be further away. from where i stand in my backyard, (where i can most clearly see the lights) if i could cover the round-to-triangle shaped lights with an object, they would probably be skittle sized or aspirin sized. \r\n\r\ntonights lights were suprisingly very bright, a deep firey red while last weeks were more of a firey orange. tonight was also sort of cloudy, but the lights were still very visible. we questioned reporting the lights to the police, but my family and i feel it won't be investigated or taken as serious as it should be. \r\n\r\nbasically, these lights appear almost weekly it seems, typically between 9:30 and 11:30, sometimes come in groups or periodicly every few minutes, they have strange flight patterns and are completely silent, move slowly and disapear slowly, and they are always a firey orange and red, sometimes white. \r\ni have no pictures or film evidence, but many have

and noticed a very bright red pulsating light in the southwest, about 6 to 8 inches above the horizon, which i thought could have been a planet as it was so bright (after checking with an amateur astronomer friend, it could not have been mars, which i initially thought it was). the moon is full tonight, with not many stars out and jupiter is plainly visible below and slightly to the right of the moon, as expected.  when i went outside again at 10 pm, the light had moved slightly eastward and upward at least half again its prior height above the horizon, and no longer appeared as a bright red color; it was rather white in aspect.  i ran inside for my binoculars and camera, and when i came back outside, it was moving in an east/northeast direction. the height relative to the horizon seemed to increase as it moved, likely because it was passing by my position.  when viewed through the binoculars, it was a grouping of three lights, 2 red and one white, which did not blink but remained constant.   the two red lights were forward as it moved, with the white light trailing behind. i could not make out any shape corresponding to the lights.  i am not sure whether its true altitude had changed as it passed from southwest of me to east/northeast of my position.  there were no planes in the sky, and the speed of the three lights was indeterminate, neither slow nor fast ��� there was nothing to compare it to. i tried to take pictures (sony cyber-shot 14.1 on twilight setting), however, it was not possible to see through the viewfinder; i could only point and shoot. the only one that i got is attached, but it does not clearly represent what i had seen through the binoculars.  not sure if it is related, but my dog was most eager to go outside during this time (actually, he was the reason i was out there), and since the lights moved away, he has been content to remain indoors.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":25528,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.3016091,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09232010-0003","longitude":-89.5041042,"occurred":1285138800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1285228605000,"summary":"Distant

to the right  which was a valley like field with much open space i noticed a large yellow hovering light source. it appeared at first as an abnormally close star. after pulling over to observe it the object began moving slowly. it was moving from above the tree line upward then began moving horizontally and eventually was almost directly over head. as it traveled slowly overhead i got a clear look at the large orb like blinding light that was in what appeared to be the front of whatever craft it may have been. i could not see the definite shape of the object but there we two rectangular blue lights running parallel down what seemed to be the edges of the craft as well as a bright red light in the rear. as the craft moved farther away and almost out of sight due to the thickly wooded are directly behind me the red light became clearer and appeared to what i can only describe as \"jet looking\" although the craft was moving a little slower than a low flying plane i took full notice of the red ring on the rear that seemed to be producing pulsating heat. after it went out of sight i stood starring at the sky looking at other extremely bright stars but nothing was comparable to what i saw and the way it hovered and changed direction was unexplainable. i witnessed something first hand that fully assured me that there are aircrafts being used by  either humans or other forms of intelligence. please if anyone in this area or nearby saw something notable contact me. i ill not be at ease until i hear of other sightings on this day- (*wit's name and email address

out the window & saw what i first assumed was a spider web but it seemed very far off. i moved to another room to get another view, i could tell that this was very far off and likely in the stratosphere. it remained directly above the sunrise. i also thought it was a contrail. however it did not dissipate in the manner which a contrail even a \"persistent\" contrail have in the past. \r\n\r\ni observed this through a window of the second floor of my home. the screen had been removed and i was filming while physically holding my camera outside.\r\n\r\nfor the most part, it was difficult to see without looking through the camera because of the brightness of the sun. however, at around 10:00, it was visible with the naked eye. it almost seemed to project itself forward or backward in order to move but stayed at an angle. it appeared to be extremely large/long. sometimes it appeared a a row of balls and other times it appeared smooth, a couple of times, i witnessed it change to an orange/red color, which seemed to flow through the rod-like structure. video footage and digital photographs were taken on a sony handycam with 20x optical zoom, a digital  finepix camera and a cannon rebel camera with a 300mm lens.\r\nthere was one other witness to this, which was my husband, he also watched this for several minutes and does not agree that this was any of the things i initially thought it was. \r\n\r\nadditionally, it appeared that there was a lot of \"activity\" around this rod-like structure but i am unsure of the nature of these quick moving objects. some did seem to be coming out of the structure. i was very overwhelmed by the whole thing and would have rather that something would happen to reveal that there was a simple benign explanation for what we were seeing and would have preferred that it would have just gone away. regardless, i could not take my eyes off of it,  until it was finally gone.\r\ni did upload a video to you tube in the hopes of

was 8.5hrs into my shift as a truck driver when i saw out of my passenger window a craft moving west, at an altitude of 300-400ft (there was a storm with low cloud cover but not raining yet) down the 401 on september 22, 2010 at 1:10am. i was driving down pinebush rd after leaving my employers office. about 400ft to the right i caught out of the corner of my eye, what i thought was a helicopter with it being so low and all the big lights. there were three large bright lights 60ft apart in the shape of a triangle, with two lights about half the size/brightness in the center as well as a small red flashing light just like the ones seen on civilian aircraft. the lights seemed to create (atleast from my angle) a gold/orange haze obscuring the shape of the object. it was moving forward with the flat part of the triangle, leaving the point at the rear. turning a short distance before franklin blvd the craft pivoted the right light toward hespler, while tilting alittle in a tight 90 degree turn. the craft was now moving with the pointed part of the triangle over food basics and then over the houses vanishing out of sight. i couldn't hear anything but then again i was driving a loud big rig. i slowed my driving so i could watch it more and was amazed at how much ground it covered without appearing to be moving fast. i was excited to see this object but didn't feel the enlightening/awakening i had felt with my sighting in 1999 of a green orb. i felt up beat and good about the sighting until i got home at 4:00am, i then started to feel a little down and discouraged. i keep thinking what i saw was normal and not \"out of my reality\" and there for is not a big deal. then i would change my mind and think it was important and would want to find out what it was. i think i'm feeling this was because it wasn't as crazy as the green orb but either way i thought i'd let everyone know what i saw and who knows if more people come out with sightings.

watching in an attempt to 'figure it out'. i began to watch the triangular shaped object with one very prominent light that turned red, then back to white. the object hovered in the same location above the tree line then took off in a slow but purposeful southerly direction where it hovered and moved back and forth for about twenty minutes (above and between two trees) before slowly moving away in the distance at 6:31 a.M. most notable was the appearance of the object. a couple times i noticed what appeared to be a fog or smoke surrounding the object with long trails of lights much like tentacles. the most prominent light was very bright fading in and out. there were lights around the primary light which gave me the opinion it had to be triangle in shape. \r\ni watched with disappointment as the object moved away from me in a westward direction. it finally disappeared behind the trees at 6:31 a.M. as it began to get light out. i was disappointed to see it leave. i want to know more.

these helicopters do not emit a vapor trail and usually can be seen since they fly fairly low.  i noticed the vapor trail was shaped similar to that of a comet- it was white and rectagular and looked like it could be a cloud but it was too low to be a cloud- there were several cloud formations above but they did not move as this vapor cloud was moving slowly and keeping up with the car.  i noticed the sun glare on an metallic object at the front of the vapor trail- it was a very small silver metalic sphere or circle. i assumed it was a nose of a plane. i kept looking at the object for several minutes due to i could not fiqure out how a plane could move so slow and it was too small to be a traffic helicopter.  i then turned away and looked back and saw a small metallic silver sphere in the sky not moving just there montionless with out the vapor trail- it then dissapeared. it was right next to the sun so most people with out protective wear could not propably see it- i then began to consider all the possibilities of what it could be and did not come up with any solution- we do have a small national guard base in plymouth meeting and also an army reserve center in the area which does have tanks.  i do belive in ufo's and study the documentation but never actually had an experience- i am a rational person and would not have reported this unless i could come up with no other explanation.  i do believe ufo's are investigating military bases. i would be happy to testify to this if needed.  it is time for disclosure.  thank you for the opportunity for me to do my part bu telling you my small story.
