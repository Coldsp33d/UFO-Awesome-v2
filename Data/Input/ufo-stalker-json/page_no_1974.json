exercise on my deck, i set up a chair in the shade on the north side of my home (a small deltec house with all-around deck). i have a clear view from there of the blanca massif, 15 miles to the north, at about 330 true. this is also the view from my \"office\" (i'm retired)as i sit at the computer. it is a very clear, sunny day, and as it was quite warm (even at 8,500 feet) i was conscious of the house soffit providing shade at this spot. this permits me to know the time approximately.\r\n\r\nas i have been retired to this house since the summer of 1999, and as my office has been at the same spot all this time, the nice view of the mountains is something absolutely well-known and routine to me. i have looked at exactly this spot no doubt more than thousands of times in these years.\r\n\r\nbut this time, to my immediate surprise, i notice quite clearly a sun-reflecting metallic sphere slightly to the right (east) and slightly up from blanca peak. (angle from sun to object to me, about 60 degrees.) i feel immediately that it is something i've never seen before and quite large because i have lately been paying close attention to the aircraft passing above me here, ordinary jets and military aircraft are quite common, but lately i have been paying attention to them. with my unaided 20-30 vision i can make out the different shapes quite well as they pass over at, say, 35,000 feet, about 5 miles above me. this metallic sphere was definitely larger than the largest jet aircraft i see, and it was at least 15 miles away (distance from here to blanca peak). it subtended an angle about one half to three quarters the length of an overhead jet liner. i felt that it was beyond the mountain some indefinite distance, but not far.\r\n\r\nkey fact: it was a sphere, and stationary. after about a minute, not much more, it moves slowly to my left, not far, perhaps one times its diameter, towards the mountain peak, and down. then it fades away to nothing, in place.\r\n\r\ni did not have camera or binoculars with me. no other witnesses. subsequent glances out my window at the mountain do not show anything like this, as they never did. i have also actually seen one weather balloon in my time here -- much smaller, a different shape entirely, closer, and in a different direction. military aircraft and helicopters pass over my house frequently, perhaps because we are near laveta pass on a line between los alamos and pueblo/colorado springs.\r\n\r\npersonal reaction: slow and puzzled. nothing dramatic in this event, but it occurs to me that reporting it might corroborate someone else's sighting. i would be happy, but surprised, to hear there is a perfectly ordinary explanation for what i saw. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":25502,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.4331973,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09192010-0008","longitude":-105.4328999,"occurred":1284586200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1284961467000,"summary":"Large sun-reflecting metallic sphere, stationary slightly above mountain, disappears","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4,"locationName":"Fort Garland, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:98853"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Evans","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Whilst taking out a vaccuum bag to empty it, i came to notice a vry bright orange \"star\" in the sky. i thought of it as polaris (the northern star) and disregarded it. soon, however, it came to my attention that the light was not in the north direction but instead, it was southeast. checking a compass, i confirmed my suspecion. what struck me as odd though, was the fact that i had observed a similar object previously in virginia while on vacation. i went and got my dad. we are both ufo enthusiasts and watch programs on tv whenever we can. he took a look at it and (as i did) disregarded it. until, that is, it began moving. first, it moved right (eastward) and then began descending. quickly, my father, my little sister, and i jumped into our truck and took off, chasing the object. we soon came to a position where we could get a clear view. we had a cheap meade telescope with us and set it up on the truck. the object continued it's descent and we frantically sifted through lenses, finally finding on with the correct zoom, etc. as i looked through the lense, i saw that the object had three distinct colors to it (this may, however, be due to the lense), the colors being, red, white, and green. again, the object moved down. we jumped back in the truck and followed the light to the intersection of hereford farm and columbia road. we followed where we thought it would be but could not locate it. just as we were leaving (and on the phone with mufon) two helicopters (very close together) flew over us to where we orignally spotted the craft. one went on to fort gordon and the other made multiple passes over the area. during the initial experience, i was stunned and amazed. you never know when you will see something like that. when the helicoptors flew over, however, i got a conformation of my feelings. they seemed to be scanning, searching.

north of pekin, il above north pekin, creve coeur and east peoria. i'm used to seeing planes/helicopters and kind of keep an eye out for them. the peoria airport is 10mi or so to the northwest and lifeflight is active in the area.\r\n\r\nwhat i seen last night is foreign to me. i can not explain this event. i don't necessarily think it has to be alien in nature, it could very well be some man made event. however, i do keep an open mind and it's a certainty that we're not alone in the universe. i am 36 years old, married, and father of twin 4 year old boys. i do not use drugs or drink alcohol. i was an infantry soldier in the illinois national guard from 1990-1992.\r\n\r\nat about 8:40pm (+- 2 mins) on 18 september 2010 i had the lights off in the living room while i was watching some tv and eating a snack. out of the corner of my eye i caught a light in the sky and focused my attention on it. it was orange and not something i'm used to seeing.\r\n\r\ni walked outside to have a better look. there was some cloud cover and i didn't see any stars. during the daylight hours we had been under a uniformly covered grey sky. i am assuming the night was more of the same. a couple hours after this event it was a little foggy and rainy.\r\n\r\nthe light itself was orange with some gold to it. it was flickering a bit and it appeared to me that the flickering was either caused by the various density of cloud cover between it and me or it was simply on fire. it was bright enough to see it through the clouds, but it did not brighten them or cast a glow around it. it was about as bright as venus. it moved in a straight line and didn't seem to deviate in it's motion or speed. it didn't instantly extinguish itself, it took about 10 seconds for it to disappear once it started to fade.\r\n\r\nthe time i first noticed the light to when it faded out was about 2 minutes. it travelled from the east to the west and i would estimate from my vantage point it was at 315deg when i first seen it and 10deg when it faded. due north being 0deg. elevation was approximately 50-55deg\r\n\r\ni'm using the word faded, but i'm not sure if the object actually faded or if the cloud cover got thick enough to block it out. i kept looking for a couple of minutes to see if it would reappear. it did not. i spent enough time outside to completely smoke a cigarette.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound that i could hear from the object.\r\n\r\ni checked the satellite flyby database and didn't see anything matching the location. i have not contacted the airport or any other officials. i noticed some other reports of a light loosely matching my description here in illinois in the past. could this be part of an ongoing event? \r\n\r\nplease feel free to email me if you have or need any additional information. i will assist with anything i can. thanks!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

he says is a ufo to me and i tell him from my point of view it looks like a plane, with the normal blinking light on the wing.\r\n\r\nhowever, when we pull up to a red light around 30 seconds later the object (which now i will refer to a ufo) was much closer and at a lower altitude than just moments before. not only that but there were 2 lights blinking now one white and the other red (red light was on the right side, white was on the left). \r\n\r\nthe ufo was just hovering silently and seemed to be a fairly large size although it was pitch dark and my only perception of it's size determined by the distance of the blinking lights. i was able to make our it was concave on the sides making it a rounded object when the lights would blink, to give an approximate size i'd say maybe 50-75ft across (although as i said it was hard since it was dark). the ufo did not hover the entire time we were at the red light, at one point it darted from left to right quickly then was stationary again - i know there is no 'publicly' known aircraft that can do this so i will remain calling this a ufo until i am told otherwise. \r\n\r\nthat was just the beginning of the night however... \r\n\r\nafter we got back to his place we were outside having a cigarette when i saw a light through the treeline that was moving. the light was a somewhat dull yellow however it was large in the shape of a rounded rectangle and bright enough you could see it was circular on either side (as in it was definitely 3 dimensional and not a stationary light facing us). this ufo was so low it was literally just above the treeline farther out - unfortunately the treeline by his house is so thick i only got a full view of it for about 30 seconds until it started moving slowly in the northwest direction. i kept seeing the ufo partly as it moved left nw - eventually it disappeared from our view (this happened quickly, not enough time to grab a camera or anything unfortunately although i really wish i had some footage because it was an amazing experience).\r\n\r\nso, to sum this up, the first ufo had 2 blinking lights was stationary at first then darted west then back eastward very quickly - almost like it jumped/teleported.\r\n\r\nthe second ufo which was seen later on in that early morning (approx. time 4-5am, was before the sun rise), had what looked like a dim yellow 'bar' like light in the front but it was bright enough to reveal it was curved on the sides (i couldn't make out the entire shape but i know it was curved on both sides) - this second ufo moved silently through the tree line at an exact speed very low to the ground.\r\n\r\ni decided to share this because i posted it on a forum and got responses saying others saw ufo's that same night/morning in pa and other east coast states.\r\n\r\ni apologize for not having any pictures or video but i honestly didn't expect to be seeing anything nor did i have time to get a camera even if i wanted too.\r\n\r\ni will keep an eye out with a camera for now on when i'm planning on being outside for a bit.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

up processing an arrest that i had made.  a group of my colleagues and i were standing around talking and i looked up at the sky because it was an unusually clear and starry night.  when i looked up, i was looking southeast toward richmond county and i saw a bright light which looked like a star moving east across the sky.  i remember focusing in on the object and tried to see if i could see any blinking lights which would indicate that it was a plane and i could not notice any.  then, to the west of the object, i saw another light moving north.  i did notice lights blinking on it, and they appeared to be strobing like an airplane.  i then looked back at the first object and it was still moving east at a steady pace.  suddenly, the object began to speed up from its steady pace and suddenly went black and disappeared, still heading east.  the object was extremely bright, just like a planet would look, and remained that way until it just suddenly went black and disappeared.  when i say it disappeared, i mean that literally.  there was no gradual fading or cloud, it just went from bright to black instantly.  none of my colleagues observed it to my knowledge and i didn't even make mention of it at the time.  even though i thought it was odd that it just went black instantly, i didn't feel it necessary to bring it up to my colleagues.  this is partly because i had seen on the internet the day before that an asteroid was going to be moving close to the earth soon, and i couldn't remember if it stated that it would be viewable on this night, so i just dismissed it as the asteroid.  i was confident that it wasn't an airplane, because prior to becoming a law enforcement officer, i worked with aircraft in the navy, and i am very familiar with the flight operations and makeup of aircraft, both civilian and military.  however, i didn't actually think it was anything \"out of this world\" until the next day when i seen the local newspaper in richmond county, \"the daily journal\", which had an article about numerous ufo sightings occurring in hamlet, nc, the same night as my sighting.  hamlet is a small town in southeastern richmond county, and based on where i was looking in the sky, the object i seen would have been over that area of richmond county (anson county is the neighboring county to richmond county).  what was even more astonishing to me was the fact that the sightings reported occurred around the same time that i experienced my sighting.  according to the article, one witness seen a craft hovering over her neighbors house, others across town reported seeing the same type craft, while others on the other side of the city also observed objects.  a store clerk stated several of her customers came into the store reporting seeing an object similar to what the witness seen hovering over her neighbors house.  since monday i have spoken to several credible people who have told me that they also seen strange lights and crafts that night.  some say they seen the same \"starry\" type craft that i seen, while others seen a cylinder shaped object.  i'm a \"no bull\" kind of person, and because of my profession, i form my opinions based on what the evidence tells me.  just my sighting alone and i would have never thought twice about it, and i would have dismissed it altogether.  however, with all of the sightings reported by several different people in different parts of the area, it is hard to deny that we may have experienced a true ufo phenomenon in our little part of the world that night.  if you guys at mufon read this article, i think you truly have a good investigation in your hands down here.  the thing that gets me the most is that so many people witnessed something that night.  people from all walks of life, from all over the area seen similar objects.  for more information on the sightings and the article in the local paper go to [link moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg]","distance":"Over One

fireball like object in the sky.  i saw it 2 nights in a row at about the same exact time each night.  i was only about 3 minutes away from my house and was driving alone. there was one car on the road ahead of me.  scott airforce base is about 25 minutes away.\r\ni just went home.  i did not pull over on the side of the road or drive closer to the object.  i am not sure what 2 nights i saw the ball in the sky but it had to be between august 20 - 27th.  both times it was around 10:30pm - 11pm.  \r\n\r\n\r\ni have previously reported 2 other ufo sightings to mufon over the past couple years in this same exact area.  there are 3 more sightings i have not reported but will do so after i submit this report. this is the same area the famous 2000 ufo was chased by 4 or 5 police cars.    \r\n\r\nmy first thought was the giant ball was a ufo but then i decided it must be something on a building or tower.  the next night i saw the very same thing.  \r\n\r\non sept 15th i saw another ball in the sky so i checked out your sight and nufroc and see that there have been several sightings of these balls around the country as well as my area which is 15 minutes from st. louis.  i guess some people reported seeing these balls on the 4th of july in the st. louis area.  \r\n\r\n\r\nyou can contact me but please keep my name, address and phone number off of your sight and the internet.

step-sister) parked our suv approximately 2.5 miles (texas 87/97 and county road 538) southwest of where we spotted the three lighted triangle ufo the night before. we set up four cameras (one vhs-c and three digitals) around the suv. at exactly 9:03pm we spotted what we believe to be the same triangle ufo as the night before. it was moving at the exact airspeed and flight path angel (from the northwest to southeast) as the night before. however this time, the altitude was up to about 8,000 feet and it tracked about a 40 degree angle up from the horizon west from our location and the flight path was about 15 miles west from the night before. \r\n\r\nmy experience as a retired army helicopter mechanic and weapons tech makes me feel that this is a drone. when my son said the ufo was zigzagging coming down from the sky the night before reminded me how the old line-of-sight, wire guided tow missiles would zigzag along its sighted path to its target. this ufo looks and ���feels��� like it is on a pre-calculated flight path using the earth magnetic fields as way-points and not land terrain or land marks as flight references.  it also reminds me of how ���we��� would send spaceship or probes to other planets to map the terrain. in other word, it is either mapping the terrain or it is looking for any wreckage from the reported falling airliner, see mufon report wingless, burning object falls from cloud near la vernia, texas. \r\n\r\nnow here is the kicker, as soon as we spotted the ufo, two of the digital cameras locked up (froze).  i never see the cameras do this before. the vhc-s camera could not get a focus on it but we have audio. the jvc 1080 camera was the only one that worked but the quality it terrible (see added film).  i cannot say what caused the three cameras to go bad but this morning they are working just fine now.\r\n\r\ni cannot make it back out there tonight for i have to work this weekend. it would be nice if someone could continue the watch tonight. looking over the maps i predict if should track just southwest of floresville, texas anywhere between 8:30 and 9:30pm. maybe setup at 97 and cr 102 but this is just a guess, it could pop about anywhere or nowhere.              \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

evening.  the clouds looked pretty dark and ominous, so i took a closer look.  this was just after 6 pm, maybe 6:15.  i saw, then, under the cloud cover a dark object.  i was startled, but tried to think as logically as i could.  it appeared to be spherical in shape, but it was quite far away.  i would say it was about the size of a pencil eraser if i was to hold that up to the sky.  it was either black, or dark grey.  as i watched i could see that it was rotating around a central axis.  i know it wasn't a bird because it wasn't moving, at least not flying across the sky.  it wasn't an airplane or a helicopter because there were no lights.  it did move slowly through the sky....By the time i lost sight of it, it had moved from the north-east to the north-west.  but it took about 10 minutes for it to move that far.  i lost sight of it when i went inside, down the stairs, and out the front door to get a better look.  i couldn't find it again.\r\n\r\ni did call my daughter out to see it, and she saw it as well.  we both had feelings of awe and excitement.  the only think i could think of that it might have been would be a balloon, but then again i don't think that is how a balloon would move, especially underneath the storm clouds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
