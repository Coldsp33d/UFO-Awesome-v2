which were clear with good visibility.  at 12:20 p.M., i spotted a brightly luminous object steadily moving from the northwest toward the skies over my house, but at what seemed a fairly high altitude.  my best \"guestimate\" about the distance it covered, from the point i first saw it to the point it disappeared, is perhaps 15 miles.\r\n\r\ni live near a small airfield (gillespie field, el cajon), so i am accustomed to seeing light aircraft and copters from different angles an on different paths of approach; however, this object did not take on the recognizable shape of aircraft commonly seen over el cajon.  although i expected it to become recognizable as a helicopter, instead it retained its star-like, spherical shape and intensified in brightness as it drew closer.  after it glided eastward, i considered it might be a weather balloon, but it seemed to slow down and \"park\" in the skies almost directly overhead (very slightly northwest of me).  i observed the object through windows with seamed panels and used these like cross-hairs to see if the object were wavering or if it were actually moving slowly away, but it wasn't. it just looked like it had come to a  complete stop.  there it remained, overhead, in the same stationary position, for about three minutes, where its general brightness and size resembled that of venus (but, of course, against the bright blue of noonday).  in the last thirty seconds or so, it faded from view but, once again, without moving in any direction.  rather, it seemed to diminish from the sky as if it were traveling upward and out of view.  by 12:15 p.M., the event had ended.  \r\n\r\nsadly, i didn't have a camera within reach and didn't risk leaving to retrieve one in case i lost sight of the object; if it moved, i wanted to witness that as well.  all i have is this eyewitness account, unfortunately.  i'm hoping other people saw this \"broad daylight\" event and reported it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25471,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7972231,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09172010-0002","longitude":-116.9609269,"occurred":1284664200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1284707946000,"summary":"Bright,

air. there is something that i have noticed about some of the ufo's i've seen.  they seem to have stelth abilities. what i mean by this is that a particular probe i saw once was apparently attached to another vechile. the reason i'm saying this, is because after examination of the video i noticed that the probe when launched appeared to be two circles of light, but after traveling a short distance in my direction i only saw one circle of light growing larger as it approached in my direction. this object however was only above my head about ten to fifteen feet and about two to three feet from the tree. i have no idea what it is and i,m tired of guessing. at first i didn't want you guys to investigate these objects for fear that they may be dangerous. but after being so close to two of them i think that they are mostly curious about us. these thing have really changed my opinion about the world and i hope that just the sight of these creatures will do the same for others.

in the distance a tree and a building so i could see it change over time in the line of sight. i thought it could be a military helicopter that was closer than i imagined but far enough away for me not to notice it moving slightly as it hovered or whatever. then it crossed paths with the landing patterns of boeing and seattle-tacoma airport. a jumbo jet passed in front of the light a little after dusk and you could see how puny the lights of the jumbo jet were- at 35 miles away compared to this thing.... \r\n    it moved another 15 degrees or so west and then it moved fast enough to be

for more eyewitnesses to the prior night report (see ���jet liner with no visible wings burning and falling out of a cloud��� september 14th 911 call). after spending about two hours in leesville and the surrounding area, we drove back to nixon and asked around if anyone had seen anything in the sky. \r\nat approximant 8:30pm, my son and i started our drive west from nixon on texas 87/97 toward stockdale. we had drove pass the town of pandora when my son makes me pull off to the side of the road. he said something is zigzagging between three stars. with the truck still running and traffic coming at us in both directions i jump out with my camera and ran over to his side. \r\nmy son was now standing outside the truck and is pointing in about a 55 degree angle up and is pointing northwest. i asked him again what he saw. he stated it is not an airplane, not a shooting or falling star. it was moving zigzagging and it is now coming right to us. since i was driving my eyes needed a few seconds to adjust to the night sky. i told my son to get the spot light and point to it (we learned to carry a high power spot light with us at all times). he points the spot light at a now slow moving light, this is moving right towards us from about 1,000 to 2,000 feet above. as it moved closer to us, a few more cars and trucks pass us on the road but nobody stopped. at first it was a solid light but as it flew closer i can see three separate lights in a tight triangle formation with a huge light at each corner. each light was glowing and had a shape like those sunken ceiling light used in modern kitchens, you can only see the lower half of the light. we could not see any metal or any shadow of the body but you can see the three lights where mounted onto some kind of fixture. i believe the diameter of each light would be 15 to 20 feet across and the space between each light about 6 to 8 feet.  i would give it a size between a caravan 675 and a citation cj4 or a length of 50 to 100 feet. it moved steadily over our heads from the northwest to the southwest without changing its speed or direction. my truck was still running so we could not tell if it was making any noise.  i predict it was moving about 70 to 80 miles an hour for it took about ten minutes to fly over us and out into the horizon.\r\n i so busy trying to get measurements and directions in my head that i forgot to film it. go figure.\r\nafter it faded into the night we drove up to the next crossroad which is county road 538 and turn left and drove about 100 feet to get away from the traffic. we parked there observing the night sky for another hour or so but there was no more activity. we are planning to set up there again tonight.                           \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, Over 1

pub with a friend at around 22:00 in ditherington. shrewsbury. the sky was very clear and not a cloud to be seen in the sky (was perfect for a stargazer) i was looking up constantly at the stars when i saw a flashing light very low from my witch caught my eye, as my friend was speaking to me i watched the light continue to rise and commented to my friend that it looked strange. he said that it was a plane as we watched the object there was at least 4 or more lights in a flashing formation as we watched the lights there was no sound throughout its travel. my friend continued to say it was a plane until it accelerated to a speed a plane could not. my friend tried to guess how fast it was traveling and he then agreed it was to fast for a plane and the way it flew coupled with the fact there was no sound at all in the sky when i was watching it ascend it was very iratic not in a straight line and continued to watch though out the event as it travelled through the sky until it went out of my vision. within minutes we heard watched a plane in the sky look like it followed the same path and carried on trying to follow what looked to me and my friend. we could confirm the distinct difference of the plane when in the air the light flashed in a normal pattern and could hear it it looked to us like it was most definitely trying to follow it. \r\n\r\nmay i add although i am a very big believer of ufos but my friend was not originally he was very skeptical and tried to explain it with a number of logical ways but totally agreed afterwards that we had just witnessed was indeed a ufo.\r\n\r\ni was unable to take a picture as my cam on phone does not work and as there was only the two of us who witnessed this he neither had a camera on him.\r\n\r\ni am not after fame or fortune but would happily go on record about this sighting i frantically tried to find somewhere last night i could report this on phone to as i feel i witnessed a massive ufo event coupled by the fact that a plane was deployed very soon afterwards not only confirmed to me we are not alone but the powers that be know we are not either.\r\n\r\ni would like to add a number of people the previous night reported on facebook hearing a number of helicopters in the sky from shawbury very late at night which i thought at the time was strange due to the time of night i wonder if this was also connected?\r\n\r\ni have already sent this to a uk ufo reasearcher in uk a mr j hanson upn investigations i would like further investigation in to thi ie flight records from shawbury etc as this did

when i noticed a dim red flashing light just above the west horizon. at first i thought it was a satellite. i watched it for a few seconds and realized it was moving to fast to be a satellite. i saw a white light appear and disappear 3 times forming a diamond shape with the red lights as the top point of the diamond. i thought it was a fleet of helicopters or planes flying in formation and very fast until the white lights didn't get any closer. i pointed it out to my boyfriend and we watched the red light move across the sky with the white lights flashing all around it. the red light came out of the west and moved toward the southern horizon then turned toward the northeast horizon, making a large u or horseshoe path across the sky before disappearing into the northeast horizon. it lasted about 5 minutes. about halfway through the event the object was turned at an angle where we could see multiple red lights (3-5 it seemed some were fainter than others).They formed a line. it was too dark to make out the objects shape. when the object changed its course (from southeast to northeast) it went into a part of the sky with less light coming from the horizon and we could see the white lights weren't multiple objects it was one object darting in all directions. it was leaving leaving trails that lasted a split second. it was extremely fast and was able to change direction and reverse instantly. it seemed like this red light was trying to follow or escort this fainter, faster, darting light. i was amazed and in disbelief. i love to watch the stars and i live in a fairly small town without many lights so i have a pretty good view of them from my house and an even better one a few miles out of town, i look at the stars very frequently, almost every night and i have never seen anything like this. my boyfriend was with me and saw the exact same thing i did. i'm still very confused and curious about what we saw. i don't think we're crazy but what we saw was not normal or believable. it might also be interesting to note that i live about 80 miles from the maelstrom air force base which is located in great falls, mt. it is a large base that controls nuclear missiles and has a large experimental synthetic aircraft fuel plant. maelstrom afb is located to the northwest of me which is the direction the lights were headed and disappeared.","distance":"501

was having a barbeque late last night with some friends of mine. we were having fun and making some jokes on the wooden deck in my yard (and eating some really good ribs). my eyes were quickly drawn to the sky for a brief moment by what seemed to be a very bright star shoot across the sky at high speed. it was easily under cloud altitude and, interestingly, dissapeared abruptly after a couple of seconds. i involuntarily pointed up and said aloud \"holy ****, did you guys see that?\" no one else had seen the 'star' except for myself, one of my friends was even kind enough to tease me a little about the sighting. \r\n\r\nthe object was white and bright like a star except slightly larger and brighter. it traveled in a straight line heading east for the moment that i witnessed it. it was clearly below the clouds. the lowest clouds rest usually around 2000 meters above ground i believe, i would estimate this object was between 1000 and 1500 meters above ground. it dissappeared a moment after i looked at it, as if someone had flicked a light switch off. it made no sound.\r\n\r\ni was immediately excited about what i had seen, the first thing i thought of was that this was no star and that i may have witnessed something rare and special. i'm an amateur astronomer and i own a high powered telescope so i am very familiar with the sky at night. i am certain that this was not a shooting star. i have never seen something like that so low to earth at such a speed and instantly vanish this way before. can you help me explore and maybe explain this phenomena? thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nunfortunately this event was so brief that i did not have the time to take any pictures. if you can find the time to contact me, i have left my e-mail

the night, so i reminded him. he was out there for about 5 minutes when i got a phone call from him telling me to come outside quick! he told me that there was a craft hovering above and he wanted me to see. i was on my way out but by that time it was gone. when he came in he was very overwhelmed with excitement and he actually drew me a picture of what he saw. after looking at the picture we browsed the internet to look up strange triangular lights in the sky. he then pointed one out that looked exactly like his drawing. i told him that we would wait for 30 minutes and then go back outside to see if it had come back. once the 30 minutes were up i grabbed the camera and our phones just in case. as soon as we got outside my boyfriend immediately pointed out the same thing he saw earlier but it was farther away this time. so him and i both ran to get as close as we could to see the craft. i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw it. we tried taking a video or a picture but our zoom couldn't zoom in far enough and all we got was darkness. we stood outside watching the crafts every move for about 30 minutes. as we were watching, we could see that there were 3 red lights and 2 white lights. the white lights would flash as if it were at a slow pulse but had no particular rhythm to it. every couple of minutes we would see multiple lights light up in a circular pattern that formed the shape of the craft and lit it up. it's motions were not big strides but small pacing horizontally from left to right. we could most definitely tell that it was no plane. it was more stationary rather than constant movement like a plane would do. it was as if it were hovering and trying to hide itself. when the craft left, it shot up vertically very very fast. my boyfriend also saw the same thing last wednesday on the 8th of september 2010. and again, he tried to get a picture but it was just too dark to capture it light.

about 30 mins of watching this light we could see as if it was almost searching for something.... reason being we could see a light being shown outward from it and reflecting off the clouds. we then went to grab some taco bell, after getting back we went back outside on the back and it was no where in sight,. it's not every night i go outside and look ip but with alot of things on my mind lately

had just met dan aykroyd last night, and we discussed shortly about ufo's in which he asked do u have any photographic evidence and i was like no but then i remembered hey i do have some evidence!, so he told me to report on forums when ever i see one or catch one on camera. \r\n\r\nso a few years back in 2007 i caught news from a local newspaper that a crop circle was found out on a farm in the st greggor area of saskatchewan. so the article stated that it was not the first time this happened on that particular farm and that the reporter that went to investigate was having difficulties with her cell phone which was registering dates of calls from the 1940's and also that her cell phones memory was erased. so i thought wow i need to go check this out. \r\n\r\nso a group of friend's and i travelled to this crop circle about 3 hours east of saskatoon. we arrived about 7:30 pm and stayed about 2 hours just walking around in it and takeing pictures. nothing out of the ordinary happened the cell phones were fine the only thing odd was that upon takeing pictures it seemed like the cameras energy was being drained. the battery level stayed steady but the flash was not working properly the pictures appeared darker then it was at that time of day. the time this has happened to my camera before was when i took a picture of a friend who had bike reflectors on so i am thinking weird what is screwing with my camera flash. \r\n\r\nafter we left me and the other two passengers felt really exhausted which was also odd considering two of us had slept in quite long that day and me the driver is use to driving long road trips so it just can't be explained. upon returning home i got on the computer to upload my pictures and i noticed in some of them there were objects in the sky that i did not see while i was out there, so i blew the pictures up and well you can see for yourself i have no idea what to think is that an object? save and zoom in on it they look cylinder.\r\n\r\n also after returning home i couldn't help but feel really odd like i was being watched so i went to go camp over at my brothers house, and another thing most pictures were filled with orbs which i think were wheat particles mabye?  \r\n\r\npicture 1: is just to show you how dark the flash was making it look \r\npicture 2: top left side is an object with a tail\r\npicutre3: another object on top of

then i noticed a ball of light in the far distant bright and continuously lighted moving east horizontally and low in the sky at a slow pace.  i was looking north-west in direction, and i estimate the distant from me to about 5-10 miles. this reminded me of the ball of lights i have previously seen flying in the sky many other times.  i rushed inside the house to grab my camera, and i set the camera mode to night mode.  i then rushed back outside, spotted the ball of light, and i took 1 picture while trying to hold the camera as steady as i could in just one position.  because of the building structure was beginning to get in the way of my view, i was only able to get one more picture of the ball of light.  at the same time i noticed the ball of light, i also noticed something else flying around in that direction about maybe 1-2 mile away what may be a helicopter since i was able to see strobe lights flashing of it.  i took 1 picture of that helicopter light after the ball of light event.  upon downloading the picture, you can clearly see strobe lights on the helicopter, but not on the ball of light object which lately i been calling it a globe ufo.","distance":"Over

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving west on texas state road 87 towards la vernia. it was lightly drizzling and the traffic was driving slowly. i saw a little light shining through the rain clouds so i pulled over to get a better look at it because there no other star or light in the sky at that time. i stepped out of my truck and stood there next to the driver���s door for an about five minutes. as the rain cloud slowly dissipated and moved from south to north and i discovered i was looking at a shining star or a planet. however, as i was about to reenter my truck, something fell out of the slow moving rain cloud. at first i thought there was a mid-air collision so i imminently called 911 to report it. first i got through to bexar county 911 dispatch then i was transferred to wilson county 911 dispatch. a second car pulled off the road about 100 feet behind me and i believe they too witness this event.\r\nthis is what i reported to 911: i told them i was driving on 87 heading to stockdale, texas. i was presently between san antonio and somewhere near la vernia. i told 911 to hold on and i jumped back into my truck and drove about 200 to 300 feet to give them a crossroad. i pulled up to county road 365 and relayed my position. then i explain that i saw something about the size of a jet liner fall straight down from the rain cloud but there was no more rain coming from it now. the 911 dispatcher asked if i was sure it was a plane. i told them it looks like an airplane but the wings had broken off (i did not see any wing on the side facing me) and about the size of a boeing 757 or a bigger 747. i estimated the bottom of the cloud was 20,000 feet and it fell for about 5,000 to 10,000 feet and i think i counted 2 to 3 seconds of free fall. the object was about 20 to 30 miles east of me and was burning up on its way down but it was engulfed in blue flames with dripping hot metal falling more from one side of it (like when you see videos of the space shuttle columbia breaking up on reentry). except this thing is dropping straight down from the cloud and it was falling horizontal as if the plane hit a wall, stayed intact and started falling. as i watched it fall, all the flames had burned out about 5,000 feet above the ground. i could not hear anything because of the passing traffic and i did not see a ground impact because of the trees on the horizon. i told 911 that it was not a meteor because meteors fall like left to right or across the sky. 911 asked me where i thought it had falling. i told them it fell to the north and between of la vernia and stockdale. they asked for my full name and said they are sending a car out to investigate.\r\nafter i hung up the phone with 911, i continued my drive to stockdale and picked up my son and told him what i had called into 911 about 15 minutes earlier. so we continued east on 87 looking for the crash. we drove all the way to nixon with no luck so we stopped into nixon���s dairy queen to get something to eat and asked around if anyone had seen anything fall from the sky. there were about four employees but no one had seen or heard anything. it was now exactly 9:51pm when i stepped outside of the nixon���s dairy queen when i heard and noted a twin engine plane flying very slow in a circular formation right above the town. i motion my son to come out and verify the aircraft. i could not see any markings (just the anti-collision lights flashing) but by it slow speed and altitude i believe it to be a search plane.\r\nnext we drove back to stockdale. on the drive back to stockdale from nixon, we passed two police cars heading east but i could not tell if they where state or local law enforcement.  about 4 miles west of stockdale we took up a looking position at the southern corner of the intersection where 87 and 97 from floresville meet.  at exactly 10:33pm a low flying helicopter was flying from west to east just north of 87 in the direction to where i reported the possible impact area. at exactly 10:55 two police cars with sirens and lights flashing were driving very fast from stockdale direction towards la vernia direction. at about 11:15 with no further incidents, we drove home so i could make this report.  i have added a few maps of the area to show my location when i called 911.\r\n\r\n[name removed/cms/tg]\r\n         \r\n \r\n","distance":"Over One

continued to observe the lights and i e-mailed the following update last night to cclift@mufon.\r\n\r\nmon, 9/13: the larger multi-colored object we observed is still visible although it is somewhat smaller and appears to be a little further south of where we first observed it.\r\n \r\nsince i submitted the report, we have observed multiple triangular or chevron shaped objects appear around the larger object.  the three points of the smaller chevron shaped objects appear to be smaller versions of the larger multi-colored object and they appear to pulsate and dim more so than the larger object which remains fairly static in brightness.\r\n \r\nfrom 9:45 - 9:54 pm ketchikan, ak time two chevron shaped objects phased into view surrounding the larger object and \"pointing\" at it. two triangular shapes were at roughly 7 o'clock and 4 o'clock in relation to the larger object. at 10:03 we observed a third chevron appear at about 11 o'clock from the larger object. the third chevron was also \"pointing\" at the larger object.\r\n \r\nit is now 10:51 and the larger object is still visible...I discontinued observing shortly after 11 pm on 9/13.\r\n\r\ntonight, 9/14, we returned home at about 8:20 pm ketchikan time and observed the same multi-colored formation/s. the largest one is situated  more south/southeast than last night but it is in the same general area, although it appears a little more distant/smaller.  there are a number of smaller multi-colored objects as well. we haven't seen the triangles form tonight.\r\n\r\nin addition, at about 8:30-8:35 pm we noticed a brilliant white object appear to the west of deer mountain...When we arrived home at about 8:20 pm tonight that object was not in the sky.\r\n\r\nmy sister reminded me that she mentioned the brilliant white object last night but we were so wrapped up in observing the multi-colored object/s that we didn't pay much attention to the white object. \r\n\r\nupon closer inspection tonight, the white object has a large brilliant light on the north side and it appears to have mass between the north end and what appear to be small windows further back towards the south end of it. overall, the shape appears to be flatter and more elongated than the spherical multi-colored objects. both objects are at roughly the same altitude and appear to be stationary.\r\n\r\na group of four of our neighbors observed these objects with us tonight. one of our neighbors has lived in the area for a number of years and she says she's never seen anything like this. everyone agreed that these appear to be \"ufo's\"\r\n\r\nagain tonight, the sky is clear and visibility is excellent. there appears to be less erratic movement than we observed last night. the objects remain clearly visible by the naked eye as i type this at 10:10 ketchikan, ak time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

left at the top of the hill. i was in the passenger seat & looked up. what i saw was just pure confusion. \r\n\r\nmy first logical thought was \"is that a plane going down?\" the object was completely & steadily vertical. simple, very uncomplicated plane/cross type shape. vertical, cylindrical, 3 bright lights. shadowy aura, blurry background; almost computer pixel-y looking. more 2-d than 3-d, if that makes any sense. \r\n\r\nit was right above the church's roof. the driver did not want to stop so i kept looking in the rear view window, i could still see the 3 lights behind the trees as we headed down the hill. i convinced the driver to turn around,.. we returned & there was nothing out of the ordinary. it was gone.\r\n\r\nit was almost like an apparition, because we were so close to this thing- it was extremely confusing as to why neither me nor the driver could focus our eyes on it. everything around it was clearly there, but looking at this thing was just too much to process. it was very jerky, fast moving - but at the same time not moving at all; seemed very busy, the energy was busy. but it did nothing at the same time. i was too stunned & confused during/afterward to even think of grabbing my camera out of my purse.\r\n \r\n--------\r\ni drew a decent enough drawing on my computer via paint.\r\n(the pole with red lights in the background of my picture, behind the trees on the right, is a distant radio tower that i kept looking at, behind my object, to make sure i wasn't confused while looking at this mystery thing.)\r\n\r\nalso added is a the only picture i
