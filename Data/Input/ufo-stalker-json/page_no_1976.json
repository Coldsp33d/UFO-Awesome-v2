sky, but it was mostly clear. i looked up and noticed an odd shaped object moving slowly from a westerly direction moving easterly. it was high in the sky and it was quite a long distance from my vantage point but i could tell immediately that it was not an aircraft (there were no wings or helicopter blades and there was no sound). my first thought was that it was some sort of balloon but it didn't resemble balloon shapes that i'm familiar with. after moving slowly eastward for a time, it stopped and hovered above my head for perhaps a minute or so. i always carry a small camera with me so i pulled it out and snapped a couple of photos zooming to the maximum that this camera is capable of (about 5x). i wasn't sure that the pictures would turn out since it was difficult to zero in on the image with the camera's viewfinder. after a minute or so the object drifted behind a small cloud. i watched for several minutes thinking that it would pass through the cloud and become visible again. after it vanished behind the cloud i never saw it again. my initial reaction was that this was an object that is not commonly seen, at least in my experience, and it definitely piqued my curiosity.\r\n\r\ni was quite surprised to discover that the photos captured the object fairly well, especially the second photo. when zeroing in on the object with my computer's software i was very surprised to see that it was shaped like a dirigible or torpedo but it seems too small to be a blimp or similar type aircraft. it also appears to have a shiny metallic skin the reflects sunlight. the fact that it stopped and hovered for awhile also seems a bit strange since the cloud next to it was moving slowly with the prevailing wind. after viewing the photos on my computer i felt a sense of mystery and intrigue and am really anxious to see if there's some sort of conventional explanation for this sighting. i suppose it could be some sort of weather or scientific research balloon and i intend to do some follow-up to see whether or not that is a plausible explanation. i do find it especially strange that the object did not appear again after drifting behind the cloud.\r\n\r\nany insights that you can provide would be appreciated. if you have any further questions feel free o contact me.  i look forward to hearing from you.\r\n-[name removed/cms/tg]","distance":"Over One

leaving (around 10:10), i was driving west on marine drive nearing the 223rd st exit. as i approached the off-ramp, i noticed a unique light in the northern sky, and it was heading in my direction. what made the light unique was that it was circular in shape and moving back and forth across the front of the craft. it reminded me of the car \"kit\" from the television show 'knight rider' except for the fact the light was white and round. as it drew near (roughly 100 yards away), i could see the underneath of the craft. it seemed to have a triangular shape but rounded (basically there seemed to be no straight lines). the craft was also a silver color and absolutely had no visible means of propulsion. i didn't see any propellers or jet engines. now the most incredible part of this experience was that the light seemed to help determine the direction the craft would head. the light stopped pacing back and forth and was stuck on one end for about 20 seconds. the craft started heading in the direction the light was facing, and soon the craft stopped and tilted forward as if the lights were this crafts eyes. i immediately realized what i was witnessing was something out of the ordinary and caused me to lose control of my scooter for a brief moment. while this happened the crafts light shot directly in my direction and then the craft slowly turned in my direction. by then i was so scared i focused on my driving, trying to figure out what to do and where to go, being that i was in an area with little traffic and little to none lighting. about 30-45 seconds passed without looking at this craft,(while heading south on 223rd), but once i turned my head assuming it'd be above me by then, it was gone.  when i noticed the craft gone, i was coming to a light

wife and i were on a cruise through the alaskan inside passage aboard the ms norwegian pearl.  it was approximately 9:30pm pdst.  the night sky was clear with no mist, fog or clouds anywhere in sight.  the seas were calm.  our position which i checked via gps after the incident and then factored in the time and distance traveled subsequently was about 51���02.23' n 128���38.26' w.\r\n\r\nour stateroom was an outside cabin on the port side towards the bow of the ship.  we went out on the balcony to view the stars and the water.  no moon was visible and the staterooms to either side of us had no outer lights on so visibility was excellent.  according to the ship's gps broadcasts over the stateroom tv the ship was traveling at 22 knots with a compass bearing of about 338 degrees.\r\n\r\nahead of the ship and about 10 - 20 degrees off her port bow and above us i noticed a bright light heading in a straight line along the side of the ship at about 11 o'clock.  it was coming directly towards the ship but on a parallel, not an intercept course.  the light was brighter than any star, and brighter than venus on a clear night.  it was also more of a dingy, yellowish white rather than the white or bluish light of stars and planets.  there was no flicker to it nor was there any changing of color.\r\n\r\ni directed my wife's attention to the object and noted that it was approaching the ship but only very slowly; far less than the speed at which an approaching aircraft would have been moving.  we both looked for any sign of flashing strobes or of the standard red/green lights lights on conventional aircraft but there were none.  if i had held a new pencil out at arms' length the eraser would have just been big enough to cover the object, but just barely so.\r\n\r\nthe object passed above and along the length of the ship and passed by our position over a period lasting about 5 minutes.  both my wife and i continued to look carefully for any signs of a strobe or navigation lights but there were none, not when it was in front of the ship, not when it was directly perpendicular to our position and not after it has passed us by.  we also listened closely for any sounds of engines.  there were none.  as the seas were very calm and any wind consisted mainly of that generated by our ship's own forward motion, noise levels were very low.  we would easily have been able to hear a plane or helicopter engine.  since there was no cloud cover at all we had no way to accurately determine the object's altitude.  i think it was probably no less than 1000 feet and probably no more than 3000, but that's a very subject estimation.  the object did not pass near enough to any bright stars for us to detect whether there was a greater bulk behind the bright light or not. \r\n\r\nafter about 5 minutes the object simply faded from view over the course of less than 10 seconds.  one moment it was very bright, then next it was fading, fading, fading, gone.  as it faded out there was no deviation in any direction from its original course.  we looked carefully to see if there might have been some very nebulous, low-lying clouds it could have ducked behind, but we could still clearly see faint stars in the same area the object had disappeared in.  they were faint, but not obscured by clouds.  the object simply disappeared.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i stood discussing what we had just seen and kicking around all of the possibilities.  we were confident it had not been an aircraft in any conventional sense.  it was completely silent and had none of the normal running lights required.  we considered whether or not it could have been some sort of balloon.  the fact that we were approaching it at 22 knots and yet it took about 5 minutes to travel such a short distance to get past us suggested it may have been moving in the same direction our ship was traveling only at a slower speed.  still, we thought, if we had grossly misjudged its altitude, perhaps it was some type of balloon and the slowness of its approach had been due to its extreme height.\r\n\r\nwe chewed things over like this for about another 5 minutes when all of the sudden the object reappeared in its full brightness at about the same position relative to the ship it had vanished at.  this time it kept exact pace with the ship and fell no further behind.  it was, however, now moving on an intercept course perpendicular to the ship.  it took about 2 minutes to traverse a distance equal to the length of my thumb held out at arms' length at which point it made a course deviation back up to the north and then reversed course away from the ship before correcting once again in the opposite way so that it was again approaching.  both my wife and i noted this course change at the same time so it was not a trick of the eyes.  it was clear an unambiguous.\r\n\r\nthere was still no sound and still no other lights of any kind associated with it.  once again it began to fade from view only this time the fade was slower.  it took nearly a full minute for the object to fade to the brightness of a very dim star but it was clearly visible the whole time.  once it had reached this level of brightness it continued to move towards the ship for another 2 to 3 minutes, very slowly and visible at all times.  when it had traveled about twice the distance of my thumb again it disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nwe waited for several more minutes on the balcony to see if it would reappear.  it did not.  however, it seemed to us highly unlikely that any type of balloon would have drifted at high altitude past the ship then held position and followed the ship while executing first a 90 degree turn so as to head towards the pearl, then a letter s type maneuver, then headed back towards the ship again while keeping pace with it.  so we ruled out the balloon hypothesis.  we couldn't come up with any other plausible explanations.  the ship never deviated from its course the whole time so were were not being fooled by apparent motion of the object.  there was no sound, no other lights, and no flickering or twinkling of the object's light.  we ruled out all the things we're sure it was not.  we just couldn't come to any firm conclusion as to what it actually was.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25418,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.1658836,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-09142010-0004","longitude":-123.9400647,"occurred":1283833800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British

bright. as the object passed and proceeded away from my location the light never lost size or intensity. i did view the object wth my binoculars on it's approach, passing and leaving. doing this always reveals some part of the aircraft or any marking lights (red, green or flashing) but this time it did not and the light actually seemed to have a dark center but i am not 100% sure of that. i

yellow.  it was about the size of jupiter and venus joined together on their brightest luminescence. it flew from the west to the southeast.  after the object went over the far horizon the chanting ceased within minutes.  i don't know if the two are related but they seemed to coincide with each other and each seemed to stop with each other.  i tried to check the field where i heard the chanting from and it was dark and empty.  i also got the sense of presence from the object and along with the chanting seemed to cast a strong presence of unease.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

from project starlight(still have the plans)on the night in question the detector had gone off and my parents and two brothers had went outside and in the northeastern sky had seen an odd light so we had big high powered flash lights and started flashing them at the light and it stopped moving and soon a light came out from underneath and started coming toward us so we kept flashing(very excited)so it came closer and closer came to the edge of our yard(in the woods)we were about 75 to 100feet away it was disk shaped with a band of colored spinning lights like a belt with portals with figures in them totally silent except windy me my middle brother and mother all ran inside and hid under the beds and my older brother and father stayed and watched longer and the disk went over my yard and father and brother and kept going about 300 feet over to the edge of the cometary and turned around went back over them and returned to its other ship and casually left then after my father and brother came back inside me and my middle brother went back outside to see if we could still see the ship and it was gone and at that time three army jets in a triangular formation from the direction of fort devens flue over the house and us at tree top level so we know they had the object on radar so thats my story i would take a lie detector test any day of the week i know what i saw and it was about 75 to 100 feet around and about the same distance from us and there is no way it was anything but advanced very advanced from another world so far ahead of us we cant comprehend.And around the same time my parents were smoking in bed and dont remember anything but waking up with both having a very weird dream of being picked up and being examined by beings and them teling my mom that she would die from cancer and here it is 25 years later and she passed earlier this year from pancreatic cancer very weird and father can still tell you of the dreams he is kinda sick know and my middle brother is passed but my older brother and father would probably tell you of the incident but its bothered me my whole life and i just wanted someone to know other than us that i thought could understand             thank you *(wit's name deleted--sgonzalez/cms)call anytime id love to talk farther and i also have a signed leter from betty and barny hill to my mom from the day and the detector plans ill tell you one thing that stopped our curiosity                   ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Three of us were returning from a high school football game in a suv traveling north on 17th street on the east side of bend oregon.  it was  10 pm when we noticed lights to the north, off in the distance, perhaps several miles away  it was a clear night and no moon light.   as we discussed the incident later, all of us at first just assumed it was an aircraft at first.  however the object then went from what seemed like a stationary point several miles off and at a high rate of speed, perhaps 1500 mph, as though it was shot from a gun, it came directly towards us and stopped a short ways off, maybe 1000 feet away.  it stopped instantly; there did not appear to be any acceleration or deceleration -it just went full speed and stopped on a dime.  then the object in a similar manner shot off in easterly direction and stopped again then it came back again and hovered perhaps 500 feet away and not more than 500 in elevation.  then the object moved very slowly getting closer to us.  we could see very clearly the object was triangular in shape perhaps the same mass as a medium sized motor home, not really very large.  underneath the object were perhaps 15 symmetrically placed bright white lights that formed the shape of a triangle with lights inside the triangular shape as well.  i would estimate the diameter of the lights at 5��� and they were definitely round in shape, the bottom side protruded down sort of like spot light in shape.  all the lights were on and extremely bright, not flashing or pulsing or fading.  the object was approximately 1/3 longer than the width of what appeared to be the rear of the object.  on the sides were red lights that appeared to at times be on wings or perhaps the upper sides of the craft.  one of the witnesses with me said he saw blue lights, which i did not see.  when the craft was slowly hovering a short distance away it seemed that part of the craft, the part illuminated with the red lights, rotated or shifted some how in a very bizarre manner, as though they messed, passed through each other and traded sides on the craft which gave the impression it was flip flopping around, although the triangular shaped lights on the bottom remained constant and did not change or fluctuate in their positions.  these events all unfolded in about 90 seconds, then again the craft shot off, like shot from a gun.  it went from a hovering position to full speed instantaneously which was at a very high rate of speed in a westerly direct and in just an instant out of sight.   all of these maneuvers did not generate any noise, the craft was absolutely quiet and did not stir up any dust  on the ground.  we did not see it again, it was gone.  all of us were shocked and nervously laughed about what we just seen.  not one of had ever seen anything like it before.  we started to try to explain what we saw.  we eliminated helicopters because it would have been noisy and would stirred up a bunch of dust.  a helicopter could never perform those types of maneuvers, we eliminated airplanes for similar reasons.  the only conclusion we could draw was that the object was a ufo.  perhaps this was a once in a life time event for the three  of us, but we all agree, we hope to see it again. it was very interesting and facinating. in retrospect not one of us was fearful or frightened, only curious.  i  spent a good portion of the next evening looking into the night sky hoping to see it again.  we all agreed we would never look up to the night sky in the same way after seeing our first ufo.
