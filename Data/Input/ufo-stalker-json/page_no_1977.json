lie, unfortunately i didn't have my phone with me during this sighting so i have no evidence,which obviously doesn't really help to prove this, but regardless of evidence i know what i saw and it wasn't the usual aircraft,my partner suggested i should report it,i agreed and thought others may have seen the same thing and be able to relate,so here it is!.....\r\n\r\nso.....\r\n\r\ni was walking back from the shop,the time was 09.10pm,and as i was walking up the road that's close to my street,[holton road in barry] i turned the corner to enter my street and noticed lights moving in the

high,it was like looking at four jupiter's,they were quite big but silent!\r\nat first glanse i thought they must be a plane or something but as i carried on walking and then looked up again,the white

houses close to my street and went out of sight,it to was silent!!!\r\n\r\nonce i got home,which was about 20 meters away,i went straight to the garden to see if i could catch another glimpse,but by

 this thing just turns on with consistent white light, and turns off with consistent darkness, one minute its moving the next it is in the same spot, the next it is gone, and the next it is back bright and in a different part of the sky within the same vicinity, disappearing at different times.  i have not been able to photgraph it, its too far away for my phone to pick it up, but other people have seen it,  though no one knows what it is.  i am sure i will see it at some point again tonight, and frankly i wonder why me and what is this friggin' thing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":25386,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.9888424,"location":null,"logNumber":"DZ-09122010-0003","longitude":6.4582443,"occurred":1281176460000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Skikda","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1284315741000,"summary":"Unidentified flying object.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Africa/Algiers","timeZoneName":"Africa/Algiers","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":36,"locationName":"Zitouna, Skikda","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:99462"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Concordia","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were behind a local restraunt talking to an employee in the ally when we seen the ufo.  the night was very clear, not a cloud in the sky.  the stars were bright.  they orange color appeard and i noticed it first.  i watched for a flash or any different color to see if it was a plane.  but there was none.  only a orange ball(from the distance) i'd say it could of only been a few miles from us.  not that far away.\r\n\r\nfour orange lights moving north about as half as high as a normal commercial jet flies.  two of the objects were close together, id say a few hundred of feet apart. moving at a consistant speed them fading all in what it seems like the exact same part of the sky.  and faded into the night with in a few seconds.  soon one more came and did the same, and as soon as that one disapeardin in the same part of the sky, another came and did the same.  we were on main street and close to the building.  so we couldnt see them south of main street.  it looked like they were on the western part of town or outside of town heading north.  \r\n\r\nthey glowed an orage color and did not flash, but were bright.  \r\n\r\nwe all got our phones out to take a picture or make a video.  our phones did not have the quallity to get any good pictures. our friend did, but it was just a faint orange light in the darkness.

accounts until i experienced this myself. anyone who's anyone can distinguish an airplane or a helicopter at night...Unless it's military you're going to see red and green lights and a flashing beacon light. living in the west valley of phoenix you can often look towards the scottsdale area and see the bright landing lights of planes on approach to sky harbor. when i first saw this object it occurred to me that this might be what i was looking at. i'm not up on all of the scientific terms to describe the object's initial location so i will do my best using constellations, approximate angles to the ground, and \"clock\" angles. the following is what i witnessed.\r\n\r\nat about 3:15 am, which is about 2.5 hours ago right now, on saturday, september 11, 2010 i stepped outside to have a smoke before going to bed. our back patio faces to the north. we are approximately 2 miles southwest of westgate city center, university of phoenix stadium, and jobing.Com arena. as i usually do when i'm outside at night i look to the sky star gazing and looking for the occasional shooting star. so as i'm turned slightly to the northeast i see a little pinpoint of light appear that was red in color and moving in a southeasterly direction...Towards the airport. to put it in perspective the north star was directly out our back door, roughly 30-35 degrees above the horizon with cassiopeia slightly higher and to the west. the object was probably between 35 & 40 degrees above the horizon and at about the 1 o'clock position relative to the north star. it was moving somewhat slowly but it seemed too far away to be on approach.\r\n\r\napproximately a minute after i noticed it the red pinpoint was gone and in its place a slightly larger white light. at this point i'm thinking it must be a plane on approach and it only looked far away because it's a little 2 seat cessna. it didn't take me long to change my mind as only a few seconds later the white light shrunk back to the red pinpoint. the object cycled from red pinpoint to white light several times, i want to say in 10-15 second intervals, as it continued moving in the same direction. now i have no idea what to make of it. i thought there might be a possibility it was a satellite catching sunlight and reflecting it. however, i have witnessed satellites before as well as the shuttle and space station flying over when i lived back in michigan. satellites travel at tremendous speeds and traverse large areas of sky quickly, while this thing still hadn't made it to 3 o'clock position relative to the north star.\r\n\r\nagain, my mind was changed...About 5 minutes after i first noticed the object it reverted back to a red pinpoint and stopped moving. it just sat there stationary like that for about 2 minutes when all of a sudden it turned to the white light again and continued moving. it went through i want to say 4 red and white cycles when it stopped again. this time it stayed stationary for a minute but it continued with the light cycles. after that minute passed it began to move back towards where i initially saw it! right about at this point i'm thinking that perhaps it was a helicopter due to the starting and stopping as well as the possibility that the white light was a search light. the only thing that didn't make sense about this theory was that there was no beam reflecting on dust particles in the air and the white light was not independent of the entire objects movement...Meaning it didn't appear that it could be positioned to shine backwards, it was fixed and moving as one with the red light. eventually, it stopped moving again and stayed white for almost a full minute. when it turned to the red pinpoint again it continued moving for about 30 seconds, stopped, and then just seemed to fade out and vanish. this vanishing part is what convinced me to write this, i am positive that it was not a satellite or an aircraft that i am aware of! unfortunately, i have no pictures or evidence, only my eyewitness account. if any part of me was skeptical before it's not anymore...I have no clue what i was observing for about 10 minutes!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then

myself, but another tenant in the apartment house i live in saw this one) there appeared out of the cloudless blue sky an object that seemed to be about fifty yards in front of us and about thirty-five ft. up.  i was sitting on the ground level front porch out front.  there was no sound that i could hear from the object.\r\n\r\nmy estimation at its size could be very wrong, as i think it had a depth or length to it that i could not see beyond the front of it.  it looked to be about twelve feet wide.  it looked like there was silver fire about a foot and a half long shooting out from it all across it.  like i said in the description above, like the 'sparks' of sparklers, only a foot and a half in length, and much much larger generally, and all across what i thought then was the front of it, as the object was moving towards me.  \r\n\r\nwhen i, rarely, see a ufo i try to see what there is about it that could be explainable as something mundane, and i did so with this, thinking, could it be some kinds of lights that i'm seeing, but it was obvious that it was some kind of, not flames, but flame or huge sparkler-like 'flames' coming from it.  it came down at a slight, straight angle in my direction, though still fifty yards or so away, at the most, then it went sharply to its right and up.\r\n\r\ni began to go into the apartment house to get my camera, but after a few quick steps i thought, it'll probably be gone by the time i can get my camera, and i saw from my second-story window that it had gone.\r\n\r\nmy reactions was amazement at such an unusual thing, and too, the 'flames' that were most of what i saw could have been on any side of it, i couldn't tell from which side or if from only one side, as they were towards me, from where i saw it, both when it was moving towards where i was and when it was ascending towards the side of where it had been.  \r\n\r\nfor a couple of seconds i thought i could see metal, silvery metal above and in back of where the 'flames' were, a foot or two in back of them and less than a foot 'above' the huge, sparkler-like 'flames.'\r\n\r\nit seemed very much an object that was there, and i feel sure it was, but there certainly was what seemed like a strangeness to it, probably because i had never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\ni think too, the way it appeared fairly near me and descended as it moved a bit closer, that it may have been checking me out, perhaps because of the sighting i had a few days earlier.  i didn't really have a feeling about that, but it was something i was thinking a little later.  in spite of the objects 'unusualness,'  i was much less excited about it, though glad i saw it, than about the earlier sighting, but the guy sitting on the porch with me was very excited, to put it mildly.\r\n\r\nexcuse the long report.  i guess i could make this report much briefer, but now that i have it, and exactly as it was, i will leave it.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

also usually look up at the stars, the moon and any visible planets just to see them.  as soon as i looked up this evening i noticed two stars 'close' together in the west, but the reddish-white one, at a much lower altitude, began moving fairly quickly, but at a steady rate, in my general direction.  it was going much too slow for a satellite and much too fast for a plane.  i could not hear any sound associated with it at any time.\r\n\r\nwhen it got to what i think was about 900-1000 ft. above me, and only about 50 ft. away horizontally, it stopped.  it was there about four seconds when i thought to say, and did say, but not aloud, \"please signal me if i am communicating with you.\"  by \"you\" i meant any occupants of course.  in a second the 'star' 'morphed' into a light-brown form six times the size of the star shape.  the 'star' was no longer visible. \r\n\r\nthe form was perfectly clear and with no lights on it.  perhaps it was lit from inside, though it did not have a transparent look about it.  it was a basically round form, but not exactly spherical, it was longer and wider and round where it seemed to go out from where the 'star' had been, but more pointed at the other end.  the form looked as if it had, or was of some kind of texture, rather than plastic or whatever.  it stayed in that shape for about two seconds at the most, then was the star shape again.  a few seconds later it began to move east again.  \r\n\r\nit disappeared a little more than half-way through the eastern part of the sky.  there were some clouds in that part of the sky, though they were barely visible.  it was a fairly dark sky except for the stars in the western part of the sky at that time of night.  the ufo might have gone behind a cloud, though i don't know that.  \r\n\r\nwhen the ufo, for lack of a better name for it, as that is what it was technically and perhaps in the general use of the term, i don't know what else it could have been, but when it responded, if it was responding, to my request to it that it respond to me, i became fairly excited.  it may be 'amateurish' to think and say so, but at the time and even more so later, i did become pretty damn excited about it -- though i didn't quit looking at it or jump up and down when i saw it do as it did.  i did feel good about the fairly certain assumption that it had responded, especially for a couple of days after, and i still think it was neat that it or they appeared to do so.

probably because when it first started to appear, it matched up with venus on my google sky map.  it always appears just very slightly south of the western sky at dusk and travels in an easterly direction.  but don't get me wrong, it goes up and down and backwards and forwards the whole time...Veeeeerrryy slowly.  with no sound that i can hear, yet it has only been close enough to hear once, and then there was no sound either - i know because an airplane passed right before i saw it in the same place, and i heard the airplane loud and clear.  one night i watched it for 30 minutes thinking it was coming toward me, but it ended up fading away, and i assumed it was heading the opposite direction.  later on, i started watching it with the binoculars, and that's when i noticed that it was flashing.  it did not look like anything natural.  after i witnessed the flashing for the first time, i seemed to notice the flashing more often, even without the binoculars.\r\n\r\nin the past couple months or so, i had gotten really involved in ufology and such, and they seem to be drawn to me now, which is terrifying, so i don't want anything to do with any of it anymore.  basically, 3 nights ago, i saw one flying by close enough to make out that it wasn't a plane, because a plane flew by right before i saw it.  i actually tried talking to it with my mind, asking it to power up, (believe me, i know how weird it sounds) but to my disbelief, it actually started strobing hard right before it disappeared behind the trees - almost like when a police car flashes its lights.  i went inside and set the alarm, and when i hit the last button, a light behind me in the house flashed and i heard what sounded like a power surge.  my whole body felt like it was electrified, and every hair stood up - this was the first paranormal experience i ever had.  later that night i had one of the realest dreams i've ever had that i was abducted, and when i woke up, i couldn't go back to sleep because i was so terrified.\r\n\r\nthe next night, i saw it sitting in it's normal location when it first appears, and noticed that it was definitely coming towards me - so much so that i was so terrified of what i might see, i had to get up and go inside because i started having a panic attack and got nauseous.  it was really strange.  later that night i had another dream that i saw like a mothership-like craft, which was also really unsettling, yet not as much so as the abduction dream.  and by the way, all day this day and the day before i heard planes overhead constantly, yet only saw one.\r\n\r\ntonight, i watched it sit in its usual location and strobe like crazy.  it came a little closer and then started to drop down behind my neighbor's house and fade out a bit.  later tonight, i went back outside, and it was in a completely different part of the sky, still strobing like crazy - red, blue, green, and white.  this time, i also witnessed 3 tiny separate single strobe flashes in separate intervals, right after one another which seemed to be away from the craft and move in a counter-clockwise l shape going up to the craft - only 3 - flash, flash, flash, gone - but the craft was still there strobing crazily.  i went so far as to ask my neighbor, who witnessed the same thing as well as my best friend who was in a neighboring town who could also see exactly what i was seeing.  neither could explain it.  i also went so far as to call the local police station to report it and ask if anyone else had reported it, but they said no & they would walk outside and look.  i also tried to call the local newspaper, but it was too late and they were closed.\r\n\r\ni'm really scared at this point, because i know this is not normal, and i just don't want to see it anymore.  i just feel like it's watching me or something, and i just want to be left alone.  especially the bad dreams are the worst.  if i have another dream tonight, i don't know what i'll do.  i don't like it.  there have been so many cases of this that obviously our government has to know, or either they are just completely retarded.  i just don't like being kept out of the loop, and if there is something that i don't know that i don't even want to know, just please stop flashing it in my effing face every single night.  i'm just tired of feeling like i'm going insane, because this is just getting ridiculous.  please explain to me what i am seeing.  what is the most likely explanation?  is there one?  please get back to me as soon as possible, because i'm not really comfortable with this stuff anymore - i've given up all research on ufology and exopolitics because i just want things to go back to normal, but these things keep appearing every single night.  sometimes i wish the air force would send jets and just shoot it down, but i feel like nobody knows it's even there except for my friend and neighbor who i personally made aware of it.  please help!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":25371,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.80285,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09112010-0001","longitude":-87.670031,"occurred":1284102000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1284190727000,"summary":"Flashing strobe-like light (white, red, blue, green), happens every night in western sky.","tags":["flash","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Florence, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:99477"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Marshfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I looked up at the clear night sky because i noticed movement, when i looked i seen a big star like object moving across the sky, i immediately got excited, and all of a sudden another star like object caused a bright flash or sparkle and disappeared. i looked for the other object and found it again moving at a more brisk pace and it gradually appeared to get smaller and disappear into the blackness of space. i stared up at the sky for a couple minutes after this and i noticed slow moving stars looking like they were moving on an orbit across the sky","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":25370,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.6722624,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09102010-0013","longitude":-90.1676987,"occurred":1284093000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1284187424000,"summary":"None submitted. see detailed description.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/25370_submitter_file1__UFOPathSketch.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Marshfield, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:99478"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Newport News","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was walking home from a friends house through a field.I was on my way back home to go to bed.When i had seen a violet colored glow in the corner of my eye and decided to look upwards.Sense i live near a-lot of military bases i just assumed it was another black project.But the way it was hovering and the length it hovered i knew it wasn't a black project.I stood in the field transfixed for at-least 1 hour 10 minutes just looking.I felt like it was scanning me or something to that effect.I had some sort of paralysis that made me unnerved like i couldn't move even if i tried.Then after i was able to regain my constitution and be able to move.The violet glow intensified then it was as if it went from stationary to at-least mach-4 if not faster.When i got home it took me at-least a week to finally be able to sleep.To this day i still have nightmares from this event.
