streets. just above the trees to the south/south-west i observed 3 very large bright spherical objects. 2 were white light and one was crimson. the 2 objects with white light seemed to cross in close proximity to each other with the crimson object centered slightly below them. these two objects moved in opposite directions (south east and south west) leaving the crimson object which dipped down in a v shaped path. when it completed the v shaped route it hovered in the air for about 60 seconds which is when i was able to really focus on it's characteristics. first, regardless of the direction of the object, it always remained a spherical object, as opposed to, for example, seeing the underside as it moves higher in the sky. there was no sound from any of the objects. it's movements were similar to a helicopter and i tried to dismiss it as a helicopter. but the object was way to large to be helicopter lights and i would have been able to see the body of the helicopter as it changed direction and height. \r\n\r\ni wish i could remember more specifics but i was too busy trying to convince myself i was seeing something normal. primarily i remember the point at which the crimson object was hovering and i could see it very clearly. i would describe it as spherical, with a beautiful crimson (deep red with black kind of running through it)color. it didn't shimmer, it looked more like plasma. around the circumference of the object looked almost like contained flames. it was one of the most beautiful colors i have ever seen.  it started moving down behind the trees and then it was gone. \r\n\r\nit also didn't project any light, it was completely self contained. it was pretty low in the sky, and closer than airliners pass overhead. all 3 of the objects had to be very large. \r\n\r\ni wasn't afraid while i was watching it, or after. oddly, when i recall the color of the crimson object, the most overwhelming feeling i have is how beautiful it was. i have never seen a color so beautiful.

experienced in thousand oaks, ca on saturday august 21st, 2010 at 12:00 noon. i also have a short video.\r\n \r\nplease note: the picture with the blue colored sky is the original picture. the purple colored pictures were highlight by me to bring out he objects in the image. note, if you zoom in you will notice the other objects in the pics that resemble the larger object. i did not notice the other objects until i uploaded the pics and zoomed in. \r\n \r\n \r\nexplanation of events:\r\n \r\nnote: this report includes two sightings exactly one week apart from each other in the same location within about 3-5 miles. have video and pics for the second sighting.\r\n \r\non saturday august 14th at around 5:30pm while floating on my back in the swimming pool looking straight up at the sky, my wife and i observed two bright ���star-like��� objects directly above us. i have always been interested and have observed/studied different aircraft and can usually make out what kind of aircraft in is in the sky.  one of the objects stayed stationary in the sky while the other was moving at a relatively slower speed (and very smoothly through the air) than a typical jet type passenger aircraft and heading south. the moving object seemed to disappear or i just lost visual sight of it after about 5 minutes. the object would speed up and slow down during the 5 minutes of observation. \r\n \r\nafter losing sight of the first moving object, i looked back at the other object and it was still motionless in the sky. it appeared to be a star (which was strange considering stars are not usually visual during this time of day with the sun still shinning bright) because it was so still in the sky. after what seemed to be 2 minutes, this second object began to move south in the sky as well about the same speed as the first. this object would also speed up then slow down and make slight turns while ultimately keeping a flight path towards the south. after losing sight of this object because of trees, my wife and i went to sit in the spa. almost immediately after getting into the spa i noticed the object out of the left corner of my eye towards the east of me and was heading north. it seemed the object had made a complete 180 degree turn. the object was a little lower in the sky towards the horizon and was much bigger at this point. it seemed to be a white sphere that was shinning bright in the sky. after observing the object heading north for about 5 minutes, we again lost sight of it because of trees obstructing our view. i did not have a camera on me at the time so unfortunately no pictures were taken of these objects.\r\n \r\nexactly one week later at 12:00 noon on saturday august 21, 2010 while walking out to my vehicle, i noticed the same type of bright white ���star-like��� ���orb��� object in the distance northern sky (altitude, size of the object, and distance unknown). i immediately ran into the house to grab my camera and told my wife to come out in order to confirm what i was seeing. she did confirm seeing the object in the sky and i was able to record a video of it as well as take some pictures. also, something strange happened when i uploaded the pics of the object to my computer. when i zoomed into the object, i noticed many more of these strange \"white balls.��� these other objects were smaller, but i believe this was due to being further away.\r\n \r\nafter my experience observing these unidentified aerial objects and finding so many other videos and pictures of the same types of aerial objects online from all over the world, i am convinced this is something that is of extraterrestrial in origin. i am truly amazed at how many other pics and videos from around the world show the same type of objects that my wife and i have observed. it seems out of all the videos and pics i have seen thus far after researching this subject for the past couple of weeks, it seems this type of object shows up more than any other unidentified sightings. interesting considering just a few weeks ago my wife and i were skeptical of this kind of stuff. we are both highly educated and our brains/minds are ���pre-wired��� to think logically and in a scientific manner. after going through a process of elimination in our minds, we just can���t seem to find an answer as to what this was. we have researched this thoroughly and have analyzed pictures and videos of other aircraft, weather balloons, and other aerial explainable phenomenon. answers anyone?\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

that appeared to resemble, at that time, a condensed version of the big dipper. as i stared at it more, i noticed the flashes that were given off by the objects. perhaps, i thought, this was atmospheric hazing and poor vision, but with more and more observation, i undoubtedly saw red and green flashes at uneven intervals. i was able to nullify the effects of any light pollution by holding my jacket up to block any ground based light. it became more apparent that many of the flashes were weaving around each other, and sometimes visibly accelerating away and out of sight. the flashes were also able to make hairpin turns, and it seemed like there was a game of tag being played. i have no frame of reference to how high up the flashes were, but in regards to an extremely clear night, they seemed a little dimmer than most stars you can only see on extremely clear nights. i would speculate on there being between 5  and 9 of these flashes, and they clearly moved around a slightly brighter and slightly bigger flash. i will be clear when i say that there were red and green flashes. \r\nin order for others to get an idea where in the sky this was, i will attempt to describe it in a very rudimentary way. i was standing looking due east. let's say looking straight up is 12 o'clock, and looking towards the horizon is 3 o'clock... these craft were flying at barely 1 o'clock. \r\ni had no feelings toward seeing the craft, besides being certain that what i had seen were no stars or satellites. \r\nthe only reason that i left the flashes was because there seemed to be no end to the maneuvers, i grew weary of straining my eyes, and i expected nothing more to happen besides the eventual cessation of activity.

which is under the flight path of seatac airport and also has excellent views of puget sound and maury island. i am very familiar with the sight or aircraft landing. driving down a steep hill close to home i noticed a craft with an odd lighting formation. its lights were different sizes forms and placement than standard commercial jets that were very common.  it was also about half of the size of a jet.  i pointed it out to mark riding passenger. we both noticed that it was moving in the direction of other landing airplanes, but too slow for a commercial jet to stay up. i asked \"what is that?\"  he said he didnt know.  we were both very tense and  drove for another 60 seconds before arriving home. there was a bright moon and sparse low clouds. i thought that moving in the car or maybe wind blowing the clouds created the illusion of floating. i got out of the car and got a better view of it and is was still in the same area! we were sure it wasnt an airplane and ran afraid toward the door. to confirm again that i wasnt seeing things, i stopped at the door before going in and focused on it in relation to the coulds for about 3 more seconds when it moved in the opposite direction. it was at this point that i got the best view of the lights. unlike any aircraft i had ever seen, going up the side  was a large thick red light that showed the side angled like a pyrimid with a flat

o'clock to my position. i was at a stoplight when i thought that it was very close to the ground (est. 500-600ft) and couldn't imagine an airplane being in such close proximity. it was at this point when i realized that it appeared to be stationary and not moving. it was approx. 1/8-1/4 mile down range and to my left as i was at the traffic light and as i continued on my way the road curves to the left and the object was now directly to my left about 9 o'clock and still 500-600 ft in the air. at this point i stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down the window to try and hear if it was a hovering helicopter or something. it was dead quiet and now i could see that there were two distinct red pulsing lights to the rear of this object. they pulsed slowly and intermittently. i stared at this object in utter disbelief all the while waiting for another car to come by so i could verify this with someone else. there were no other cars around. i couldn't believe it and as i continued to stare at this thing for about 30-45 seconds i know it was completely still in its position. very bright forward lights with no defraction of light, by the way, and slowly pulsing red rear lights. after this duration of time, this \"thing\" completely catapulted forward from its position roughly 1/4-1/2 mile away within 1/2-1 second. when it did this i had a distinct guttural vibration of some sort and it took off like that and slowed immediately. i literally screamed and took off to come home. after i made my left turn at the next light i knew i could see this object about 1/4 mile down the road and to my left because it was a clear view from there. as i passed this area i could see the red pulsing lights, still the same distance above the ground but it looked to be about 3/4 mile away and it seemed to be slowly moving in that direction (away from me). i made my right turn to enter my housing! development (300 feet away) and as i was going down this road i kept looking in my rearview mirror to see if i could see anything at all. as i was driving down this winding road, all of a sudden this \"craft\" of somesort appears at my 11o'clock and coming directly overhead on a slight angle so that as it passed over i would then be at my 5 o'clock position. it still seemed to be about 500-600 feet above ground and i again stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down my window to stick my head out to get a better view. i was literally shaking with fear and/or excitement, i guess. as it passed over me very slowly, i could make out what seemed to be underneath structure of some sort with 4 additional \"lights\" facing downward. because of the location of the red still pulsing lights, i had the distinct impression that it was sort of triangular in shape but more like a wedge/boomerang. it was moving very slowly and didn't make any noise at all. it was extremely quiet and it traveled out of my sightline (many trees line this street)and i raced home thinking it was going to turn around and follow me. i don't know for sure if it was the same craft as i observed prior to this, but i am convinced it was the same shape and size.","distance":"101-500

i was outside just standing on the porch looking around at the night sky as i always do not thinking much about anything more than the conversation i was having,i then noticed what i thought was a meteor shooting across the sky and i even mentioned it to the friend i was on the phone with saying oh wow i haven't seen that in a while and then what ever it was stopped almost right above me just to my left and as it did i then saw a commercial plane coming up behind it heading in the same direction going north.The trees around my house are tall so you can't see planes or meteors or stars very good unless they are directly over a certain area of my yard anyway the object what ever it was as best as i can describe it appeared to be looking for something it was moving in a way that reminded me of a draggonfly moving back and forth with incredible speed and jerky movements i didn't even think were possible for aircraft,i am still stunned by what i saw i am at a loss for words i guess but as the commercial plane began to move across the sky to the north the object which was much lower than the commercial plane shot off to the north ahead of the plane.I am not a good judge of airliner speeds or plane speeds in general but this object shot off at a speed that got it straight out of sight heading north going upwards to a higher altitude so fast my eyes had a very hard time staying with it,the only speed i can think of that compares to it would be the speed of a meteor entering the earths atmosphere as you see it shoot across the sky,i am baffled by this what the heck was it? the whole incident with the object lasted about 4 or 5 seconds but the movements and the speed just don't seem real to me there is know way a person wound be able to withstand the force of such speed or the way the thing was shooting back and forth in different directions,i'm not telling anyone about this and using my name with the story there is know way anyone would believe me heck i don't even believe me and i saw it myself i just can't get over it and i'm quite sure i will be trying to rationalize it for a while and i know i will remember it for the rest of my life.I wish i didn't even see it because i was having a normal relaxed evening until this and now i will be up for a while just running that incident over and over in my head trying to catagorize it somehow..What was it that i

the front/rear of craft(3 to 7 lights in all). traveling s/sw over paris mt. toward greenville's historic west end. \r\n\r\ni was co-hosting a labor-day bonfire at a friends' house. we were all in the backyard. some of us were sitting or standing facing the fire and some were sitting/standing facing away from the fire. i was tending the fire and dividing my attention between the conversations and the music that we had playing at low level. my friends' brother had walked a little ways up the hill toward the house and something caught his attention. whatever he said exactly, i don't know but he caught my attention. i looked up to the area where he was standing and could see right where he was looking. i looked and couldn't see anything moving for a split second and then i saw it tracking from right to left very quickly. i said something excitedly and began moving up the hill towards my friend while watching this object. a few people were wondering what we were yammering on about since they hadn't seen this thing. the aircraft seemed to be triangular in shape. i say this due to the position of the 3 to 7 bright white lights(one at the tip and two rear points of the craft and maybe as many as 4 on the rear edges of the craft). no reflection from the city below could be seen on the aircraft but the bright light of the craft gave it definition. now i was running toward the front yard and saw a good five to six seconds of the object  before it went past the tree-line. after making it to the front yard i saw no more of the aircraft but did see an approaching aircraft that would have been at or near the same altitude and flying toward the area the object had just departed. the object may have been as much as 2-3 miles away from my location and was maybe no higher than 1k to 2k ft. in the air. helicopters and small aircraft seem to fly in the same altitude range as this craft. while only two of us saw the craft we asked the other folks if they had seen or heard anything at all while this took place. no one else saw the object and all of us agreed that there had been no sound.\r\n\r\nmy friend agreed to send me a short account in his own words for this report. here is what he had to say:\r\n \r\n\"i was staring into the night sky looking for shooting stars and what i thought was a shooting star was the front light of the air craft, then i followed the rest of air craft and noticed the four lights in the rear. the aircraft was also going at a very fast speed and no engine thrust sound what so ever.The air craft was a triangle shaped with no signs of color at all.\"\r\n\r\ni'm attaching two sketches of the craft. please bear in mind this is only a best representation of what we saw. the actual body shape and the number of lights could be very different. also, after discussing this event with the other witness, we both agreed we saw no sign of jets/afterburners.","distance":"Over One

horizon at a geopraphical heading of about 350 degrees. it was moving in a downward curving trajectory until it disappeared in a fraction of an instant at about 10 degrees above the horizon. the object appeared about as bright or detectable as jupiter rising in the east or venus which had already set in the west. the object appeared to reflect a pinkish or yellowish orange glow that may have been caused by the sun which had already passed over the horizon. the object appeared to be at a very great distance and therefore a very high altitude. it also would have been moving very fast and been quite large if it was at the extreme long range it appeared to be. my friend and i quickly noted all relative observations, time, heading, etc. we walked around the corner of the house to see jupiter, at which time we estimated the luminosity to be very simular. we could not explain what we saw. i have many reasons i do not believe this was any type of known artficial or naturally occuring

the most awesome thing i have ever seen, i was so excited that i had a hard time sleeping.  i wish i would of reported it right away so that date would be exact.  if you look at a map of waukesha you can easily find the intersection of highway 59 and fox river parkway to see the route i took.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the beach in progreso, yucatan. all of a sudden i said to her excitedly: ���we have to get to the beach. c���mon, let���s go right now!��� within minutes we had dressed and ran down to the beach across the street. (an urgent voice in my head had told me to get to the beach immediately.)\r\n\r\nwe sat on the beach and looked up at the sky, due north over the gulf of mexico. patchy cirrus clouds made it necessary to be extremely focused, as what took place often occurred at incredible speeds, infinitely faster than the fastest military aircraft. \r\n\r\nthere were two large ships. \"n\" (my wife) and i estimate that they appeared about as big as football fields, but we could be way off. one ship was circular and its contours were illuminated by a rainbow array of lights. the other was triangular, and emitted what we immediately thought was a laser-like light---a glow---that was magnificent. these ships were relatively stable in the skies. although they moved in any direction at will and even appeared to change shape, what they sent into the skies was even more incredible. \r\n\r\nabout twenty spheres were released by the ships and performed amazing feats of aeronautical engineering. they went up, stopped, went down, went left, right, changed direction. and then we were treated to something even more fantastic. one of the spheres zigzagged (like a zipper) from an altitude of about one mile and landed in the gulf of mexico, swimming distance to where we marveled on the beach. neither of us has seen faster movement by a material object. it was incredibly beautiful.\r\n\r\nafter forty-five minutes (2:15 est) we were more than overwhelmed and went back to our hotel room. interestingly, the following day we met our shaman in the pueblito of halacho near the campeche border with yucatan and he told us: ���it is good that you can see them.��� a fisherman who works at a popular restaurant in merida said: ���yes. two years ago we saw one in the same place. it landed in the water and didn���t even make a ripple.���\r\n\r\nfollowing this sighting, for a period of approximately three weeks, my wife and i experienced unusual phenomena (for me, life-changing). this is not the first time this has happened:\r\n\r\non may 30, 1998 (in los angeles) a brilliant white light appeared in my bedroom at 2:02 am. i felt myself (my mind, i guess) being drawn into the light. i have no other memory of this experience. when it was over it was 2:22 am. several weeks later a spirit-like being(female)appeared at the foot of my bed and observed my ex-wife and i. my ex-wife said to me: \"get back into bed.\" i said: \"i am.\" she said: \"stop goofing around. i see you standing over there.\" i was in bed, watching the almost incorporeal being for approximately five minutes. these two experiences changed my life in a multitude of ways. also, i learned to be extremely discreet in who i discussed these matters with. almost everybody thought i was suffering from psychotic delusions. (i was 48 years old at the time with no history of mental or emotional problems).\r\n\r\nthis is the second time that \"n\" and i have seen ufos together. on september 9, 2003, with my son \"j\", we witnessed a thirty minute ���display��� in which several spacecraft were encountered by dozens of military planes in the desert skies above prescott, arizona. we reported our experience to the fbi in

early summer, probably between the years 1965 to 1967.  i believe it was 1965.  five years old, i sat by myself in the back yard near the alley playing with matchbox cars.  my dachshund was beside me in the late afternoon.  my dog alerted before i heard the sound of an engine above and to the south, out of view because of the house.  looking up as the sound increased, i saw a crop duster, a bi-plane, i think.  the plane swooped down from over the roof of our two-story house and continued low as it flew northward.  a cotton field was just a few hundred yards to the north, and as the crop duster (that is how i remember it-- a crop duster) went over head, deep red or blood-red pellets of various shapes and sizes fell on me and into the yard. odd, but sometimes i recall them as horse-pill shaped lozenges, sometimes as red bands up to three inches long, and sometimes as clumps of course granules. \r\n\r\ni watched, amazed, and my mother soon opened the kitchen door leading into the garage.  the main garage door already being open, she called out to me to come in-- somewhat alarmed.  i told her i wanted to watch the plane, but she insisted, seeming to me to be unnecessarily alarmed.  i had never seen a crop duster and we had just moved to this new home.  i cannot account for my interpretation of the object being a crop duster, nor can i understand why i have no memory of going back outside to look at the red pellets.  i so distinctly remember the pellets, but after collecting my toys and going inside, the matter seemed to be no longer of interest. \r\n\r\nthat cotton field to the north was soon built-over by the expanding neighborhood and including spring creek elementary school which opened for my second grade year in 1967.  that school was the location of a second account supposedly involving me and told to me by the witness two or three years after the incident he recounted. \r\n\r\nabout 1969, a classmate described what he remembered this way:  \r\n\r\nour class was out playing on the school playground at recess in about 1967.  as he described the event, he asked if any of the several of us listening to him remembered the event (none did).  he was particular surprised that i had not remembered it, because he claimed i had gotten in trouble for ignoring the teachers' panicked calls for everyone to come inside the school, instead, he said, i and a few others went toward what he described.\r\n\r\nhe said that several students started pointing in the sky to the south of the playground and that the teachers noticed it as well. initially, the many witnesses (a school yard full of students and teachers-- probably a hundred persons) thought a small plane, like a cessna, was in trouble and trying to make a landing in the playground, so low was the craft. that might make sense given that a row of high-tension wire separated the playground from the wide, long and straight gravel road slightly to the west.\r\n\r\ninstead of it being a plane in trouble, the craft came to the southern edge of the playground no longer (if ever) appearing to have wings, and it nearly stopped to hover there.  it made a very slow pass over the playground as the teachers tried to gather the students into the building.  my friend said the teachers were panicking, but that at least some of the students were not.  then, he said some of us continued to watch the craft as numerous small metallic objects, maybe a little larger than silver dollars, dropped out of the larger craft and began to fly about over the playground.  some of these little disks were flying across the street and toward an old stock pond surrounded by trees which we called, \"cobb's creek.\"\r\n\r\nhe seemed disturbed that no one recalled what he described and tried to prompt me to recall how i and a few others actually ran toward the craft hovering overhead and tried to find some of the small disks.  the teachers, he said, were furious with me and the others who did this--as we were the last to come inside the school.  he also said that after school, some of us went around in the \"cobb's creek\" wooded area looking for disks and none were found there or on the playground.\r\n\r\nperhaps due to an unconscious connection, i perceive each story as having a duration of perhaps a little more than sixty seconds.  in neither story do i know how the craft departed.  the crop-duster i recall, disappeared from view in mere moments due my line of sight being hindered by the house across the alley, although the engine noise was audible while i remained outdoors.  my impression of my classmate's account is that his craft made no noise at all-- because engine failure was an initial assumption in his recollection.\r\n\r\nmy own analysis is that my crop duster and his story are the same.  between the dates of the two varying stories, i, inexplicably, became terrified of the part of my backyard near the alley-- worried about ufo's. for a few months, i would not go out there at night.  during that same time, many of my classmates were fascinated by stories of ufo's and i did not understand their fascination, having never heard of such things before that time.  \r\n\r\ni admit that some traumatic experience involving me is a viable explanation for my having a very tame memory compared to my friend's oddly similar story, given my inexplicable fear of ufo's and the back yard, which i in no way connected with the crop-duster.  that i apparently had post traumatic stress disorder before a most obvious traumatic experience much later in my adult life has had me looking quite closely at these memories as well as the story told by my friend.\r\n\r\nboth craft in the two accounts were, at first appearance, taken as airplanes, both traveling from south to north and both dropping smaller items as they passed overhead.  both stories have the adult authority figure(s) standing at a door, calling out in what appeared to be unjustified concern.  both accounts have me resisting the call to come inside.\r\n\r\ni have a master's degree in pastoral theology (counseling), and nearly two decades of counseling experience as a parish priest.  some of my earliest memories include mystical, spiritual experiences-- typical of a person whose prayer life leans toward the contemplative.  as a result, i have studied carl jung's theories including his concept that ufo accounts are often (perhaps even always) mystical visions of the post-modern culture.  \r\n\r\nwhile my recollection of what may be the same event does not involve a ufo my recollection of the crop-duster is \"overly vivid--\" very much the sense that it was spiritual experience rather than an historical one.  that my school mate recalled it as a collective experience but having to do with alien spacecraft is most intriguing.\r\n\r\nfor precise location: spring creek elementary in far north dallas may be located via google earth.  (32d 57' 23\"n 96d 46' 39\"w) and the playground along meandering way is where my friend recalled the event taking place.  my own backyard experience is about 300 yards distant of that same location.  what locals always called, \"cobb's lake\" and \"cobb's creek\" is now labeled \"arapaho park\" directly sw of the playground.\r\n\r\nmy friend's story would be a ce1, my crop-duster i suspect would be fb4.\r\n\r\nwhile preserving my anonymity publicly, a researcher may contact me via my email (which is provided separately on this form) including any requests for third party sharing which i will consider individually.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Window(s),  Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with

names moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg]\r\n\r\n starting 8-27-2010 we observed a star like object and watched it slowly sink behind the tree line. 8-28-2010 through last night 9-7-2010 we observed the star like object and realized that the twinkling light is on  top of the triangular ship. the bottom lights are smaller and softly blink in an amber hue or antique white. the top light changes colors that rotate clockwise and in long/fast patterns. the colors are: blue,red,green,orange,yellow,white and amber.\r\n the ship seems to have cloaking capabilities the stars behind the mass of the ship are blotted out sometimes, then at other times the triangle seems transparent. we have started to go out side every evening just as venus begins her rise the ship descends. the descent is not always in the same location but so far the object begins the descent in our south or western sky. we are north of lake ponchatrain and wonder if the ship is coming in from over the lake.\r\n my dad had a friend, a professor at our local university, he lived in a camp down south of here on the lakes pass. he often said he saw craft on the lake funneling water up into its belly while hovering over the pass. we hear these stories, but it now seems possible.\r\n last night the ship was really close. the air was heavy with humidity we could make out the top disco type light, but the tail(wing tipped) lights were barely visible and at least a city block apart. my neighbor sandy d., said \"that looks like a mother-ship.\" when i figured out how close the craft was i came inside and watched it out the window until it moved on @10:30 in a n/w direction. the ship stays below 1,000 ft. and is completely silent. at times it is stationary and then sometimes the craft moves so slowly it is difficult to notice the movement. please if this is happening in other locations on our planet please leave a response for us to review. thank you..........\r\n ","distance":"101-500

soon after i saw an orange ball with a \"comet like\" tail zip through the sky above the tree tops. it happened very fast maybe 2 seconds, i jumped out of my seat and ran accross the yard in an effort

previously.  i looked at the clock, but the time was no different.  i thought perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me, so i called into the other room and said to my mother, who was reading in
