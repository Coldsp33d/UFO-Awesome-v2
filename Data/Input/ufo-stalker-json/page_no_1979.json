google sky map software to check.  it was not located anywhere near a planet.  i then yelled for my wife to come outside and look.  she first said no, that she didn't want to.  i stayed outside and watched it for a while.  then i went inside and kept watching it through the window in the front door.  i kept telling her to come and look, and she finally agreed.  we went onto the porch, me, my wife, my daughter (6) and my son (1).  it was more \"cigar\" shaped than anything, but seemed to have a \"tail\" on the left (south) side.  it also seemed to have a sphere on the right (north) side that seemed to be orbiting the front (right, north) side. we watched it for some amount of time, approximately 5 minutes.  we did walk out into the yard to look for any other starts, as my wife was trying to dismiss it as a star.  i told her there was no way it was a star, because you couldn't see any other stars in the sky.  also, that this was entirely too bright to be a star, and too large.  she agreed, and said she wanted to get her camera to zoom in and look at it.  when she came back into the living room with the camera, she said it had no batteries.  i told her they were on the charger, and she went to get them.  i think she got busy doing something else, so i went to get the batteries myself.  i put the batteries in the camera, went outside to zoom in and snap a few photos, and it was gone.  i felt very uneasy, and went back into the house and locked the doors.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":25320,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0457867,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09062010-0009","longitude":-84.8932571,"occurred":1283831400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,

it to check out my impressions. indeed, i\r\n  was unable to discern any wings or stabilizing structures. no lifting surfaces. long cigar\r\n  tubular configuration. it emitted absolutely no sound my

after finishing a project, and i noticed what appeared to be a bright star in the southern sky.  as i was walking up my side yard, i noticed it was moving.  i stopped for a minute to watch, and it seemed to move like no conventional aircraft that i am aware of.  it was about the size of a small pea at arms length at about 45 degrees.  at this point i woke up my adult daughter and wife to witness this with me.  my wifes distance vision is poor, so she could only perceive what appeared to her to be a bright star.  my daughter however,  having much better vision as myself also saw what i saw. this star like object at first seemed to be just a bright star to my daughter , as it was motionless when they first came out to look.  after a couple of minutes however , both my daughter and myself witnessed it moving about in a very strange manner.  it seemed to waver back and forth noticeably against the other ���stars���.  it would also jerk forward and side to side or up and down coming to a rest instantly. as i couldn't tell how far away it was, i can't say how far it was moving. i can say that it moved from two to twenty of its perceived size from  my perspective.  my wife and daughter stayed outside for about an hour on and off with me, but i watched this ���craft?��� for four hours.  it never stayed rock still for more than a minute or two.  i was using a high intensity flashlight to shine at it, and it seemed to respond with movement after each attempt.  i was flashing prime numbers at it and just other random patterns. i did take some pictures and video, however it doesn't have any useful reference. it just looks like a star. the video was no better because when it was motionless, i was moving giving it the appearance of motion. it didn't ever shoot at high speed across the sky, but it did traverse in a westerly direction.  i went in the house to go get some sleep at around 5:20 am and it was still up there when i left.  those last 20 minutes it seemed to stay totally motionless, so it seemed the show was over.  i am under the impression that it was under some kind of intelligent control as to respond to the light then cease movement again.

holy *&#@! look!. i'd come to a complete stop(15-20 ft. in front of the stop) and we were both hanging out of my truck windows looking at this thing. it was difficult to focus on the object at first. a very large, flat black, triangular aircraft with 3 constant orange/yellow lights on each point and 1 strobing red light in the center of the under-side. object was traveling very slowly giving us around 30 seconds to a good minute of unobstructed view. we both were talking to each other about what we were seeing. once the aircraft flew past the tree-line, we could both see a smaller craft following a short distance behind the large triangle. neither of the aircraft made any noise whatsoever. the second craft seemed to be more equilateral in shape, and the lights on it's body were more recognizable to me as possibly an f-117(size-wise a decent match) or other modern stealth craft. we both watched until it was overhead. i pulled forward to the stop and looked behind me and in my rear-view mirrors and could still see them both. my room-mate continued watching as we turned right onto county rd. 96(gap creek rd). the general direction of travel was s-sw and would have traveled over a good portion of greer, taylors and possibly the greenville downtown airport. most obvious possible destination of interest would be donaldson center (formerly donaldson air force base) which is also the home of lockheed martin. i lived in the moonville, s.C. area very close to the back side of donaldson airfield. over several years living there i had seen many daytime and night-time military flights. c-130's (even the hercules), f-4's, f-16's and even a few black choppers w/ stealth escort. i've included a windows paint sketch of the approx. size and position of the crafts. this is an address link to google street view right where this took place!

or plains. once in a while i see something really interesting. tonight was one of those nights. i was just outside admiring the sky and listening to a concert in the distance. when my eyes fell on a star-like object that moved slowly from my left or westerly, to my right. then suddenly as a plane passed near-by (probably at a different altitude) it flashed a bright white light and just sort of \"powered up\" as i like to say. it satyed bright for a few moments then went dim. it didn't flash off like someone turned off a light but rather dimmed slowly like a candle. it moved until it reach the cassiopeia constellation and stopped. it hung there like an ordinary star. then from the same area where the i first noticed the other one, a new flash appeared. it flashed on quickly then off again. it moved at a different angle, slowly, toward the southwest. it just kept going until i couldn't follow it anymore. i was pretty excited and just had to come in and report it. there has been a lot more activity lately but as i said before this was really unique.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

orange light in the wsw sky.  the object was just a few degrees above the horizon, which would put it right at the tops of the distant trees (over 900 ft. away). \r\n\r\nat first i assumed it was venus but the object began to rise in elevation, approximately 2 to 3 degrees.  the object stopped it's ascent and i reach in the door and grabbed my camera, taking two shots.  i then got my binoculars and looked at the light. \r\n\r\nthe object was a bright white orange light and for all appearances i would have dismissed the object as venus.  however, venus does not ascend from the west, nor does it move 2 degrees or more in 3 seconds. i also know what venus looks like, with the naked eye and through both binoculars and telescope.  this did not look like venus. i called to my spouse who also looked at the light, saying \"it's venus.\"  after saying that, within seconds the light turned red and disappeared completely.  total viewing time: 10 minutes.\r\n\r\ni went back inside, pulled up an astronomy website, checked and saw that venus had set an hour earlier.  i wrote a short report, attached the original photo and sent it off to mufon's director of research.  he did not know what the object is either and confirmed that it wasn't venus. \r\n\r\nattached photo is a cropped version of the original i sent to *(name deleted--sgonzalez/cms).\r\n\r\ni must add that my digital still camera will not focus on anything at night, unless the subject is unusually large and bright. it had no problem focusing on this light.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

(there was no fog or smoke around. that's just where my brain went, for some reason.) the object was orange and luminous and almost completely round. there was a small indentation, wider than it was deep, that took up a fifth or so of the surface area. it moved in a steady, straight line (which is also why i associated it with the spotlight) and moved slightly slower than a falling star. there were some (cumulous?) clouds in the area and the object passed in front of the cloud and didn't seem to cast any light or shadow on the clouds. it seemed to be disc-shaped, but could have just as well been an orb. it was hard to tell in the night sky. it was silent. \r\n\r\neven though i had a camera phone with me, i was too focused on figuring out what it was to think to take a picture. so, this orange, glowing, pencil eraser-sized object moved in a steady, straight line, a bit more slowly than a meteor, and passed between me and the clouds. i think it just moved beyond my field of vision, but it may have gone behind a more distant cloud. i was so perplexed by what i was seeing that some of the details didn't stick. \r\n\r\nat this point, i didn't think this could possibly be related to the spotlight, but i kept looking up to see if the orange object would reappear along the same flight path. that's about it.\r\n\r\ni went inside and decided that i knew what i hadn't seen -- plane, helicopter, satellite -- but had no idea what i had seen. i called my parents and they had no explanation for me and my father suggested i report it to mufon. i did a little searching around hoping to see a similar report (and saw one, not too different in indiana). in the end, i decided that my reporting it might encourage someone else to come forward and i'd be that much closer to figuring out what it was.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":25304,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9042918,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09052010-0006","longitude":-77.0321358,"occurred":1283663100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"District of Columbia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1283740940000,"summary":"Orange luminous disc in dc.","tags":["disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Washington, District of Columbia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:100025"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1979}
