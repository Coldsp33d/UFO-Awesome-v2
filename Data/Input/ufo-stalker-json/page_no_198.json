blink, blink, blink blink blink, blink blink, etc and we exclaimed \"wow look at that!!! did you see that?!?\" and then gone. just no light at all, it just blinked out. but instead of the light, we could now see a ship!  i hadn't noticed that before. it was triangle-ish in shape, more obtuse point at the top and more acute at the two bottom corners, but none were pointy corners, kinda rounded. and it was flying right to left, but not flat, the point was up towards outer space and the two other corners were bottom left and bottom right, flying weird like that. and we also noticed a second ship that didn't show any lights at all but was identical in shape and direction of flight. it was lower in altitude and just came out from behind one tree only to soon go behind another.  we just didn't have a good line of sight on that one. the first ship continued across the sky in the same general direction, without any lights the rest of the time, until it went out of view behind the roof of my house, towards the south east.  maybe it lasted a minute? maybe less.  my boyfriend said that before he told me to look at it, it had curved in it's direction, but i didn't see that.  no idea what these were! and no sound at all, even though the wind typically comes from that direction towards my house. just nothing. the wind wasn't blowing though, and we had just been talking about how still the night was before all this happened.  so crazy!  we wonder if it was maybe secret military craft since we're so close to wpafb, but why would the one blink like that, risking attracting attention?

my exit from sequoia national park. i was leaning forward looking at treetops which were about 200 feet off the ground when the road straightened out from its previously curvy path. i immediately saw three white lights in the air that were roughly at my elevation due to the fact that i was coming from uphill. my girlfriend was talking to her sister on the phone at the time and i cut her off and exclaimed \"look at that, look at it right now!\" i continued to force her to look so that i would not be the only witness. i'm convinced other cars that had been in front of me and behind me saw it as well. the object was hovering just above the tree tops a short distance to the south of highway 198 and began ascending and making its way south east at a visually slow aircraft speed that i estimate to be 80mph. the three lights were in a triangle shape on a shadow that looked circular. i am unsure of the shape of the craft as the middle light rotated about the x axis of the shape while the two outer lights stayed put. the individual lights were circular and bright white. the craft rotated to face the general direction of the road all while it continued to move higher and further away from where i first saw it. my girlfriend is in agreement with what i saw and both of us are mentally healthy. i am sure it was not a civilian or military aircraft as neither had the distinct light patterns that accompany such aircraft. i am sure that i did not just witness the aircraft from an angle at which i would not recognize the light patterns as my father is a pilot, i have flown planes since age 10 under my fathers instruction, and i have lived near a military air base since birth. living near the airbase has exposed me to aircraft everyday for as long as i have lived and i can recognize which aircraft it is by the silhouette, lights, and flight patterns. the experience with the object lasted approximately 2 minutes but this is an estimate as adrenaline and fear rushed through me while i vacated the location ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

went outside to smoke a cigarette around 10:15pm as i do every night and i always look at the sky in hopes of seeing something but tonight changed my life forever. i was watching a movie on my phone when all of a sudden my movie shut off and the application just went dark. i have a samsung galaxy s7 edge which is a brand new phone and this never happens. my internet and service completely dropped out. i had no bars and it was like we didn't even own wifi, i couldn't get it to reconnect. my data would not even work it was like my phone completely died and it was on 62% battery power. i took a bit of my cigarette and looked up over the school that is across the street from my house and i was completely frozen in what i saw. i saw 2 huge glowing spheres dancing around each other. they were reddish orange in color and they seemed like they were only a few miles away in the sky. i knew what i was looking at was 2 ufos. at first they both moved in a circular motion around each other for about a minute or so, then the one came to a complete stop and the other continued to circle around the other. there was no sounds in the neighborhood and in the sky. it was exciting and eerie at the same. they continued to stay visible in the sky for about 12-15 minutes. the whole time the one sphere stayed hovering while the other continued to make movements that no plane or helecopter could make around the other craft. after minutes of observing myself i ran to the window of my bedroom to wake up my girlfriend to tell her what was going on because she is a believer like me. my phone wouldn't dial so i ran over to the window we're she was sleeping and yelled her name. at this point i could then hear her and helecopter sounds coming from the east which so happens to be the direction of the local air force base. after looking back up i saw the hovering craft just disappear and then about 5 seconds later the craft that moved about the sky shot off higher into the cloud cover and disappeared. after they left you could hear jets and helecopter racing in the sky to the location they were at in the sky. after they disappeared my phone turned back on like nothing happened but it was drained to 2% battery. this was one of the most amazing sights i've ever seen. after going inside for a few minutes i went back out to see anything at all but the clouds had moved over the area and they were gone.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:22","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

i disagreed as it continued on a very straight path. it was perfectly round and orange in color. i noticed the surface of the orb seemed to appear to be covered with small flames or something like flames. i ran up to my apartment to get a very powerful tactical flashlight. if it was a drone i wanted to attract its attention via its digital camera. when i directed the beam at the orb, which was now directly in front of me, i got no response. i tried flashing the light-no response. by now it seemed to be slightly climbing. the clouds that night were scattered and quite low. the orb remained below the clouds at all times. its flight speed never changed nor did it's color as it flew out of sight. about half an hour later it reappeared two or three miles away toward the east. i observed it again, with my friend, until it was out of sight. i stayed out for another hour or so but never saw it again. the next day my neighbors told me that they saw it too. i had also observed pulsating lights on two sides but they seemed the same color as the orb itself. there was no persevered sound, no jet trail, no engine noise, just silence.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

i had just come home from work and went out back i noticed something very odd by the edge of the woods it was an area about 30 ft off the ground and it was shimmering kind of like looking at water in the air.  i sat here thinking what is that? i thought at first it was a weather phenomenon. it was approximately 8 feet in length and 6 ft wide.  eventually about 10 mins later it moved forward then to my left and centered itself between a crape myrtle tree and the woods.  now i'm very concerned as to what it is.  within 5 minutes an et appears on the ground in front of the crape myrtle tree, he's just there all of a sudden he was almost invisible at first like a hologram but became more solid the longer he was climbing to what had to be the ship, i believe he was not suppose to be seen but possible equipment failure.  i did not see him walk to the tree or from anywhere. \r\n\r\nhe grabs what must have been a rope as that is the actions of his hands pulling himself up but he also was climbing what i believe were steps using his feet and legs. neither was visible.  only his physical actions of climbing up.  he was sideways to me but saw me and would look behind him constantly then look at me occasionally.  i could not see a spaceship but it had to be there.  as he entered the shimmering passageway he had to turn his back to me and change the way he was climbing more like rock climbing at this point.  each hand was out to the side and above his head with his legs finding each object to climb as well. once he reached the top of the passageway he too disappeared.\r\n\r\nhe had a human type body, very strong, very muscled, approx 6'3 to 6'5. but his head was not human at all. he had large bulging eyes which is why i checked robotic as i do not see how he could possibly close his eyes they stuck out so far from the sockets, very white eyes with black pupils, he had nostrils, very strong jaw bones, i do not remember seeing ears, skin was like an alligator but off white, he looked like he had on some type of armor jumpsuit but not metal.  he was not friendly and i was terrified to move or do anything that would provoke an attack he was at most 50 feet away.  i will never forget what i saw ever. the photos attached are of something in the woods that i believe is them taken before a hurricane last year.
