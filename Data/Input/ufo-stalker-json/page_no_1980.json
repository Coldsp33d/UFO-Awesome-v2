i've been seeing alot of strange objects lately, i've been really paying close attention to the sky. i just happened to look through the window on our front door and saw a bright orange light, im guessing around 1,000 feet above the ground, and appeared to be stationary. i jumped up off the couch and told my dad to come look at this, i had a camera in my pocket because we had some friends over earlier, but another reason i kept it with me was just incase if i witnessed another ufo i would have a camera with me. the object did not stay very long, maybe two seconds at the best. i got outside and the object was gone, so i waited, and waited, and waited, for about 20 or 30 minutes, then i decided to go back inside. about 20 minutes later, we were sitting in the living room watching tv, and i kept glancing over hoping to see the object again, and to my luck, i eventually saw it again, i flew off the couch and told my dad \"there it is again!\" and this time he saw it, he was not sure what it was either, it was not a flare because f16's usually practice dogfights over our house and sometimes they drop flares, they tend to move slowly and flicker, but this thing did'nt do anything like that. it was stationary and was a constant light, and it was visible about two seconds, but flares usually last longer than that, maybe 15 or 20 seconds, there were also no jets in the area at the time, so i'm not going to consider it a flare. unfortunately, since the object lasted only a few seconds, i was'nt able to get any

quickly it was not and a-10, f-16, c-130, or c-17, or any other aircraft i routinely see flying in and out of dm. \r\nobject appeared to be paralleling course of i-10. at cpa, obect was between size

hear very deep hum similar to turboprop aircraft, but bass rather than the usual tenor sound. \r\nobject lights did not conform with any known light patterns of aircraft in my experience. i have been a sky watcher and aircraft aficianado since childhood, and am a student pilot on extended hiatus until finances improve.  i was unfortunately, not able to determine the shape of the object, as the strobes were incredibly bright, creating a contrast with the dark sky which was impenetrable. however i was able to observe the object occlude stars twice along its flight path proving that it had some sort of mass and structure.\r\nthis may have been some sort of military aircraft, perhaps a uav.  still, it was unknown and flying, so i am reporting it.  i would post pics except that when i ducked inside to grab the camerai found that the camera batteries were still in the charger at the time.  oops! \r\n\r\nfor some odd reason, i have been having just a little bit of an adrenaline

(this park is a \"depressed\" park.  that's where all the water goes after it rains.  at this time there was a little bit of water, but not much.)  i thought it was a helicopter as we do have a small airport by our nieghborhood, but i thought it was strange for it to be just hovering there.  i drove a little further towards it and decided to stop and see what it really was.  i pulled over, turned off my music, and rolled down my window.  there was no noise coming from it and i could see that it was only maybe 20 yards above the park.  a vw beetle with two teenage girls pulled into the center lane and watched the light for a few seconds, then they drove off.  i was about to drive off when it started to move upwards, going east/slightly north.  i was intending to watch it go back towards the airport, but then it picked up speed and a reddish/orange light (like the one i originally saw) illuminated the object and i could see it was round, not a helicopter or any planes they fly at the airport.  it lit up for maybe a second or two, then took off towards the stars.  i watched it till it disappeared, which only took a matter of seconds.  i sat in my car for a couple more minutes, trying to figure out what i just saw.  i drove home and i was very scared afterwards.  i was very intrigued when i was watching it because at that point (before it was lit up) i thought for sure it was a helicopter.  after it lit up and took off, i knew it wasn't a helicopter.  when i finally got the courage to get out of my car and carry my stuff in the house, i walked in, locked the doors and windows, then proceeded to tell my parents what happened.

the hotel i work the graveyard shift at, i started noticing a number of lights in the sky encircleing our big island of hawaii.  they were all at the same height, all the same brightness and spaced evenly apart. i thought they might be satellites protecting us from any incoming missles.  sort of like an umbrella. ok with me i thought.  \r\nthen, about two weeks ago there appeared a bright star-like object out over the ocean.  i thought it could possibly be two satellites, one behind the other. it was a little higher in the sky then the \"umbrella lights\". \r\nlast week on my way into work i noticed that the bright star-like object was even brighter.  as i was watching this thing get brighter, a cigar-shaped object with red lights approached the bright star-like object and shot a beam of light down on it, just like a tractor beam from a science fiction movie.  then the red-lighted object blinked out of sight.  the bright star-like object dimmed but remained.  \r\nwell, then tonight the bright star-like object got brighter again and one by one the umbrella satellite objects blinked out as they progressed closer to the bright star-like object. the bright star-like object then looked as if it were receeding away from where it was and as if someone gave a command to go to warp speed, it was gone.  \r\nin the end there were no more lit objects that had originally caught my attention. no umbrella satellites, no red cigar-shaped object and no more bright star-like object, just black empty space.\r\ni felt releived, but angry that other people missed the whole thing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

clear, no moon  time 10:00-10:30pm\r\n\r\nbeing that i was sitting around the house doing nothing and due to my first ever ufo sighting back in may, i decided to go out and try my luck at spotting the ufo again. so i got my camera and went for a drive on route 347 which was around 9:30 pm.  i first went south for a 4 or 5 mile, saw nothing. so i made a u-turn and headed towards phoenix for about 5 mile outside of maricopa, saw nothing. made a u-turn and headed back to maricopa. when i was about a mile outside of maricopa city limits and looking up as i was driving, just off to the left of 347 one of the orange orbs slowly appeared, then went out and came back on again. a split second later a second orb appeared some distance to the left of the first and when back out. then the first orb went out and a third orb appeared just to the right of the first and when back out. not know their actual position, i drove through town on 347 and turn left on n. bowlin rd. (due to the large open area) and parked hoping to get a photo of them if they should reappear. at this location i had a good overall field of view plus i could see the harrah's phoenix ak-chin casino were i first saw the orbs and i hoped they would reappear near the casino. i stayed there for about an hour but i never saw them reappear so i went home for the night. \r\n\r\nday 2   2 sep  skies clear,  no moon  time 9:45-10:00pm\r\n\r\naround 9:00 pm headed out of the house with camera hoping to see and maybe get a picture of the orbs. drove back to the bowlin rd. location and waited. about 45 min. goes by, lots of air traffic out of phoenix and over maricopa, but no orbs. so i���m looking toward phoenix and turn around to look towards the casino to see an orb that looked to be hovering less than a 1000 ft. just over the harrah's phoenix ak-chin casino and then when out. so i���m happy that i saw the orb but not enough time to get a picture. i waited hoping it would em to reappear. about 15 min. later an orb slowly appeared and then went back out to the left of 347 across from the casino but a little farther out. then a second orb appeared a little to the right of the first and went out. then the third appeared a little right of the second and went out. i had gotten sidetrack trying to light a cigar it and couldn���t get my camera turn on in time to take a photo. so i waited hoping for one more chance to take a picture. about 15 min later the first orb slowly reappears to the right of the casino and goes out. the second orb appears (photo 2 nd) and went out. the third orb appears (photo 3 rd) and goes out. so now i���m real happy, i���ve got photos of a ufo to backup my 24 may mufon report. being that the ufos were near the casino i drove down 347 and turned left on n. farrell rd. and parked, hoping to get better pictures. i waited about 20 min but no sightings. as i was standing there i happen to look down the road and into the fields on the ak-chin reservation and off to the left of farrell rd. i could see two white shimmering lights that slowly faded out and slowly came back on a few second later. now i���m thinking the ufo is on the ground, so i drive onto the reservation for a better look and pictures. i found a spot where i could see about five or six of the lights on the ground in the field just behind the house were farrell and thomas st/rd intersect. they were all shimmering, four or five of them would slowly fade in and out of view but never change their location. i also saw a couple of really small light that were moving in the location of the larger lights.  i took a few pictures but most were bad. so i���m posting the two best that show two light (first picture), then you can see a third starting to come on again. you can also make out some of the other lights. the green blue lights are not part of the craft. after about 15 or 20 min. of looking at the ufo i started out for home. i drove pass a really good spot to get better pictures so i made a u-turn to go back that���s when i spot the ak-chin police (someone had called me in) coming from all points. so i pull over and told them what was doing, told them about the ufo sighting, showed they one of the photo and i even pointed out one of the lights of the ufo that faded out and in while we were talking. i was told that either side of the main road was indian property and that i would be trespassing if i left the main road. then i was told to have a nice day they got back into their cars and drove way. i went home to start typing this. it was about 10:50 pm.\r\n\r\n day 3   3 sep  skies clear,  no moon  time 5:45-6:00 am\r\n\r\n4:30am wake up for a nap sitting in front of the computer. decide to go to wal-mart to pickup a few things. departed the house 5:05am thought i drive over to the reservation to if the lights were still there from the ufo or maybe it could have been a construction site or something. get to the location no lights, no construction equipment, no construction, no nothing, just green farm land. head out to wal-mart. driving on route 238 towards casa grande coming up on traffic light of intersection 238 and shea way about to make left turn in to wal-mart. light is green.  all of a sudden, out of nowhere, in a knife edge position, in maybe a 30 degree angle traveling at an extreme high rate of speed, in a northeast direction, is a large dark gray or black v shape craft with five white lights, one in the middle and two lights on each wing. it appear too me that it had just taken off from one of the fields to the right of 238. as the craft rolled over to a horizontal position i saw the lights flash then the craft made a hard right turn and disappeared over the horizon. i was in a low part of the road so disappearing over the horizon was an easy task. so i sat through a cycle or two of the traffic light, spellbound. i sapped out of it due to a truck leaving wal-mart and went right pass the wtf moment to the nobody is going to believe this. i wouldn���t believe this myself, that all of this could happen to one guy in less the 8 hours. so i drove down 238 a little farther just incase there was more to see. now i���m on the high side of the road, i can see all over the area. again out of nowhere, in a knife edge position, in maybe a 30 degree angle traveling at an extreme high rate of speed, in a northeast direction, is the craft, which appears to have just taken off. the lights flash again as it rolls horizontal. it makes a hard right turn and heads out to the mountains to the south. it makes a hard left turn (flyby photo) and now heading north back in my direction. once it���s over or just pass the ak-chin farm complex area, it makes a hard right turn and heads south back to the mountains. it then makes a hard right turn and heads north in my direction and lands (landing photo) in the fields off to the left of the farm complex. it���s getting pretty light out so i���m thinking it may clear the area soon. i wait at my location between n. white and parker rd and n. porter rd. for about an hour waiting for it to take off again but it never did or maybe i missed the take off during the passing of one of three frigate trains. i ended the wait and made a right on white and parker and another right on w. peters and nall rd. just to see if i could spot the craft which i didn���t. made the loop back wal-mart.\r\n\r\nas for the craft i saw. it was v shape dark gray or black and non reflective, taper wing design. i has five white lights evenly spaced, one in the middle and two on each wing which looked to flash when it made its first maneuver. extremely fast with no sound and highly maneuverable. other than the possible knife edge take offs it flew pretty much like any other pitch/roll aircraft just tighter. steep banks with almost wingtip type turns. if you���ve ever seen a glider do a tight wingtip turn that���s what this craft can do only at very high speeds. as for landing i can only assume that it went from fast to dead stop hover and land. it didn���t look to really slow down to land. it just made the fast descent and land. i couldn���t make out a cockpit or cabin area because it was moving to fast. also i can���t remember if i saw the five lights on the underside of the wing because it was moving to fast. i did notice it had what could be blinking nav. lights on the wing tips. it was large but not really overly large but it did have the longest wing span of any aircraft i���ve even seen. when you look at it head on it pretty thin and almost disappears with the mountain backdrop. i would have to give it a 9 for being a good looking craft as compared to our normal military aircraft that are flying today. sure was something to see. may buy me a camcorder tonight and get back out there by 5am just incase.\r\n \r\nthat���s it, you guys can stop reading now. sorry for being so long, for any mistakes you may find and for not getting better pictures. something is better than nothing. i did make a report to include photos to the pinal/maricopa police.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
