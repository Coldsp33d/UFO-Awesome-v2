highway in that region, hwy 41. it was 8:07 pm, est. the orange light first appeared at this time. it was off to our right side, over the lake. we were ascending in elevation from the lake and had a beautiful view of an expanse of lake superior. the light was out over the lake. it seemed to large to be aircraft lights, and was moving in a slow, irregular pattern. the light seemed to be a long distance away, and getting a perspective of its size in relation to distance away was difficult, for its size and intensity of light was changing so rapidly. my son and i became somewhat nervous, becuase we were literally in the middle of nowhere. the nearest house with occupants was maybe 6 miles away. by the time we arrived at hwy 41, the orange light moved inland and was to our south, still visible the entire time, now seeming to stay in one spot. about 12 miles soth on hwy 41, there was a large valley with steep hills on both sides, which is about 4 mies across. when we got to the top of the other side of that valley, the orange light had disapeared. jupiter was now visible, low in the eastern sky. about 10 minutes later, the orange light appeared to our east. it was very large now, and the color was very intense. both the light and jupiter were visible. the light began to move close to the horizon, and seemed to be following the terrain. both my son and i were becoming really \"weirded out\". the light stayed in the eastern sky another 40 minutes, then suddenly dissapeared. it seemed it had just \"gone out\", it had not moved. 5 minutes or so later we arrived in the small town of bruce crossing, which consisted of a bar and a small truck stop. we stopped here to use the bathroom, and asking the person at the counter if anyone had seen anything, a trucker mentioned that, as traveling west on hwy 28, he had seen \"a large orange ball to the east\". as we got to our van, i looked east and saw nothing. we then turned onto hwy 28, westbound. about 5 minutes later my son yelled out \"look behind us, there it is!\" as i looked the east over my shoulder, i noticed an intense, small red light, just above the trees, just to our south, and the orange light was in the east, higher in the sky than previously. i pulled to the side of the road to text my wife (we now had signal for the first time since houghton) and tell her what was happening. it was 11pm est. when the van came to a stop, the red light was gone. when i finished my text and began driving, the red light \"came on\". my window was down, so it wasnt a reflection. a minute or so later my son yelled \"what the hell is that!?\", and was watching a small, intense white light moving crazily through the trees, to our right. this white light zipped over, and around our van, while the red light to our left stayed motionless. the red light seemed very close, and the white light seemed to be the size of a softball. as the white light moved into the trees, it lit up a small area dimly wherever it went. i began to think i should turn around and get back to bruce crossing, as the next town was 12 miles away on hwy 28. i texted my wife \" i am afraid\" at 11:10 est, which she received at 11:13, cst, she texted back at 11:15(time on my phone),  asking if we were ok, and she recieved my response of \"i'm really scared\" at 11:18. but upon looking at what time i sent that text, my phone showed 11:40. we arrived in the next town, bergland, where we were staying at a friends motel for the night, at 11:51. the lights were gone, and seem to have been gone for maybe 10 minutes, or so. i cannot explain the extra time it took to travel between the 2 towns, nor can either my son or i remember exactly how the lights disapeared. the next morning as we left, heading back to minneapolis, i began to get the feeling i had been \"read\" by the red light. i cannot explain it any other way. my sons memory of the incident and mine match up until the last part with the red and white lights. looking back and remembering, my son nor i felt terror, as much as just scared, and in awe of the whole situation.","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile,

satellites and other phenomena. i also have trained my eyes to cue in on movement due to many years hunting experience.\r\n\r\nso, i was looking up at the sky while we were all talking and i saw a very small star apparently move.\r\n\r\nhowever, it was not an airplane, (i saw several while we were there) and it was not a satellite, as i have seen many of those as well.\r\n\r\nthis star was moving back and forth, up and down, diagonally, slow and fast. the funny thing was it stayed in a fairly well defined area.\r\n\r\nas i looked up, the area of movement would be similar to holding up a tennis ball at arm's length. within this area, this star moved erratically, and was not predictable.\r\n\r\nfor a while no one else could see what i was pointing out, but my wife and the mother of the other family finally saw what i was seeing.\r\n\r\nthey also said they could see this star move back and forth, up and down, fast and slow, etc.\r\ni was open to the possibility that it was an optical illusion, but that was the only star moving in such a way in the entire sky. i was also open to the possibility of it being the clouds moving but the clouds moved on and the star stayed in the same relative position for almost two hours. all the other stars slowly orbited, but this stayed in the same area. \r\n\r\ni don't know if anyone else has seen such a thing, or if anyone else reported seeing something unusual on saturday, august 21st, 2010.\r\n\r\ni just wanted to know if you have heard of anything like this.\r\n\r\ni pride myself in being observant, and an amateur astronomer. i am very interested in space and astronomy, and love to look at stars. also know that i was a data analyst, and am able to observe things.\r\n\r\ni would be interested in your opinion.\r\n\r\nthank you

located, we have an unobstructed view of the western sky. on the night of saturday august 28, 2010, the skies were clear with temps in the low 70's.\r\n\r\nat about 9:25 that evening, i went outside to get something out of my truck. we had been cooking and canning vegetables from our garden all day, and the house was quite warm inside. noticing how pleasantly cool it was outside, i asked my girlfriend if she might like to come outside for a while to cool off.\r\n\r\nas we stood down by the water, chatting and looking at the house lights from across the lake, something caught my eye in the west northwestern night sky. \r\n\r\nat an elevation of about fifty degrees, a bright white star-like object had suddenly appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nhad this object been stationary, and not as bright, i might have mistaken it for just a large star. but it was not stationary. it was moving in a northerly direction at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nafter about three or four seconds from the time it first appeared, it executed a very tight, almost flat, 180 degree turn to the south, and after proceeding in this new direction for another three or four seconds, it just as suddenly seemed to \"turn off\" again, just like someone turning off a light switch, and became invisible to our eyes once more in the night sky.\r\n\r\nplease understand that when i used the word \"turn\", i am not speaking of any kind of a turn in the conventional way. this object, whatever it was, had managed to accomplish a complete and opposite change of direction in less than a second. it's speed remained constant throughout the entire manuver, and it's motion can only be described as \"fluid\".\r\n\r\nas we stood there in silence for perhaps fifteen seconds or so, trying to comprehend what this actually was that we had just witnessed, another bright white \"star\"  \"turned on\" in the west southwestern sky.\r\n\r\ni took this to be the same object that we had seen before, as the size and light intensity were the same, as was it's elevation above the horizon.\r\n\r\nthis time however, the same manuver that we had just witnessed was being repeated in reverse, with the object making another of those \"impossible\" 180 degree turns, and heading back to the north again before \"turning off\" once more.\r\n\r\nwe stood there for several more minutes watching the sky, but it did not reappear again.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
