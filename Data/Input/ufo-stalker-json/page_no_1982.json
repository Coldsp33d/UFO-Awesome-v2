were on our second night in halifax nova scotia, sitting on our condo balcony in lower water street, looking south at the sky between the buildings.  we thought perhaps we were seeing some kind of fireworks or light display, when we saw the blue-green glowing light in the sky, but then noticed it did not move.  then it pulsed slightly and seemed to drip down upon itself almost like a lava lamp, and then broke into three even sections before our eyes. it stayed in the exact same spot, however, and came back together several times, continuing to glow with an odd greenish blue light for ten full minutes.  \r\n\r\nat the end of the event, it formed a ball of bluish green colored light and bounced up and down and all around very irratically. eventually, it grew smaller in size and dimmer in appearance until it was gone altogether.  my husband and i are sceptical and would like to know what it was that we saw, if there is in fact an earlthy explanation. \r\n\r\nwe did not feel scared but felt amazed and awed by the object. it was also very beautiful because its light was glowing and looked very unearthly.  we knew it was not a plane or helicopter and since it seemed not to be affected by the intermittent clouds (or lack there of) it was hard to imagine it was any kind of projection from below -- like a prank. to project something, one needs a screen of clouds or another surface to use and there was no consistent cloud cover that night. we could easily see stars around the object but it was too elongated / bar shaped to be any kind of planet or star.  since it was not moving and only seemed to pulsate and divide, it is hard to imagine it was any kind of human made craft.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

a couple of movies. it was mid october and the skys were clear cool and stary. i can say that i can't remember the movies that were shown,but i do remember the event of the evening. as we sat in the car i had noticed a bright dot about the size of a pencil eraser at about ten feet distance. the dot hung above the skyline of the city of wooster. the dot tumbled top to bottom as if it were a ball rolling on the ground, as it rolled it changed colors of red,yellow,orange and a whitish blue.The color flashes reminds me of the crystals you see hanging on a automobiles rearview mirror that you see now. i would say that the dot looked to be approximately 1500 feet in the air. from my vantage point it was to the right of the screen as the screen faced the west south west. i continued to watch the movie,then i saw a flash in the sky which drew my attention,it was the ufo,and it was moving in a southward direction. i trained my eyes and watched it move across the sky and knew that it would soon be out of my sight line as the movie screen would block my view of it. i continued to look at the top and left of the screen to see if it would show up,and after a few minutes it did. the ufo stopped to the left of the movie screen at about the same distance and height as my first sighting,and it continued to do it's colorful tumbling motion. i never spoke to my friend of all this as they weren't a believer in such things and i always had a open  mind. i was able to see the movie and the ufo as they both were in the same field of view. then the ufo flashed in the sky and it again started to move toward the east doing it's colorful tumbling during it's travel.I fixed my eyes on it and decided to focus only on it. i rolled the driverside window down to see if i could hear if it made any sound. all i could hear was the speakers of the theater in the drivein. i thought now i know an airplane can not make these actions and it would be pretty late for helicopter traffic, not to mention the colorful tumbleing light it had.I eventually had to pivot my body to the left to see the ufo as it had traveled farther than my head could turn. my friend said what in the $&## are you looking at? i said this light in the sky,and my friend said whatever!! i rolled up the window and thought to watch the movie to keep the peace.So i turned around to face the screen and started to watch the movie again. i turned my body around for a moment to see if the ufo was still there and the it was gone,only the stars remained.","distance":"Over One

but had her describe them, thinking they were just stars or something. she said they were in the field next to us. i just told her it was fine, and go back to bed, and that i would check it out. (what every dad has to do right). so after a bit i went out side to check it out. i didn't really see anything other than jupiter brighter than i'd ever seen before. but that was on the other side of the house, she couldn't have seen that. the only thing interesting was what i thought was mars, about the right size flashing red. i went back inside. she was standing in the living room waiting for me. \"daddy the aliens still out there\" i asked while i was out there. she said yes. now i knew for sure she had to just be seeing things. i had her draw me a picture. she drew the dome first, i thought she was going to draw a cigar type but then but a disk on the bottom. i've never heard of anything like that, maybe you have. i drew another and asked if that was it. the pic is not scanned or i would send it now. this happened less that 2 hours ago. again i had her go back to bed, and told her it was fine and it would be ok. about 4:00am i checked on her, she was still awake. i had her point to where she saw this. she did and said there still out there. now i'm getting freaked. what the heck is she seeing? i had her get up and told her were going outside. she didn't seem to want to, the whole time she was acting scared, which is very unlike her. as soon as we got out, she yelled there right there, all over the place, i'm like what are you seeing. \"they are small now, by the stars.\" i said you are just seeing stars. she said, no these ones are moving all over. i thought satellites.\r\nthen she pointed out what i thought was mars. \"see it flashing and it's moving. i had moved quite a bit in the half hour or so sense i had been out there. i had moved from one side of the tree to the other in a half hour? i had the moon and jupiter as reference, they hadn't moved that much. and it was flashing, not like a plane or like a twinkle. the white always on behind the red flash. this all was to the east. i had asked her, she said that it had been close to the house and was much larger. and didn't know if what we were seeing was the one she saw close. about there being lost of them, i am understanding she thinks that all the other ones were above and could all have been on a bigger vessel, all she said about them was that they flashed. the lights on the smaller craft she said were almost of every color. red green yellow etc. and something about green and yellow at the same time. and said the dome was a yellowish green. i put her back to bed and googled this site. it's 5:20am and i'm going for another look. then i'll report. 5:27 and i'm already back and i'm spooked. i went out, was looking around and noticed the moon and jupiter had moved. and as i looked at jupiter i noticed there was 2 of them. i thought where did that star come from? i didn't see it earlier. it was just as bright, and if you have seen jupiter like this you know what i meen, you notice it. now 2 of them? just as i thought that. the one that was not jupiter began moving to the south and in about 10 seconds was gone. from the time i noticed it until the time it began to move was between 5 and ten seconds. like it moved because i noticed it. this was bright white, almost a twin in every way to jupiter. you know that feeling, like your being watched? that's how i feel right now. i'm still curious but nervous at the same time. that's how my daughter felt. if i had a sixth sense i'd say these things are up to no good, it's just my feeling. for perspective i'm a christian and don't drink. i believe that this is possible. 1. because i've seen a metallic orb during the day before, and know for a fact what i saw and i've never seen humans create anything close to that. it was literally a ball of liquid mercury stationary in the sky for more than 15 min. i think that was 1998. anyway if anything else happens, i'll write it down and get back with you, feel free to email

these three really bright lights hovering really low by the tree line.  upon the time of getting to a clearing the object came across an open field.  my mother said that she pulled the car over so that my brother can get a picture with the camera.  as my brother went to go take the photograph, the object in the sky disappeared.  seconds later after the object vanished, two fighter jets flew over head as either being in pursuit or escorting the object.  \r\n\r\nsince about april of this year, i myself have noticed stranger objects in the night time sky.  i noticed on three separate occasions of seeing a solid glowing white to blue color object in the sky moving like a plane but moving away from my line of vision.  being a lover of astronomy, i know what planes, satellites and meteors look like in the night sky.  when a plane is  coming toward your line of vision you see a solid white light until it gets closer you can start seeing the red and blue flashing lights.  when the planes move away, you then just see the blinking red and blue lights until it fades off in the distance.  \r\n\r\nthe objects i have seen kept a bright solid glow to them even after moving away from my line of vision.  there were no blinking red or blue lights, just a solid whitish blue object moving ever so quietly. i know it was not a meteor or satellite or a government issue weather balloon.  i have been keeping an eye on the skies at night and hope that i can capture these objects in a photo or on a camera soon.  i will keep you posted. also, if whoever contacts me through this site, please give me an update if there are any sightings in my area so that i can help look into it.  thanks    \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

definitely noticeable, and of a white color, and was just west of the road.  it was there for a moment and was gone.  it was just below the window seal of the front window, and was not at eye level or at the horizon.  my guess would be ~20 degrees off the horizon.  first thought was it was a small plane, i.E. cessna, making a night landing, and what i saw was the lights as the plane turned about.\r\n\r\nshortly later i saw the same type of light just east of the road, and its behavior was the same.\r\n\r\nshortly after this, i saw a series of 4-5 lights appear, starting just east of the road, and appearing in series westward.  these were also fairly bright and of a white color.  they were visible for a moment, and not long enough it see any motion to determine if they were falling, drifting, etc..\r\n\r\nthe series if 4-5 lights appeared 3 times, each time they appear to start closer to the road, and the 3rd ended just over or just west of the road.\r\n\r\nwhile driving, during the 2nd series, i believed two of the lights appear to come close to each other, but my vision was obscured by the trees in the area.\r\n\r\nit was during the 3rd series that i decided to pull to the side of the road to better observe, and attempt to hear any aircraft.  i heard no aircraft while the window was down.  i had previously turned my phone off as my reception was having problems, and turned it on in hopes of getting either images or movies of the event, but it never appeared again.\r\n\r\nthe entire event may have been a few minutes.  the time when i was observing the series of lights and decided to pull to the side was 10:00pm.  i recall seeing the big dipper in the sky, just west of the road.  all the lights had appeared pretty much appeared due north.\r\n\r\nit is possible that the event was a military training exercise, selfridge ang base is less then 80 miles away, and i did observe military jets further north the next day in the afternoon.  this was near caseville, michigan and would be 15 miles north of where i saw the lights.  however i never seen flares on and off as quick as these.  the lights were visible for a moment or two, but were not visible

financee and i were in the courtyard of st. michael's cathedral in kiev. the skies were completely clear, the moon off to our right.Sitting on a bench in relative quiet, i first observed the rose/gold orb off to my left (west). at first, i thought it was a searchlight on a helicopter,though i'd never seen that color searchlight. i thought, well, i'm in ukraine, and maybe this color isn't unusual here. however, when i looked back at it some 2-3 minutes later, it had not moved. \r\n\r\ni pointed it out to my finacee, a ukrainian, and asked her if she knew what it was ... do helicopters in ukraine have lights that color. she said she'd never seen a searchlight on a helicopter, to the best of her knowledge, and that she didn't know what it was. we began to watch it while talking, and it began to move to the east. it did not move in an arc. it's motion was erratic, going one way a bit, stopping, another way, backtracking, no coherent direction to its movement. i still thought it might be a helicopter, though the movement seemed odd even for a helicopter.\r\n\r\nhowever, in a general sense, it was moving from our left to our right, and as it did it was growing in size. when it was about 30 degrees to our left, crazy as it sounds i got a \"message\" from it. it was my second day in kiev, and the message was, essentially, \"hi, welcome .... when \"i\" get about 30 degrees to your right, \"i\" will disappear.\" it felt \"friendly.\"\r\n\r\ni told my finacee that i'd just received a message from the orb, explaining what i'd heard. she smiled, with a bemused look on her face. as this orb traveled to be directly in front of us, i was astounded by its size, about a penny's width held at arm's length. a rock musician when i was younger, my hearing is not the sharpest. given the time, traffic was extremely sparse, the noise from it barely audible.\r\n\r\ni asked my finacee, do you hear anything. after a few seconds, she said no. nothing at all, i asked. she listened again. no, nothing, she said. i said, by definition, we are seeing a ufo. it's unidentified, flying, and a rather large object. i noted, everything man-made which flies makes some noise. she agreed, and the former look of bemusement no longer was on her face.\r\n\r\ni repeated to her: it's going to disappear when it gets \"about there,\" pointing about 30 degrees to our right. it continued moving, and oddly, it's size remained the same. when it flew to about 30 degrees to our right, on cue it disappeared. never will i forget the look on my fiancee's face. though we were startled, both of us had a peaceful feeling. nothing about it seemed threatening or ominous at any time.\r\n\r\nthough i've observed other ufos in my life, this one was unique. it did not travel in any kind of straight line. the color, i'd never seen a ufo that color. the size, this was the largest orb i've ever seen, by far. and of course, the \"message,\" and the orb disappearing just as it had promised me.\r\n\r\ni am

that we have had enough fun for the day. the two ladies went to the deck of the cottage where we were stayng to smoke a cigratte. after a few minutes on the deck my wife called to me and wanted me to observe something unusual in the low sky. she pointed it out to me and said \"look at this thing it has strange colors\". she pointed it out to me and the first thing that was obvious to me was that it was emmiting more than one color. my friends had binoculars so it was the first thing i tried to get to. once i focused on the object it appeared to me to be a pulsating object with the colors of red, white and green continuously at a rate of about 2-3 tenths of a second. when the light was white it looked to be triangular in shape. when they brought out their telescope to see if we could aquire a better visual description of the object it took a few moments to capture the object in the lense. my first look at it appeared to be the same as the binoculars had rendered. we continued to

hour or so,but that all changed during this walk.After an hour i began to worry,imust have told my sister because she clearly remembers me being alarmed.Here is the story my mother conveyed:while i was walking rocky across the park/ballfield i noticed odd lights all different colors flashing on the ground,i thought it was strange that utility workers would be working at this time in the late evening.Next i saw several who i thought were small children all around me.They did'nt look like normal kids though and then they began to talk to me,not through their mouths,but through their minds.I heard them clearly in my mind.The beings said why don't you come with us,and i said to where,and one of said to our craft right over there. i said no i'm busy why should i go with you,and they responded because we want to help you.Then another being asked me what is that next to you?Before i could answer one other being said thats her pet.Then one of them said again come with us we want to help you,i told them if you want to help me you should go to washington.What is washington?One of them said.After that exchange my mother says she remembers very little.A note to the reader,i had an encounter in my yard when i was 7 or 8 years of age.A craft was hovering over our front yard and i saw 3 beings staring down upon me from inside the craft,which was about 60 or 70 ft above me.Also my sister saw a ufo hovering near her while she was on her bike,she was 10 or 11 at the time,and it occured at talbot st and new york st also . our house is only 5 or 6 houses from new york st.Today the house is still there,but nobody resides there yet.By the way my childhood friend & his family always told me & others that our house was haunted,because they saw bluish glowing or bluish orbs over our rooftop more than once back in the late 70's.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

 the sightings tonight started at 10:05pm and ended at 11:20pm.-- we could not make out the shape of the craft, just the pulsating lights they had. --also, they were not lanterns sent up as a prank as one person recently suggested.  they did not move slowly with the wind currents, but moved fast, against the wind.  and the lights around them were bright,quivery,and pulsating, but not like the beacons that are on normal aircraft. we will look tomorrow night to see if there is any more activity. we don't have a video camera, but i wish someone else in clovis would look up into the northern sky tomorrow arount 10pm and see if they can't get some footage of this.
