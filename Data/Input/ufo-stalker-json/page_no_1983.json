a good handful of aircraft landing lights speckled the southern and eastern horizons, and there was plenty of air traffic all over the city in general. when we exited the freeway and hit the residential area of lents, a bright aircraft caught my attention and i decided to keep an eye on it. it was off to the south, where i'm used to seeing airliners come up and then bank east. upon arriving home, i got out of the car and looked up; what i saw was an airliner, banking northeast overhead, with its landing lights glaring and wingtips flashing, the whining of its engine clearly audible. what i also saw was a bright, star-like point of light moving in roughly the same ne trajectory, not far from the starboard side of the plane. now, if this was another plane, then it was dangerously close to collision with the other craft, and - while i'm not some expert on how atc handles traffic, - it doesn't make sense to me why air traffic control would divert two landing planes so close to each other. but i'm confident that the second light was not a plane, because i noticed some strange qualities: it was one single light, no wingtips, no flashing whatsoever; its path was completely straight with no wavering (whereas virtually all other aircraft i see are turning in a slight curve); moving at roughly the same speed as an airliner, it was quite bright, almost fluorescent, and it moved either into or behind some light clouds, which changed its tint from a monochromatic bright white to a slightly bluer hue.\r\n\r\nafter a few moments the light crossed paths with the plane and was therefor on the port side. it kept moving ne at the same speed until i lost it behind trees in the distance. unfortunately, i don't have any photos.\r\n\r\nfor the record, there wasn't much of a psychological involvement; it simply occurred to me that the light looked quite strange and out of place.\r\n\r\nin the interest of time, i will post this now. i understand there are some similar reports coming in. if mufon requires any more details for investigation, i'd be happy to provide them.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":25211,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5278815,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08282010-0004","longitude":-122.6717671,"occurred":1282968000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1282985182000,"summary":"Portland, or - approx. 9 pm, bright pin-point of light seen cruising ne (in close proximity to airliner).","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Portland, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:101515"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bellevue","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\t\r\nsorry i had to do this twice , they put me in washington dc. i am in washington state.\r\ni was on the corner of bellevue way and main street facing south east. i looked out to see if it was a cloudy night and i saw that the stars were out. the first star i noticed was a bright one ,the size of venus. i assumed that it was a planet until i saw that it was moving. i yelled at my friends that it was a u.F.O , but they went inside anyway. i stood watching , looking for a flashing light or some sound and i got neither. i watched it go from the southern part of the sky heading north.An airplane passed over it, and i wondered if they might collide.The object was clearly below the plane ,the plane was not at cruising altitude. we have a lot of air traffic around here. i yelled for my other friend to come outside , i asked her what she thought it was as it was moving away from us. she said the same things i thought (no blinking light, no sound). we watched as it disappeared in to the clouds. people were walking by , and no one stopped.\r\nmedia:\tnone","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25210,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.612867,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08282010-0003","longitude":-122.1917786,"occurred":1282967700000,"potentialRelations":[25209],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1282984726000,"summary":"Bright white star like","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Bellevue, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:101516"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Washington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on  the corner of bellevue way and main street facing south east. i looked out to see if it was a cloudy night and i saw that the stars were out. the first star i noticed was a bright one ,the size of venus. i assumed that it was a planet until i saw that it was moving. i yelled at my friends that it was a u.F.O , but they went inside anyway. i stood watching , looking for a flashing light or some sound and i got neither. i watched it go from the southern part of the sky heading north.An airplane passed over it, and i wondered if they might collide.The object was clearly below the plane ,the plane was not at cruising altitude. we have a lot of air traffic around here. i yelled for my other friend to come outside , i asked her what she thought it was as it was moving away from us. she said the same things i thought (no blinking light, no sound). we watched as it disappeared in to the clouds. people were walking by , and no one stopped.

like an reddish -hued star (western sky). however, it was larger than any other star in the sky, and was sitting very low, below the clouds, right at my tree line.  it seemed to stay still and i ignored it for a while not really knowing what it was. 3 hours later, i  checked it again and it was significantly higher and had moved farther south.  me and my friends came to the consensus it was most likely a weather balloon from the local university (considering the movement). we tried to take some pictures on our phones, but all we'd get is a dot of light...Not much.  the next evening (august 24th), when i saw it again in relatively the same place and time i assumed it was a weather balloon and didn't pay much attention...Until yesterday, august 25th when , after seeing it for a third time in a row, in the same western sky, i decided to sit outside and watch this thing. my friend joining me, we sat and watched.  the first thing we noticed was that it was indeed moving..Up and south.  the light(which was really all we could go off of) coming from the object, resembled a bright white orb, with red flashes or strobes emitting from the ends. \r\n     heres where it gets funky....After about an hour and a half of watching this thing (from about 9:15 to 10:45 pm) we noticed 3 (that we could see) military jets coming from the east (presumably from scott air force base)...Moving west towards the object. by the time they got to the object they were very far away, as all we could see was their lights flashing (indicating this object was quite large).  they seemed to surround the object on one side (one above, one slightly below, and one to the side).  after about 5 minutes of this, they proceeded to take turns circling the sky, one at a time, making passes at this object ( always passing underneath it).  this lasted for almost an hour and in the process this object had moved even farther up and south. \r\n    after the jets seemed to subside, we sat for another hour, watching the object, which continued its path up.  eyes hurting and tired, we went inside.  as of 1:30 am when i looked out my window, the object was still there, that is when i reluctantly went to bed.  i am determined to find out how it leaves, and am doing so tonight, if it is out again.  \r\n   all i can say is this:  we live in a small town, the closest military base to us being scott air force base, and we are outside at night alot.  we have never seen this many jets in one hour, let alone one evening,  in the five years we've lived here.  i would never normally report something like this, but this was the third night in a row this object was blatantly out there and i'm hoping maybe someone else caught it and possibly took a video of it. \r\n

after saying that the object appeared as an extremely bright white light (comparable to the moons brightness). at first we didnt really know what to make of it. and joked around that it may be an ufo. we both exclaimed as it started to bob back and forth; left to right in a downward arc. stars tend to flicker because of atmospheric disturbances, this object didnt flicker at all. and the fact that it was moving side to side gave it away. i have never seen anything do that ever. i panicked a little bit and my friend and i got back in my car and drove back to his house. after dropping him off and noticing that the object was still there, i drove the 30 miles back to pullman. as i pulled into my drive way and stepped out of my car i looked at the moon and the ufo was still there. by that time it was about 12:15am thursday august 26th. i woke up my roommate to confirm what i was seeing and we both noticed that the object seemed to get smaller and change to an amber color. right now i am in

antioch,tn. we saw over the trees towards our left,a very low flying,very smooth gliding,object. we turned into the parking lot of a citgo at the corner,and faced due north. the ufo flew entirely over the store,to where we could see the entire underside of it. we saw a large \"t\" shaped object with an approximate 20 very bright lights on it total. 5 very bright,very big lights,with 3-5 small lights in between the larger ones. it was about a 5 minute span from when we first made eye contact,to when it left eye sight. there was no sound,at all. it was completely pitch black all around the object from a few seconds before it passed over us,to a few seconds after wards. directly after we saw it,there were two planes,one coming from the south and the other from the east(with regular sound and visible sight of stars and moon light). there was/are no other feelings other than sheer amazement and awe. (this description is from my daughter, kendall who was in the car with me. she tried to get her camera out of her purse and she handed it to me, it was in view but the memory card was full.  i went into the gas station and told the attendant who looked at me like...And said i was lucky.  \r\n\r\nwe are both very sure of what we saw.  planes do not fly so low and there was no sound at all.  we were speechless. its an hour later and my daugher is freaked out.\r\n\r\nalso, thanks for following up with your phone calls.  i had intended to call back but your number was erased from the caller list.\r\n\r\ni guess i should also let you know that during the week of july 5, 2010, i have seen two objects in the vicinity southeast of our home (i believe in proximity of the lake area.  the objects move in irregular patterns, they go up and down and zigzag, sometime moving fast, but mostly they seem to be suspended.  we take a break from looking at them and when we come back they have moved to another place.  (we also noticed these same type of objects during june of last year 2009 looking directly south/southwestard that moved slowly from right to left over the treeeline)  \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":25183,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.0069049,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262010-0001","longitude":-86.5072342,"occurred":1282801200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1282808736000,"summary":"Perpendicular looking,\"t\" shaped.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Smyrna, Tennessee","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:101542"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Moore","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Strange light orange/white color traveling in northeastern direction.  i live in southwest okc/moore.  approximate time of sighting 10:05pm clear sky, no clouds.  the object was a distance away and was approximately the size of a pea at arms length...Went inside to wake up my wife but she did not come out in time.  i ran back outside (didn't think about getting  camera) and saw it getting considerably smaller and turned a bluish white color then went out. \r\n\r\ni live next to an international airport...And have seen all kinds of airplane lights, but this was different.  it floated/glided very different than a conventional airplane. this is the second time in the last year that i have seen weird lights.  last year i saw a light directly west of my house just above the horizon..It looked like the light from a welding torch bluish white.  observed it for several days and then it no longer appeared in the sky.  \r\n\r\nas for the object observed tonight august 25, 2010.  it was moving at a constant pace, and no sound was heard.  \r\n\r\ni just went back outside and seen another object about 10 minutes ago.  i took several photos of it(see photos).  earlier today there were several black helicopters flying around and directly over my house. i took several photos of helicopters (see photos).  perhaps they were doing exercises?  i've only seen helicopters several times in the last 10 years. and never have i seen two small black helicopters side by side like today.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25182,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.3484679,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08252010-0007","longitude":-97.4832028,"occurred":1282799100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg,   Fireball,   Sphere,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1282805875000,"summary":"Orange floating/gliding light.","tags":["lights","photo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/25182_submitter_file1__Unknown1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/25182_submitter_file2__Unknown2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/25182_submitter_file3__DSC05299.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Moore, Oklahoma","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:101543"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Mountain Home","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i travel during all hours of the day and night.  we are currently commercial drivers.  \r\n\r\nthe night of august 24th, 2010, i was driving thru idaho on i-84 eastbound my husband in the passenger seat.  the weather was clear, there was not a cloud in the sky that we could see.  the moon was a full moon that made for a bright night sky that could cast shadows of objects on the ground. \r\n\r\ni had gone past boise and was approximately at mile marker 80 when i noticed a bright light in the distance ahead of me and slightly to the right. (east bound)   it was yellowish orange in color and was just above the horizon.  it lit up for about 5 seconds and went away.  it was in the direction of mountain home, which has an air force base. it didn���t appear to move, however i thought it may have been a large aircraft in the distance turning off it���s lights possibly after take off.  i mentioned seeing it to my husband.  since he has previous military experience working in avionics mechanics with military attack choppers; we discussed what possible craft it may have been.\r\n\r\nabout 20 minutes later, as we came near mountain home, idaho, the light lit up again.  it appeared to be about a quarter of a mile away in comparison to the town and objects around it. it was over the town of mountain home on the south side of the interstate.  it was approximately 400-500 feet off the ground hovering.  we could now see clearly two bright lights close to one another.  in comparison to the size and the objects around it, the size of the two lights together were approximate to the near size wingspan of a 747.  it was lit up brightly and hovering for five seconds and then disappeared.  we could see no silhouette of the lights or the craft after it disappeared.  we could clearly see the sky behind where it was seen hovering lit up.  \r\n\r\nthis peaked our amazement for neither of us knew of anything similar to that in an aircraft or helicopter that would just hover and disappear.  we talked about what it might have been but could not come to any rational conclusion.  still traveling down the road now at about mile marker 97, i pointed to a pulsating red light that had a small yellow light to the left of it.  this object was just in front of us on the north side of the road, moving to the south side.  i pointed to this object, mentioning that the other bright light couldn���t have been a helicopter like this red light probably was.  \r\n\r\nas i was talking about this theory, the red light object was on the south side of the highway.  we had driven up closer to it and it was only about 150-200 yards away from the highway and was only about 200 feet off the ground.  my husband was looking directly at the object.  at 11:19 mountain time.\r\n\tmy husbands account: ���at first i saw two square lights appear directly across from each other as the red light faded away.  i opened the window to get a clearer view.  the light was a bright yellowish orange.  a red light reappeared directly below and to the left of the left square.  at that time this immense light lit up the entire object and i saw a cylinder object that was attached with the red light separate from the brightly lit object.  at first it almost slowly moved off.  directly after the separation the brightly lit object disappeared. the cylinder object then snaked off quickly and continued south.  about four to five seconds later the first red pulsating craft reappeared. it repeated its self in the exact same manner slightly to the right of the original cylinder separation. the immense light again disappeared and there were two cylinder shaped craft with red pulsating lights moving across the sky.���\r\n\r\nwe did not notice any sound. \r\n\r\ni had personally witnessed the first time the craft lit up but did not witness the separation due to having to watch the road, however as my husband in his excitement told me what he was seeing i looked over, had slowed way down and witnessed the second separation.  we were now past the objects separation area and we wanted to pull over to get a look at anything else that was happening.  i pulled over less than a mile away.  we turned off the truck and got outside to look behind where the craft had been.  \r\n\r\nwe saw both craft with pulsating red lights flying around, hovering at times. the lights would stay on for a bit at times then pulsate at others. the craft would disappear and reappear in different places quickly but still in the same general area.  they would follow each other.  they were flying very low over homes.  we took a look around the sky  and noticed there were no other happenings going on.  traffic was slow but steady.  we would see trucks or cars pass approximately every 20 or 30 seconds at best.  i did not notice any other spectators stopped.  we watched these craft fly around in this pattern until about 11:45 when we saw a fast moving jet coming towards the area from the east.  it appeared not to be a commercial craft.  as the jet came closer the two red pulsating cylinder craft flew quickly off back over the highway towards the northwest.  the jet appeared to be tracking them.\r\n\r\nwhen we sat back in our vehicle the time was 11:49pm.
