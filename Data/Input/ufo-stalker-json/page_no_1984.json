sony trv-65 model, had some kind of infrared, night mode.  it does and it is called ���������nightshot��������� mode.  i had recently read some new information about ufo photography in j. chisholm���������s photography methods for the ufo hunter, and he had a section about near infrared, night photography for video shooting of ufos.\r\n\r\nafter getting out the old trv-65, i proceeded to my deck out back to test it.  i intended to videotape the backyard trees, roofline, and sky with the sony in regular and nightshot mode.  while doing this with various levels of zooming in and out and turning the camcorder back and forth from regular to nightshot mode, i was greatly surprised to see a white blob come into the frame from the left while i was zoomed in to maximum extent.  it was so startling that i naturally started following the object as it sped along in the sky under some high clouds.  i managed to keep it in the frame the whole time it was visible till it moved along into a bank of dense white clouds.  this ended up lasting only eight seconds.\r\n\r\nview the video at [link moved to additional evidence section/cms/tg]","distance":"Over One

then i noticed it was moving slightly. i kept watching and it didn't move like anything i've ever observed before -- planes go overhead often & even helicopters (some planes went by while this thing was around, & it was always still as they went by then started moving again once they were out of sight.)\r\n\r\nas far as the locomotion goes, it could be absolutely still, or in constant motion, it most often moved in small increments but sometimes crossed more distance and often circled back on itself almost like it was covering a grid or something?  i called my sister outside and she brought a couple of pairs of crappy little binoculars we have, so we were able to get a little closer look. at times it was almost like an orb, then at others perhaps comprised of smaller lights in an almost triangular shape. often, there were 'arms' or offshoots of light or that would have a light on the end. \r\n\r\nwith this closer look, we could also see it was never perfectly still even tho it appeared so with the naked eye. it was in constant motion - faster than anything man-made could possibly be in my opinion. at times it was almost like it was drawing shapes in the sky in such rapid movements we could almost see the circles & marks it made for a split second inscribed in light before our eyes caught up & they faded away. it was almost like it was dancing, lol. as strange as it was, it was beautiful. all the shifting, moving, lights that mostly appeared white, but sometimes i would catch hints of blues, greens, & reds in the mix. i'm very curious what it could be, because honestly i've never heard of any ufo that behaved in quite this way...  \r\n\r\nwe'll definitely be looking up to the sky tonight as well for any signs of anything unusual, just in case.

about the size of a 737. my immediate thoughts were it must be a tethered balloon although this was way high and would have been a danger to other aircraft. the visibility was so good that i am certain there was no tether. the shape was unlike a blimp or airship and there was no motion that would be consistent, particularly in the strong sw wind. it did not bob or rotate or move with the crosswind. the shape was like a squished as in flattened figure of eight. lying on its side. so nearly cigar shaped but with a dip in the middle. we watched it as long as our eyes could focus on it from very close to what must have been about 3 miles away. i was frustrated i could not just pull over and watch it but we were on the motorway. i have seen a lot of aircraft in my time but this was

for a drive. it took us approximatley 10 minutes to get dressed and start the car. we decided to go for gas in raytown at 87th street. after paying for gas, i walked over and began to pump my gas.  while pumping i began to look around the sky and noticed in a distance a brightly illuminated star that hung low in the sky.  i brought it to my wife's attention and suggested that we drive toward it. first we drove toward overland park kansas and noticed that the star appeared to be moving. so we ajusted our direction to the south toward butler mo. as we got to butler, we notice that the star appeared to be a bit north and west of our current position.\r\n \r\n so we again changed direction. now driving toward belton. once we got to 166th street we turned east. while driving on 166th we stopped and pulled over because we noticed that the star was now dimming, and it was now comming in our direction. it seemed to have spotted us some how. while we sat there party on the sholder and half of my car still in the street this very large craft flew directly overhead turning it's extremely bright light completely off.  watching it fly over i marveled at how large it was.  this night there was a full moon and i could see that it was trianglular in shape.  as it was flying south now headed toward butler fast.\r\n  we continued to keep our eyes on it as it turned its bright star like light back on and tried to drive in it direction again. needless to say we couldn't catch it again. this thing just sits in mid air for hours (atleast until we noticed it and began to drive toward it) what it was i couldn't tell you but it was but it wasn't a conventional air craft. i'v never seen anything this big! i know we have b2 bomber2 in the area, but this was'nt that. i seen the b2 up close and this thing was 3 to 4 times as large.  for those of you who saw it in overland park, i'm sure that this is not the first time anyone has noticed it. i've noticed it from raytown mo, but this was the first time i decided to drive toward it to see what it was. i seriously think that perhaps now is the time to report any and all sightings. i'm not trying to panic anyone, but there is something really serious going on. i've got more strange pictures and videos than i really care to have.  i hope that all (and i do mean all) these creatures are here for peaceful purposes. i should also mention that i was taking pictures of the moon the night before and i notice that there is something there that was'nt there before. atleast not in any prior pictures that i have taken.  someone else out there knows whats happening without speculation and is either unwilling or unable to comment on these phenomena at this time.  but mark my words, that day is comming!","distance":"501

program we noticed a big bright star over the flight path in san jose.  we looked at his phone to program, looked up and it was gone.  we thought it must have been a plane.  about 10 minutes later, my friend noticed a big bright \"star\" in the trees to the right and in front of the observatory.  he then noticed it was moving.  we walked out from behind the tree to look at the light in the clear and noticed then that the object was hovering from side to side in the same place/same level.  it then slightly and smoothly moved up, then came back down to its original location and continued to move from side to side.  you can see this in the attached photo 6981.  although you can not see it moving, you can tell when you magnify the picture that it is not a star and not a plane.\r\n\r\nin

early evening. i had crossed the north arm of lake charlevoix almost to the entrance to pine river, which exits into round lake, and then lake michigan. when i was about 100 yards from the old train trestle bridge abutments that flank the entrance to pine river.\r\n\r\ni turned the kayak south to head back directly to oyster bay. it was a lovely evening, about 7:30 p.M., clear and warm, with little cloud cover. the lake was a bit rough, with maybe 1 to 1.5 foot swells, but no white caps. stiff wind from the west, i think, though i am no expert.\r\n\r\nas i turned, i noticed a large pinkish-silver sphere low over the trees way south near what i guessed was ironton but not as far south at east jordan. it just floated there. i thought at first it was a hot air balloon giving rides at a fair, but i watched it over 30 minutes it took me to row back to oyster bay, and although it appeared to shift location slightly, it never went up for down much. in order to try to place the object, i noted that if i held my hand at arm's length with my finger at the horizon of the lake, the sphere was about my index finger's width above the horizon and seemed to be floating slightly to the left of the narrow center portion of lake charlevoix. it could have been father south than ironton, but since i'm no sure how big it was, i'm not sure how far south it floated. i could block my view of the sphere with my index finger but not by much. it looked big. \r\n\r\nit was a solid, pink-silver color, not with any graphics like you would expect on a hot-air balloon. i tried and tried to spot a gondola, but could not see anything hanging below it. i wondered if it could be a coast guard weather balloon, because i know there is a coast guard station in charlevoix. but if the sphere was tethered to a boat, i could not see it. anyway, it was a clean sphere, not an upside down teardrop shape like you would expect to see in a weather balloon. it was actually rather beautiful, like a plain little pink moon.\r\n\r\nas i paddled, i kept expecting it to disappear or to move. there were maybe two or three power boats visible on the lake. none were remotely close to me, so although i wanted to hail a boat to see if anyone could confirm my sighting, i couldn't. surely someone else must have noticed this thing. i raced back to the bay in hopes of getting a better look with my binoculars, but i lost sight of the sphere behind the tree line there as i rounded the point going into the bay. i even climbed onto the roof of the cabin to see if i could spot it from there. but it was still below the tree line, and by then it was getting dark, so i gave up. it occurred to me later in bed that i should have called the cg in charlevoix to ask what it was or to call the local police to see whether they knew, but the next morning it seemed like it would be too silly to do so and i would just be laughed off as a kook.\r\n\r\ni have no idea what the sphere was, and i would be grateful to anyone who could tell me if it was merely a mundane object or some weather phenomenon. someone else had to have seen it.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

looking around at the garden.  sometimes i go out there at night and relax in the garden so this was normal for me. i was completely involved in looking down at the ground and my plants when something caught my eye in the sky to the south of me.  i looked up and saw a large group of around ten dimly glowing red lights forming an uneven \"v\" pattern in the sky.  when i say \"uneven\", i mean that they formed a v shape, but one side of the v extended out farther than the other. picture like a check mark shape with the longer side on the right. it was completely silent and glided across the night sky from east to west. it didn't appear to be moving very quickly and i was confused because at first i just assumed it was the underside of a plane.  i remember thinking that the plane i was looking at was in pretty crappy condition because its lights were burnt out on one end causing it to have a check mark shape instead of a full v. then i realized it was not making any noise, and i started to get chills down my spine because i was quickly realizing that it was not a plane. i couldn't tell how high up in the sky it was, but i could tell that if it was a plane, it would have to be flying extremely low to be as wide as it was. it also most definitely would make loud noise. i felt like the floor fell out from under me.  then, as i was fighting to accept what i was seeing, something amazing happened to make me know without a doubt that what i was seeing was extraterrestrial. as the formation of lights slowly glided across the sky, the portion of lights which created the uneven, extended part of the v broke off from the rest of the lights. it spun rapidly in clockwise circles, shot off into space, and was gone.  what now remained in the sky was a normal even \"v\" configuration of lights which had slowed its movement in the sky above me. then it faded away and was gone.  the glowing reddish orange lights just faded away, just like when you turn off a light on a dimmer switch slowly. the whole event lasted about 10 seconds.\r\n\r\ni stood there completely blown away. i am not a ufo nut or even ever think about the subject. this makes me change my perspective on a lot of different things in my life. i now know that we are not alone and there is at least one far more advanced species of life than us. i kind of feel privileged to have seen

i turned off onto a secondary road. taking a right and then an immediate left. as i turned right i saw a car in front of me going very slow. i then saw an object in the sky straight ahead of me. i appeared very bright red in color or orangish in the center and shimmering around the edges. i thought it might be a bright star or planet at first. it was bigger than either and it was closer and brighter. im guessing it was around 10,000 feet. big though! i pulled off of the side of the road and pulled out my iphone. i took a couple of pictures however i was in a panic and could not get a zoom in the shot. while taking 2 pictures one other car approached and saw the object as well. they saw me taking pictures and asked..What is that in the sky? i replied i have no idea its why i pulled off the road! we observed the object for a minute or so, and i was convinced it might have been a star that was being refracted throught the atmosphere. im an aviation enthusiast and i have alot of experience viewing aircraft night or day. this was no aircraft! all of a sudden the outer lights dissapeared. there was a single reddish to orange light left and it went straight up into the sky quickly until the light got smaller and smaller then finally dissapeared completely!After downloading the pictures from my phone and i zoomed in on the object it appears triangular.. amazing. i am curious if you recieve anyother reprts from charleston, wv. it should have been visible to alot of people in the city as i was just in the suburb and it was very bright. i was shaking driving home and

sparkled the way a star does, maybe a bit more. as stated before it did not move at all in the 15 minutes i was staring at it. at this time i went in and decided to try and find out what star it was. after about 10 minutes i had read that sirius was the brightest star and decided that was probably what i had been looking at. went back outside.... and whatever it was, was gone.  the only thing that could stay in the sky motionless like that is a helicopter, and i stared at it for a long time and i am possitive it was not a helicopter. i am possitive that i did not loose the star or anything

are so bright and odd i seen the same thing in hemet, ca when i lived there over 1 yr ago. i am starting to wonder if i am being watched from afar. if i am not someone is.  i just hope it is some military experiment or something. my husband seen it also and we both think it is strange. this is not airplanes. they are far away but if i can see it from that far away it has to be huge. it looks like airplane pass under and aroung and even above these objects. i wish my camera worked but it is broke so i can't include pictures but if you come into my house area and look around you will see a ufo about 9:45 to after 11pm.","distance":"Over One

was evening, the sun was setting. my roommate and i were talking when i noticed a bright object in the sky. thinking it was a plane or some other well known cause i ignored it. moments later i realized the object was gone. i told my roommate about it who remained skeptical. about 5 to maybe 10 minutes later the object reappeared in another part of the sky, much brighter. my roommate then noticed the object. even though it was bright the setting sun seemed to reflect off it. then without warning the object disappeared once more. my roommate and i contemplated as to what it could be. then the object appeared once more in another area of the sky. there were other people at the track at the time and i'm sure my roommate and i weren't the only ones to have witnessed this object. after the third time the object didn't return but several moments later several jets flew in the vicinity of where the object

the choppers were about 2 streets away (300 yards) from my house. however when i started taking photos of the heli's one of them flew directly above our home! it was very intimidating to say the

photos and many of them had 'unknown quantities' in the frame. the one photo in particular though (attached) is astounding, it appears to show a ufo materialising! i dont know what to make of it.

old town, clapham common and we were less than five minutes from home. i love living under the gatwick flight path because i get to watch planes every day. ever since i was child i have always looked up. i was watching the new boeing a380 with absolute delight, when i saw what i thought was another plane much higher and much farther away. i looked at it for a long time and decided that i couldn't see any wings or tail, and of course i had this rather large boeing to compare it to. in fact, it had the shape of a cigar, it seemed to be white i did not see windows. i did my best to track it using the a380 as it continued on its route. i nearly lost it in the clouds and whilst searching it for it, i spotted a second object, it seemed to be similar to the first but was too far away for me to establish a shape. the first object came back into view and the second disappeared into the clouds.\r\n\r\njust as the a380 disappeared from sight in the direction of clapham junction and gatwick, i stopped a passer-by and asked her opinion, she took a while to find where i pointed but she confirmed that she saw both objects and that she didnt know what they were and continued on her way. what nailed it for me, was that at the start both plane and object were headed south but now the object had moved back and was headed north and then i lost sight of it.\r\n\r\ni'll be honest i am 38 and have been staring up at the sky since i was a child, i really love planes, and i had never seen anything but planes in the sky up until today, today, i saw something else.","distance":"Over One

now west of here. i requested that he call mclean county and see if anyone over there had gotten any reports. i don���t think that he believed me, so it will be interesting to see if he called or not.
