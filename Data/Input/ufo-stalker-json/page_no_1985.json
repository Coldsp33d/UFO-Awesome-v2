at a 10\" exposure the planes are obvious in nature, the stars are \"solid\", and the \"streaks\" cover a much greater distance than that of either the planes or stars.  if you (investigators) would like these photos feel free to contact me any time day or night and i will gladly provide them to you in any form you see fit.  although, you may need a mac computer to read them in their current form. thank you for your time...","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":25147,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.9500262,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08212010-0002","longitude":-74.1278596,"occurred":1282360500000,"potentialRelations":[25144],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,   Star-like,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1282392923000,"summary":"Covey of ufos in \"dog fight.\"","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Fair Lawn, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:102492"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Henderson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were swimming down at nelson's landing which is on lake mojave. we were floating around looking at the stars. my sister noticed 4 objects moving in the sky. as we watched, 2 objects appeared to fly away from earth and while the one of the other objects sped up to join the other object and they flew away on an easterly trajectory. i watch the stars often, but have never seen a satellite exhibit any erratic behavior like i seen last night, nor have i ever seen one match the speed these objects had. unfortunately we were swimming and didn't have a camera handy.

delta shaped pattern of four lights approximately 5 degrees or so in apparent size passing overhead at the zenith. i didn't have much time to think about it but i believe that it blocked out the stars as it passed by. i watched the pattern fly along it's symmetry axis extremely rapidly. it crossed from the zenith to the local skyline which here is about 30 degrees up or so as we are at the bottom of a hill where it passed out of view. it flew much faster than the large jetliners which fly a similar approach path into san jose. \r\n\r\nwhat really struck me about it was that it was absolutely silent, meaning it would have had to be extremely high or if a low flying aircraft be extremely quiet. if it was a formation of low earth orbiting satellites it was remarkable in the fact that it would have that particular arrangement, and it shouldn't have blocked out the stars. if it was some sort of experimental airship, i imagine it should be much noisier if it was flying low enough to appear that large and move that rapidly. it did not appear to display any other unusual characteristics other than it's apparent size and rapidity, nor did it deviate from an apparently straight flight path. \r\n\r\nthis was my first and only ufo experience. as a professional scientist, a longtime amateur astronomer, and licensed pilot, i honestly never expected to see one. i remember being unnerved enough by it's appearance that i stood up and watched it as it flew, thinking that finally, i had seen something that had at least the tiniest possibility of being extraterrestrial. i remember a feeling of awe, humility, and curiosity at the same time. although to this day i don't know what i saw, it gives me hope that the truth *might* be out there, after all.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

formation.  they were identical in appearance and traveled at identical speed.  at first i wondered if they were planes, but they were not plane-shaped.  also, their speed, elevation, formation seemed to rule them out as planes.  i can't see why planes would be doing that.  also, they were close to nrel.  since that is federal govt property, i don't know why multiple small planes would be allowed at low elevation there.  \r\nnote:  i live in area, and have seen lots of small planes, military helicopters, and of course the paragliders on top of lookout mtn.  these objects were not like any of those. also, they were travelling pretty much nw in a route that i have not seen planes/helicopters take.\r\ni kept watching them as i drove, since i was driving in that direction.  their speed, elevation, formation and appearance seemed unusual to me.  i lost sight of them when they kept traveling nw and were eventually blocked from view by table mountain. \r\nthe objects were spherical,

were sitting on the back balcony watching the night sky and talking.  kevin my brother-in-law and i spotted some airplanes that were flying in circles. there were four of them in total but they were split into 2 groups.  they would follow each other in huge patterns accross half of the sky. this was one of the planes that was to my left front the other plane appeared to just stop i can only assume that it started flying away from us but we could still see the light on it.  the other plane that was with it started to circle by its self but it was moving alot faster then it was before. \r\n\r\nwhere it get crazy is we hear a muffled boom noise over and over again about about 30 secs  apart then we hear a quick 3 of the same noise instead of just one and it repeats for about 10 mins. while this is going on kevin was looking in the other direction my wife and i seen a red ball fall out of the sky in the direction of the airbase. this is where the one airplane \"stopped\" moving and the other one put it in overdrive.  i tell kevin and he turns around and about that time we see 8 more red balls fall out of the sky.  \r\n\r\nwhat we seen is multiple red balls with defined edges falling so fast that it appeared to have a blur behind it.  they disappeared when behind clouds and reappeared and then disappeared or hit the ground far away from us they could had went into the horizon or hit the ground or ocean far away. each one lasted about 3 sec and were one after the other and some fell at the same time.  the first one fell from left to right and the rest fell from right to left all seemed to be heading in the same direction. they started about halfway through the sky out of nowhere.  the first one fell and there was a few seconds before the others started to fall.\r\n\r\ni just knew that the base was under attack because i thought that they were bombs or missiles being shot at the base but there were not any noises after they \"hit\".  i never have seen a bomb or missiles so i don't know what they look like.  after the red balls fell all but one of the planes went off the one that appeared to stay still went out of site and the other one just kept on flying the same routine it had before for a little while longer then it went off and we couldn't see it any more.  \r\n\r\nwe don't know what we seen but we are hoping that someone else that seen them and may know what they were and could shed some light on this for us.  i will be back on my balcony tonight to see if it happens again.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

can't remember the exact date now, but it was still dark. i was commuting to my job at the time.I was the only car on the road at the time.\r\n\r\nas i drove along, i noticed a red light in the distance ahead of me. it looked out of place and at first i thought it was the tail lights of a car.I nixed that idea because the red light seemed to be too high up to be tail lights. i then thought it might be the trailer lights on a semi-truck. i also nixed that idea because i realized it was only 1 light.\r\n\r\nit suddenly hit me for some reason that it was a ufo, because it was so strange. i suddenly got a feeling of excitement and i was quite happy at the thought of seeing a ufo. \r\n\r\nas i got closer to the ufo, i kept thinking to myself, \"please don't fly off. i want to get up to you and see you\". i didn't speed up or slow down, because i was afraid if i did, it would suddenly fly away.\r\n\r\nfinally, i came up on the ufo and stopped approximately 15 to 20 feet from it. the ufo was approximately 10 to 12 feet in the air. i felt i could have gotten even closer, but i was afraid if i did it would take off.\r\n\r\nthe whole area was lit up in a red light that was emitting from the craft. it wasn't a bright light, but rather a soft light. it was so surreal. the light wasn't coming from something like aircraft lights, but rather it seemed to be emitting from the outer shell of it.\r\n\r\ntry as i might, i couldn't see the craft itself, only the red light and what appeared to be a dark center. i started getting frustrated that i couldn't see the ufo, so i really concentrated and squinted my eyes at it. finally i could make out the left hand side of it. i had to look through the light to see it. \r\n\r\nit appeared to be an oval shape about the length and height of a car. i remember thinking that there couldn't have been more than 2 occupants in it. the craft was perfectly suspended in the air without any hint of wavering. there was no sound and no apparent signs of propulsion.  \r\n\r\nafter staring at it for a few minutes, it suddenly dropped down to only a few inches above the ground. i believe the craft was a gray color at this time. it seems to me it had a wide belt around its middle and it had raised ribs with a possibility of what looked like nuts and bolts on the ribs. there were no apparent windows or doors of any kind. \r\n\r\nit then slowly took off to my left and down through a gully. i remember seeing its red light shining off the ground under it. the craft never wavered from its distance from the ground. if the ground rose, it rose. if the ground dropped, it dropped.\r\n\r\nwhen it got down to the bottom of the gully, the land opens up into a wide, flat stretch. this is when the ufo suddenly accelerated to a high speed and was into the horizon in only a couple of seconds. it left a trail behind it that reminded me of a tracer bullet. even though it was traveling very fast, i had the impression it wasn't even trying to go fast. it came to an abrupt and immediate dead stop when it make it to the hills in the horizon.\r\nit then slowly floated off to the west, following the hills in the horizon. \r\n\r\ni sat there watching it for a couple of minutes when another car came up over the hill heading east from wolf point to poplar. i was on top of the hill and a ways back. i now realize the ufo had dropped down and went down the gully, because it didn't want the other car to see it. i have no idea if the other car had seen anything at all. when the car went by me i just stared at it and it kept going. they must have seen something, but not like i did.\r\n\r\nthe whole experience was totally surreal. i was never scared the whole time and i was quite excited and happy. i often wonder why the ufo let me get up to it and look at like that. could it have somehow read my mind and felt nice to me? \r\n\r\nas a side note: a month or two later i was riding with my parents from wolf point back to poplar. a bunch of cars were parked out in the burrow pit and a bunch of people were looking at tule creek, which is down the hill from where i saw the ufo. i asked what were all those people doing there as it was quite unusual. my father than said he heard people talking about a ufo landing in the cat tails in tule creek. sure enough, there was an imprint in the cat tails that would have been the shape and size of what i had seen\r\n\r\ni never seen the craft again. it still haunts my memory every day. i couldn't tell you what it was, but i believe it was not of this earth.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

the sky.We got up and went out onto our balcony to see several, maybe 8-10 aircraft with extremely bright strobing lights on them.They were north of us flying extremely fast from east to west. then once nearly out of sight they turned and came back towards the east. when flying from east to west we witnessed a bright red light ahead of the conventional aircraft. at one point the red light made an abrupt and complete stop and then changed directions flying back in the direction it came from. the other aircraft made their turns and began following. we lost sight of them , then within 30 seconds or so a triangle shaped object with a deep red light in the center came flying directly overhead from the direction the jets left in, followed minutes later by the group of jets again. the triangle shaped object made no sound as it flew overhead, yet we could hear the conventional aircraft as they flew by. over the next several minutes the aircraft continued to maneuver around the airspace near the city at extreme speeds, my wife , son and myself all witnessed changes in speed (including full stops), direction and altitude which are not possible with currently known technologies. after 30-45 minutes the aircraft all flew over the horizon.\r\n\r\nthis is not our first sighting here in lake havasu city. we had a very similar experience in may of this year, still my first thought was to try and rationalize the aircraft as being of a conventional nature. the feelings were excitement, fear and frustration at not knowing exactly what it was we were seeing.

was out on my balcony skywatching,as now that i am retired, i tend to be a bit of night person. it was an exceptionally clear night, quite windy, and any clouds were quickly blown away. my balcony faces north. i was looking at a group of stars almost directly above, but slightly north. i was using a set of high powered field glasses/ binoculars.\r\ni noticed a silver disc shaped object move away from the star cluster and fly for a short bit going east. it then stopped, and sat still for a few seconds after which it changed direction by about 45 degrees and headed in a mostly north/north east direction. i thought, at first,that it may be a satellite, but realized quickly that they do not stop, change direction or leave orbit. when i moved the field glasses away from my eyes i could not see it, so it was far enough out that it could only be seen with them. after several seconds it flew out of sight, straight out. i felt as though it was 'scouting' or searching for something.\r\nat this point i must tell you that this is not the first time i have seen a 'ufo'. i am sixty years old now, and have had several of these encounters, the first one being when i was 15 years old. the subsequent ones were incidents where the crafts got so close that i could easily see the shape, size, lights, etc. i must say, however, that at no point did i feel uneasy or scared. quite the opposite, in fact. i do have them logged, but sadly, only as as afterthought, so the specific time and date were only as close as i could remember.Luckily, i do remember what i was doing each time, so the dates are fairly close to the actual. i must add that every time i always had another witness with me, but not the same one for every incident. i would welcome any queries, as i have never before made any official reports. thank you for taking the time to read this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25114,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.252723,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-08162010-0011","longitude":-79.883125,"occurred":1281942000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1282026078000,"summary":"Saw

rather long traffic signal, i noticed that there was only one small, normal-looking cumulus cloud in the western sky against the hills of red rock canyon.  i don���t know why i kept staring at that cloud, but maybe i was bored.  after about 10 seconds of noticing it, the ���cloud��� began to do some truly amazing things that i���ve never seen a cloud do before.\r\n\r\nthe cloud started out looking rounded and puffy just like a small, normal-looking cumulus cloud.  but it suddenly started to slowly elongate itself from left to right until it became a skinny, sausage-shaped cloud (and this was not a windy day.)  this change in shape happened over the course of about a minute.  then this sausage-shaped cloud started rapidly collapsing in on itself to form an abnormally round ball-shaped cloud.  when it was a perfect white circle, it continued to keep shrinking until it suddenly disappeared.  the entire transformation that i saw probably took place over no more than two and a half minutes total.  when this cloud disappeared, there was nothing in the air in that direction, and visibility was very good.\r\n\r\nby the way, before and after the above-mentioned event, i saw no planes, helicopters, or any kind of objects other than the weird cloud on that bright, sunny afternoon.  this was definitely not a vapor trail either.\r\n\r\ni was reminded of a remark that a ufologist (whose name i can���t remember right now) said on one of my ufo/government coverup dvds.  he mentioned that if you ever see an otherwise clear daylight sky with only one cloud in it, you can bet that it���s a ufo.  after seeing this particular cloud, i think he was right!","distance":"Over One
