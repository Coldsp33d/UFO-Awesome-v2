deleted--sgonzalez/cms). we were in a pickup truck, driving into a cattle pasture to assist in tagging and weighing a new born calf.  the pasture is in a very rural area of alabama, just off of cobb's landing road, which runs east-west from us hwy 28, between camden and miller's ferry in wicox county.  we were facing east/south-east.  there is no airport in that direction untill the montgomery airport about 80-90 miles east/north-east.  nothing but small towns, pine woods and the alabama river.  the small camden airport about 10 miles to our south.\r\n\r\ni saw what appeared to be a white cattle egret fly up from the tree line at the far edge of the pasture.  what caught my attention was that it was solitary, egrets are usually in flocks; that it wasn't flapping it's wings as it rose, it's body position stayed fixed; and that it ascended at a steady 40-45 degree angle.  i watched it a second or two and pointed it out to **(name deleted--cms/sg) when it continued to ascend at a steady slope.  egrets will usually fly up a few feet, level out and glide back down to the field.  this was well above the tree top level of the distant trees, probably 300-400 yards (1/4 mile).  before **(name deleted--cms/sg) could locate it, while i was pointing it out, it dissappeared... vanished.  i was describing what i had just seen to **(name deleted--cms/sg) when it re-appeared, higher in the sky and to the left of where i had last seen it.  it had been ascending from our left to right, going south.  i had watched it for 5-10 seconds before it vanished, and it re-appeared in about the same length of time, still ascending at the same trajectory.  i again pointed it out to **(name deleted--cms/sg) as it climbed higher into the sky and moved farther southward.  it was still brlliant white and didn't seem to be diminishing in size in spite of the distance it was travelling. **(name deleted--cms/sg) still wasn't able to locate it before it dissappeared a second time, then re-appeared again, higher and back to left of it's last position.  \r\n\r\nthe object repeated this sequence a total of five times. **(name deleted--cms/sg) spotted it on it's fourth and fifth appearances.  i interpretted this trajectory to be a spiralling ascent that carried it upward and southward at about a 45 degree angle.  it seemed to be visible to us only along a portion of it's spiral, possibly due to light reflection from it's surface, and then vanished when the surface angle changed.  on it's fifth appearance it entered the scattered clouds and we lost it.  it did not seem to be smaller when it entered the clouds than it was when i first saw it, which makes me think that it was farther away initially than i had at first thought, possibly even miles away, and that it was much larger than a cattle egret.  \r\n\r\nwe heard no sound, it left no trail.  it did appear bird shaped, with a fixed wing position.  this was during operation desert storm in kuwait, and i thought that a possible explanation would be a stealth aircraft painted camoglage and we saw it only because we happened to be at the correct angle to catch a reflexion.  the area around miller's ferry is used as a training area by the air national guard out of montgomery.  the reason i'm reporting this is because it certainly did appear to rise from the field or from the trees beyond the field... we did not see it fly into that location.  it rose from that location as if it had been there some time, and i can think of no location a plane could have taken  off from in that direction.\r\n\r\nif each acending appearance lasted 5 seconds, then the entire sighting lasted at most a minute.  i guess-tomate the clouds to have been 10,000-15,000 feet at least? - possibly higher?  a direct ascent to 2 miles with 2 mile downrange at a 45 degree ascent would be a distance of 2.8 miles.  the spiral added more distance - depending on how tight the spiral was, another mile? say 4 miles in 1.5 minutes, that's about 240 mph.  a 3 mile climb with 3 mile downrange gives about 360 mph. if the circles of the spiral were large, the distance covered could have been as much as 12 miles, a speed of 720 mph.\r\n\r\nfrom our perspective it appeared to ascend in a straight line, but it must have been a spiral, it's the only way i can explain its dissappearance and re-appearance higher and back to the left. neither it's speed, angle of ascent, or size seemed to change during the sighting. a third co-worker already in the field whom we immediately joined had not noticed the object and was completely unaware of it.\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was in my backyard with my 4 year old son watching the perseid meteor shower. he was excited to finally see a shooting star.  we were watching the sky and mostly due to light pollution i suspect, we had very few meteors visible-over the hour we watched together i only saw 5 and my son missed 2 of them and witnessed only 3.  luckily, being 4 years old that was excitement enough for him.  i had planned to allow my son to watch for 30-60 minutes starting at 10 pm as this was way past his bedtime and we made a special occasion out of it.  my wife was tired and went to bed at about 10:15 after seeing nothing for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nmy son and i were carefully searching the skies for the perseid show and were spending an extended period of time doing it.  had i not been paying such close attention, i likely would have missed what has instantly become  the strangest thing i have ever seen.  my son saw it as well, but i downplayed it's significance to him due to his young age and not wanting to scare him.  \r\n\r\nat about 10:30 i noted what i thought was a star in the sky just like any other except that it seemed to be twinkling more than other stars so i kept my eye on it.  i then realized that it wasn't just twinkling, but actually moving.  it was moving in a way that immediately made me realize it was not a typical fixed wing or rotor aircraft.  at first i took the light to be a very distant object at extreme altitude that was moving perhaps greater distances and with less conventional motion, akin to old videos i have seen on television when people used to watch form the \"black mailbox\" at area 51, although less dramatic.  fascinated, i pointed it out to my son, who also was able to see \"that moving thing\" and then as we watched it together i realized that there were 2 more lights below the one that i was looking at that were intermittently visible and had a reddish hue, very dim.  the light i noticed at first was more of a white light that at times twinkled red or blue like a star can do, which is anther reason i at first mistook it for a star.  connecting the dots i realized i was not looking at a craft at extreme altitude represented by a single point of light but rather a triangular craft that had a light on the front and was pointing toward me, perhaps with the nose angled up somewhat, and that this made the 2 lights at what i took to be the back of the craft sometimes visible to me and sometimes not from my vantage point in my yard.  this craft was really close to my house in a very densely populated area so i was surprised that it would just sit there.\r\n\r\nbut sit there it did, for at least 90 more minutes.  i put my son to bed and went back outside to watch it and took some audio notes i recorded then attempted to take video and photos with my cellphone then video and photos with my 10 mp point and shoot camera.  given how dark it was i ended up going and getting a tripod and mounting the point and shoot to take long night mode exposures as otherwise i knew with the equipment i had on hand there would be nothing visible in the images at all.  i will not attach the images here as even after cleaning up on my computer this object is barely visible due to the black on black and dim lighting.  if mufon wants the images they can contact me and maybe they will have some tricks i don't to bring out more detail, but as i know where to look in the photos i can still see the outline of the craft in them.\r\n\r\nthe motion of the craft was a hovering, at times nearly motionless, at others sort of what i can only describe as sloppy.  the craft was utterly silent.  based on a visual observation of an occasional faint purple-blue/black plasma like haze misting over the bottom and edges of the craft, i had the impression it was airborne via some type of field it generated.  this was enhanced by the strange manner in which it hovered which was unlike a helicopter and more akin to a blimp but clearly not a blimp either.  the craft at times seemed to struggle to stay in one place as if it were balancing on top of a sphere and occasionally lost it's balance and had to hustle to get back to the perfect center.  this gave me the impression that whoever the pilot was was an amateur.  strange, i know-i expected to assume that the craft was other worldly but my impression was that it was man-made with technology we haven't yet mastered based on what i witnessed in the motion of this craft which was far less precise than what i would have imagined would be the result of an extra-terrestrial race's efforts but maybe i assume too much.  at times the movement seemed like a kite on a string in the wind or perhaps a bobbing balloon.  it just sat there in the sky while i watched and i had the impression it was up there to watch the meteor shower too (another strange impression that made me think it was piloted by a human).  the object was able to move in any direction with equal ease it seemed.  at times it tilted, raised, lowered, scooted forward, scooted straight backwards, all with equal but imperfect dexterity.  at one point it seemed to move a bit out of the way of a passing plane which made me wonder what the pilot of the plane thought or if they saw it at all.  90 minutes after i started watching it almost exactly at midnight cloud cover rolled in and obscured my view of it and since i had to be up early the next morning i went to bed.  i did not witness it's arrival or departure and it stayed in a very small area in the sky throughout my period of observation.\r\n\r\nother details of the appearance of this craft include that the triangle was not 3 even sides.  it was a rather sharp triangle like a slice of pizza (though not curved in what i assume is the aft part of the craft).  it lacked a central light or lights around the edges.  only the light in front and the dimmer lights in the rear.  i saw 2 lights in the rear portion at most times but occasionally the nose would tip up enough that i had the suggestion of perhaps more lights on the back as well that perhaps i could have seen from another angle.  it was matte black on all visible portions as far as i could tell but the craft was at some distance from me which i will try and give details about below.  it seemed to be thin from top to bottom which gave it a nearly 2 dimensional quality, like a puppeteer had a paper plane on strings from above.  while watching this object i went on the mufon site and noted another report of the object i was witnessing from my area earlier the same night with the only difference being 5 lights in the back while traveling.  i suspect i witnessed the same craft or one identical to it, as to why it essentially parked over my house i have no idea except as i noted above.\r\n\r\ni live in a busy air travel corridor and many aircraft were in the vicinity of this object and most seemed to be flying below it, which was one clue to the object's altitude.  another was the fact that the clouds obscured it when they rolled in, so if someone had data on the altitude of those clouds we could say it was at least that high up.  similarly, with how long it was there, somebody had to have radar hits on this thing.  there are many local airports both ga and commercial in my area and the airspace is tightly controlled.  i suspect it would not be too difficult to get radar data for the area at the time if you knew the right people.  i don't.  but i witnessed both airplanes and clouds under it so it was fairly high up.  \r\n\r\nthe object's size is tough to say, except that it was clearly quite large given how high up it must have been.  i have some photos with my roofline that could be used to judge scale if nobody can find radar data on this thing.  with my arm outstretched and thumb extended looking along my arm to it, it went from the tip of my thumb past the first knuckle somewhat.  it sounds cliche but it could have been as long as a football field.  \r\n\r\nin my excitement when i first was noticing the object i started looking around to see if there were more since it was essentially hiding in plain view in the sky.  of course i connected all possible stars into triangles and thought i may have noted others but quickly realized i could confirm only 1 craft was present.  however, i am absolutely certain of what i saw.  i watched it nonstop except to put my son to bed and grab camera equipment in my home for about 90 minutes total until the clouds rolled in.  it was a physically present object that occluded stars when it moved in front of them and was itself occluded by things passing underneath.  \r\n\r\nit moved in ways utterly unlike any aircraft i am aware of and it was too high in altitude and too large to be an object tethered to the ground.  it seemed to be on some type of slippery surface that it had to balance on just right to hover motionless or else sudden clumsy adjustments had to be made to maintain its position, and it seemed to bob a bit like a cork on the ocean.  it is an experience i will certainly never forget and i would be willing to discuss it with mufon investigators if they were so inclined.  otherwise i hope this detailed description helps somebody get to the bottom of what this thing was.  \r\n\r\nthere are many things i am certain it wasn't.  it is to me in the truest sense of the term unidentified.  a google search of photos of black triangle aircraft seemed to demonstrate that what i saw was less common than many other descriptions/photos out there but it has been seen before.  \r\n\r\ni am not sure what significance this has but what will last with me is how this thing was nearly cloaked over my house for such a long period of time motionless in the sky and i could have so easily overlooked it, yet once i saw where it was it seemed like such a bad place for it to be if it wanted to remain hidden or discreet or specifically wanted to avoid being seen by eyewitnesses.  it was almost as if it was trying to see how many people would take note if it sat there for hours... or maybe it's pilot just didn't care either way at all.  i will certainly study the nightly stars much closer from now on as for all i know this could have been there every night and i might never have noticed it.  but now that i know what to look for i suspect i could pick it up more quickly and will file another report if i am lucky enough to spot it again.

only things in the sky. my family and i went to a state park in sumter, south carolina to be secluded and watch the falling rocks but ended up watching something so much more. i am contacting mufon due to the fact i am not doubting what we saw could have been military, since an air force base is so close. the maneuverability of the aircrafts we watched was jaw dropping. \r\nat 2201 while lying in a field watching and waiting for meteors to streak across the clear sky, my wife noticed a blue-ish white light moving extremely high up in the sky. as it was entering the center of our field of view, another ���������aircraft��������� approached it from the opposite direction. they were tiny specks of light traveling quite a distance that we knew they were not meteors. as they reached one another, both stopped and the one from the left emitted a very bright light before dimming and becoming less obvious. both moved off in the directions they were originally traveling  at the same speed as before and vanished behind the clouds. moments later, a closer, but still far-off jet of some sort blinking white lights trekked across the sky before splitting into two aircraft, followed by a third. the first two began doing aerial acrobatics like you would see at an air show ��������� at one point crisscrossing one another at dangerously close intervals. this is where we saw the first parts of their amazing maneuverability such as their ability to fly in acute angles at such increased velocity, as one made a sharp v and headed in a different direction. while these two were playing, the third appeared to start giving chase before joining as part of the group. we noticed as they increased speed, their lights would blink faster and faster until they were nothing but a blur, such as a meteor with no tail. when they slowed, their white lights blinked less and turned to three red lights at a slight pause before they resumed flying right, circling to left and dropping to the v at a lower altitude. they did this many times. \r\nprior to seeing them, we had noticed numerous airplanes (regular ones). at approximately 2200, it seemed the area became a no-fly zone, until approximately 2235 when an airplane entered from the left, at which time, the unknown aircraft proceeded to flee the area, reappearing at a lower altitude, when the airplane had passed. they resumed their ���������acrobatics��������� for another approximately 15 minutes before leaving. these three aircraft made a loud, deep, growling engine noise��������� deeper than any combat aircraft i have encountered in my 5 years of service as an infantryman. i am unsure about what type of aircrafts these may have been, but i did see similar aircraft, to the first we witnessed, at extreme altitudes 56 miles away at my home in lexington, sc the night before. they appeared as dots in the sky with one brightening then separating, going in different directions, covering distances that would baffle you. i believe in reverse engineering that is kept from the public by the military. it is my belief these aircraft could possibly be proof of such. \r\n\r\n[witness name
