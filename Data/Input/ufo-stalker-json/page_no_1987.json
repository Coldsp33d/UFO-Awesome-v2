balcony looking at the sky in hope to see a meteor. the date was 13th of august 2010 (according to the news the peek of meteor shower).\r\nthe sky was clear with some thick storm clouds on the horizon to the west and lighter clouds closer to me west. \r\nafter a few moments of gazing up i saw a group of four lights fly westward and disappearing behind clouds.\r\nthe lights were orange-red color, not bright and not points but more like small circles (something like small discs of red-hot metal..Even the color). at first they were in a square shape (like number 4 on a dice) 1 forward, 2 in the middle and 1 back. as they moved the shape became more elongated. it was night so i didn't see an actual object these lights belonged to, but if you draw four circles on a piece of paper and look at them from different angles you will get the idea of the thing i saw. \r\nthe lights were very close together, all 4 in the area moon covers on the sky. when i saw them they were at nw, elevation about 60-70 degrees. they were flying in a strait line roughly from ene to wsw. it all lasted for 2-3 seconds. i don't know how high they were, but they were very fast. there was no sound i could relate to this.\r\nmy opinion is this a flying object with four engines on the more or less flat lower part that flew strait but did a rolling movement to the left. it didn't make any sound so it was either very high and in that case inhumanly fast and inhumanly big, or very low and in that case inhumanly silent and still very very very fast. i think it was not very high.\r\nmy first impression was that it was some projection from land because it looked a bit like that red laser dot used for indication during presentations.\r\ni called my mother but it was long gone by the time she came to the balcony. it is possible that some other people saw this because it was announced in the newspapers that there will be a meteor shower so many romantic eyes must have been pointed upwards that night.\r\ni felt happy i saw something strange.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:03","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

(venus, mars, saturn). so i saw 3 bright lights to the east and assumed it was the planets. i watched them while i was walking and noticed that the lights were in fact quite close to me. i tried to figure it out and realized that the lights were hovering over a nearby gas station. they then proceeded to move above my head and beyond the trees. no sound was made from the craft. i feel like the craft was quite large (about the size of the gas station). as it passed over my head, it was also rotating. the rotation was quite slow, not even completing a full revolution before it passed beyond my view. despite seeing this, i still don't believe in aliens. but i remember thinking that i should not be seeing the object at all, because of my strong belief that extraterrestrials don't exist. i tried to rationalize it by thinking it may have been 3 airplanes in a close formation. however, stars were blocked out in the middle of the assumed formation, which led me to believe it was a ufo. upon some research, it would appear that this \"black triangle\" ufo is a common sight. however, most sightings include a large light in the center of the object. this is not the case in my

and to slow. i ran in to get my dad when by the time we got there it was but a faint red dot. the object orginated at about '13 hours right acension' or in the south west it then moved whilst fading towards the north and fully faded at about '10 hours right ascention' or in the west moving from 'hercules' towards 'ursa major'. after it reached the '10 hour mark' it then began to in short move

was it could not have faded to such a dim magnitude. it was an exhilerating experience i had to get as many people to see it as possible. after about 3 minutes of flying about the '10 hour mark and 30

my right hand side as the motorway bent to the left. from what i could see, the light was much brighter than any star and about ��� to 1 mile away. i could estimate this because of the way it changed position in relation to the moving car. the height must have been somewhere between 400 to 1000 feet in the air. after we had observed it for several minutes we lost sight of it behind us. i quizzed my partner as to what it looked like and she agreed that it was a very bright star like object orange in colour. she then went on to say that it was like a cross or had spikes coming off it. it was hard to say whether these were physical spikes or just the way the light looked. i have also seen recent reports from a similar area (carlisle) on the ufo-uk site describing orange objects with three spikes coming off them.\r\nif anyone else has seen this object in the area or elsewhere then please reply to this post. my partner found it impossible to give a rational explanation of the object as

were watching a jet airliner which had recently taken off from gold coast airport on a northerly heading (possibly 3000 feet altitude). we suddenly noticed something following behind the aircraft on the starboard side, at about a 45 degree angle from the aircraft, about 200 meters away (large passenger aircraft never follow this closely), and travelling at the same rate of speed. we could not identify the aircraft following because it didn't have any wings, a tail plane or flashing lights. it was oval/cigar shaped and it was shiny like a mirror. the jet airliner flew into a small cloud and then reappeared out of the otherside  continuing on its path. the unidentified aircraft flew into the small cloud and disappeared, but did not appear out of the otherside of the cloud. this event happened over a period of about 30 seconds and we couldn't understand what we were seeing. unfortunately we didn't have a camera available to take photos.\r\ni am a commercial helicopter pilot and quite familiar with aircraft laws, rules and protocol. the following craft we could not identify as any type of conventional aircraft.

velocity (speed).  within a few minutes, i seen it reappear to the left (west), move for a short duration in a straight line (east) and then appeared to move upwards into a cloud and disappear. it did not curve into the ascent but appeared to just rise upwards at a right angle.  it's speed did not change. it did not re-appear in the fifteen minutes i watched after that.  \r\n\r\ni could not tell

seen this flashing red, blue, green object in the sky around 11:p.M.  upon closer examination i noticed that it took the form of a triangle which was surrounded by the lights mentioned above.  i took pictures of the object.\r\n\r\nthe next night, i took a video of the object and then noticed that in the sky it looked like it stood in one place but when i looked into the camera lense, the object began bouncing around like a ping pong ball.  i managed to capture pictures and videos of it.\r\n\r\ni remember feeling very curious to know what that orb was and to this day as i still see it every night.  i never lost sight of it yet, it is still here.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":25053,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.868509,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-08102010-0006","longitude":-97.259867,"occurred":1281337200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

curtains not drawn i suddenly saw what appeared to be about 9 large round orb lights slowly passing in the night sky, just above horizon level - they were moving in a \"v\" formation.  i was so stunned - i jumped up and ran through the hall shouting to my partner don to come and take a look - he rushed out with me to the sun room and they were still visible, we went out of the back door and watched - we could hear no noise, saw no flashing lights (it was a very still night - we live in a remote part of west wales).  the lights moved to a single file formation and simply disappeared, one after another - maybe into cloud, but there was no moon, so it was difficult to see if there were any cloud formations.   since this happened i have been trying to research what we saw, and am surprised to find that there have been other similar sightings.   i would just like an explanation.  it may well be that the military have secret craft that they take up and test - but i do not believe this was so.  i still cannot stop thinking about it!! unfortunately, i did not think of grabbing my camera - i would have had more than enough time to have taken photos.","distance":"501 Feet
