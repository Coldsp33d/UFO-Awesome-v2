the cloud.   it was in the cloud maybe thirty or forty seconds,  then came out at the same position along side of the cloud.    it stayed there for for over a minute,  then moved off around the noth

from a kc-135. the 190th air refuling wing (the kansas coyotes) opperates out of forbes feild about 7 miles north of here so air trafic is very common over here, mostly kc-135s and other military

taking\r\noff from a hover position, they appear like a shooting star, with a trail of flame behind them. some nights you can't see them with the naked eye,\r\nbut upon taking pics with a flash they appear anywhere's from 1 to many\r\nround spherical objects, other times you can see what appears to be different abject shaped objects lit any of many colors ranging from red,green, orange, yellow,

have possibly seen things that may be secret machinery unknown to the general public. they make absolutely no sounds most of the time, and other times you can hear what sounds like a bunch of jets hovering a long ways up. most objects appear to be anywheres from 200 to several thousand feet up. some even as high as the stars. and they're not satellites, you can tell the difference, satellites move usually in one direction across the sky. one night i watched as one of these objects chased a jet. they\r\nblock out the stars when they are overhead and sometimes move very quickly.\r\na couple of times i've seen what appeared to be a star, and then it got brighter and brighter and actually lit me up.When i looked up it dimmed slowly and flew slowly away towards the north/northeast. in many

northfield, vermont. we were sitting around a bon fire when someone noticed this object coming from south to north. i was in the treeline when it was first noticed and i ran out to the field near the bon fire to take a look.\r\n\r\nthere was 9 of us there that night and we all saw this object.\r\n\r\nit flew from south to north and covered the entire skyline in 45 -60 seconds.\r\nthe object did not make any sound. planes fly over bonehill all the time but we can hear them. this did not make a peep. \r\n\r\nthe object was very bright and appeared fairly large in the sky. it was moving very fast and i have never seen anything move that fast.\r\n\r\nthe object flew right over us but it was appeared to be very high in the sky.\r\nbeing at night i really have no clue how far up it was but it seemed very high as we could not hear anything.\r\n\r\nit was a incredibly clear night sky and all of the stars were visible.\r\n\r\nthere were some shooting stars that night but this was no shooting star.\r\n\r\nbecause it was such a clear night we were able to see satellites in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe object we saw was at least 1o times larger and brighter then any satellite i have ever seen.\r\n\r\nafter it flew over us it continued north and we were watching its backside. it had blinking lights on it(i think 2 blinking lights). after it went out of sight i went back into the treeline where we were playing cards.\r\n\r\nabout a minute later some of my friends saw it again and it was traveling from west to east. this time when i ran out i did not get to see it as it was over the hill already. but my friends claims it looked like what we had seen just earlier.\r\n\r\ni am not sure what it was to be honest. i know alot about ufo's and military aircraft. in my life i have never seen a ufo. every time i have looked up in the sky at some weird object i have been able to identify it.\r\n\r\nthis was some sort of aircraft for sure but it was no commercial airliner or anything like that. i also work next to an air national guard base in burlington, vermont. i see military aircraft take off and land all of the time. this object appeared to fly much higher and made no sound. f-16s and f-15 make a ton of sound.\r\n\r\nimo this had to either be a new military spy plane or something even more bizarre.\r\n\r\nas it flew over head my friends scrambled for their cell phones to take photos and/or video. i have not seen any of this yet but i am hoping there is something

(.Psd) file format. once in photoshop, open the \"layers\" window (f7) and click on the eye to expose/hide guides and layers. i also highly suggest zooming way in on the objects, and adjusting such settings as: brightness/contrast, levels, and curves, to get an idea of the objects' shape, size and possible distance from viewer. after i zoomed in very close, i noticed that in each of the photographs, the objects have similar characteristics, such as size and shape. this is especially obvious and apparent since the objects take up only a few pixels. the best example of this is noticed in ���duel lightning strike���, which is the photograph that has two simultaneous lightning strikes, specifically, the object in the vicinity of the lightning strike on the left hand side of the screen. when viewed at an extreme zoom, there is a distinct, almost diamond shape to the pixels, especially during/after adjusting the various brightness and contrast levels. it is curious that the most distinctive feature that all the objects in each photo share, is the very blackness of what i will refer to as ���the core��� of the objects. the objects closest to the lightning strikes reveal an outline to this core. this could be attributed to many things; my guess is light diffraction. in the next lightning photo (���single strike���) the viewer may note that there is also an object in close proximity (at least from the viewer���s angle) to the lightning strike, and it too seems to have what appears to be an outline of the center of the object. the photo, or should i says photos, that convinced me that these objects were more than ���specks of dust on the lens��� or ���birds/insects���, is the 3 frame sequence. when i overlapped the three frames and marked the positions of the objects in each frame, i noticed one thing right away: some objects are in the same position in two of the three frames (these objects appear to be stationary for at least two frames). and i mean absolutely the same position ��� what i might speculate to be a generator/drive with perfect anti-grav/hover

property i had just sold. i was thinking about how i would have liked to have kept my lot but was buying out a partner on another house. i saw a flash of bright light and thought it was a plane crashing into the mountaintop where i was. i realized it was a series of glowing cylinders that was covered in a mist individually. the total area was twice the size of a house. the sound it made was a roar like niagara falls almost deafening even inside my truck. \r\ntheir was another craft that was entering the 'doorway' it was gold/brown/yellowish and reminded me of a broken mirror. the craft was shaped like a rugby football. i only saw the front half of the 2nd craft i believe from the reflective light of the first craft. the 2nd craft appeared to be floating and as it entered the doorway they both disappeared. the craft was directly in front of a former astronaut's house which i thought was an incredible coincedence. i asked him about it later and he said he did not know what i was talking about but showed no surprize, amazement, or suspicion which i thought was a very odd reaction to the wildest story he ever heard.\r\ni had been selling the lot and their were two dogs that barked at me constantly. but they were not barking then and i got out of my truck because i expected people to come outside to see what the commotion had been about but no one came outside and i am absolutly sure people would of came outside to see what the roar was about. there were about about 10 homes in visual sight. i think the dogs and people were put to sleep and the aluminim storage container made a barrier to keep me conscious.\r\ni have seen 3 other craft in the area. 2 sightings were a green glowing ball of light floating at sunset along the mountain tops. 1 was a flash of light in a  figure 8 shape 10 pm when i was playing basketball in the dark.\r\nthat only lasted 1 second but enough to see it slide as it tuned like it was on wet plastic.\r\ni have heard other stories of sightings in the area and believe it is a portal doorway to another place.  a pilot told me of some very unusual experiences he had but do not want \"you know who\" to question me because i believe they are very aware of this area. i did see an description on a discovery in the egyptian pyrmids that remined me of this doorway and she described it as a symbol for a doorway into another

child like foot steps with shoes on. at the time my 2 year old daughter was in her crib sleeping which was located in the rear end of the apartment and our bedroom was located in the front. i had my back toward the back of the the apartment. as i continued to hear these steps walking back and forth i was thinking that it could not be the baby because she could not clime out of the crib, much less put her shoes on and walk around the apartment.\r\nby now i was starting to worry because i couldn't  figure out what the hell was going  on, all i know is that i could hear the steps walk up behind me then turn around and walk away again. on about the third time i heard the steps come up to me and spotted. within a few seconds i heard the voice of a young female tell me in spanish, \"roberto don't be afraid we are good spirits.\" at that point i panicked and tried to turn around to see what was going on but some kind of force was preventing me from turning around. i was scared but i was determined to see what was behind me.\r\nas i continued to struggled with all my strength i was able to look behind me and i saw what appeared to be two translucent spheres purplish in color havering over me. now my fear turned to terror and i tried to turn around so i could reach out to my wife but again i was struggling with this invisible force.\r\nafter what it seemed to be about 10 to 15 minutes, i was able to wake up my wife who got scared after i explained what had taken place. i then grabbed my kid and my wife and ran upstairs where my mom lived.\r\nalthough they identified themselves as spirits, i believe that i was visited by aliens because when  the voice spoke it was in spanish, and my primary language is english. i also remember that i went to bed 1am, and when we went to my moms it was 3am. and i strongly believe that something has watched over me for most of my life.\r\ni even have a foreign object in my had which is suppose to be the tip of a pencil and from

about a 100 feet from me and could of been more than 200 feet up. as this aircraft approach me i could see the plans coming after it and with the and helicopter sounds i noticed when it was close to me it didn't make any sound and it went from comming my was to a perfect left at about 30mph and at that point i went to get my camera it went behind the trees by my house and as i was trying to get a picture it made another perfect sharp left turn, it went about 200 yards and than it vanished.  the strang part was all the aircraft that night that seem to be chasing it because i am outside at night and never aircraft at all, let alone 4 or 5 that i heard and saw that night.  for whatever reason i was able to get my camera to focus to take a picture, i have one of the best cameras you can buy so

in the state of arizona facing the desert. i would usually get migraines after the event, and once i lost time ( i was sitting indian style on my couch after a sighting around 10 pm and apparently passed out, only to awaken sitting upright, indian style on my couch many hours later at 4:oo am.)\r\nonce i had awoken and my hair was such a mess, full of static and just so all over the place, that it has never been before nor since that day. i would also have dreams of flying inside my apartment and outside my apartment up into the sky.\r\ni will describe the different types of sightings below.\r\n1. i saw red orb like objects flying high up in the sky that would hover at times and then suddenly accelerate away from each other. there were maybe two others blinking below them and they all seemed to be communicating with eachother.\r\n2. i saw a silent, hovering rectangular type craft above me that had a series of green and red lights that beamed crisscross, and then i heard what sounded like a strong wind and just above my head coming in the opposite direction was a triangular craft that looked like dull metal, and it glided over my head and glided over the desert moving away from me for quite a while. it has 3 blinking lights.\r\n3. my last sighting was a series of approaching star like objects that would stop in midair and illuminate more and more intensely, that it was very beautiful and i felt as though they were communicating specifically to me. there were 3 consecutive lights like this until they disappeared out of my viewing range behind my balcony.\r\n after the last sighting i had moved away from arizona and have since then not seen anything in the sky again. i truly miss my sightings very much and my feeling towards them is very benevolent.\r\ni did report my sightings to the arizona republic newspaper each time.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

bright light just to the left of the ridge. at first i thought it might be venus, and i was going to get my telescope. as i watched the light it was moving to the right towards the ridge. but it did not follow the same path as the other stars in the sky. i watched for about two minutes, then i decided to climb up on my porch roof to bet a better view. as i did this the light rolled behind the ridge, but i could still see the light of the object. i climbed down and looked back to the ridge i saw the light roll back over the ridge towards me. i watched for about a minute and the object shot over the ridge and out of sight. from that point i could not see the light from the craft any longer. as i watched this object i thought as it moved this is no star or planet, its not a plane or helicopter. as it was dark and about 60 degrees i heard no noise of engines or rotors.","distance":"Over One
