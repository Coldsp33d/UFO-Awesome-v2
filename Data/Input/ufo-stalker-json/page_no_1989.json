part of the evenings sitting back and looking at the stars and watching for satellites.  at around 10:30 pm, a disc like object with a blue light in the center of the objects bottom side passed over.  the blue light was brilliant like that of a blue l.E.D.  the bottom of the object had a feint glow on it from the blue light.  the object moved a high rate of speed in comparison to all the aircraft we normally see pass over...Around 2x to 3x the speed of the average jet liner.  the object was still visible after approximately 1-2 miles away after it had passed over.  we were charged with excitement and while discussing what we had seen, someone noticed another one on the same path, this one was different, more blueish green in color and moving the same speed.  to describe this object i would say that it looked like a long string of glow sticks, imagine this string of glow sticks being on something like a bungee, whipping in a circular motion from front to back and then back to front in the direction that it was traveling.  this one was much more shocking to witness than the first...Then in about the same amount of time that it took for the first one to go out of sight and the second to become visible, the third came into view.  the third was very similar to the first, same speed, same blue light and flying flat and straight...Now i did forget to mention before, there was absolutely no sound what-so-ever.  with each pass we expected to hear the sounds of a jet engine, but nothing at all.  the silence was especially surprising, considering the speed at which the objects were moving.  there was a very slight breeze in the opposite directing that the objects were moving.  one of the gals in the group went inside here home and looked on the net to see if anyone else had reported anything and found that something that matched our description had been spotted the night before in another state and again in the previous month in new york.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

faster than we had ever seen anything move before. we immediately began trying to follow it and did succeed in following it to another open area by a shopping center. it seemed like it knew we were following it because it would slow down at times and we would \"catch up\" with it. this time it was closer to the ground and even though the sky had become darker, we got a better look at it. it was dark gray in color and shaped like a rounded chevron at times and at other angles it appeared to be a rounded triangle. we were trying to figure out if it could be an aircraft that was being tested by someone at ft knox, but after watching it move and hover a while vertically and horizontally we began to consider that it might be a ufo. after watching it for a few minutes, i began to feel very eery, like i was being watched and that someone or something was trying to assess what i was thinking. we rolled down the windows to see if we could hear anything but it seemed to emit no sound, the hairs on my arm began to stand up and i began to be fearful and began to quietly pray. as i prayed \"god please watch over us and keep us safe\" the object moved vertically and then sped off horizontally in a southward direction from louisville. immediately thereafter we saw three military jets fly over in formation in the direction of the object. i have never forgotten this incident and i never spoke with my boyfriend about it again. in fact he seemed so skittish about it that once it flew away he began talking about other things as if it never happened.\r\ni have only told this story to about 3 people as i didn't want someone to think i was nuts.

object that seemed to be high in the sky west of me. i used a building that was 3 blocks north west of my position as a point of reference. i thought the object was a star or planet at first because it was stationary, but it sparked my interest because it was pulsating with red blue and white lights like that of an airplane in the night sky, except that instead of flashes the lights seemed to revolving like a lighthouse beacon. i kind of made a mental note of this objects position and drew an imaginary line from the object that was at a very high altitude and the building underneath it. i went to call my wife so that she could come and take a look at it. we watched it together for about 30 minutes and my wife who was standing to my right said that it seemed to move right slightly. it didnt seem that way to me.\r\nthen after 30 minutes my wife went back inside and i decided to stay and continue watching. i had been standing this whole time and decided to sit down on the floor of the balcony. i had watched for about 2 minutes and then it seemed to move slightly right, so i stood and noticed that the object was indeed moving right and dropping altitude very slowly until it seemed parallel to the top point of the building's north side. it hovered there for about 2 minutes then disappeared out of sight. i called my wife back out to show her that it was definitely not a star or planet because of how rapidly it moved after being perfectly stationary for such along time. she was shocked because we had kind of assumed it was a star until it disappeared in the clear night sky.  we tried to reason that it was helicopter but the object seemed to hovering at 50000 feet because it looked much higher then the airplanes that are visible at 35-38000 feet. im not familiar with all types of air craft but i had heard that helicopters dont really fly at super high altitudes. then we thought it was a hot air balloon with lights, but then we dismissed that because of how perfectly still it was for half an hour, beside the fact that somebody up there would need an oxygen tank for breathing at that altitude. at this point we were out of ideas and my wife went back inside. i stayed outside a while longer and scanned the sky hoping to see it pop up again but it didnt at which point i decided to look in the eastern direction. i then noticed the flashing blue light of an airplane and watched for a few seconds as it moved slowly across the sky. my view was perpendicular to its path. after watching it for a minute i saw an object that moved at an incredible speed east of my position but also gaining altitude as it crossed the path of the air plane which was flying south east at a lower altitude. it was a thick streak of bright powder blue that narrowed at the point furthest from me. it lasted a fraction of a second, at which point i got freaked out and went inside. because of its color i tried to argue to myself that it could have been lightning but i have never seen horizontal powder blue triangular shaped lightning on a clear night.

fireworks show at the oak mountian amp.Theater.Its a large show with 2 other locations doing the same thing at the same to a radio broadcast. it was ling after the show around 10:30pm when i decided to ask my friend if its ok to smoke a cig in his car.As i crack the window i notice in the front right of the windshield that there's an orange glowing object above the mountian and as i look at my friend i tell him hay check it out.He looks at me and says oh thats just the reflection of your cig in the windshield and then i proceed to throw my cig out and tell him to look now.In amazement he decides to pull over and we get out of the car and watch as this thing as best as i can describe begins to acsend and decend and also move from right to left 200 to 300 feet above the mountian pulsating. then it begins to change shapes from teardrop to oval to well as i can best describe it looked like the oil in a lava lamp.Almost like it was on fire but not.Like it was splitting and reconnecting back together glowing the same color as a sunset. to say the least it was breathtaking.So as o try to come to terms with what happened \"come out of shock\" the object begins to ascend to about 500 feet and then vanashes.But like it was in slow motion in the same spot in the sky and faded like when a candle burns itself out.It seems like it took forever.So we take our friends to the meeting place to drop them off and then we head back towards hwy 280 when my friend notices before me that that object is on the other side of the county road in a field doing the same lava lamp thing it was before but just above groung level maybe 15feet from the ground and as he tries to pull over it dissappears but not like before it was quick like snap of a finger gone.When we got to my parents home in indian springs (about 10 or 12 miles away)and began to tell my mother and father what had happened.And in doing so my mother had mentioned she had seen something in the 60's in the sky here that made the news but it was reported to be a weather baloon over birmingham.She had given a very similar discription of what she saw so i was wondering if anybody in this area saw the same thing.Or maybe someone has seen the same thing or has footage or photos of the object that would help me prove me and my friend are not crazy!!!!Thanx for reading  ","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

where this thing was so i could get some good pictures. it was  8 to 10 miles away, but clearly visible from the top of the hill where we were. the object was in front of another hill which was across from the hill we were on. we drove down the hill, but there were trees all along the road blocking our view. we took another road to see if we could see it clearer but we couldn't find it afterwards. he is still trying to come up with a logical explanation but i know this object clearly resembled what my mother and i saw back in 1982","distance":"Over One

was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me. although there was no change in the light, i had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky. a few seconds later i saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool. \r\n     at first glance i thought it was some kid's silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of firm-surfaced metal. i focused in on it so i could remember as much detail as possible.  it was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed egg type shape. the top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a mento candy. there were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. it was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. i'm estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. i got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. there was absolutely no sound emitting from it. \r\n     after the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds i had the presence of mind to call out, \"look up!\" to my husband, who was doing some yardwork about 20 feet behind me and to the right. since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. his description of the disk corroborated mine. from the time i saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and i estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone. \r\n     immediately following this sighting i felt glad to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. then i started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on earth is a bit unsettling. from our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. i can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans. \r\n     we told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). we humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don't want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable.  and the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. so our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. i don't think our government could keep such technology a secret. even if they could, if we had it, we wouldn't be fighting wars to get oil because we would have a better propulsion system already. so what we saw was an object, that was flying and is unidentified...A ufo.","distance":"21-100

spot. the distance it moved was very short.\r\n\r\nafterward it moved across the sky a great distance. from where i originally saw it and headed east. it kind of wobbled in its flight path it was weird hard to describe. moved past another dark object in the sky, that had no illumination and continued on. it kind of looked like an eclipse. then it stopped for a few seconds, and then faded away like a shiny object sinking in murky water.\r\n\r\ni assumed it could have been a satellite. but i never heard of a satellite change direction so quickly and then disappear. possible asteroid? again not sure. the change in direction is the only thing making me consider intelligent guided craft. of course when i see something like this i don���t have a camera, binoculars, or my telescope handy. i did grab my binoculars afterwards and watched the sky for a further 20 minutes. but only one shooting star from a south to north direction was observed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

round at first and it reminded me of a broach made of mother of pearl with a silver border around it. i spotted it first with only my eyeglasses later i used my binoculars  it appeared to stand still for about a minute then it moved very slowly higher in the sky then it appeared to stop then it moved higher and to the west very slowly.  during it's movement to the west it changed shape to more of a cigar shape.  the light also became faintly colorful and appeared to vary the rainbow like colors from left to right.  after several minutes it returned to a round shape.  about a minute later it blinked out and although i continued to look i couldn't find it at all.  i was with my wife and she did not see it at all  but she has limited vision.  at about 5 after 8pm i was able to locate venus in the west and way north of the object i had sighted.  this sighting took place at my home on the front porch.  my wife and i sit in our rocking chairs and enjoy the fresh air and the sunset every evening.  we live near the airport and we enjoy watching the planes come in low as they head for the airport.  i was really wishing for somebody else to spot it as well.  but my neighbors were busy across the street trying to move a shed across the property.  i was not excited at first but after i thought about it i did get excited  my wife didn't appear to share my enthusiasm.  since it was so close to the airport i wonder if they picked it up on their instruments.
