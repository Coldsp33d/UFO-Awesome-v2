fertilize the front yard and i immediately look up to the southwest and see the exact same object i've seen 3 prior times in the exact same location of the sky, same altitude, flying the exact same compass heading (sw to ne), flying at the exact same slow speed (150 to 300mph)in the same hour of 10pm - 11pm and then just slowly disappear without a trace, in the exact same part of the sky after coming to a slow hover for a few seconds. each time the object appears to blindingly accelerate in dead silence at a 90 degree angle straight up until its no longer visible. the last time i saw the object was 07-04-17(last night around 10:10). i would guess each time that the object is roughly one mile from me at its closest approach as it slowly flies by on the exact same compass heading each time. object is bathed in a constant thick red glowing plasma that changes shape while the object is in motion. at one point i saw the plasma blow straight up around the edges of the object to reveal its shape and length which was flat or nearly flat on its bottom and maybe 100 feet from edge to edge. the plasma was too thick to see threw it though. object does not fly a laser straight path but instead slowly meanders in a somewhat straight line at changing slow speeds to its same predetermined hover spot before blindingly accelerating at 90 degrees. winds are always calm and visibility is nearly unlimited on 3 out of 4 sightings of this object. i knew i had time to run inside my house, based on where the object was in the sky at the time i saw it, and get my girlfriend out of the house for the last two sightings, so i did. that's all i know. lol","distance":"501 Feet - 1

aware of something moving off to my left in the sky. i turned my head to see 5 bright round objects in what i can only describe as a upside down tick formation. this formation was traveling from the north to the south very quickly. i became aware that right then it was dead quiet. not a sound. at first i wasn't sure what i was looking at. there was no reference for me to use. i observed this formation till it disappeared out of sight. it didn't deviate in direction or speed that was noticeable to me. i waited for a little while for the sounds of jet engines or some sound of propulsion but there was none. being ex military for many years, i'm well aware of what a jet fighter traveling at faster than sound leaves. there was no sound. no afterburners. the formation was far to close for that speed and at night, no navigation lights. the light of these \"orb\" like objects was visible from the front to the rear. no change in intensity. no rumble felt. just silent orb \r\nike objects

of my condo when my girlfriend and i noticed a large red glowing orb that was high in the sky over the downtown loop area of chicago. this was nowhere near the fireworks that were over lake michigan to the east, this was by itself in the sky over the downtown area where all the skyscrapers are. fireworks are not allowed anywhere in that area which is why this glowing orb caught our attention immediately. it appeared high in the sky out of no where and hovered and then descended down behind the buildings. by the time i got my camera out, i only was able to catch the last 35 seconds, but i witnessed the orb for roughly 2 min total. my balcony is approximately 4-5 miles from downtown so when you zoom in on the video and look at its size of the orb relative to the buildings you can tell this is a pretty large object. i see planes fly over on a daily basis and this was not a plane either. based on its size, its glowing nature, and  its location and behavior in the sky, i just can't explain what it is that i saw. both of who saw it, were quite startled and knew this wasn't normal.

9:30-9:45pm\r\nsighting; 7 \"lights\" total.  first group of 3, then a group of 2 followed by another group of 2. all lights were moving in a south to north direction.\r\ndescription of \"light\" : white-ish, constant luminosity with very minimal \"flickering\"\r\nweather conditions: mostly clear with partial clouds. according to recorded weather: wind speed: 1 mph (nne) max wind speed: 8 mph visibility: 10 miles\r\n\r\nwhile standing outside on corner of morell & wycoff streets  in new brunswick, a car coming down the street, pulled over & 2 young men jumped out, looking at the sky,  saying, \"are you seeing that?\" to one another.  there were fireworks going off (being the 4th) and i thought that was what they were seeing/talking about. then 1 young men pulled out his phone/camera & started recording. this made me curious, so i looked up and saw 3 \"lights\" in a triangle formation (but they did not appear to be 3 lights fixed to 1 object, you could tell they were separate objects flying thru the air.)\r\n\r\nthey were moving from south to north, (traveling in a direction opposite of the nne wind conditions that night) there was no sound coming from them. they were moving in a forward motion at a speed close to that of an aircraft. they eventually flew beyond our sight and/or behind the few clouds that were out that night. *one note- there was no wind that night. even the clouds above moved very slow, way slower than these objects were traveling.\r\n\r\nafter those 3 disappeared from our sight, the young man recording noticed 2 more lights, traveling at the same speed, same direction (going south to north but not in \"same\" exact location). they  originated in same spot in the sky as the first 3. and again, traveled at the same speed as first 3, traveled across the sky til out of sight and/or behind clouds.\r\n\r\nthen almost at  the same time those 2 disappeared, 2 more \"lights\" appeared in same spot in sky, traveled the same speed as the previous ones but these 2 \"lights\" did travel almost the same direction as the previous 2. again traveled across the sky in forward, \"propelled\" speed and disappeared out of sight and/or behind cloud cover.\r\n\r\nafter they disappeared, i went inside bar and mentioned this to the few people in there. i was inside for about 2 mins. when i decided to go back out for a look. looking around i did not see any of those same lights but i did see a steady \"red light\" in the sout/west horizon. upon seeing this red light \"staying in a fixed  spot for about a min. i asked 1 of the people in the bar to come out and take a look. the red light stayed in exact same spot, pretty much \"fixed\" but the light changed from red to white back to red again. by the time this other person came out, i pointed to the light in the sky, it was now red, and again, not moving & very fixed in the sky. then the  light moved forward at a slow rate, again changing from red to white, back to red. then stopped completely still in the sky. then it moved backward to the direction it came in, at the same rate of speed. then it moved behind a tree & house out of sight.\r\n\r\nthis last \"red/white\" light i can almost pretty say may have just been a drone. but those first 7 \"lights\" i do not think so due to the speed, height and characteristic ways that the \"flew\".

the southern sky south of yreka, california, during the fireworks display. \r\nat first it was thought to be a high-flying jet liner, but then it stopped and didn’t move. it was a neon green object that appeared to be round, but was to far away to discern its exact shape. after watching it for a minute or two, it began to make unnatural maneuvers un-like anything any of us had ever seen before (quick turns, and reversals of direction), then came back to its former spot and was stationary. it made these sorts of maneuvers three times during the fireworks display. \r\nafter the last maneuver, the object changed color, from green, to white and red. it was about the size of the largest visible star, and seemed to be flying in the upper atmosphere at about a 45-degree angle from where we stood. we commented to each other that it was probably watching the fireworks displays in yreka and lake siskiyou (a lake immediately west of mt. shasta).\r\nabout 30 seconds after the grand finale (10:10 p.M.) the object turned a bright red. it began moving slowly in a northwestward direction and we lost view of it as it passed behind a tree. emerging from the other side of the tree, the glowing red object began to pick up speed, and made an abrupt turn westward. it then darted from that position (still about a 45-degree angle), and in about two or three seconds disappeared over the mountains on the horizon. this occurred about 10:12 p.M.\r\nit was too fast and too high in the atmosphere to have been a drone. when it sped west over the horizon, it was at super-sonic speed, yet did not have a tail, or light trail behind it like meteors have. \r\ni contribute this in hopes that others may also have saw it, and captured it on their cell-phone cam. it was so distracting, we payed more attention to it than we did the fireworks show. if it caught our attention that much, others must have surely witnessed it also. i’m anxious to see if it makes the newspapers or local news channels. it was a life changing experience. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:21:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

as the grand finale began. i noticed a green sphere shaped craft descend from the clouds to my right. maybe about a mile away from us and about 500-1000 feet in the air. it hovered while pulsating from a lime green to a white green. it flew a little towards our direction and then stopped again and hovered. motionless. i have used drones before and this was by far to big to be a drone and hovered way to motionlessly. the odd thing about the incident was the military planes that were seemingly flying right in to the fireworks as they were being shot up in to the air. the fireworks were halted at one point for a couple minutes oddly as well just before the grand finale. during the finale the craft seemed to manouver a few times almost circling in a small area but with great speed and then coming to a dead stop to hover yet again. finally another plane made it's way towards the object in which then the object finally bolted off to the right and out of view after a minute. but before it was out of view i noticed to planes coming from the distance heading in the same direction of the object. i had never seen anything like that before. seemed like it was watching the fireworks and then when spotted by the planes it took off abruptly. was a very cool thing to see as well as interesting since there are no airbases around the town this event took place...I wanted to film it but was too afraid i would miss a second by grabbing my phone from my pocket. i'm hoping someone filmed it or has pictures.
