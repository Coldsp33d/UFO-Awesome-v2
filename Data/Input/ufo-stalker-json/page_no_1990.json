crazy.  anyway, back to the story, i was watching cmt and out the reflection of the ontario college of nurse building (oh, i have a picture too!!!), yes i do!  sorry, i'm so excited, holy ****.  uhm, i saw this massive triangular reflection, moving very very slow, too slow for an airplane, then i stood up, as i was already at my window and i saw the entire ufo pass right over my building, very slowly i got a great look at it and then realized, take a picture, and i got one only on my blackberry, but there's no way in hell i'm the only person who saw this.  i called 911 (twice, i was so friggen excited, they got pissed off).  anyway, i've always known they exist and now i'm really seeing the interaction and appearances represent those of us who already know the trust.  please, how vain to think we are the only ones here.  so, i watched it move and almost hover about 200 feet above the ground, closest i've ever been, ever to a ufo. oh my god. it's so exciting, really, trippy too, i was blinking, really trying to observe, just taking in this huge ass triangle floating effortlessly (no sound< none< not a sound, no propulsion engine at all, something that big and no sound.... wow, out of this world and they're here alright.  lol, sorry, rambling, uhm, the thing that was amazing about this one were the lights, and all 3 i have seen, all different, this one without a doubt the closest i've been to one yet ... although two psychics have both seen the first encounter with 45 minutes lost time as a possible abduction, i say cool to that if it happened, i have no recollection, but certainly lost time occured.  this one, was only 1 minute and i managed to get a picture on my blackberry, and when zoomed, yes i got a picture this time< for real.  uhm, back to the lights, they went straight across the one side, then a brilliant pattern, which played tricks on my mind it was like a circular ship then with triangles lighting up, then it looked triangular again, very shape shifting trippy eye work, but i know what i saw, it was that clear, and freakin low, low.  wow, who else saw this?  i haven't loaded the picture from my blackberry yet, but i will, you have

\"look, a white light!��� i immediately looked in the direction she was looking to see a white spherical star-like white flashing light darting around in an amazing and shocking way. we looked at each

i heard my mom say \"oh my god, one of them just shot off so fast, it almost left a trail of light!\" and just as quickly, it returned again.  very strange. but if that wasn't strange enough, things got weirder.  i couldn't get pictures because the backlight on the camera was too bright in the pitch dark and prevented me from seeing the objects.  we continued to watch until a plane came through

town and making our way to his van, something in the far eastern sky caught my brother���s eye. after pointing it out to us, we fixed our eyes on it as well and immediately tried to figure out what the thing was. the object had an orange color to it, no visible blinking lights, and flickered like a flame. by using a telephone pole as a marker, we could track its movement pattern, which changed directions from left to right, almost as if it were being effected by wind, except that it was moving in straight lines. at first we thought it was something attached to a balloon, until we noticed that it became perfectly stationary more than once. any movement it made was very gradual and calculated, but it was definitely traveling. we noticed it was neither getting further away or closer to us and only traveled a very small distance up and to the right from where we originally marked it with the telephone pole.\r\n\r\nwe were watching this thing for a good 5 or 10 minutes, still clueless as to what it could be, when all of the sudden the object disappeared in a lightning-like white flash, followed by a loud boom that echoed off the mountains behind us in the far distance. the only explanations we could come up with were a) it was a craft of some kind that took off at such a high rate of speed that it created that loud boom, or b) it was an explosion of some sort. what we can���t figure out about the explosion theory, however, is the white flash. a firework, perhaps? the only problem with that, though, is that fireworks always have a visible flame or spark. this thing was just a pure white flash of light with no visible flames, sparks or smoke. it was just gone.\r\n\r\nanyone else who may have seen this that night is welcome to e-mail me @ \r\n*(wit's email address

from below or above them...There were no beams of light\r\ncoming from the ground to where they were floating. they were suspended in\r\nmid-air, and like i said were literally no more than 10 feet

try to connect it with anything real. ghosts, aliens, angels...I don't know what they were, but they did not look or act anything like these things. after a couple minutes they just vanished...Literally winked out of existence. they seemed very benevolent yet very foreign, but the three of us felt like we weren't in danger. i just wanted to report it to you guys and wanted some

from the time we left the power lines until we saw the orb. was about 2miles deeper into the woods. i knew and i was right it was just a matter of time and it is still going on out there, you can not just look at the sky you have to look at the ground and you can see the signs there everywhere. thank you for you'r time in this matter. we do know what we saw and i know they are still there and will be for some time to come.Ps. after we saw the orb. we decided it was time to go home and we did   ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:33:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":24957,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.939702,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08052010-0013","longitude":-72.2723709,"occurred":1225504620000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1281052994000,"summary":"I was driving through the woods as i always did and while going under some power lines i could see a low flying light it headed my way it was awsome.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":642,"locationName":"Keene, New Hampshire","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:104981"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1990}
