soon as i found my lane trying to get into the middle lane , i immediately noticed the light directly in front of me well above the horizon but not high enough for me to have to peek up out of my windshield. not wanting to be a bad driver i asked my girlfriend and brother what is that ? they responded looks like an airplane so by then i had reached my exit to head south on 360 on the overamp i took another glance at it and said are sure thats a plane it has no blinking lights none of the signs that screams im an airplane ! i then tell them stressing \" keep your eyes on it dont loose it \" it only takes 7 minutes to get back to my house exiting off of 360 i turn west on to my road. and the object was perfectly positioned in between the trees down the street, now that i had focused in on it and the trees are moving past me i was asking my brother and girlfriend if it was moving, no one could tell because of the cars movement. so i pulled over next to a junior high facing west behind the school i parked and turned off the car i was really excited and anxious to get some references to make some decision as to what it could be. well i got it cause it was right over the tree line and sure enough it's movements were little left , then up ,little right , back up , freeze , at one time it started coming back towards the south east but watched it gain altitude a bit and resume course back north west. overfilled with a rush i hopped back in the car went straight for my ladder and got on the roof with my brother we observed this light change it's colors by swirling a red from our left to our right followed by periods of orange then white it stayed a steady course for over a half an hour in between it would go dim then go out completely then reappear. i thought to myself after it had reappeared this is the real thing i point at all the planes and stars around for comparison all flights that go into dfw airport come over and around my house i saw three planes make there way across the sky and disappear before i even lost sight of the object over the trees no telling how long it was there it was 10 til midnight when i went inside the house to collect my thoughts it wasnt till the next morning that i wondered if anybody else saw it and thats when i ran across this site

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"After hearing of my younger sons encounter the night before, my older son, his friend, and myself went to the same place outside of town to see if we could see anything. we got there at about 9 pm just as it was getting dark. skies were very clear and could many aircraft flying for miles around us. we were predominately looking west out of whiteman afb and the town of knob noster. after about 15 min. i stood up from my chair to look around and noticed two planes flying together at low altitude approaching from the east, over by sedalia. the two planes continued west to a point souht of the base then turned 90 deg. to the north at which point they started gaining altitude. i originally thought they were on approach but they should have been descending not ascending. they continued to a point just north of the base and the town at which point they made another 90 deg. turn to the east. the boys had been looking in this direction and had noticed nothing. when the planes made their turn to the east i looked almost directly up and a little north out in front of them a fair distance and noticed a huge dark triangle or chevron shaped object with 3 pale orange lights (not a b2 bomber) heading to the east almost directly over 50 hwy at medium to high altitude. the object made zero noise. the two planes sped up and gained on the object and it was obvious that they intended to follow. the object then sped of slowly and stayed out in front. we could see very well and followed the progress of both the object and the planes as they flew east to a point somewhere north of sedalia and perhaps beyond.The two planes had very bright flashing lights like most of the military aircraft here at the base. the airplanes disengaged at that point and we followed their progress back to the base where they landed. it wound up being two a 10 warthogs. looking back towards the north side of the sedalia lights we noticed several aircraft flying at medium altitude with the same distinctive bright flashing lights. the object was no longer visible at this point.\r\n at this point the three of us were on the phones telling various people of what we had seen. my son's friend called his girlfriend who lives in knob noster and told her we saw a ufo at which point she told him that she had just seen one above the trees just on the southside of town. she described the exact same object that we saw without matt having told her what our object looked like.\r\n after about ten minutes a few more high schoolers showed up along with one of their mothers. after another 5 min. i was pointing out to her where we had seen it and spotted another one coming from the west but farther north than the first. this one appeared to be following a plane instead of being followed. they continued to almost the exact same spot north of sedalia as the first. at this time we noticed between 10 and 14 aircraft stacked at different altitudes at this spot. the object appeared to split in two with one part going north and one part going south, but it was very far away at this point and hard to tell exactly what we were seeing.\r\n we then observed a plane leave that area and head in our direction where it immediately landed. another a 10. then we observed two more leave that area heading west in our dirction where they also landed. two more a 10's. then the same thing, then two more a 10's. for a total of seven.\r\n while all this was going we noticed 2-3 helicoptors orbiting a large area west of the base, roughly over knob noster state park. having lived in knob noster for the last 20 years, i can say that it is very unusual for helicoptors to be operating here at the base during night time hours, but i have seen it. maybe only once or twice though.\r\n after another hour or two we noticed no more planes north of sedalia, no more helicopters. then roughly half an hour after all that died down a b2 came in on approach, did a couple of touch and go's, then finally landed. not standard practice at this base in my opinion. touch and go's are normally done back to back to back with small orbits. have never seen a b2 come from somewhere distant, do a couple touch and go's then land. if they have been somewhere doing something, they simply land and taxi.\r\n all aircraft landed without the flashing landing strip lights being on which is also unusual. normally when the aircraft are landing the base has the blue flashing landing lights on. they did turn them on for about 30 seconds between the a 10's but then turned them back off and left them off.\r\n also while this was going we noticed zero commercial aircraft in the air. we had been seeing them, but after the first object we saw no more till perhaps 230 am. then we saw them in every direction. just an observation. \r\n we are going back out tonight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24940,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.7717198,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08042010-0018","longitude":-93.5511358,"occurred":1280896200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron,

coast guard helos, chinooks, blackhawks, hueys, even an osprey. \r\n\r\ni would work all day, pulling drywall out & flooring, breaking up tiles... a complete gutting job. i wouldn't get to bed until the early morning hours. one night, at about 3 am, i heard the sound of an aircraft slowly approaching my home. but it was unlike any other helicopter i had heard up until then. i hadn't fallen asleep yet, so i laid there listening to it as it came closer. finally, it seemed as if it came to a stop as it got above my house. it just hovered there. \r\n\r\nfor about 10 minutes i laid in bed listening to it & wondering why it was no longer moving. i also tried to discern what type of aircraft it was since the sound was unrecognizable. it put out a low bass tone, similar to a powerful car stereo subwoofer. it was making my body vibrate from the strength of the sound. additionally, it was putting out a very high pitched whine, like that of a dremel multi-tool. but the whine was even more high pitched, as if it were a 50k rpm dremel (normal dremels are 10k rpm). the osprey aircraft were similar sounding but not quite the same. \r\n\r\ni decided to get out of bed, and shoo it away if i could. i was very tired from a hard day's work and i was beginning to get annoyed. when i stepped outside, in my boxers & t-shirt mind you, i walked out to the street. there was no one else around. most of the street lights were still out from the storm. i looked up, and there above my home was what certainly seemed to be a flat black triangle shaped object. on each corner were glowing sections that glowed a blueish white. there were no other lights on the object. the lights at the tips of the triangle were not like spotlights. they were more like very bright leds (the light emanated out equally in all directions). \r\n\r\nfor 10 more minutes (now a total of 20 minutes) i stood there looking at it trying to make out what it was. i didn't get a camera since i didn't think 'ufo' at first. it was about 150 feet over my home. it seemed to be about 100 feet long on each edge. (about half the size of my house in total volume.) my first thought was perhaps it was a 'super osprey'. so i looked between the lights trying to make out some kind of structure. i looked at the large 30 foot high magnolia tree in front of my home, to look for rotor wash. there was none. i shaded my eyes trying to block out the glare, in hopes of seeing something besides the triangular shape... and still nothing. between the lights seemed to be a flat solid and dark object. there was no motion anywhere that i could see (no rotors, no wings, no cockpit). \r\n\r\nfinally it started moving away slowly (20 mph) toward lake pontchartrain. i watched it for another few minutes. i went inside and i thought about it for a while trying to work out what it might be. i gave up and went to bed. i thought about it very little from then on since i could never find a plausible explanation. if it were some secret us military aircraft, why hover it 150 feet over the street in a major city? if it were an alien spacecraft, then why hover it 150 feet over the street in a major city? if it were a foreign military secret aircraft... why invade us airspace? if i was mistaken because of the glare, it would have had to be a very very large osprey. it would also have had different proportions from the osprey aircraft we know about, because of the equilateral nature of the shape. \r\n\r\nit wasn't until about 2 years later that i happened across a tv show about ufos. on that show people talked about seeing black triangles. i'm as certain as one can be that a black triangle ufo is what i saw above my home that night. what it is, i have no clue. but it was triangular, equilateral, appeared to be black, had 3 glowing ends & capable of hovering. \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

several lights. they got scared and continued to drive into town and passed 2 or 3 police cars heading that direction moving fast. after informing me of what they had seen i went out there with my other son and his friend and observed nothing. no ufo, no police. but did notice that the base had several helicoptors operating do flyovers over the base, which is unusual. they normally only fly the
