exact location again, about 2 minutes later, the cross formation was gone.\r\n\r\nmy husband thinks the wind could have done it, however, i've never heard of horizontal and intersected vertical

spot. this time it started moving towards my direction i proceded to watch it but it dissappeared behind the trees. this was blinking soooo fast!! and it wasnt very solid looking at all. the last time it dissappeared i seen fighter jest which wasnt to weir i always see alot of planes & such over my house. but then the jest kept comming honestly i seen over 10 jets searchng the same area and direction where i seen the craft. all the jets were searching the same paths as the ufo al of them. and the jets kept comming one after another looking for a really long time. i think thats why the

flights. this object was truly amazing and i swear it knew i was looking 4 it. \r\n\r\ni was out font of my home when i seen the object it wasnt very high in the sky either if it was  plane which no

6 times the size, then vanish.  \r\n\r\nthe lights of the cluster and those moving from it were significantly different than the airplanes which were also present in the sky - the planes were much

up at the sky, i heard a loud roar over my right shoulder and turned to look. out of nowhere, a triangle shaped object appeared and at the same time, the roar stopped. the object was completely silent for the duration of the sighting.  it passed over a tree which was west of me by about 40 feet and north of me about 50 feet, and it cleared the 60 foot tree by about 30 feet. the sky was dark, though not black, and airplanes (with running lights on) could be easily seen flying at high altitudes. there were no planes at low altitudes.  \r\n\r\nthe object���s shape was in a triangle.  the object was solid, as it had an outline and blocked out the stars behind it. it was very dark, with each point of the triangle having a rather dim white light, and in the center was a blinking red light. these lights turned off for a period of perhaps ��� minute, starting when it was about 60 or 70 feet south of the tree it had passed over, and just after i had moved my position to be almost directly under the object. the size of the object seemed to be about 25 to 30 feet long from the front point to the back, and the dimension across the back, as seen later, seemed to be somewhat shorter. \r\n\r\nit traveled very slowly (a human could have outrun it) on an even horizontal altitude toward the south/southwest, over pastures, a road and then a bean-field, for about ��� mile before i lost sight of it. i believe i may have lost sight of it due to the terrain, as there is an upward slope to the land. as it passed over the bean-field, i noted that the back end of the triangle seemed to be less than 10 feet high, and completely but dimly lit with white light. a few times, the land below and to its left glowed with a soft white diffused light. the sky above the illuminated land was also

south-east as he was leaving to go home.  as he was entering his vehicle, he asked what planet was above the big dipper, above the \"pot\" area which is formed by four stars and attached to the handle.  i looked up, which was to my north west and noticed a star-like object in the position he described but knew it could not be a planet since it was well above the elliptic.  it was not moving but it's star-like appearance along with the four other stars formed a pentagon shape. a few seconds later or so, we both witnessed it just fade away.  \r\n\r\nwe could hardly believe what we saw. after a few minutes he proceeded home after we also had seen a couple of meteors.  a few minutes later, i had told my wife and some other family members of what we saw and the meteors so they came outside.  what we saw after some minutes later were three meteors in just a few seconds streak across the sky from like south to north and one of them from east to west.  we kept looking at the night sky and i looked towards the big dipper again, and very soon, within about two minutes, i noticed another star-like object, but this time it was just below the handle of the big dipper and next to the upper left star of the \"pot\" of the dipper.  and this time it was moving very slowly diagonally towards the right and below. by then, my family also saw it, to include one of my nieces.  i and they could hardly believe it and i quickly had my wife call my brother since i could not keep my eyes off what i was seeing.  \r\n\r\nhe and his wife came over immediately but by then it had disappeared again.  he lives only about five minutes from my home.  by this time, we continued watching the area, and were particularly focused in the big dipper area.  we all then saw star-like objects again in and around the big dipper area. we saw them with the unaided eye and with three binoculars.  the star-like objects were moving slowly but were also changing in color and direction and in some cases, large directional and angle shifts.  each time they faded away or simply vanished.\r\n\r\nthe time line began around 10:55 pm when we saw the 1st star-like object - witnessed by two family members as noted above.\r\n\r\n11:10pm - saw three meteors\r\n11:11 - 11:15 pm - saw star-like object moving through big dipper diagonally as noted above.  witnessed by three family members.\r\n11:26-11:38 pm - star-like object (s) around big dipper that was witnessed by seven family members.\r\n11:45 - \"shooting star\", meteor through big dipper\r\n11:56 - star-like object near third star in handle of big dipper proximal to the \"pot\". witnessed by seven\r\n11:56 pm - 12:00 am - something moving up or shooting up from same third star as described above.  noticed by two family members\r\n12:00 am - another meteor to right of big dipper.\r\n12:06 am - something moving up, star like object, from between the 2nd and 3rd star of handle.\r\n12:15 am - meteor through the center of big dipper from se to nw direction.\r\n12:25 am - meteor through handle of big dipper.\r\n\r\nthis is the best of my recollection.  the times are quite accurate as i instructed one family member to record time of

at a distance in front of us and started to take notice.  as we both watched we noticed more of the same lights come on.  i counted at times, a total of 6.  they were all bright orange in color and they would either flash on and off, flash simultaneously or completely stay off for a while.  a few would stay on for about a min or two and then completely go dark.  they lit up the whole sky.  however, you could mistake them for a star because they had no movement. (for most part)  they were stationary.  when they would move, they were never the same formation.  some did stay really close together, like 2 together and the rest far away.  one would be down low, two up high together, and another to the right.  these orange lights when they would flash, i would have to describe it as a sparkler, when you wave the fire in the sky and it leaves a trail.  that's what these lights did.  when they would move, you could see the light behind it slowly fade.  there were also white lights that you could explain as \"dancing\" as i have just read other reports.  they would start off close together and spread far apart.  there were lots of white lights at times and other times just two blinking at a time.  we watched these lights for about an hour.  there were just too many to be any sort of plane or helicopter.  and again, they stayed stationary and sometimes we had to just watch and wait until they would turn on again.  the sky would be black.  these lights are unexplainable, like nothing we have ever seen!!!  i started looking on my husbands phone on the internet and he jumped and said, \"oh! there they are!\" by this time we were almost home and the lights were behind us.  he saw 3 right in the sky in front of him up high.  they turned on - 1, 2, 3.  and that was it!!! i did try to record it from his video camera on his phone but it was way too dark to capture them and sometimes they stayed so faint you could barely see them.  you had to wait for them to \"ignite\" and then you could really see them!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":24908,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7025412,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08032010-0001","longitude":-114.6252716,"occurred":1280811600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280827887000,"summary":"Arizona lights off of i-8 from phoenix into yuma.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Yuma, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:105958"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Fort McKavett","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This event happened sometime in the summer of 1967, probably in july or august.  it's been a while so i do not remember the month as well as i do the specific event.  i had been to a week long boy scout camp with a lot of my fellow scouts in harlingen, texas which is in far south texas.  we had chartered a bus for the trip.  the week long trip was almost over and on sunday night we returned by bus to our home camp, camp sol mayer, near menard, texas which is in the western part of the state.  we lived in san angelo which was still another 100 miles or so away.  we disembarked from the bus and threw our gear in a '57 chevy owned by one of the older boys. (i was 16 at the time.)  i remember some of the boys had dug up one of those big round wooden poles that support guard rails on the road side and drug it on to the bus along the way.  don't ask why.  i think you have to be a teenager to understand things like that.  we helped them unload it and then got in the '57 for the final leg of the trip home.\r\n\r\nwe drove two or three miles on farm to market 864, which is where camp sol mayer is located, and then turned west on highway 190.  we were tired and no one was talking much although there were four of us in the car.  we listened to koma from oklahoma city on the radio.  i was sitting in the back seat on the drivers side.  my friend in the seat beside me first commented on how big and bright and orange the moon was that night.  we each bent down for a look through his window and concurred thinking it was strange.  a few seconds later,i noticed a normal looking moon on my side of the car.  we all checked it out and then turned our attention to the one on the passenger side.  it looked like some celestial object, far off in the sky but much larger and brighter than i had ever seen the moon and very orange.  it did not show the \"man in the moon\" markings of craters we had all come to know.  we kept looking at it, talking about it and wondering what it could be.  it did not move, get brighter or dimmer.  it did not change in any way - it remained in the same part of the sky appearing, as i said, to be a celestial body.  \r\n\r\nafter about fifteen minutes, we turned north on highway 2084 which took us on to christoval and then san angelo.  when we made the turn, we realized the object had been much closer to us than we had thought and traveling at a speed matching ours.  it kept going west.  we watched it recede in the distance for another five to eight minutes until it was just a small speck in the western sky.  abruptly, it divided into three different colored lights, each shooting off in a different direction until they all disappeared.   this part was much like one of the ufos in speilberg's \"close encounters\", but i saw it for real years before the movie came out.\r\n\r\nthe next morning, the local newspaper had an article about numerous ufo sightings all over the midwest.  i said earlier that this was in 1967 when i was 16 and i think that is correct. the importance of details like dates have paled in comparison with the actual experience.  it is possible that it was 1966 and i was 15.  perhaps cross checking with midwest ufo sightings in those summers would verify the date.\r\n\r\nregardless of the year, it has been over 40 years since i witnessed that event and i have never come up with an explanation which satisfies me.  to this day, i do not know what it was.

pulled off the road about 20 miles west of delta, utah on hwy 50.  it was 4:15 a.M.. as i turned off my truck, my oldest son, and my girlfriend woke up.  i was getting ready to take some of our things out of the cab of the truck, to make for more sleeping room, when i noticed what looked to be a low-flying airplane.  i saw white with green lights moving easterly parallel to the highway.  the trajectory seemed to be headed downwards around 10 to 15 degrees.  i thought it was strange for an airplane to be flying at that time, in the middle of nowhere, but i just wrote it off as normal until a huge, orange jet-fire, for lack of a better description appeared from the back of the lights.  the jet appeared very long.  it didn't look like flames, but like a torch, or something. i don't recall any acceleration of the lights, but it just sort of dissipated, and was gone. there was no sound.   i asked my girlfriend, and my son if they had seen this, and they saw the same thing.  i don't know if it could have been a meteor, or any other describable object, but the jet-fire tells me it wasn't.  \r\na week later i asked my son and girlfriend to draw what they saw, and all of our drawings were pretty much the same.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

smoking cigarettes. i was gazing up at the sky and noticed a point of light slowly moving. my first impression was that it was a plane, but it was not blinking and it was moving slowly. i get my friends' attention and point it out. they too first thought the same thing as i, then thought maybe it was a satellite. it was  not moving like a satellite either. it then stopped and turned from going north to east and approached a second ufo. they approached each other and one went westward and up while the other continued and seemingly entered a lower cloud which was lit up by light pollution. it dropped out of the cloud and disappeared. a few minutes later in the southern portion of a sky a bluer ufo (the others were pale and twinkly) started moving northeasterly. this one moved very slow. it moved directly west of us and stopped \"in front of\" a group of actual stars. it seemed to dim a bit and remained there. we got tired of straining our necks and eventually it faded out too. \r\n\r\ni think the ufos are trying to resemble stars. when they are motionless and if you happened to look up you would never notice any difference. and they were moving slow so if you just happened to look up you wouldn't even notice it moving! they have to be doing this on purpose and personally, i think its genius.
