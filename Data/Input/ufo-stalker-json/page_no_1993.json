(i don't remember this as well as my mother does, so i'm just relaying this bit from her.)  when we first saw it in the field, the object was still slowly floating just above the treeline from left to right, but it soon stopped moving laterally and more or less parked itself about 100 feet above the ground. during the remainder of the encounter, the object hovered a few feet above the trees. my mother and i stood there mesmerized by this thing, watching it for maybe ten minutes and pondering what it could possibly be.  i distinctly remember us discsussing how it reminded us of \"close encounters of the third kind\", which had come out only the summer before.  soon after this, we witnessed what turned out to be the highlight of the whole night.  as we watched the object hover there before us, our eyes caught sight of a small bright red point of light steadily moving across the starry sky from one end of the horizon, above the trees in our yard, across the field and towards the craft.  as it approached the craft, we noticed another red light coming from the opposite direction, and still another, until four red balls of light converged on the object from different parts of the sky.  one by one, these red balls slowed and moved in towards the object, stopping just above it, and then descended into the top of it, until all four had dissappeared.  my mother mentioned that these were possibly scout ships coming back to the mothership after a reconaissance mission, which sounded pretty plausible to me!  we waited for the object to start moving again, but nothing happened for a few minutes.  suddenly, as if it sensed us observing it, the object activated two white spotlights on opposite ends of the craft, and the lights criss-crossed several times, focusing on the field between us and it.  after this startling display , my mother felt like we might be pressing our luck staying there, so we headed inside with the object still sitting above the trees. i remember wanting to remain there until it left, but being only ten, i had little say in that decision.  upon hindsight, my mother regretted our going back in the house before it departed, as we never saw it again after that night. she now wishes we had waited at least a few more minutes to see what its next move would be.  i later suggested we might've avoided an abduction by leaving when we did.  that apparently didn't happen, as the thirty minutes or so that elapsed while we were outside were accounted for by the fact that my father and brother didn't seem to feel like we were gone too terribly long.  additionally, i returned to the den to catch the tv show following the one on at the time we left the room.  a short while later, my brother told everyone that this evening was not the first time he had seen the object.  he had observed it sitting above the same treeline the night before while looking out my parents' bedroom window after having felt somehow compelled to do so. when asked why he didn't mention seeing it the previous night, he didn't have an answer. as for my father, he says he believes we all saw what we saw, but he still thinks a more earthly explanation exists, which is why he never bothered to have a look that night. (personally, i think it was simply a case of the reading chair being too comfortable.) we all agree that he missed out on the most extraordinary experience of our lives.  had this event occurred today, we most certainly would have documented it with video.  i tried to find out if it had been witnessed by anyone else in our immediate area, but none of our neighbors saw it (or so they say.)  i wish my mother and i had had the presence of mind to get our neighbors next door to come out and see it for themselves, but it didn't occur to us at the time.  maybe that was just as it was meant to be, a special experience only a selected few are allowed to have in their lives.  for that, we are honored. my mother and i tend to be a bit greedy in this regard, however, because both of us would absolutely welcome another chance to see this craft or another in our lifetimes.  it is a topic of conversation on many visits, especially in march, when we quietly celebrate the anniversary of what we feel to be our greatest moment together as mother and child, second only to my birthday, but a close second at that!!   thank you for the opportunity to share my story with you.  hopefully, it will be of some use to you in your investigation.  please feel free to contact me for any other details, as it is entirely possible something else might come to mind that i failed to mention here.  i would be interested to know if there are any reports of sightings around that time in my area that might coraborate my account.  if so, please let me know.  thanks again!!","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":24888,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.3165769,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08012010-0016","longitude":-95.4480512,"occurred":258868800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280716145000,"summary":"My mother and i witnessed a disc shaped object float over our street and hover in a field behind our house.

clouds. i had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on. i ended up looking at the stars after they left. at 2152 hrs i noticed what seemed to be a a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. it was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest. it started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity. just when i thought i was about to see a good iridium flare, i realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance. it became huge, larger and brighter than saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center. it appeared to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun. it remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance. concurrent with this display, i noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle. the white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail. it appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (it is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its' appearance and proximity to the green object.) the green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. it did not just blink off but seemed to ���power down���. \r\n\r\nat 2202 hrs i saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. they performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color. they too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark. i checked the heavens above website and discovered that there were no iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

airport and noticed a large \"banner\" flying above the airport.  i look back to read what the \"banner\" was advertising and i noticed that it wasn't a \"banner\" at all!  it was a large rectangular/square object about the size of 4 to 5 highway billboard signs and was yellow to orange in color.  it was very \"dingy\" but still transparent.  i looked around and didn't see any other craft in the area.  the object was actually about 1 mile west away from the airport and it was not moving or making any noise.  it's shape was perfectly rectangular/square... like a playing card on it's side.  the lines of the object were perfectly straight.  it really stood out from the overcast clouds and sun because the clouds are more rounded in shape and they were slightly moving... the object was not.  it also stood out because it was slightly yellow and orange.\r\ni felt bewildered for a moment and looked for anything that could tell me what this object was.  there were no other craft, there weren't any strings attached, there were no external compartments or moving parts to it.  it was just... there, halfway up the skyline sitting very stoic and unnatural.\r\ni slowed my vehicle down from about 40 mph to about 20 mph and watched it until i had to exit onto cline avenue to go to work.  i would say that the entire incident only lasted 1 to 2 minutes.\r\ni continued to look back to try to find it but i couldn't.  by that time my view back towards the object was blocked by highway ramps and buildings.  when i parked my car inside the parking garage, i tried again to get another view of the object but i could not.  there were too many obstructions blocking my line of sight.\r\nthis feeling of embarrassment and bewilderment has stayed with me all day.  i worked 330-1130pm tonight and felt that i had to tell somebody.  so i told my wife, i sent an email to the gary/chicago airport.  i tried to call them but all i got was a recorded message.  then i looked up mufon on wikipedia and... here i am telling my story.\r\ni do not believe in aliens or things of that nature.\r\ni know that i saw \"something\" today, but i do not know what it was.\r\ni will tell anyone that wants to listen my story and i will take any lie detector test there is.  i'll undergo any evaluation.\r\ni'm sure that there's an explanation for what i saw, and i would like to here it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in the sky about a thousand feet ahead of me. the sphere appeared to be made of light and was red with golden light around it and emanating from it. as i drove along it was blocked from my view for 2 or 3 seconds by trees. in those few seconds it had jumped a considerable distance further away from me, i would guess at around a mile or so, and it was also dimmer. i continued to drive along hoping to get a better look at it, because apart from the jump it made it appeared to be completely stationary. after seeing it for another few seconds it was blocked from my view by more trees again for 4 or 5 seconds. by the time i drove into the clear part of the road a few seconds later the object had disappeared. i proceeded to pull my car over and put it in park so i could get a better look at the whole sky. with the moon roof of my car open, i stood up out of my car and looked all around, but the red/gold light object was gone. i stayed there for a couple more minutes looking around the sky, and there wasnt a single cloud in the sky nor was there any airplanes flying. after approximately 2 minutes of looking at the sky, 3 helicopters flew into the area spread over a 3 to 4 mile area with  bright search lights pointing from the front of them. i watched the helicopters fly around and after a couple minutes 2 more helicopters were in the area with bright search lights on the front. when i first saw the light/object and shortly after it disappeared, my first thought was that it was a ufo, but then i thought it could possibly have been a trick of the light or something, tho i wasn't convinced of that. when i saw helicopters show up, and they actually appeared to be looking for something that they knew had just been there in the sky moments before, then i was almost certain that what i saw was a ufo of some kind.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

obviously much closer. it appeared very white. so white that the glimmering showed various color hues as it shone. about 5 minutes later it started to move what seemed like away from me and also north. the light did not dim or strengthen as it moved. it was moving much slower than an airplane would, maybe about as fast as a helicopter (which is my best guess concerning it's identity). it disappeared behind my apartment building and my apartment is on the 5th floor. when it disappeared it seemed to be over downtown. this really spooked me as i have never seen anything like it before

sightings reported here.\r\n\r\ni'm not going to file 8 more reports and in fact i'm seeing them so many times that it is becoming redundant, and expected, for me to see them now. i know for a fact that something is happening, going on and it is constant now! i reported sightings on the 27th of june and on the 17th, both in plain sight, one in the dark of early morning and night, and the 17th sighting at 7pm with the sun up and the sky bright blue. both spectacular!\r\n\r\nmost of these sightings are of the flash of light that increases in brightness before cloaking or disappearing or camouflaging itself or just plain disappearing.\r\n\r\nthese are the ones that start out as a moving star that looks like a star until it begins moving. then the light becomes extremely bright with almost a blue center from the light which is bright white before dimming completely out. several of these were witnessed by someone else. here are the dates all in july:\r\n\r\n5th-witnessed, 20th-witnessed, 27th, 29th and 30th-witnessed. the one last night (30th) had two separate events happen... three really and i'll explain later. all of these sightings are happening between 11:15pm to 11:45pm nightly.\r\n\r\nthese next sightings are the craft, celestial form, rectangular, oval or diamond shaped ones. these are becoming frequent too.\r\n\r\njuly 26, at 8:12pm i saw a rectangular shaped object way up in the sky. i perceived it to be very high up perhaps 20,000 ft or more. a person was with me but did not look fast enough to see it. this object flew steadily then a bit faster and went behind a cloud as if to hide from me. once it went behind the cloud it never came out the other side and must have gone back out into space. this was daylight still and a muggy day with clouds forming or formed.\r\n\r\njuly 28th, approximately 8:15 although i am not sure of the time, i was out on the lake with friends and i had the feeling i would see something out there. at that time, i thought i saw what was a jet plane \"going to the northwest\" as some of my friends later said. but as i looked closely to it i could see that the jet form was a facade or really some kind of shadowing so that if a casual, asleep individual looked at it it would just appear as a plane.\r\n\r\nthis craft was huge and not so high up as before so i could see it clearly. it was white in color but in the shape of a large rectangle. as i was about to tell the others they wanted to know what i was looking at but then this large craft started to move outwards, turning itself into a small star because of the distance so that only one other of the people on board saw it as it was moving away and dimming out.\r\n\r\nthen of course i already reported the 17th sighting which occurred 7pm. that particular craft was either diamond shape or perhaps oval . . . i just cannot tell because of its luminosity and movement, and the shock and awe state that i was in.\r\n\r\nthere is no doubt i will see the flashing lights at 11:30pm again tonight and if i were to stay out at night around 6 to 9:30 pm i would see the bright and different shaped celestial or ufo's!\r\n\r\nlast night's vision was the flashing light then, almost immediately after seeing it i looked up because i heard a small plane engine but what i saw was a large craft that was very lit up, with swirls or shadows making it look strange. it sounded like a plane but it sure did not appear as one. after the \"plane\" disappeared from site we saw some kind of dark shimmer or movement where the two celestials, crafts or whatever, would have come together. i don't know what to make of this but truly there is something going on and i cannot believe that no one knows about this.\r\n\r\nunless i see something even more spectacular than what i have already experienced i will not report anymore. i mean, what's the point? no one is going to do anything about it anyway. however i am taking this message out to all that will listen in the way i feel they want me to communicate it.\r\n\r\ni can draw detailed sketches if needed because even when i have camera in hand it happens so fast that i cannot capture an image or it doesn't let me at all.\r\n\r\nalright... that's it folks,,, believe it or not! peace and love\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

maybe not even that fast. the shape of the object was similar to a triangle, except it was on it's side. the lines of the object were clearly defined. the center of the object was pure white with blue color at the edges. the back of the object in the middle had flames coming out almost like those from a rocket engine. the object continued flying in the same direction until out of sight. only then, did i think about my binoculars which weren't readily available. \r\n \r\nas i stated above, i've never seen anything like this object, but i'm very sure it was not any kind of aircraft currently flying in the skies, now. i also realized that the object must've been flying over the forest further to the west than i at first thought because i did not see any commotion from the people that live near the edge of the forest in that area. the object must not have made much noise or the people near the forest would've heard it and called 911. \r\n \r\none last comment, this object was not in a saucer shape and had no round edges. after it disappeared from sight, i got goosebumps all over. \r\n \r\ni'm attaching a rather crude drawing of what i saw. please forgive my lack of artistic ability.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":24861,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.5453042,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07312010-0009","longitude":-112.4623425,"occurred":1105845000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280611637000,"summary":"Sighted ufo west of house between 7 and 8 pm.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24861_submitter_file1__mufon1.docx"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2022,"locationName":"Prescott, Arizona","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:106468"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Butte","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was just taking pictures randomly and did not notice this at the time.It is exactly the same anomoly that i reported on the ninth.,just a different part of the sky.The first sighting was facing south and this one on the 25th is facing west.Just to refresh your mind on the sighting on the 9th of july,this is a copy of that one,so you can compare.Thank you","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":24860,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.006187,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07312010-0008","longitude":-112.531916,"occurred":1280041200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Montana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,   Missile,   Cigar,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280604248000,"summary":"Tube like object - 2nd one in a little over 2 wks, of same thing.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24860_submitter_file1__100_0648-2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24860_submitter_file2__100_0648-2-3.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24860_submitter_file3__-3.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Butte, Montana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:106469"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1993}
