i thought was thunder and i saw a flash of light as i woke up from the loud noise, i was happy  and got up to open the window to hear the rain. i looked from the blinds ad to my surprise nothing, all was calm. my neighbors lights were out but i made the big mistake of looking up at the sky.  i live on the third floor of an apartment complex and the roof is right above me.  on the roof i saw this hugh craft some of it was just out that i cuold see right under it from  my window. it did not seem to have  its lights on and very quiet. i saw its oval shape with indentations or something like rims under and many circls and different shapes like balls under it. i moved away from the window in a way that i just wanted to hide under the covers. as i am going around my bed the strange being walks right in to my bedroom and stands at the door blocking my path and i almost bump into it. i face it with my back towards the bed and move backwards slowly as high as i can get to the top of my bed. it is looking at me and i at it.  around  maybe 3 and half feet, strange metalic suit the coverd its whole body, 2 arms and two legs and some kind of mesh covering its face. i did see whar seemed to be large eyes but no mouth or nose and i could not tell if it was male or female.  in its right hand it has an instrument with a long needle. it mde me feel like i was powerless to do anything. when it did not communicate with me i decided to talk to it. these were my exact words ,please dont hurt me. as i said those word it came right at me, i felt a grab and i blacked our when i woke up it was morning and i was on the left side of the bed, i sleep one the right side.  ever since this happpened i keep my bedroom door closed, i always kept it open. it is something that i have always believed

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i work at home on computers in lake city, a suburb in north seattle. as we make our own hours, it is not uncommon for us to work late. we decided to take a break and a walk at 11pm. we walked out of our apartment and decided to walk east toward cedar park, a neighborhood of nice middle class homes. we arrived at lake city way, which is usually very busy with traffic as it is the main roadway leading to northern communities.\r\n\r\nit was a clear, still night and the stars were were visible. no cloud in the night sky. as we crossed the 4 lane roadway, i glanced up at the sky above and saw what, at first, i thought was a satellite. it was a white glowing light in the sky moving northward. almost immediately i realized that there were three lights arranged in a triangle, with one being at the point of the northward direction that the lights were moving. in the next moment i realized that the sky was being blacked out between the triangles. this realization was accompanied by the realization that this was an object and that it was not high in the sky, but right over our heads. my background in architectural study, perspective drawing, and mechanical drawing among other skills at perspective, allowed me to take site off the trees and the buildings next to us to estimate the height of its flight, which was about fifty feet.\r\n\r\ni instantly alerted my wife and she looked up, but, at first focused on the stars. i grabbed her arm and quickly said, \"it's lower. the moving lights, look!\"\r\n\r\nwhen she saw what i was pointing to, she gasped. we were stunned and discussed the object as it glided absolutely silently over us as about three to four times the speed of cars that pass down lake city way. the speed limit being 40 mph.\r\n\r\nas we watched and discussed the object, we realized it had a glowing morphing red light centered between the triangle of lights. by morphing, i mean it shifted its shape continuously, but remained contained in what seemed to be a defined space in the center of the object.\r\n\r\nan odd point that we later discussed at length was that the light source, that is the points of light, were like like none either of us had ever seen. that is, the light seemed to emanate from the points but had no source. more like a glow of light without the center being bright. like, but not the same as fluorescent light.\r\n\r\nbacking up in my narrative of events a bit, as the object flew north, it came to a main intersection at 145th st, we were on 140th st, the object turned left, or west, at the intersection, with such a sharp turn as to seem to defy the physics of inertia. there was zero banking or slippage through the air. it turned as if it were on the ground, with none of the normal compensations necessary to overcome velocity in flight.\r\n\r\ni don't say that it defied physics, only that it turned in a way that did not make sense to our minds, so quick and shape and sudden, with no air drag or resistance of any kind.\r\n\r\nonce the object made the turn, it accelerated at what i can only describe as rocket speed. completely silent, it made the sudden burst of energy and velocity increase toward the direction of lynnwood, a city northwest of seattle.\r\n\r\nwe discussed the object at length that night, but were cautious about sharing our experience at first.\r\n\r\na month later, we ran into our upstairs neighbor and her husband. she is a mother with five children, a nurse and a very responsible and grounded person. in our hallway chat, she mentioned that she saw the current ufo movie playing at the theater that night. i asked her about the movie, making small talk, and she informed me that she had a new interest in ufos because in june, her and a friend, another mother, were crossing lake city way one night and saw a black triangle fly down lake city way, heading northward. when she described the object her and her friend saw, it matched the description of what we had seen.\r\n\r\na final point needs to be addressed. that is that as hard as this is to explain, we all felt as if the object was oddly like a projected image, but solid at the same time. this object, in no way, could have been projected, yet it had qualities reminiscent of a projection. very odd.\r\n\r\nwe would like our name withheld from the public in general, as we have seen how people are viewed and treated when they have revealed similar experiences. the members of mufon, may, however contact us if they desire. we make no claim as to the origins of the object. we are just reporting what we saw.\r\n\r\nnow it's over a year later and we have not been able to shake the experience.\r\n\r\nthank you for providing this forum.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

was on a summer camping trip with a group of boys. the camp director had a cabin on lake chesuncook in the wilderness around baxter state park in maine. there was a small village nearby, mostly summer cabins, but also one home that served as a bed-and-breakfast and was also the residence of the village's only year-round residents.\r\nanyway, one night some of us decided to canoe across the lake and spend a night on one of its small islands. the island was roughly 50 by 30 feet, with a few pine trees.  while settling in for the night, looking at the night sky, suddenly appeared a glowing, bright, light blue fireball. i saw it move from the top of the trees (or so it seemed)a few yards or so laterally, and then it was gone. it scared me (i was 12 years old). i asked aloud, \"did anyone else see something?\"  \"i did,\" another kid said, nervously.\r\ni saw him some years later and asked him if he remembered the fireball. he never forgot it.  \r\nit was rather large. it looked to be a yard or two wide, about 20 or so feet in the air. of course, it might have been much higher and therefore been much larger. at any rate, if it had been a meteorite and blazing hot (it looked like blue fire), we should have heard it hit the water. it just appeared and disappear just as fast. this was only about one or two seconds.\r\ni've never forgotten it either. years later, when i was a counselor on the same maine trip, i told my story to another counselor. he then told me that the owners of the bed-and-breakfast told him a story that one evening, while getting into bed, a bright blue light lit up their room, apparently coming from a source outside. that's all i remember of the story.\r\n\r\nhas anyone had a similar experience, have a theory about what i might have seen?","distance":"20 Feet

was bbqing behind my house in a hay field yesterday around 5:00 pm. the hay field is developed for camping grounds and about half the field has been cut with a lawnmower. me and another camper were sitting in lawn chairs near the bbq, unfortunately drinking some beers. i suddenly heard a private airplane (a small one) flying from east to west, fairly low and relatively loud. when i looked up at the private plane, i noticed a white object flying several feet above the private plane, and the white object was going from west to east. they did not appear to be parallel with each other though. if the white object was making a noise, it was over powered by the lower flying private plane. \r\n\r\nthe white object (may have been a light grey color or something) did not appear to have wings. it litterally appeared to just be a cylinder or cigar although the object was at a significant height and the wings may have been difficult, if not impossible to view from my point. \r\n\r\nwhen i seen this object, i stared for about 30 seconds before pointing it out to my drunken camping buddy. he was able to hear and see the private plane, but i just couldn't get him to focus enough to see what i was seeing. i pointed out a small cloud to him which he was able to find, and the object was slightly under the cloud (from our ground view) but i couldn't get him to see it. eventually, as i continued to point out the object, it continued flying east at a uniform speed until it was too small and far away to see myself. \r\n\r\nit is in my opinion, this object was simply a commercial airliner which was flying too high to be heard, or to distinguish any descriptive features on it. regardless, i am not 100 percent, or even 99.99 percent sure that this was an airplane.\r\n\r\n...Previous encounters: me, my mom (rip), and my neighbor seen a strange hovering light moving to slow to be conventional aircraft, and was to quiet (cant remember, but i think it was silent) to be a helicopter, and this was at night; around 10-11ish pm. the object hovered in the camping field i mentioned earlier and hovered over and past my house in a southern direction. i called my neighbor as soon as i seen it and he was over in about 2 mins (lives 400 meters away). i met him outside where we watched this thing up close. it had bright white lights (i think) but the one thing i remember for sure is the earthly structure of this craft. it appeared to have a crane like structure to it (only an iron (looked like iron) frame with no exterior). the object may have been approx 20 meters by 20 meters (irregular shape). hovered 100 feet off ground approx in the camping field then moved over my house southerly and hovered in a field across the road where we got a good look at it. then it continued moving south but started to curve south west and up! wish i had more details.\r\n\r\n

night. it was between 10:30 and 11pm and the fireworks were dying down. my boyfriend asked me if the pieces of fireworks could reach us and i told him the were too far away (at least 10 city blocks away was the closest any firweorks were being set off). then a little later he pointed at something that appeared to be on fire moving toward us and asked me if that might reach us. we first began to back across the roof thinking it was a piece of flaming debris, even though there were no fireworks going off anywhere near us. it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't falling and wasn't fireworks. we stood still and waited for it to pass over head. it looked just like a perfect orb of fire. it had no tail and was not obstructed by any clouds or fireworks. it was silent and glowing orange, did not flash. it moved at a  constant speed directly overhead. it was closer than stars, seemed much closer than a plane. it was silent and moved in a straight line. it did not get bigger or smaller and did not appear to be falling. we followed it until it disappeared far into the sky in the distance. i have seen many fireworks of all types throughout my life including flares, parachute fireworks and duds and partially-exploded mortars, this was not fireworks. i have lived under the jfk flight paths my entire life. this was not a plane of any kind. no running lights and no sound. it took almost a minute to pass over us, so we got a good look at it. it seemed perfectly round and like it was on fire but much closer than a star. it was not something that you sometimes see come through and burn up in the atmosphere like meteorites or meteor showers (i have seen many). it was constant in its speed and altitude and was not something falling to earth. as close as it was within the atmosphere, if it was just a piece of something in the atmosphere i would have expected it to fall towards earth. some force kept it eleveated and travelling horizontally. i have never seen anything unexplainable in the sky before this. neither in the city or catskill mountains where i frequently visit my family. seeing a ufo was the furthest thing from our mind on that 4th of july. i felt absolutely crazy trying to explain this to my family until i went online and saw that i was not alone.

(my father���s last duty in the navy was a chopper trainer, he said that it was impossible for a helicopter to maintain position like that in those winds and not experience some lateral vectoring) \r\n\r\nthe closer we drew to the object the more distinct it became, the object then moved slightly away from the tower and stopped in the center of the tower ���yard; at this point the object began to bounce gracefully in approximately 50 foot drops and 50 accessions, all the time still spinning.\r\n\r\nmy mother tried to take some pictures of the object but as far as i know they never came out.\r\n\r\n my father and mother opened their windows, in order to try to here if the sound of a copter was present, but the only sound heard was road noise; and at this distance, if it was a helicopter one would have been able to hear the roar.It was now clear to my parents and i that this was no helicopter.\r\n\r\nas we were passing the tower station, the object leisurely and effortlessly moved and began to follow the highway; particularly our white suburban truck. at this point, my mother began to flip out, and begged my father to get off the highway, but we just kept driving.\r\n\r\nthis is where the events of this night become weird, as we were driving the craft took up position above our truck and started to flash bright, and i mean bright flashes of directed light into our vehicle, particularly at me. they were brighter than any police or emergency vehicle or anti -collision light i have ever seen.\r\n\r\nfirst flashes of: yellow, than flashes of red, than blue, than green, than blue than red, than green and finally blue.\r\n\r\nafter a while the object flew slowly away east bound in to the sky and out of sight straight up.\r\n\r\nthis whole event from start to finish lasted from 20 to 25 minutes; i have tried using google earth to locate the precise location of where this event occurred, but much of the topography there has changed since i was a kid.\r\n\r\nwhat has bothered me over the years is that there were other witness to this event on that stretch of interstate 40 that night; none as far as i know, have ever reported this event.\r\n\r\nmy current vocation is a licensed and soon to be ordained pastor, there is a big risk for me to even speak out these events, but they must be told.\r\n\r\nthis was not the only experience my family and i had in new mexico; there was another one, just as weird.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":24833,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.9776905,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292010-0015","longitude":-105.0307935,"occurred":14400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280437846000,"summary":"25 minute event of a triangle shaped object seen by many on interstate 40 in new mexico, between clines corner and tijera,new mexico.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":14819,"locationName":"Btwn Clines Corners/Tijer, New Mexico","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:106523"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Skykomish","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  i was on vacation in washington state. i was out in my pickup that i keep at my sister���s house, doing some fishing and taking pictures of the scenery. it was a clear blue sky and i was east of skykomish at the martin creek trailhead for the iron goat trail. i thought i would head further up the road past the trailhead parking area on us forest service road 6710 for some pictures.

always a lot of air traffic in this west view so we are used to jets coming and going from salt lake international airport, which is to the north. something a little odd caught my attention just after the sun went down but before it got all the way dark. \r\ni spotted a very black sphere in the west, and it wasn't moving. it just hung in the sky in that exact spot for about 3 minutes. my wife said,\"it's just a plane.\"\r\ni said,\"if it's a plane then why is it not moving and where are it's lights?\"\r\nshe noticed then that it wasn't moving and we started to get excited. i ran inside the house to get my binoculars and when i returned my wife, who had kept the object in view said, \"it's gone now.\"\r\ni looked with my binoculars where i had seen it before and it seemed to be gone but after a cloud moved past i could see it again. it was very black, reflecting no light whatsoever. i've never seen anything like it. there was a lot of wind and clouds. i could see it again when the clouds thinned out but within a minute or so after that it was gone. \r\nthe oddest thing about it was that it stayed in the same spot in the sky this whole time. if it had been a balloon of some sort it would have had to move in the wind. this black sphere never moved but stayed fixed in this position the whole time it was in our field of view. so then since we could not see it anymore we sat back down on the deck and discussed what we had seen. \r\nafter about 5 minutes my wife went inside for something and i was still on the deck sitting in my chair when something very big swooped silently over my head and i saw its dark shadow out of the corner of my eye. at first i thought it was a big bird because i could not see it clearly but something had definitely flown over my head so fast that i could only see the shadow of it as it passed. i ran to the other side of my deck but i couldn't see anything. it really seemed far too big to be a bird. we don't get eagles or any other kind of big birds in the city. it was completely silent. \r\n\"ok,\" i thought to myself,\"now i finally have something to report to mufon!\"\r\nunfortunately this whole sighting was in the near dusk so pictures would have been impossible, but my wife and i definitely saw this very black sphere fixed in the sky. it kind of reminded me of a black hole, the way it just stayed there as clouds moved in front of it and in back of it with the wind and it didn't move at all. i could make a sketch but it would just be a black ball or sphere with no lights or markings.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

come out here and see\" she then came out and seen it and wasn't all that excited about it and just said \"it's just a airplane, it's not a ufo! people are going to think your crazy out here just staring up in the sky\" i then knew she wasn't going to be my witness and i have no idea how she thought this thing was a plane. it had no sound, no blinking lights, and if it was a plane, it would have been long gone by then, not just hovering. she goes back inside and i'm fixed on watching this thing. then out of no where, something flies by at high speed passing the orange sphere, also no sound and had red blinking lights all over it. i then started seeing the orange sphere slowly move right and down. i was thinking maybe the night sky was just moving like normal but the same stars i was looking at was in the same spot. another 10 minutes pass and the orange sphere is now ducking below the tree line, almost completely out of sight, just peeking at me through two telephone poles, and then, gone. i was now convinced i had just saw something strange and hoped it was a ufo. i come back inside my apartment and get on the internet to google about the orange sphere on tonights date and whaddya know....Other people seen it as well! i then proceeded to see how i could report it, and here i am! sorry no pictures or video, will have camera on me next time! also during this whole sighting, about the time this sphere started to move, it seemed like a storm was coming in from the east. it got real windy and clouds were coming in but then all the sudden stopped?!? airplane my left foot!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":24826,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.731079,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292010-0008","longitude":-97.3142196,"occurred":1280379600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Fireball,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280403123000,"summary":"Huge bright orange moving sphere","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Fort Worth, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:106530"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82758,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":1994}
