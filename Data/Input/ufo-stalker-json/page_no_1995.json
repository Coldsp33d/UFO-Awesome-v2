live right next door. it was the night of the 4th we were all hanging out outside in front of our town home watching fireworks being shot into the sky by our neighboring apartment complex which is a huge college apartment complex. so needless to say there were plenty of fireworks for us to watch while we chatted amongst ourselves.\r\n\r\nthere were 4 of us that happened to be hanging out at the time of the event, i happened to be facing north west when i spotted a round pulsating orange light moving slowly (much slower than a prop plane) and moving off to the north east from my position. this orange globe looked to be rather large based on its altitude. i would estimate it to be about as big as a compact car. looked to be about 400 to 700 feet off the ground and traveled silently flickering almost like a campfire. this means that the intensity of the orange light being emitted by this object changed constantly giving it a \"globe containing a fire\" type of effect.\r\n\r\nmy neighbors walked down the street to help keep it in view so that the apartments next to our location did not prevent us watching it. but then it just turned off its light, and just as quick as it had begun it ended.\r\n\r\ni have never contributed to the mufon database although i have had many encounters watching the skies over the years. i was casually looking at the mufon ufo activity map and noticed after reading the other 10+ accounts that many people witnessed the exact same thing all over the country that same night of july the 4th 2010. so i thought it is almost my duty to confirm this by adding our report.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

1993,  i have had this incident tattooed on my brain ever since, it still amazes me.  so i was about 13 when this happend, it was a dark clear night, coming back from the store with my mom in her mini van.  \r\n   we turned down a long road near the house on our way home, basically i instantlly noticed these 2 what appeared to be \"stars\" in the sky directly ahead in the distance, but they were way brighter than the other stars around them, and one was right above the other.(if you stick your arm out and hold a bic lighter in your hand thats about how far apart the objects appeared to be) they caught both of our attentions.  \r\n   it really stood out seeing these really bright stars and the other stars were not gleaming like these balls of light were. so we are driving and are about 30 seconds or so down this road, the lights still just look like unusually bright stars, right about then the light on top just shot away to the right and into infinity like it was shot out of a sling shot, just from sitting still to blinding speed and gone in less than a second. then the bottom light shoots off just as fast in the same direction as the other one.  it was crazy! my mom said \"did you see that\"??  she was shocked and puzzeled. we got home about 5 minutes later and i was out on the deck right away looking for more lights,excited from what we just witnessed but saw nothing else that evening.  havent had a sighting since then but hope i am lucky enough to have another.  please contact me with any questions. - *(wit's first initial

over the east end of sky harbour airport. the time was about 5:30 or 5:45 am and the sun had not fully risen but the sky was full of light but the globe itself was reflecting bright sunlight. the sphere/globe reflected a gray/silver color just like stainless steel and there were no other features about it. it was just a perfectly round globe devoid of any markings or external material. if one holds a large childs marble at arms length you get the idea of what size i was seeing. this object was perfectly stationary in the sky and clearly visible to anyone who would look up and as i said looked for all the world to be made of stainless steel. i watched it for a short while and first thought it was a tv satalite. i went back into my office, gave report for my shift and went home not thinking anymore about it. a few weeks later coming out of my office for a breath of fresh morning air at the same time as before i saw it again in the same position perfectly stationary in the sky with the early morning sun reflecting off its exterior. i watched it again for a little while wondering just what it was then gave my night shift report and went home. before i drove off the parking lot i took another look but could not see it again. on the way home i began to realize that it could not be a tv satalite because it had no array of antenas or solar panals etc. and it was positioned in the atmosphere only a few thousand feet up. i am a retired rn and have never seen any other odd objects in the sky.","distance":"Over One

wife. when i looked out  the window and i noticed a very very brilliant bright gold light in the north east sky. at first i thought it was a star. i believed it was too bright to be a star, especially on a night with a full moon. i thought perhaps it was a low flying airplane. starring out the window for a while, it was not moving like a plane. my wife asked, what are you looking at? i said there  is something out there. i called my wife to take a look. she went and got out our telescope 25 x 100 skymaster.. the gold light was positioned at 2:00 in the sky. when i looked through the telescope i was astonished see what looked like a dark crescent shape craft with different colored  red and blue lights that outlined its shape and bright gold light off center. i asked my wife to take a look and she verified the same craft. it was moving, almost floating very slowly from the north east to the south west. we both felt unsettled and anxious, like it was observing. this sighting lasted for an hour and half before we went inside leaving the craft in the sky starring down. the longer we observed the more creeped out we got and felt compelled to go inside. it was the first time we both have ever seen anything like that before. the next night monday on the 28th i went out with my wife at about 9:30pm and it was there again. i thought perhaps we misidentified it the night before. with the naked eye it looks like a star but when we used the telescope it was a craft of some kind. on the next night, tuesday the 29th, it was very clear night and the craft was not there. afterwards we tried to think about else could it have been, not a star, not a plane, or comet , meteor, satellite, astroid. i can not figure it out. i went on the mufon site and saw a very similar photo of a crescent shaped ufo taken in 1987 in illinois.

two bright.  at that point it was right above our heads and still we heard nothing.  suddenly a light came on and pointed straight up into the sky and as we were watching it the light suddenly turned down towards us and bathed us in the beam.  it did not point down and find us it came right on us ..Not to the right or the left of us but right straight on us.  lol, at this point we had no idea what to do so silly us just waved at it.  i am not sure how long we were in the light it only seems a few seconds but then it started to drift away out toward the huckleberry creek river valley (where the

and we could see red lights shaping a red trialgle on the top of it.  this point it looked like an arrow head and we thought it was coming back for us.  it then flashed blue and for lack of a better term warped towards mount ranier and was gone.  faster than anything i mean it was gone.  10-15 seconds after the ufo flash out towards mount ranier we final heard a noise like a sonic boom but not quite as loud and earthshaking.\r\n\r\nthe only thing else was we did check and there was no scheduled flights over suntop but no the less it was definately nothing i have ever seen before of since but it has definately change my outlook on things. \r\n\r\nsorry the only proof i have of this is my wife was with me and after 7 or so years she will still tell you the exact same thing.\r\n\r\nthanks that is my story\r\n\r\n*(wit's name

the night of 6/29/1981 a gentleman called the wahweap district ranger office and requested a ranger meet him at the wahweap launch ramp. a ranger responded and took this formal department of interior, national park service, case incident report.  the incident was given case incident number 811310.\r\n\r\nthe gentleman reported, that two nights earlier, his group of 15 individuals from salt lake city, utah were camping in cow canyon, in the escalante river arm, of lake powell. the group were all members of the lds church and there was absolutely no use of alcohol, or drugs on the trip.  the group had a houseboat, that was used as a base, for the trip.\r\n\r\nnote:  the following account is taken directly and verbatim from the national park service case incident report number 811310.  i have used quotation marks for all information taken verbatim from the case incident report.  where i have used the word \"name\" i have left out the name of the person who gave the account of the incident, to the national park service.  i have corrected some obvious spelling errors that were in the original account and i have put in brackets ( ) information that can clarify the report, to persons reading it. \r\n\r\n\"on 06-29-81, at approximately 1715 hrs.(5:15 p.M.), recieved a call from a visitor wanting to report a strange experience in the escalante river.  i contacted name at approx. 1745 hrs.(5:45 p.M.), on the launch ramp (wahweap launch ramp).  on 06-27-81, at approximately 2230 hrs. (10:30 p.M.), name and 14 other persons in his group were camped in cow canyon, a side canyon off the escalante (escalante river arm of lake powell).\r\n\"name\" was about to tell the group a story of an incident his family experienced five years earlier in explorer canyon, which is  the next canyon south of cow canyon, when the same experience began to happen again.  a bright light, which was described to be flashing at 2-4 second intervals, was coming down the left side of the canyon in midair. it circled above the group and then flew down the right side of the canyon.  the light was described to be similar to a strobe light and bright enough to light up the canyon wall.  the group observed the light flying in close proximity to their campsite for approximately one and a half (1 1/2) hours. at one point it (the object) was thirty (30) feet away when group member shined a spot light on it and described what he saw as \"creature-like.\" further details include: \"winged and larger than a bat.\" name then stated that another light appeared and seemed to flash a signal which was answered by the original light. both lights then disappeared down the middle of the canyon.  name stated that this experience was very similar to the one five (5) years ago in explorer canyon, only the light was brighter.  no alcohol was consumed by any member of the group that night. cleared 1800 hrs. (6:00 p.M.).\" \r\n\r\nto me this is an amazing report. the individual making the report did not want his name used and wanted no publicity for himself. the length of time (i.E. 1 1/2 hrs.) that the object was observed, is in itself remarkable and i have not heard of any other report of this duration.\r\n\r\nduring the summer of 1981 the national park service received a number of reports, from visitors, camped on the shoreline of lake powell, of \"giant fireflys.\" several of the reports were recieved at the carl hayden visitor center,located near glen canyon dam.  at first the national park service, staff members, thought the campers were seeing the strobe lights on the stacks of the navajo generating station, southeast of page, arizona. these lights can be seen for miles but some of the campers were in canyon locations, where the power plant stacks could not be seen. it is possible that the sightings of \"giant fireflys\" were what the group of 15 saw on the night of 6/27/1981.\r\n\r\nthere was a second verbal report given to the bullfrog district ranger about a similar sighting to the 6/27/1981 one. the second report was not documented unfortunately but occured two, weeks after the 6/27/1981 report. the individuals who made the second report, were supposed to be on lake powell for a week, on a houseboat. the first night out of bullfrog, utah, where they rented the houseboat, they camped in cow canyon, the same canyon as the 6/27/1981 sighting. the second sighting was very similar to the first sighting. the second group were so disturbed by what they saw, that they returned to bullfrog marina, the following morning and turned in their houseboat and said \"we are getting the hell out of here,\" after describing what had happened to them.\r\n\r\ni have a kept a copy of the original case incident report over the years because of the unusual nature of the ufos observed. i did submit a copy of this case incident to the aerial phenomenon research organization in tucson and they thought it was a most interesting sighting. \r\n","distance":"21-100

crew members (myself and two others) were walking through the desert area just behind our fire station, catching scorpions when one of the guys said,\"woah, woah, woah!\" i thought he saw a snake or something on the ground, so i looked all over the ground by my feet and he started to tap me and pionted up to the southwest sky. he wasn't able to talk. he just motioned to the sky. i looked up and caught about a half to three quarters of a second of a round, green light with a green halo light surrounding it. it flew horizontally across the sky, from east to west, at the same altitude throughout its duration, at an extremely high rate of speed, making no sound at all and dissappeared when it reached the southwest sky. the other two guys saw at least 2-3 seconds of its flight before it disappeared. it didn't go behind anything. it just disappeared completely. coincindentally, luke air force base is southwest of our fire station. i see jet planes and various aircraft constantly flying over and around our station all the time. they have conventional lights and strobes on them. this green craft was like nothing i have ever seen before fly in the sky around my station. i have seen tons of ufo videos and footage in my life. i am pretty savy when it comes to ufos and their flight patterns. this was similar to lots of ufo pics i have seen before and had similar rates of speed than them too. it is a topic that i am very interested in, but this isn't wishful thinking when i saw this since all three of us saw the same thing. the funny thing is that we, at the fire station frequently talk about ufos and aliens on a regular basis. needless to say, we were excited but not too terribly surprised since we do believe that these things really do exist. all we need now is for our government to acknoledge and admit to the public that they exist since they already know anyway. if they did come out with the truth, most people would be as surprised as they were when liberace and ricky martin came out of the closet(we all saw that coming...Lol). i would like to remain anonomous.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

tells me about it anyway... this particular morning, he came to me visibly upset telling me he dreamed about aliens. i would never take him serioulsy normally but this morning and the way he acted made me listen. he began to tell me that (in his dream) he woke up and a little gray men took him with them out the door and took him on their ship. the gray men had big black eyes and when i asked about the nose he pushed his up, and into his face, i'm thinking to make it look like there wasn't much of one except for holes, maybe? i asked him about their hands and he said their fingers looked long like sticks. he said the ship was silver with yellow, green and white lights. he said it was a ball with a ring around it...He said they took him to the moon. he told me they were talking in whispers and he remembered them telling him to \"stay.... stay with us.\" he kept repeating that. he said he was scared and told them to take him home to mommy. i know that people can be influenced as well as children by television and whatnot, but i'm nearly 100% positive that he has not seen any show where a detailed account of an abduction has been explained. i have been watching everything i can on abductions since he came to me and it really sounds eerily similar to an alleged account of. he is a truthful child. he had just turned 5 and i can always get the truth from him. he sounded totally legit. i know it could have been a dream but isn't that how some people remember? i've never heard him come and tell me a dream so vividly and detailed. i thought it should be my duty to report this and if anything else happens, i will definitely report again. thanks for even taking the time to read this. \r\n\r\nrma","distance":"20 Feet or

putting some things away (lawn chairs, etc) at about 1 a.M. & just looked up at the night sky to admire the stars, & to the east (at about a 45 degree angle saw an aircraft in the sky).  as i viewed this aircraft i could not determine whether it was a plane, helicopter, or military vessel.  it caught my attention, because it was so low...The airport isn't too far from us, but usually we don't see plane flying that low around here.  so, i watched it for about 2 min.  it seemed to move or maybe hover. it had 2 white lights & one red one in the middle of the 2 white lights.  as i watched, it seemed to be getting closer, but not like a plane. i found this a little strange, but dismissed it at first as maybe military tests (since we have a military base near by)it wouldn't be that unusual.  when i heard about what others saw that night, i am sure i saw it.  i don't own a t.V. & don't watch the news, it's depressing.  i just surf the internet for the info i want to hear about.  so 2 days ago, i put in google (alien sightings in clovis) and mufon/jeffery popped up. \r\n\r\n\r\nthats when i decided to contact you.  there was also an incident back in 2004.  at my mom's house, where i am now...My bf & i were sitting on the back of his oldsmobile, looking up at the sky & just conversating. we looked up & there was this steath like triangle shaped aircraft.  it made no noise whatso-ever. was dark, no lights at all, & passing right above us.  slowly, almost like it was hovering.  i didn't report it because i just figured it was military, lemoore airforce base isnt too far
