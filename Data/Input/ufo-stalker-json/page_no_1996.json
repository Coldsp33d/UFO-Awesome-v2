have seen them from afar and close up approximatly 5 th 10 feet away. they have allowed me to photograph them, video them and see more of them than i care to.  i wouldn't mind if there had been more witness other than my mother, granddaughter, and wife. i have personally seen these things in downtown kc, and over my house. last week one of these things flew or foated right over my head. i had  been watching the skys that night and saw nothing. convinced that nothing was going to happen this night, i decided to go inside.  just as i reached to open the storm door i turned and looked once more toward the street and gazed up toward the tree in my front yard. at the top of the tree i was shocked to see an object that was tranlucent in color, comming slowly toward me. i at that moment walked away from my door, down my sidewalk and into the driveway, never taking my eyes off this thing. it was approximately 15 to 20 feet in length, had no wings pinkest,red in color. it had a strange glow, almost hypnotic as it came down over the tree in front of me then came lower to the ground approximately 5 to 10 feet above my head. then it stopped. it just paused right above my head for what seem like an eternity which was really only about ten seconds then move in a continual straight line, but before it ascended above my home i shouted out \" what are you?' it never responded or reacted and just continued to float over the trees in the back yard and on toward the next block and upward. now i just want them to stop flying over my home without cause. if these creatures are trying to figure a way to communicate with us then i would suggest a better of going about it would be to acknowledge that they are here. state their purpose. and then move on. this is getting tiresome. it is making the few friends that i have think that i need psycological help and perhaps i do, but the facts stil remain the same. i have seen these things all of my life from age 5 until the present. mufon i don't want to tell your people how to do their job, but all they have to do is to look up.  thank god that the creatures don't appear to be violent or hostile. at this point they only seem to be observing. at first these things scared the (\"#$%) out of me, but after showing themselves so many times i have become acustomed to them even though each of them i seen is different with exception to

four-wheel drive trip and stopped to eat a picnic lunch, at an overlook, on the salt river, just below roosevelt dam.  \r\n\r\nafter eating lunch we walked to a location overlooking the salt river, to look at roosevelt dam and a new bridge, over the salt river canyon. for some reason i looked up in the sky and was amazed to see several white orbs moving in random directions, and at a high rate of speed, in the sky. \r\n\r\nwe watched the orbs and then noticed, what can best be described as filaments, also moving in random directions across the sky. the filaments were changing shape as they moved. both the orbs and filaments would appear and disappear.  the filaments were definitely not contrails. they moved rapidly and randomly and changed shapes. they also appeared and disappeared rapidly. as a former commercial pilot with thousands of hours of flight time, i am positive contrails do not look, or act the way the filaments we saw did.\r\n\r\nthe filaments were very interesting to watch, as they were sometimes stretched out and then would sometimes curve into arcs, like a rainbow, or into other shapes.  as mentioned both the orbs and filaments appeared and then disappeared.  this appearing and disappearing was not because they were moving and went out of sight.  sometimes the filaments and orbs would hover and then, as we watched, they would disappear. \r\n\r\nseveral other visitors came to the overlook and saw us looking up and asked about what we were looking at. we pointed out the orbs and filaments and they also saw them. we watched this display for about one-half hour, before we had to leave, in order to return to phoenix.  the dirt road from roosevelt dam to u.S. 60, is called the apache trail.  this road is very narrow, with hair pin turns and winds along the salt river.  this is a dangerous road to drive after dark, so we had to leave the overlook, or we wouldn't have made it to u.S. 60 before dark. \r\n\r\nthe attached picture was taken by my friend and shows both the orbs and one of the filaments, this was the only good picture that showed both types of ufos in the same frame. the picture is also interesting because an eagle, that was souring in the sky above us, was caught in the frame with the two types of ufos. we sent this picture and others, to dr. paul a. scowen phd, in the physics & astronomy dept., at arizona state university but he said the resolution of the digital photograph wasn���t good enough, to determine what we were seeing.\r\n\r\ni also notified the salt river project and bureau of reclamation, both involved in the operation of the roosevelt dam, of the sightings. i also let them know of our filming activity, at the overlook, when we returned with video camaras, at a later date.\r\n\r\ni look forward to getting your feedback on this picture. have you seen this type of ufo previously in any reports, or are we seeing something that can be explained? \r\n\r\ni have returned to this overlook on two other occasions and have seen the filaments again but no orbs. on one of these trips, my friend and i took high resolution video cameras with us, in hope of getting footage of the objects we were seeing. the filaments we did see appeared and then disappeared, so quickly, we could not photograph them. also, the number of filaments we saw was greatly reduced from the number we saw the first time we were at the overlook.\r\n\r\ni can best describe my feelings during and after the first sighting as being excited at the opportunity to observe this phenomenon.  being able to see the filaments on different occasions also made me realize this was't a one time event.  on the second trip, with my friend, where we took video camaras, we were both disappointed, at not being able to capture the objects on film, with good cameras.  on the trip i made alone, to the overlook and two, or three, of the filaments desended below the canyon rim, i was scared.  i have a masters degree, was in law enforcement and a commercial pilot and i can't explain what i saw.  my undergraduate degree is in biology and i taught biological and physical science and again, nothing in my experience can explain what i've seen at this location.  \r\n\r\non the trip to the overlook, that i took alone, two or three of the filaments descended below the rim of the canyon and were between where i was standing and the canyon wall. from the size of the rocks, i estimated that the filaments were approximately 60 ft. in length. the size of the orbs could not be determined, on our first trip, because we couldn���t tell the distance they were from us.\r\n\r\ni believe mufon is serious about ufo investigation and i will be happy to take one, or more, of your staff members to the location of the sightings.  because i have seen the filaments on three different occasions, i think that there is a reasonable expectation that they will appear there again.  \r\n\r\ni would suggest going to the site sometime early in january of 2011, in order to best duplicate the date, and weather conditions, when we first saw the orbs & filaments.  i am retired, so i am available at any time you want to go.  another consideration for going in january, is that, at that time there were literally dozens, of both the orbs & filaments, in the sky.    \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

very clear night and we where able to see almost every star that night. as long as i can remember, i had always been able to spot certain stars that move rapidly. you have to stare at it to distinguish if it is a stable star or if it moves. reason for that is because they camouflage along with the rest of the stars in size and color. so that night we where all looking up at the sky and took out our telescope. to my surprise i seen a star move that was very close to one of the shinier stars in the sky. it started moving upwards from my direction as if it were riding along earths outer layer. it was getting smaller and smaller in size as it moved farther away from our point of view. after 8 to 10 minutes i turned around to start looking towards another direction and i spotted another one along with my younger son next to me. at that point the rest of the family had gone inside. i really don't know what these objects are, since i mentioned before i have seen these numerous of times on a clear sky. at first when i was 16 or so, i immediately assumed that they were ufo's and thought it was pretty amazing that i had such a discovery. over the years i have come to think that perhaps they may be new satellites that the government has launched. sometimes i also like to assume that they are special jets that fly and practice at night time. altough a thought comes to me about how quickly these star look-alike objects fly so quickly and sometimes in a count of 4, from different directions. at one time i seen one come from north, and after 10 min another from east, south, and west. it seems strange but never thought of reporting anything as people might debunk me into \"it's nothing\". one strange thing i seen on friday the 25th of july 2010, is that when it started heading out of my view it somehow got brighter as if it shined a light and then went back to it's normal light activity. what could this be? all i see is star looking figures that move rapidly on a clear sky. i would like to know if anyone has also reported this so they can give me a piece of mind. i will have a camera next and hope it can catch the distance in the camera of the star like

to descend,\r\nbelow the roof line ,blocking my view and the possibility to film further!!\r\nluckily , i have my daughter sleeping room, at the second floor, where \r\ni have also an open rooftop, installed!!!\r\n\r\ni open the window large and from there i start to film further the ufo's!!!\r\nthey where still there, only at a smaller distance from the ground, but still high in the sky, ... 300-400 m?!!!\r\nanyway they where still in that 5 trapezoidal formation, !!!\r\n\r\ni tried as much as i could to take a decent footage ,trying not to shake,\r\n(too much),and zooming, slowly,....\r\n\r\nthe recordings where made with a sony crx-hd6 hd handycam, with night vision,and 20x digital zoom!\r\neven so, i could not obtain the quality i was hoping for,...\r\n\r\n\r\nthe lights,the colours, the size and clarity of the real ufo's where much better in real life(this after i replay the recording)\r\nstill the recodings they have a good quality, keeping in mind that the originals where made in hd 1440���1080 quality!!!\r\n\r\nafter another 3-5 minutes the ufo's starts to dissapear,one by one,some becoming invisibles, some descending near a forest on that area!!!\r\ni stopped recording, but i never left the place,\r\n(hoping that i will get maybe another chance of filming another ufo event)!!!\r\n\r\nhow many times in a lifetime ,we have a chance to get to see \r\n(or better),to record such an unique event?!!!\r\n\r\nwhat i will tell you surpassed my wildest dreams,..:)\r\n\r\nthe event that i was hoping to be a witness ,had happened again,..... !!!\r\nafter around ,another 1 1/2 hour (01:35am) in the morning,they have apeared,...\r\n\r\nagain,!!!! again,... 5 ufo's ,in the same position,same place ,\r\nsame high,rising above the thin horizon line,one by one,starting to change positions,and moving around (but in a close group),sometimes in a shape of  trapeze,sometimes triangle, sometimes just moving around,....\r\n\r\nthey stayed in the sky, for another 2-3 minutes, \r\nthen they aligned them self, in a line (diagonal against the horizon),...\r\nand they start to move slowly from right to left (my field of view),\r\nfurther and further away, until they totally disappeared!!!\r\nsome of the recorded footage, was also taken in infrared vision\r\n(or so called night-vision), .....\r\n\r\nto prove authenticity, of the recorded footage!!!\r\n\r\nthe details seen in the footage, are a rooftop ,from the shop in my backyard, with some flags, on the right side, far in the back a thin forest line ,and on the right side a  street light pal ,and far away on the right side a windmill use for producing electricity with warning red lights for airplanes!!!\r\n\r\ni also included a short footage with an airplane just passing by, for the nonbelievers, so they can made a comparison , with the real ufo's filmed above!!!(they way the lights, shapes and size apear in the sky!!!\r\nall the recordings are conversions from hd cam recordings in mp4 format,\r\nwith unedited audio,for authenticity!!!\r\nbest to be seen with divx player !!!\r\n\r\nif \"mufon\" is interested in the real footage, i can provide,\r\nthe real hd recordings,(the one from this july, \r\nand another one rom last year in dec).....\r\nrecordings watermarked with the time and date when where taken!!!\r\n(just crediet my recordings,on my name)\r\n\r\nand now,about the other event surprised on video,...\r\nit's  not my first experience (concerning ufo sighting),...\r\n\r\nlast year on dec.31 2009 i filmed another ufo just passing by, next to my house, when i was busy launching the fire works for the new year eve!!!\r\nthe event has last about 2-3 minutes, (in a shape of a sphere of light),\r\nred-yellow,flying low (about 100-200m),in totally silence,from right to left until has dissapeared from our field of view, behind my house!!!\r\n\r\nimportant to mention...\r\nthe ufo was flying in the same direction, from where the actual 5 ufo's formation where appeared or have lift up!!!\r\n\r\nafter some aproximate estimations, the place where ufo's stationed in the sky, and where the other ufo was flying( the one filmed last year),\r\nis near a forest in the proximity of an small military airfield from ursel\r\n(small village in east flanders),next to the seaside!\r\n\r\ni hope that,...Has been another piece of information,disclosed to unbelievers, or sceptics, all over the world!!!\r\nadvise to all the gov.Organisations, who just want to make us believe,\r\nthat everything we see in the sky are just another space debris, venus planet,ice or reflexions of gases , aurora borealis, etc!!!\r\n\r\ngod thanks to internet , who opened the doors to truth and free information!!!\r\n\r\nthank you,...\r\n\r\np.S. the footage exposed here is a exclusivity ,in belgium\r\nand world wide!\r\nnone of the recordings were aired on any tv news, or internet till now!\r\nalso to mention, that no info in the news on belgium national or private networks, neither on radio were made public or exposed!!!\r\nso, \"mufon\" here is a exclusivity just for you, as a thank to your help, and efforts to keep us informed

job entailed flight following airliners flying across arabia and up and down the red sea, going to somalia, yemen and north to african countries.  \r\n   during a night shift, i was flight following several airliners both north and south along the red sea.  *(potential identifying info deleted -- sgonzalez/cms.  i saw a non iff/sif \"skin paint\" on my radar that presented a rather big blip and transmitted to my north bound airliner to be alert for an \"unknown aircraft\" near their position.  the pilot radioed his \"roger\" and bore on through the sky.  about a minute later, my radio came to life with, \"jesus christ khamis, what the hell is this thing. it just crossed right in front of us and its turbulence rocked our ship.\"  \r\n   i told the pilot that i could still see the \"target\" on my radar but had no radio contact with it.  i had another airliner coming south along the red sea about 25 miles north of the sighting aircraft.  he was separated by 2000 feet altitude and would pass almost directly over the sighting aircraft.  that pilot was monitoring our atc frequency and radioed me, \"khamis radar, i have a radar target dead ahead and its not (the call sign of the sighting airliner) lighting up the sky like a beacon.  at ths point, the two airline pilots started talking as they closed head on but separated by altitude.  \r\n   with a minute, all three merged on my radar, the two commercials and the ufo.  \"what the f--- is that\" said one of them.  the other pilot replied, \"looks like a huge wingless plane with a glow that lights up my ship and the thing has some windows along it bottom half.  buddy, i think we've just seen a real ufo.\"  \r\n   there followed a three way animated conversation between myslf and the two commercial planes as they separated north and south.  the raw radar target remained in the area where the planes had passed each other for a few minutes than completely faded from our radar.  the pilot of one of the planes asked me, \"khamis, are you going to file a ufo report about this big craft that nearly hit us?\" \r\n   i replied, \"no sir.  if you want to file with your company, you can cite our radar visuals\"'  one of the pilots responded, \"that's the kiss of death for my flying future my friend.  negative.\"  the other plane pilot replied, \"amen.\"  \r\n   end of narrative.\r\n

( terrified at this point ) once inside, some doors opened and figures began to move toward us.  while being still extremely fightened, at the same time i was kinda interested and curious about these beings and this flying craft.  i am a licensed airframe and powerplant mechanic and at the time had spent 6 & 1/2 years in the usaf. one figure in a gray jump suit approached my side of the car and two figures in blue clad suits approached my friends side of the car.  i was getting this audible message from the one that approached me that they weren't going to harm us.  he was saying ( almost telepathically ), do not be afraid, we will not harm you.  at this point, i began to calm down.  my friend was extremely excited and was shouting and cursing at the same time and i screamed at him to shut the f--- up!  i opened my door and got out and started to ask questions as to what is going on, why do you want us, how does this thing fly, can i see the rest of it and others.  the figure that approached me, led me away from the car and toward a door.  i looked back at my friend and the two figures were laying him in a proped position on the seat and he was apperently asleep. i remember thinking, that was what he was wanting to do before we were picked up.  to make a long story short, i made the tour of the ship and talked with these beings for a while.  apperently, we were on this ship for about 4 hrs.  at one point, i remember getting hold of a book that had different colored pages in it and asking if i could keep it.  they told me i could, but later took it back before releasing us. when released, i was given a warning to share and give to the people of our nation.  for years now, i have been afraid to tell this story, because of repurcussions, especially since i have served 31 yrs. in the usaf.  now i am retired and in light of what is going on in the world, this warning needs to be shared with the whole world.  the beings on the ufo ship, told me that they had been watching our planet for many years.  they stated,  that in that time they realized the we are a war like world and have pursued more and bigger and more destructive weapons of war.  yhey further stated that they had contacted all the governments of the world and tried to warn them and pursuade them of an alternate direction, but to no avail.  at that time, they had also realized that ultimately the governments of the world were controlled by the people.  as such, for this reason, since our govts. werent listening, they were picking up people from all walks of life to give this message to in hopes that a terrible tradgedy could be prevented.  at this point, they asked if i knew what a quasar was.  i let them know that i did and they seemed somewhat surprised when i told the it was an inter galactic storm of planets being destroyed.  this is when they gave me their reason for my ride.  they said, that if our nations persue this war like attitude and use these ultimate weapons that we have developed, that we could destroy this planet.  in doing this, it would trigger a quasar which in turn would destroy their planet.  they said also, that before they would let this happen, they would destroy mankind.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":24761,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.2255797,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07262010-0004","longitude":-92.0148227,"occurred":307592400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280156376000,"summary":"Round..Saucer shape, glowing lite blue. very large.","tags":["saucer"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":11256,"locationName":"Lafayette, Louisiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:107969"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Baltimore","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"About 3 am i saw a sphere appear to the west of baltimore, traveling east at a high rate of speed. 3 other spheres followed at different elevations, all moving acoss the sky towards the east. all 4 disappeared quickly once past baltimore. conditions were no to low wind, clear sky, no clouds, almost a full moon visible to the west. i contacted 911. the operator said they were coming from the airport. i told her these were not lights, but had mass/objects. she agreed that they were not lights but the airport was using something to help planes land. her explaination makes no sense. perfect flying conditions, 3am in the morning,helping planes land where???, in the atlantic ocean???
