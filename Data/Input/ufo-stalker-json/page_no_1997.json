were talking about dreams and aliens as we made it pass the first intersection of commons way and prince rodgers ave. \r\n\r\nwe proceeded onto prince rodgers ave for about one minute when my girlfriend noticed something in the sky. \r\n\r\nshe said to me \"what is that\".  i didn't know what she was looking at so i said, \"those are buildings\". she said to me \"no not those, that thing in the sky right there.\"  i turned my head for a second and could not believe what i saw.  \r\n\r\nas we approached the red light at the intersection of prince rodgers ave and north bridge st. i noticed an object in the sky coming from the somerville, nj area.\r\n\r\nthis object appeared very low to the ground, i am aware normal aircraft must be approximately 6 miles above the surface to be legally in our airspace.\r\n\r\nwhat was even more peculiar was the object was silent. i am highly aware that planes, helicopters, and blimps produce a specific sound depending on their altitude.\r\n\r\nnow the image of this object is rather bizarre.  it had a flat bottom portion that consisted of way more than 25 lights. they would flash in a specific random sequence, turn off for a second or two, turn back on and begin flashing again. they were also accompanied by a blue light on the side.  it was very hard to tell the depth and true image of the top portion of the object, but it had one nonetheless.  \r\n\r\nfor a moment i thought maybe it was a blimp, but the speed of this object exceeded that of a blimp.  as the light turned green, i made a right turn onto north bridge street. however, i was going in the opposite direction because i was low on gas and had to get home so i could not keep up with it. so i pulled over and made a quick stop at the nearest bank. i parked and realized we were directly below the object but it didnt stop, being underneath this thing we just gazed at its lights and their bizarre sequence as it passed overhead. \r\n\r\neventually it passed behind trees that blocked my sight of it and i lost the object.  me and my girlfriend both sat in shock not knowing what we just saw and realizing not a single person would believe us at all. fear seemed to summon within me for i was afraid of what i saw and could not explain it or why i was able to see it.  \r\n\r\nif someone were to approach me on the 23rd and said to me, \"do you believe in aliens\" i would have said not really, i mean we may not be alone but who really knows. but now, i'm pretty much a firm believer that we are not alone and that they are here with us every day hiding in plain sight. \r\n\r\nalso it was quite odd to me that on my way back home to somerville, nj.  i just wanted to keep driving around for a bit so i went down to our main st. and to my confusion there were a lot of cops following each other as if they were trying to find something. i eventually made a right turn onto davenport st. and went home.\r\n\r\nfor those who do not believe in ufo's, i just want to say one thing. i once was just like you. \r\n\r\ni also want to add - the path of the object, it was coming straight then it slowed down turned alittle bit but turned back on its path. it was like watching someone not be able to make up their mind. it was weird because i know planes and helicopters all make wide turns, these turns were fairly quick.","distance":"Over One

going south south east. at a speed of 200 mph. or slightly faster. the wind at the time was a light breeze if that at ground level. this object was seen by me when it was about the half way point from

very, very large, perhaps a mile wide or more.\r\n\r\ntelepathic communication is new to me. i started being contacted several weeks ago by the one we used to call jesus (that was never his real

downloaded into my awareness the proper way to model how ions are made from the vacuum of space. i have been writing physics papers these last few weeks. before i began receiving these downloads i was

\r\n\r\ni attended the natural philosophy alliance last month and spoke with many presenters there. i was able to teach them many things they had not considered though they were on the right track with aether physics. one of them, john milewski phd wants to make me a partner in his firm that applies his own model for magnetic light to gold extraction. i explained to him the physics of alchemy, anti-gravity and zero point free energy (zero spark or moving parts and zero input needed). john knew enough to know the physics i showed him are for real so now i have a new career.\r\n\r\nthe point

near my house, i always look up and see if anything is up there.  never, until june 9th was there.  as i looked in the sky i saw 3 helicopters in a triangular formation more of an obtuse formation, if i'm using that term correctly, one helicopter was farther away than a normal triangle.  at any rate, i slowed down to get a look at them, seemingly strange they were just sitting there as we have no airports around this area that i am aware.  the nearest airport i know of is in south lakeland, some 20 miles away. realizing something may be up, i noted the time as 11:02pm.  i made a u-turn on a nearby street and as i came back to the stop sign to turn back right to see them again, i looked across the street and in the sky was the brightest \"star\" i'd ever seen! i noted it's position as being directly across of the field in which i observed the 3 helicopters.  as i returned to the field at exactly 11:03 in which i saw these 3 helicopters they were nowhere to be seen or heard.  i know this because no traffic was in the area that late at night.  i got out of my truck which i had turned off and listened keenly for the \"chop\" of the helicopter.  i did not hear it.   these mysterious helicopters were simply gone, and not heard.  out here in this area you can hear tires screeching on interstate 4 which is some 4 miles away.  i should have heard something.  leaving the scene at the field disappointed i headed back south to take my cousin home.  i traveled west on marcum road and looked for the \"star\" but did not see it, the time then was 11:18pm.  i looked farther away and saw a red in color \"orb\" or \"sphere\" which was far away enough to be over the gulf of mexico but very high in the sky.  the gulf of mexico from here is approximately 60 miles.  that is the last i saw of anything.  excitement was a feeling i got from seeing everything happen that night.  another feeling i got was strange, it hit me hard too, the feeling was as if i were in a \"crossfire\" of sorts.  the thought i had was these 3 helicopters were defending air space from this brilliant blue object.  i am a believer. i called it an \"otherworldly standoff\".

(only round)\r\n\r\n* they were pulsating in differnt colors (but no sound). \r\n\r\n* they were close enough where i could hit them easily with a stone.\r\n\r\ncontinuing ... as they moved towards me, i turned on my brothers police issued flashlight that he would let me use when i worked at this location (field) it was very dark and there were no street lights in that area.\r\n\r\nanyway that's how i knew there were no markings or numbers on these objects and the flashlight did not cast a reflection.\r\n\r\nthey came to a complete stop directly over me for about 30 seconds, that's when i thought about picking up a rock and throwing at them. i didn't because it would have been awkward to throw at something straight-up in the air. (however they were close enough for me to do it with ease.)\r\n\r\nthe next thing i knew in a flash or the blink on an eye they were gone!\r\nso i called down to hq (walkie-talkie) and reported what i just saw, and made notes in my report.\r\n\r\nminutes later the night sky was buzzing with fighter jets f-15 that i assume were scrambled from wright patterson air force base located in dayton,ohio.\r\n\r\n when i got off that morning (0600) i was called to hq to give a  full report of what happened to the capt.\r\n\r\nto be honest i don't think anyone believed what i saw, so when i got home that morning my mother had made breakfast for van and i at which time i told her every detail of what happened, and i even drew her a picture.\r\n\r\nafter breakfast i went to bed for several hours because i had to be back at work later that night again from 2400-0600 in the same field/post.\r\n\r\nwhen i woke up for dinner that evening my mother had the local news paper (lorain journal) waiting for me at the table. on the front page was a picture of what i drew for her and several witness's testimonies.\r\n\r\nnot only did i see these things but a doctor, lawyer, police officer, nurse, fireman and a few others. the only differnce between them and myself is that they saw these things from a distance, where as i saw them up close and personal. \r\n\r\nafter i got out of the military i moved to atlanta,ga (south of the city) and on a few occasions have seen these things again. only not in a cluster (group) but one at a time, and i have contacted the faa (hampton center) that is near my home about this.\r\n\r\n one of my close friends is a supervisor (air traffic controler) at the hampton center but was off the night i called in to report the object.\r\n\r\nthank you!\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n*(wit's name deleted--sgonzalez/cms).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":24740,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.456819,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242010-0007","longitude":-82.1743746,"occurred":488962800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1280020738000,"summary":"Group of glowing balls.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":9155,"locationName":"Lorain, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:108461"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Limestone","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on our back deck at approx 10 pm and off too my left i observed a colorfull object slowly come into veiw over some trees. it was triangular in shpe with a whie light in the front and one on each rear corner for a total  of three. various colors took up the center of the craft. the craft was going very slow with no sound.My wife witnessed the object as well as it slowly floated over us.She run for the camera but by the time she returned the craftpicked up speed and went into a bank of clouds.All we were sure of is this object was quite low however i would only be guessing at it's dimensions as it was against a dark cloudy sky.We arn't sure what we saw but we know what it wasn't. any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

but i noticed tonight that its path was a little off of what it usually is... so while watching it - i saw an approaching airplane that was headed right towards it, i watched, totally stunned, totally forgetting my freaking camera was in my hand!!! well as i was watching this airplane getting closer, it moved, the light moved! it moved up quickly and stopped, it moved out of the way of the airplane... the airplane did not change its course it still kept going straight and it flew right under it... after it passed, the light moved back to where it was and proceeded along its route --- i am still ... wow... the airplane flew under it!!! it moved out of the airplanes way! i am amazed. i am so mad at myself for not getting that, i came in and told my boyfriend and he just shook his head at me and was reminding me i did have my camera out there with me... i felt like such an ass!!!!!!!!!!!!! i watched the light till i couldn't anymore and as it was almost out of my site it changed in color to a firey orange. it is usually all white with some mild flicker of color, but it does it so it blends with the white.\r\n\r\nlight #2:\r\nalso seemed different tonight, its not as bright as it usually is, and is moving a little more sporadically, in circles, small circles. i tried to video it but of course my camera only has a 3x zoom, which is crap for this stuff...\r\n\r\nother lights:\r\ni have still been seeing them, just not as many.\r\n\r\nnew light a:\r\nthere was a new light out there tonight, it flew parrallel with a few airplanes, for only a few feet and then would stop. it seemed like it was pretty close to them too.\r\n\r\nnew light b:\r\ni saw another new one tonight, it was as bright as lights 1 & 2, and this one dimmed and almost dissapeared when an airplane got near it. i could still see it, just not as good, i lost it after the plane when by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni filed out one of these reports already, i am interested in someone coming out so i can point out what i am seeing, so it can be investigated. i was contacted by a mufon rep. via email, i replied several times asking him to call me and have not received a phone call. so i would still like a phone call. \r\n\r\ni have spotted so many of the things that are like lights 1&2 and am interested in posibly being able to find out what they are.\r\n\r\nyears ago, i saw one out back in the sky in glen burnie. i got in my car to see if i could find it. i did, it was hoving above the power plant on ft smallwood rd.\r\n\r\nso please i want someone from mufon to come and investigate, i just want to stay anonymous.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":24736,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.6600473,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242010-0003","longitude":-77.1672779,"occurred":1279946700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279963899000,"summary":"Light in the sky moved for airplane.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Taneytown, Maryland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:108463"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Midland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was taking the garbage out to our apartments dumpster.  looked up in the sky over the fence line and saw a bright light in the sky, it was circular and moving in my direction. it was moving really slowly, no sounds, or anything coming from it. it was about 500 yards away and about 500 or so feet in the air, when i heard a helicopter coming from the opposite direction. the circular craft, stopped moving in my direction and went off at an angle and was gone in about 10 seconds. the helicopter was just passing over our apartments when the ufo was no longer visable. the helicopter turned in the direction the ufo was going in.","distance":"501 Feet -

the atlantic ocean facing due south.  about 9:30 pm as we were talking, one of our family members (there were four of us that witnessed this) said \"what is that?\"  i looked to the sky and there were two orange/yellow lights in the sky above the ocean directly out from our deck...They seemed to be fairly close to together (more apart than two headlights coming toward you), and were fairly bright, like a street light from about a 100 yards away.  there was a pretty bright moon out over the ocean, and they were just under the moon, so they were pretty high up (unless they were much closer to shore than we thought,  but definitely not on the water).  after about two seconds, the left-most light turned off, then three or four more lights to the right all came on.  they were on for another 3-5 seconds, then all of them went dark.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound of any engines in the air.  all of the lights were in a parallel line with the horizon.  during the time the lights were on, they didn't move at all.  we first thought fireworks, as when it reaches it zenith, and right before it explodes,  but these lights couldn't have been fireworks as they floated still for several seconds and were in such perfect parallel order.  \r\n\r\nwe did notice a lot more airplane activity over the ocean after this incident, but it may have been because we were looking for it.  perhaps something with the military was our first guess.\r\n\r\nabout 50 minutes later, we did notice two more similar lights in the distance come on, but there was some clouds and it wasn't as clear.  they seemed further away as well.  \r\n\r\nbased on the angle, we could also discount boats, as they were much higher in the air.\r\n\r\nwe had several feelings after seeing them, trying to determine what we saw.  it was as if it was a line of silent helicopters hovering over the ocean and they turned their lights on for a few seconds, then turned off, like they had to mark something.  but with the moonlight providing some light in the evening sky, we couldn't see the shapes of anything once the lights went off.  it was like whatever generated the lights simply vanished with no sound.\r\n\r\ni'd love to

road d in phillips, wi.  upon walking out to the gravel parking lot toward my vehicle, i notice a bright light in the sky at aircraft level traveling from north to south.  i assumed (due to the single light) that it was probably a helicopter.  upon entering my vehicle and facing it south towards the parking lot exit, i notice that the light changed direction and was now traveling from east to west in the direction i was turning.  upon reaching the intersection between d and highway 13 a quarter mile down the road, i noticed the light was no longer paralleling the road and did not think anything of it.\r\ni would not see the light again for several minutes.  upon taking a right turn to head south on thirteen, and a subsequent left onto county road f at the corner by harbor view supper club and proceeding another half mile the light reappeared.  it seemed to be paralleling my path down the road and wavering back and forth slightly as it moved.  i convinced myself it was an optical illusion created my staring at a distant star from a moving vehicle.  however, when i reached the bend in the road just before county road f intersects with county road s i was proven wrong.  the disk shot over the treetops as soon as i hit the corner and appeared to stop above the treetops in the middle of the field which is owned now by a local tree farmer.  as i turned onto s and proceeded home and approached the middle of the field the object seem to lower its altitude.  as i drew near, it suddenly moved across the field and blocked my path in the road.  the object appeared oval shaped and backlit.  (much like when someone holds a flashlight directly in your eyes so that you cannot see them)  it was large enough that it stretched from one end of the road to the other.  i immediately stopped my vehicle and put the car in park.  the object was approximately 20 feet above the ground at this point.  my window was rolled down and my radio was not on.  i remember thinking about how crazy it was that i could hear the hum of my car and crickets chirping in the ditch, but no sound came from this object.\r\nafter approximately thirty or so seconds (it seemed longer but could not have been) the object lowered to about the height of the roof of my car and began to approach my vehicle.  i felt the hair rise on the back of my neck in a manner which i would compare to that of an excited dog.  i assumed at the time it was out of fear, but now also remember somewhat of a heat or electricity in the air.  at this point i placed my vehicle in reverse, performed a quick y turn, and sped away from the object.  i could see its reflection in my rear view mirror until i was back on county road f and heading back to town.  i sped back to town, stopped at what is now a bp gas station, and phone my parents to let them know about the event.  they advised me that i had to get home somehow and may as well come back.  that made sense lol.  \r\nwhen i eventually returned to the field the object was sitting again at treetop level in the far corner of the field.  it appeared to have changed in color from a bright white light to a more vanilla color.  i again stopped my vehicle at the midpoint of the field, and it again moved to block the roadway.  it maintained a height of approximately 40 feet from the ground.  i observed the object for approximately a minute and a half.  at this point another vehicle turned up county s behind me.  as soon as the other vehicle came into sight, the object moved from a dead stop to a speed i could barley follow heading directly north and was suddenly gone.  that is the end of my experience.\r\n\r\nthere was no missing time or anything else odd about the occurrence apart from the obvious.  \r\n\r\ni wish i worked for the government concerning this topic.  it has held my curiosity strongly since.  i do believe that these are either government vehicles or legitimate intelligently controlled vehicles not originating on earth.  i could understand in either instance the government���s desire to keep this out of sight.  the et explanation would do well to hide important aerospace technology.  if i were under government employ regardless of the case, i would certainly keep this intelligence a secret in the course of serving my country.
