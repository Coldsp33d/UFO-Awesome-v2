on for about 5 seconds and then just disappeared. our other friend also saw it but myself and my sons did not. i sat down in one of the other chairs and started to watch the sky. the moon was very bright and the beach and skies were fairly light. my 2 friends stood near their fishing poles. i had asked him where exactly they had seen the lights so i could focus my time on that area. they told me it was to the left of the moon and pointed to a star as reference.\r\nit was about 5 minutes after that that i was setting there watching when all of a sudden 6 lights in a triangle shape came on. the lights were very very bright and orange. it was almost as if they were illuminating or glowing. they were pointed in my direction as if it were coming my way. i had yelled to my friends to look up in the sky. my one friend looked up and saw the lights and said it was almost exactly what he had seen a few minutes earlier only they were in a different part of the sky. they were to the left of the moon. then they just disappeared as quickly as they had appeared. im 100% positive that this was not any sort of conventional aircraft. it was almost surreal and seemed that it had changed locations from the first time it was seen. we sat there for the rest of the night (appx another 2 hrs) observing and hoping to get some photos. it did not make another appearance.","distance":"Over One

helicopter flying at such a low altitude (we do live near enough to cleveland hopkins airport and the metropolitan hospitals and are familiar with the types of aircraft in the area). it was a very quick, arched, fluid flight path. there was no noise, nor any lights. it's hard to explain, but it seemed to glow, but it wasn't lit up. it was like a grey contrast to the sky. it flew silently overhead heading towards the lake. we lost sight of it once it reached the treetops. we both asked one another if each had witnessed it and when we went back inside, we both drew what we thought we had seen and we drew the same shape. i don't know if this was a ufo or not, but we can honestly say we have never seen anything like it, nor have seen anything like it

was about 35 to 40 ft wide and about 10 feet high. we managed to keep up but it shot at least 10 miles ahead of us in a matter of seconds. no afterburner and no sound.It was gone so fast after traveling so slow over the trees.\r\n      the most extreme encounter i had was in 1999. a friend and i were about 5 miles from the most recent sighting . we were on sylvan road in manchester mi. we were heading south down a winding hill and we could see bright lights in the distance maybe a half a mile ahead. they we on the left side of the road and as we got closer i realized they were coming from the sky. at first i thought helicopters but the lights were to close together. when we got within 500 feet i realized it was actually a ufo scanning the woods for something but as we approached the lights went off and the craft shot verically into the sky.It was about 300ft long with huge spotlights on the bottom. we have also seen huge triangle shaped crafts. along with strange military planes who also seem to be searching 4 something.\r\n

for an impact, the way you might imagine in a movie, a boom and cloud of dust.  as i attempted to describe it to our friends, the hair on my arms came up. i stood and watched the sky where the event happened and saw the blinking lights of a low flying helicopter not too long afterwards. about 15 minutes after the event my son and i drove not too far down a back road hoping to see something. only
