definitly dark-  sun had just set. i'm opening the passanger car door when for some reason i looked up at the sky. coming across the very top of the tree line in the residential area which surrounds the marina was a deep, bright orange glowing sphere. i'm guessing about 36-42 inches in diameter perhaps a little larger like the size of a beach ball, for example. i immedialty shouted \"look girls a chinese latern\". in my brain all i could think was that this was some sort of fireworks toy like the parachutes we shot off as children but i've  never heard of chinese latern fireworks & i don't know why that popped into my head. the only chinese latern reference i know in my world is a blooming plant called a chinese latern that produces little round orange balls. that's the same shape & color as this object in the sky- so i was watching & waiting for something to happen like fireworks. but it just kept floating there in the same place. no sound. i turned around to see where the kids were-  if they too were seeing this but they were exhausted and already in the back seat of the car. i looked back up at the sky and it seemed to be slowly moving up & away from the tree tops moving in a very slow pulsating sort of way, like the way a jelly fish moves through the water. suddenly a man was at my car door and we were both watching the sky again i said \"chinese latern\" and he looked at me as though i were crazy and repeated with a question \"chinese latern???\" i replied \"i've got 2 kids with me so right now that's a chinese latern\" in that brief exchange i took my eyes off the object and again turned around to see the kids were still in car-  their mother had her head in the trunk packing up coolers, toys etc. i couldn't have taken my eyes off it for more than a few seconds then i looked back up at the sky and it was no more than an orange dot- now super far up & away. how could it move that fast, i asked myself. there is no way it could be that far away in 3 or 4 seconds. but it was. i could still see the distinctive orange color but it was so far up at this point it was a mere dot in the sky. the man next to me was gone. i wish i had gotten his name.I never felt scared, just curious. i've always believed that ufo's do exist but have never thought i've seen one. once we left parking lot i knew it was a ufo.","distance":"101-500

the craters i was using 25mm lens(which shows the whole moon). at that moment this space craft ( i call it space craft because i could identify it very easily so it wasnt a ufo) it entered my view and when it reached the middle of my lens, it made a complete u turn banking left and when it turned i could see the whole surface of it very clear. thanks the light that moon was creating i could actually see the whole craft in detail. it was the best seconds of my life that i came to accept the fact that extraterrestrials are here. it was not a satellite. i know the difference between a satellite that enters your lens from right side and crosses at a very high speed and exits your view. this thing was shaped like a boomerang and it was silverish titanium kind of color or material. i could see 3 lines that were dividing the whole craft in 3 pieces. i know what i saw and i dont know if anyone else encountered what i saw and the detail i saw. i consider myself to be one of the luckiest persons alive who actually saw it in detail. i assure you that the craft was below the atmosphere. when i see a satellite on telescope they are just a tiny little black dot travelling at a very high speed. the craft that i saw wasnt travelling more than maybe 200mph. which is very slow for any craft thats in the air. especially when it entered the u turn, it slowed down quite a bit. i think if any aircraft slows that much in our technology it will stall and just fall out of the sky. because we do not have the technology to use to overcome the gravity. but this craft obviously wasnt limited by our gravitation. if you need any more information on this encounter you can contact me

times. in different areas, at different view points. i submitted good photos of what i had seen before. i wish i could have take photos of this.  it starts out looking like a small cloud like object, then almost looks like a needle with slight ovular a loop in the top end. it eventually gains a bright star like point and all together vanishes. if someone else saw this please contact me, i wear glasses, but this i saw clearly multiple times. it was a tiny bit cloudy but did not hinder visibility. i would estimate it was high, but low enough to where driving down the freeway i was able to \"swing\" around it a tiny bit. i would have to guess it came from the north west towards the south east and then curved up in to space. i am familiar with all sorts of helicopters and aircraft and it was nothing like them. it was not stars, or weather phenomenon either. at one point it looked like the star was the tip of something in our atmosphere. in a since it is almost more bizarre to me than if i had a close encounter. and since i have seen it more than once i feel like its teasing me now. my friend who is educated and knowledgeable like me could not figure out what it was either. i will keep my eye out for it again and try to take more pictures of the phenomenon. i marked partially cloudy, but it was slightly cloudy. it always it overcast heading in towards lax. we were going to

only sighted, by estimate, over a thousand of these spheres of all sizes in a single event, but also encounters with beings.  i assume mst is mountain stantard time for the us.  i did check sphere, however the first one may have been rectangular, or a rectangular opening.  previous to this event, i had not noticed any ufo's; i did have encounters with invisible beings displaying mass, intelligence, and a good grip on american english.  up to the november event, i assumed i was in a technology test area for invisibilty, and i assumed the invisibles were humans in suits just dicking with me.  way too much to write about here, so i will move on to the november 2009 event.\r\n\r\nplease understand i have been reluctant to tell this to very many folks for good reason; the whole sequence of events for the last two years has made me quite sure i do not understand as much about the physical and spiritual creation as i thought i did. \r\n\r\n\r\nto begin, the event is a 3 day sequence.  tuesday the 17th around 9:30pm i stepped out the back door to have a cigarette.  i had just lit it and was looking to the west when i saw a large emerald green meteor streak across the sky from nnw headed ssw and appeared to land in southeastern utah or northeastern arizona.  while i was still in the wow mode, i glanced to the south and spotted two human looking beings in dark suits with what looked like helmets on, walking next to the woods about 50 feet away.  they stopped when i said, \"cool tech. you ought to share it with me\".  they hustled off like they were surprised i saw them.  the next morning there was one mention on the early news about the meteor.\r\n\r\nthe next night, the 18th, i stepped out about 9:30pm to have a cigarette when a little girl with long blonde hair, in a light dress, no coat, and no shoes came skipping up the sidewalk toward me with a little blonde boy in short pants, no coat, and no shoes running behind her, and a man at the end of the sidewalk by the shed just standing.  the sidewalk is about 50 feet long.  the temperature was in the high 30's f and there was patchy snow on the ground. the little girl and the little boy came right up to me and they both smiled and the little girl waved, or i realized later was pointing up.  neither one said a thing when i asked where their coats and shoes were and if they needed help.  the little girl did wave at me then, turned around and skipped back down the sidewalk with the little boy right behind her.  they stopped by the man and i asked again if i could help them and no one answered.  i crushed my smoke and stepped in the house and locked the door and sat down.  i was kinda weirded out for about three minutes before my concience took over and i decided they were vagrants and i ought to give them food and clothing and maybe lodging until i found out more.  i put my coat back on, went outside, walked down to the end of the sidewalk where they still were standing, but the man had moved off about 20 feet.  i asked them again if they needed help, but they shook their heads in a side to side 'no' motion and kept trying to sign to me.  they obviously weren't deaf, but they would not or could not speak to me, while they kept motioning and signing trying to get me to understand something.  the man just stood off motionless and silent. i don't how long this went on while they would look questioningly at each other, then go through another round of motions and signs while i made numerous wrong verbal guesses.  i was pretty sure they had to be freezing their buns off by this time because i had thermal underwear and a heavy coat on, and i was getting chilly.  finally the little girl looked really frustrated, kinda leaned back with arms out, and palms up motioning with a ta da, here it is, will you look up you bonehead, look!  i did finally to see a rectangular opening closing on a huge craft that took up most of the sky just before clouds enveloped it then disappeared.  the sky and the stars took on a way different look than i had ever seen.  the little girl, the little boy, and the man remained, and the little girl seemed to be the one most responsible for communicating with me.  the only time the man made any move was when i pulled out my cell phone for more light to see what the little kids were trying to communicate me and the little girl kinda startled for a moment before she realized i wasn't a threat.  things got really weird from this point forward.  i began to reason how to do a valid reality check on myself if i had slipped into cartoonland madness.  i knew my fingers, toes, and nose were getting cold.  i was more afraid of madness, than anything that was happening.  in fact, i reasoned that this episode was making alot of sense even though it was exceeding anything i had ever heard of happening, or even imagined as far as what might be possible in this realm of existance.  continuing: they got so tired of asking about their physical comfort and the cold, different kinds of clothes appeared on them and they seemed to getting impatient with me.  did say getting weirder?  three more little kids began appearing and disappearing while they morphed into animals i had never seen.  they got me to realize they wanted me to lay on my back on the sidewalk and watch the sky.  when i did all disappeared but the man, and he changed position while keeping his distance.  at this point, spheres began appearing from near orion and getting larger and larger as some would stop right above me, then take off in varied directions, some disappearing as they went, some changing color and pattern schemes, but still spheres, while others positioned themselves like sentries.  i watched this for i don't know how long(i

all-\r\n\r\nin addition to the above stories, on july 4th, while riding my bike home from a friend's between 11:30/ 12am, i noticed some interesting lights in the sky. about 8 or so glowing, orangish, same -sized, very slow moving orbs almost hanging in the south/ southeast sky. i glanced over and saw other folks, in their yards and such, looking up at the lights too, so i pulled over and asked a few what they thought. the majority of responses hadn't a clue, but most had been watching for at least 10 minutes. i finished my ride home and hurriedly ushered my housemate, rob, outside to get a glimpse before they disappeared. a  few were still 'hanging out', shimmering a bit, moving behind clouds and such, while the rest seemed to either vanish or simply move out of visual range. i stupidly remembered i had a camera in my bag, and quickly grabbed it to attempt some lame video footage (it looks ok, but nothing spectacular-- the best part about it was rob saying 'that's definitely some x-files ****'). we both pretty much wrote the experience off to '4th of july' antics by whomever-- maybe huge flares attached to weather balloons, or possibly even some type of military experiment/ or hoax? \r\n\r\nanyhow, the next day i decided to check out the local newspapers-- nothing, of course. upon scanning the internet, though, i quickly came across multiple stories of sightings from around the area-- including most of oregon and into washington. hmmm. a few days later, still no 'mainstream' news action, yet to my surprise many many more stories on the web from around the entire country-- same type of sightings described almost exactly, and around the exact same time of night (timezone differences not withstanding)! there are even reports from ontario and other parts of canada... crazy, right? further research shows that these sightings have continued to at least july 8th, and now this wild story about the chinese airport shutting down due to 'ufo' activity (including cool video footage), it really makes one wonder, no? just what is going on.... \r\n\r\nanyone else out there see anything besides the fireworks?

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  my experience started when i was hanging out with one of my friends at his apartment in tewksbury ma.  one late night around 1:30 in the morning a star like object, star like in the type of blinking, non-constant light that it emitted, began to rise above the treeline you can see from his porch.  it was ignorable until the movements did not match any known planes or helicopters that i am used to seeing on a regular basis.  it rose, in scale, about one inch in the sky, about 6 inches to the right, back down an inch, rising to the left about an inch up and 6 inches out.  that light made enough of an impression on me that for the next few weeks, i kept my eyes to the sky.  this one night, back at my house in billerica, ma, i was again awake at around 12:30 1 am, and i noticed a similar light in almost the same position in the sky.  i thought considering how bright it was that it was potentially a star or even venus, but after watching the amount of progress this object made moving across the sky while the other stars in the area were stationary, i was sure this was the same object.  i watched it for at least 2 hours just cruising at a relatively low elevation.  during those two hours, a red blinking light accompanied its airspace, coming from the south east sky, moving to the northeast then north part of the sky, and then it would go bak where it came into sight.  it would repeat this several times over the course of the night, while the main bright light just continued to hover slowly over the general area.  after noticing those two objects faithfully for a week at the same times of night, i decided to call my friend in tewksbury, \"pete\", and after describing what part of the sky to look, i told him about this light.  giving him the description of the object and its placement in the sky, he told me, \"that's exactly where the light i always see is.\"  right when he recognized the object i was talking about, the power on my street began to go out, starting at one end of the road and blackening all the way to where i was.  at the moment that my power went out, a bright white flased seemed to bring on the darkness.  instatnly i had chills from head to toe and i told my friend, \"jeff\" i was with to drive to petes.  driving there, i kept my eye on the still stationary light in its position in the sky.  after turning on to 129 in billerica, the object began to accelerate and decelerate at an amazing speed, almost as if it were chasing us.  its elevation was relatively low as it continued chasing me, until i got to petes apartment.  by the time i got there, pete was asleep, and the light was floating high above the parking lot.  after i decided to go home, i again looked at the light, which for the rest of the night stayed there and never left.  that was at 3:30 in the morning.  that was the only hair-raising experience this object has given me, but writing this in late july, 2010, the object is still there faithfully, every clear night.  this after multiple other sightings/experiences at my house makes 6 events that i have yet come to a definite conclusion as to what happened, all happening at my house, not just my road, but my property.  i feel this object needs to be reported, as it is one of the only times an object is faithfully in the same sky every night.  thanks for listening.","distance":"Over One

me at the window in the hallway at first floor. \r\n\r\ni didn���t why but i have the feeling that something guided me to this window and i must look out. then i must strech me too see the discs. the disc on the right side above sparkled. faster than a second but constant. more right was the moon covered with a cloud and it was fullmoon. on the right side from the moon was the thundercloud, i heard the thunder at the begin from there, with violet color and teard edge. the discs was clear with no covered cloud as the moon and i could see no stars. and the approximately destination from these objects was south-east and the thunder came from south-west. i think that the distance from my observationplace and these objects was not more than 500 meter and they was bigger than the moon. \r\n\r\ni was a little shocked, because i didn���t expect to see something and standing at the window. then i went back to my room an tried to see the discs from another window in these destination and i thought thats are a firework in the first time. i was excited and run back to the window where i see the object at the first time to make sure that are they be still there. it was so. then i run to the terrace for my plants. i ran back to this window, they was still there again. and i remembered me that i must make a photo from these objects, also i run to the livingroom where are the camera. i take this and went back (yes i ran again) to the window, but the discs are not more still there, also the moon and the thunder. \r\n\r\nthe discs was at time of observation at the same place and doesn���t move and must thought at the whole time at the objects. after this i went back to my room and i had fear. my mom ask me to open the door for our cat if she want to come in but i didn���t it because my fear. the only thing what i have done outside from room are use the bath at the opposite from my room. i thought thats could be that aliens are coming. \r\n\r\nand at the next day i realy

anything i've seen before. it made no noise and the entire body was illuminated. at first i thought it might have been a bird gliding but i cant think of any birds that glow at night. it flew northeat

was in my room when i got the fweoing to liik out the window. i noticed a bright white light in the sky. it appeared to stay in place. i grabbed my sont cybershot dsc-w210 and went outside on my balcony. the object was just above the treeline and stayed in place. i started taking pictures and videos on all the posible settings and zoom. the camera revealed that it had lights not visible to the naked eye.It showed red,blue,green,yellow,white,and sometines orange.In almost every photo it showed that the bottom was a solid blue and the top was either a solid red or solid yellow. it had blinking red,blue,green,yelloe lights on it(not the top/botom lights). the object made no noise. if it was a plane or chopper,i would have heard a noise as i have full hearing. the object was at first at an altitude of 500-2000 feet(est.) and appeared to be slowly gaining altitude. it was moving in a strange pattern. it went fast for 1 second,then hovered, then sped up,then hovered,and so on. it's longest perod of mvement was about 3 seconds and longest hover period was 40 minutes. it moved at a speed of maybe 0-100km/h(est.). there were planes and helicoptgers pasing by ib the area and in the footage.They showed faa lights. this object didn't.It was a clear sky and later had those very thin and small clouds.The object was heading in a east-to-west direction in the path of pearson int. airport.There are 2-3 airports near me. there is a fire station 5 minutes from my home.There are power lines and a rail-road not far from me. the object performed rapid accelerations and 90 degree turns. it even perfirmed a 130degree turn(est.).I don't know if anyone else saw it. no agencies contacted me.In the end the object disapeared behing my building still moving the same way i described it.It was 5-10 times bigger than a star and at least 20 times smaller than the mon. it was as bright,if not brighter than the moon. it may be the size of a house, or bigger(est.). i took about 114 photos and 17 videos all with different settings and sizes. some have motion blur but idon't have a tripod(yet). i felt nothing,smelled nothing,heard nothing. only saw it. i had full health before,during,and after the sighting. the winf was blowing north i think, and theobject moved west. not  baloon.I saw no outline. i even have a short daytime footage of it long after all the stars are gone.Please email me so i can send these 131 files to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni first saw it at 12:45 am and last saw it on 5:40
