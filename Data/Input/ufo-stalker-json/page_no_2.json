perhaps there was a funeral service and a mass balloon release? nope. they wouldn't have stayed in the pattern these objects were in. \r\nplanes?!! nope. as i mentioned, i've lived in this home for 5 years and spend a lot of time in my backyard skygazing. no plane(s) have ever behaved like this and been in this number (over 20).\r\n\r\nit was when i had exhausted all explanations, i pulled out my phone and started recording. hoping i could catch some of this anomaly on film. it was a bright sunny day and i couldn't even tell if i was capturing any kind of footage because it was so bright, and they were so far away. \r\n\r\nthe number of objects grew and grew. i was standing there for at least 4 minutes in shock trying to make sense of what i was seeing. then they started to become fewer in number. it was then i ran inside to grab my husband. someone else had to witness this besides me!!!\r\ni ran faster than i'd ever run before, flung open the back door, ran up the stairs and screamed for him to get out back. he thought something was terribly wrong and was surprised when he got out back and saw our garage wasn't on fire. i told him to look up, between the power lines and just try to see flashing lights. he didn't at first (because by this time, they were down to so few) but then he saw them! he couldn't believe his eyes and wondered what they could be. he was a bit freaked out.  \r\n\r\nthey finally disappeared completely. \r\nwe went inside and talked in length about what the eff those things could be and i watched the video. over and over. \r\ni could see them in the video but on my phone it was so hard to zoom in. \r\ni showed it to people but they really couldn't see much. \r\n\r\nit was when i started to go through the video frame by frame in slomo that i really saw what i saw with my own two eyes. and it was then i saw what i had not seen with my eyes in real time. at the end of the video, a solid black craft zooms in from the north. it has shape and mass and even spits out a jet stream. it flies across the screen in less than a second!!!! nothing travels that fast. nothing of this earth, at least.  video is best watched zoomed in and frame by frame. \r\n\r\nthis is the third ufo sighting i've had in my 40 years of life. \r\nthis one was different than the other two.\r\n\r\nincluded are the video and three screenshots of the craft flying in at the end. \r\nnotice the light in the first frame of the video before it starts. that's the general area of the lights but remember, they are across most of the visible western sky. \r\n\r\ni can't wait to hear what you think.

alex-the white one who slept between us and cc-the black one who slept on my wife's side of the bed. \r\ni awoke suddenly to the sensation of floating above the bed. immediately i felt the drop and landed on alex, who was under the covers (both times, i landed above the covers). she yelped very loud and woke everyone up in the house. my wife asked, \"what happened?\" \"i don't know,\" i replied. \"i landed on the dog.  was i floating above the bed?\" she replied that she didn't know as she reached for alex to comfort her. \r\nthe next morning, i felt this discomfort in my ear which lasted about 4 1/2 weeks. once again it didn't hurt, it just felt like an ear ache that wouldn't go away. \r\n\r\nnovember 30, 2017 7:30am tucumcari, nm: i am a truck driver and i stopped at the loves travel center for the night. my younger daughter was riding with me. we got up in the morning, went in to take showers and get breakfast. we returned to the truck to eat our breakfast and as i began to say prayer for the food, i heard this beeping noise and stopped praying. i told my daughter, \"i think your watch is beeping.\" she looked at her watch and said, \"no, my watch is on silent.\" i told her that i could hear a beeping noise from somewhere in the truck. she stated that she didn't hear anything. i noticed that as i moved around the truck trying to find what was beeping, that the aspect to the sound never changed, nor the intensity of the noise. i told her, \"i think it's coming from my ear.\"\r\nshe had been getting over a cold, but still had a cough. she coughed kind of loud and my ear rang very loud. i jammed my finger in my ear while exclaiming, \"ahh!\" she asked what happened and i told her that when she coughed, it made my ear ring. i told her that when she was talking, it was making my ear ring also. it literally sounds like someone speaking into a microphone while standing too close to the speakers. \r\nwe had a load to pick up in los lunas, nm going to walmart in el paso and then we were going to take a few days off. i told her that when we get to walmart, i was going to pick up some ear plugs because the ringing was bad. \r\nwe made our delivery and went into the store to get ear plugs. as we were walking through the store, they announced something over the pa. my daughter was on my left side, and i grabbed my ear and bent down. my ear rang out really loud. my daughter asked, \"what happened?\" \"i don't know. when they got on the intercom, it made my ear ring.\" she asked, \"is that what that noise was?\" \"what noise?\" i asked, not believing she could hear the noise from my ear. she mimicked the noise and i exclaimed, \"how can you hear what is going on in my ear?\" she replied, \"i don't know, but i heard it.\"\r\ni told her that i needed to buy one of those scopes that the doctors use to look in my ear. she told me that walmart sells them over in the pharmacy section. \r\nwe bought an otoscope, and when we got home she looked in my left ear and found a very shiny metallic object just above the eardrum attached to the ear canal with three legs on each side (picture to follow). \r\ni have shown this to many people and no one knows what it is. i am hesitant to see a doctor for fear that they may be required to report this. the beeping is constant (24 hours a day). it is driving me crazy and i have to carry ear plugs with me in case i go to a loud area and it begins to ring. \r\ni am looking for help to determine what this device is for and who put it there. i have more pictures, but this is the best one. i need a better otoscope with a dimmable light source, because the object is very reflective and washes out the image on my phone's camera.  any help would be appreciated. thank you.

we're touching my face i couldn't see it at first it was very distorted blurry and sometimes i would see something that look like a fly or an ant float by but i would not hear a sound then i started to realize when i would see that fly it was a giant blur surrounding it i also started to see shadow people too kind one is humanoid figure the other is a black figure with batman like pointed horn like things on head 1 shadow figure is very big sort of like a bigfoot only round one type of blur is very big very long neck has like a stingray style head there is a tall skinny very slim with a huge head humanoid and several smaller average man size roughly 5 to 6 ft or so there is another blur that is roughly 3 foot very short with square blocky rock like faces the tall thin alien appears to look like a grey alien so do the 5 and 6 foot juan there's also like a four foot five foot stingray alien i started to see them nevermind penis region became really warm and something started tickling my butt all while things were touching my face i couldn't see it at first it was very distorted blurry and sometimes i would see something that look like a fly or an float by but i would not here is sound then i started to realize when i was see that fly it was a giant blur surrounding it i also started to see shadow people 2 kind one is human figure the other is a block figure with batman like pointed horn on head one shadow figure is very big short of like a bigfoot only round one type of blur is very big very long neck has like a stingrays dial head there is a tall slim with a big head humanoid and several smaller average man size roughly 5 to six ft or so they're is another blur that is roughly 3ft shortly there is a red  devil lake  humanoid figure  that pulsates red light and flashes sometimes in sequence you only flashes when he thinks you see him he runs straight to your face and he opens his mouth and worm-like things come out of his mouth and he does like crazy stuff like makes the room spin sometimes his eyes will be glowing red and sometimes they'll be like a goldish silver color sometimes when he sees you and thinks you see him run to your face and get very scary there is a blue one that looks sort of like a fish and has finn like things where his ears should be  he is also humanoid face and body he flashes blue just like the red guy when he sees that you see him he runs to your face and gets very scary like makes mean faces and even can push you he's pushed me into a table and he's pushed things off of my table he five and six foot also like 4 ft 5 ft two types  one looks like the giant stingray and one looks like the skinny  tall man i started to see them shortly after i noticed the animals acting weird scared back around august 2017 when my pregnant dog was acting very weird and would not go into the basement i thought that was very odd because i never had a problem getting her to go to the basement shortly after is when i started feeling like i was being watched uncomfortable and could not sleep and started to have problems urinating sometimes i could not urinate and other days i could not stop urinating then i realized the same thing was happening to my dogs i would wake up in the middle of the night to go piss and my dog would already be up licking herself i didn't realize until recently when i had a very hard time urinating then all of a sudden i could not stop urinating and it was like dripping out of my penis that is when i realized every time i woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and my dog was licking herself she was dripping piss just like i was and was licking herself  to hide the fact shortly after i started to feel stuff crawling on my head on my shoulders and back on my face shortly after i started having pain in my stomach like i was overly full  in my stomach felt heavy very very heavy  and it would get  very warm in my  penis region in my lower stomach  when i started to see  the entities  i realize what they were doing  they were  putting something in my stomach and the stomachs of my animals  and then taking it back out  every time i had to use the bathroom  i felt tingling sensation in my stomach and warmness  sometimes  when my stomach gets warm i get a sudden uncontrollable urge to piss i started hearing sounds and i realized using common sense that nothing was in there so  there should be  no sound so i started investigating and i would notice my animals would stare at something for a long time and then i started noticing subtle differences in the light very subtle differences in shadows i started filming all these incidences trying to see if i was going crazy because i would tell people and people would tell me i'm going crazy and i'm imagining stuff and for a while i thought i was but then i realized if i'm crazy then my dogs must be crazy sometimes i just realized today that a blue entity and a red entity and a blur entity follow me everywhere i go they followed me to my easter dinner at my uncle's my cousin's house on his easter dinner my mom's house today and the corner store several times they've even gone as far as to get into my mom's vehicle with me i started to call them out because it bothered me so much i started feeling like something was touching my ass and my butthole and i noticed when i close my eyes i would see shapes and figures shadowy figures i thought i was crazy but then i would notice that the figures would come close to my face and touch me in different areas at first i would react but then they notice that i could feel it and i would see them touching each other like on the shoulder and then pointing to me and shaking her head like a yes motion and the entire time i would be hearing a ringing in my ear or a humming this is still going on and i am tired of this very tired it is exhausting seeing these things constantly and constantly feeling them touch me everywhere even poked me in the eye balls it's never a violent poke it's just a touch but the blue one put his hand on my side left side and something in my body started hurting really bad like it was being pinched he did that because i filmed him and laughed at him and told him i did it because he keeps touching me and if he leaves me alone i want tell everybody he got angry because i called him a faggot for touching my butt and i seen him making angry face and he pushed me into a table and i split my nose it wasn't a violent push i just cut my nose then i felt a trembling feeling like i knew you was going to push me down the stairs and i'll pray to god and said don't be like that to him and he put his head down and turned around and walked away and he's never hurt me again but i still get a terrifying feeling when the big shadow comes and my couch shakes like in a motion like someone's having sex and like i said no i can see them when i close my eyes but they have ways of confusing you i don't know how they do it but they somehow have like multiple shadow people or blurs in one body and when they get spot it a bunch of them will pile up like one big blur and confuse you because you thought you saw a humanoid shape or a head or some glowing eyes and then a bunch of them appear or the shadow shape changes or a noise will come from behind you to get you to look a","distance":"20

said he remembers having the feeling of being trapped. but he didnt dream of being trapped. his eyes were puffy and he had a horizontal line of abrasion under each eye. my first thought is an abduction.\r\n\r\nit hit me this week that we have security cameras. sure enough found on feb. 20th starting before midnight a bright light appears over our house. this continues until around 6 am on thurs.The 21st. we have 3 security cameras. the one on the front porch does not show anything different. there is even cars that drive by with no reaction. the camera is in the back of the house and shows our home on the left side of the driveway and two other homes on either side. this camera is the one that captures the bright light. the 3rd camera is directed at our back yard and shows the yard lighten up even more than our yard light which does turns on and off throughouthout the night. the camera angles to the top of our house but not above it. im still going thtough the videos to try to figure it out including correlating times\r\n\r\ni dont understand why it would be here all night. we have 3 daughters and 2 grandchildren that live with us. my fear is that more might of happened per our big household.

monoliths 3-4 meters high advancing slowly and vertically  in line\r\n========================================================================\r\n\r\nyesterday, holy thursday, i decided to approach to a rural road 20 km from seville, near gerena, where i used to fly model airplanes a while ago. as there was a tractor picking up water from the stream that blocked my way, i went to a road that lies ahead. i decided to take a walk, i took my chair-cane and walked 1600 meters and i stopped to smoke a cigarette under a mass of reeds.\r\n\r\nthe day was very peaceful, a little wind blew, and the sky was clear. it was 8:15 p.M. and i would have been sitting for 10 minutes when i saw in front of me, in the distance,  little less than 500 meters, two \"black monoliths\" separated 50 meters apart, that were going on the road in a south-north direction . they went slowly, at ground level, vertically,  as if levitating, i was amazed because although they were located 470 meters from me (i consulted later in google earth) i estimated their height in 3-4 meters.\r\n\r\ni repeat, they went slowly, about 50 km / h, which is impossible with a car on that dirt road destroyed because the tracks of the tractors after the recent rains had left a huge furrows. however, both monoliths moved uniformly, without rectifying the direction or slowing down. honestly, they must have been levitating on the road or something similar, although the proximity of a wheat field prevented me from seeing it clearly.\r\nthey moved on edge, presenting the largest plane in my direction, they were of a satin black tone, that is, slightly bright. its form was a perfect parallelepiped, which reminded me a lot of the monolith of the famous movie \"2001 an space odyssey\". it is not coincidence that the famous nasa astronomer carl sagan was the one who advised stanley kubrik to include the famous monolith as a result of some strange observations made from the lunar orbit by the apollo x astronauts in 1969.\r\n\r\nwhat the hell is that? i thought at first. i did not know how to identify them, i was amazed, with my eyes wide opened and wishing they would pass by as soon as possible and they didnt  change their direction towards me. which they did not do, fortunately, although now i regret it. even so it took about 30 seconds to do 430 meters, which indicates a speed of 51 km / h. . i must admit that a great fear assaulted me, but even so i followed them closely until they vanished suddenly when reaching the top of the hill, only 3 meters of depression from the top to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\ndos monolitos negros de 3-4 metros de altura avanzando lenta y verticalmente en linea\r\n\r\n\r\nayer, jueves santo, decidí acercarme a un camino rural  a 20 kms de sevilla, cerca de gerena, donde yo volaba aviones de aeromodelismo hace un tiempo. como había un tractor cogiendo agua del riachuelo que me bloqueaba  el paso, me fui a un camino que hay mas adelante. decidí dar un paseo, cogí mi silla-baston y ande 1600 metros y me paré para fumar un cigarrillo debajo de un macizo de cañas. \r\nel día era muy apacible, soplaba un poco de viento, y el cielo estaba despejado. eran las 20:15 horas y llevaría 10 minutos sentado cuando vi frente a mi, en la distancia, a poco menos de 500   metros, dos \"monolitos negros\" separados unos 50 metros entre si, que iban por el camino en sentido sur-norte.  iban despacio, por el suelo, verticalmente, como levitando, me quedé asombrado porque  aunque  estaban situados a 470 metros de mi (lo consulté después en google earth) estimé su altura en 3-4 metros.\r\n repito, iban despacio, a unos 50 km/h, lo cual es imposible con un coche por ese camino de tierra destrozado porque las rodadas de los tractores tras las recientes lluvias habían dejado unos surcos enormes.  sin embargo, ambos monolitos se desplazaban de manera uniforme, sin rectificar la dirección ni aminorar la velocidad. sinceramente, debían estar levitando sobre el camino o algo parecido, aunque la proximidad de un campo de trigo me impidió verlo claramente. \r\nse desplazaban de canto, presentando el plano mayor en mi dirección, eran de un tono negro satinado, es decir, ligeramente brillantes. su forma era de un paralelepípedo perfecto, cosa que recordaba mucho al monolito de la famosa película \"2001 una odisea en el espacio\". no es casualidad que el famoso astrónomo de la nasa carl sagan fuera quien aconsejó a stanley kubrik incluir el famoso monolito a raíz de unas extrañas observaciones realizadas desde la órbita lunar por los astronautas del apolo x en 1969.\r\n\r\n¿qué demonios es eso?, pensé en un primer momento. no supe identificarlos, me quedé estupefacto, con los ojos abiertos como platos y deseando que pasarán de largo lo antes posible y no cambiaran de dirección hacia mi. cosa que no hicieron, afortunadamente, aunque ahora lo lamento. aún así tardaron unos 30 segundos en hacer 430 metros, lo que arroja una velocidad de 51 km/h. . he de reconocer que me asaltó un gran temor, pero aún así los segui atentamente hasta que se desvanecieron subitamente al alcanzar  la cima de la vaguada, de tan solo 3 metros de depresión. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
