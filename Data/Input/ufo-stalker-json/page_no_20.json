toward our grandmothers home that was an hour drive . driving down the road , talking , listening to music, nothing in sight , until we looked over as we turned the curve in the road. that's when we both laid eyes on it. it had to have been 100ft away \"close\" we couldn't keep our eyes off of it . as soon as my sister went to make eye contact with me it disappeared. i saw what \"was\" not from this world. lights, no sound,and fast as lightening. i am one who was brought up in church , never did i ever believe or imagine there was anything out of this world coming to our world. i am human though and i do understand that people are skeptical. i have lived all these years knowing what we had seen. we talked about the sighting but not a whole lot anymore. but i know it was real , very real. and seeing is believing. i just don't understand why there are so many people in the world today that have seen with there own eyes, why are there so many disbelieve ? so many witnesses. but yet we don't stand united and demand answers? i know now myself and my sister are not the only ones who have seen the truth of life beyond earth. and i'm glad i get to share with people who may be skeptical. i know you don't know me , if your reading this your already in question. the truth is behind the eyes of us people who have seen . my sister had asked me a question one day \" id just like to share\" she asked: wonder why we got to see it and not everyone in this world did? why does it seem like it is selective? or is it? these questions made me think. i guess there is questioning. but who knows whats to come i guess. all i know is that rather anyone believes me or not i got to share my thoughts and our story . you'll just have to believe or fight for the truth from the

me encontraba fotografiado afuera de mi casa como lo hago todas las noches que el cielo esta despejado estaba fotografiando me detuve un momento y vi venir volando a la mitad de la calle que a esas horas de la noche ya se encuentra sola un disco redondo en posiciona vertical color la cosa mas hermosa que hasta ese momento había visto como a 1 metro del suelo y trayendo la cámara preferí verlo para observar los detalles que se traía en la superficie a la altura media entre la orilla y el centro del circulo todos eran del mismo color pero de diferente forma en esa parte se me imaginaron como resortes dándole la vuelta al circulo parecidos a los que se ven en un disco de embrague  manual que traen los automóviles lo estuve viendo por el espacio de 30 segundos que fue el tiempo en que apareció y tome la decisión de tomar una foto cuando pasara la columna que soporta el porche del frente de mi casa al moverme 1 paso a la izquierda y librar la columna el objeto lo vi como entraba al lado sur de la columna de 30 cm. de ancho pero nunca salio al lado norte de dicha columna yo me descontrole un poco porque como es posible que algo se desvanezca en el aire regrese a la posición que tenia antes y paso algo curioso un as de luz en forma de manguera luminosa subió del suelo y paso dando vueltas en mis brazos y muñecas de las manos y desapareció yo no sentí nada a la hora que paso por mi cuerpo pero me sentí cansado y siempre saco una silla para sentarme así que lo hice y al levantar la cara para ver al frente veo a este ser a una distancia de 3 mts. era tipo humanizando le hable pero no recibí respuesta y me fije en una mancha obscura que le cruzaba el rostro en forma descendente del lado izquierdo al derecho prefiero entrar a mi casa pero en la puerta siento un escalofrió de la base del cráneo a la rabadilla y se me erizan los vellos del cuerpo vuelvo a preguntar que si algo ocupan porque siento su presencia que me digan de alguna manera mental o hablada pero no hay respuesta y entro a mi casa dentro de la casa sigo sintiendo su parecencia a la hora de acercarme a la puerta de salida tengo una foto que me tome del brazo con los vellos alzados desde su raíz y tarde 45 minutos en dejar de sentir la presencia del ser pero no acaba aquí todo viene  lo bueno  al pasar ese as de luz por mi cuerpo me mejoro la vista y eso lo note a las 24 horas después y de tener 1 par de anteojos en uso solamente pude volver a usar los otros 4 que ya avía dejado de usar por no servirme y anduve un como 4 meses sin anteojos ademas me dejaron un don en la vista de poder saber si me gusta la visión del paisaje hay hay ovnis volando y lo he comprobado con fotografías que yo he tomado y me empece a percatar de ese detalle.\r\n\r\nsaludos

rd and saw another 2-3 lights lower in between rooflines. as i turned north she was describing them to me as they were too my south, i turned right immediately into a neighborhood to get turned around to witness event. as i got turned back facing southbound there appeared to be upwards of 9 orbs, hovering, moving slowly in tree line/roofline, at one point two sets of three were in perfect triangle formation, at another time they were in a straight line. i drove down to kelly meyers park in roscoe, il and pulled over to get out, at this point all the hair on my body was sticking straight up in disbelief at what i was seeing. we pulled over next to a small suv that appeared to be witnessing the same event but as i went to get out of ,y car they left. the lights started moving in different directions, a few went vertical and just seemed to turn off. a few went east and turned off. two were heading northwest so i pulled out to go follow. as we were driving down the road we stopped for a stop light and tried to look back up and they were just gone. the lights were mainly a fiery orange color, but at time seemed more yellow and others almost apple red. no flashing or real pulsing. we saw several planes fly over head during the process, i can not explain what i just witnessed. by time the last two lights disappeared i noted the clock at 7:11 pm local time. whole event lasted maybe 5-6 minutes. too long for planes passing by, and i know it wasn’t a plane as we watch them fly overhead all the time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

periodically flying their black hawks into the desert for practice. lastly, there is a gunner range for the \"wart hogs\" about 100 miles away.\r\n\r\ni love planes and wish i would have been a

things about myself being part of government testing growing up and for some reason i am being drawn to others similar to me. it seems like possibly someone is trying to activate us and its side effects are others are being set off like just a couple miles from me the man who shot up the white house lived. i have been researching this a lot lately but only in the last 24 hours have i started to see the effects. i personally  have been dealing with going to sleep and waking up with open and doors that are emergency exits (fire escape) are being unlocked and baby gates left open after years of never doing that. there was also a report of something going on near by. one client i have is reporting seeing a ball of light white with red edges in jonesville. i have another client who has reported lights at another time and is writing a book about it and another client in the new york area reporting seeing bright ball of lights as well. these lights are in front of them. i personally experienced the balls of light which i chalked up as ball lightning for a long time. that happened in 2002 and there seems to be similarities to the others... like increased psychic abilities or in some cases none reported before but developed after. many are close in age and or being born in an area known for government testing and facilities. its a long story and i could type all day the years of these things for myself. i have personally seen 2 ufo's and 1 instance of seeing small grey shaped alien creatures when i was 12 and i am 41 now. the alien was invisible. regardless, i am sure something is going on we should be getting prepared for. i am hoping someone will contact me. i am friends with many on facebook who are part of your society but i recently was banned for 30 days and
