showing through. the lights from the racetrack across the street (stadium/sports field lighting) lit the low cloud cover well enough that the reflected light made it fairly bright for it being 8:30pm on a winter night. i was admiring a very bright star, over the east horizon line from my vantage point and something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention. a large, low and slow-traveling, black triangular craft with 3 red lights (one on each point) silently traveled directly over my head from over the house and slowly banked slightly right as it traveled over the tree line, about 100 yards away. i could easily make out it's distinct equilateral triangular shape against the lit-up cloud cover. i can't be totally sure of the size but it was very large...Probably close to the size of a large commercial jet. the whole duration of that sighting was about 4 or 5 seconds. i was so awe-struck that i couldn't close my mouth or move for a few moments. the sight of this craft was one thing, but the size and complete silence is what was so astonishing to me. the speed that it was traveling also seemed to me like it would be impossible for any know aircraft to create enough lift for such a large craft. it was traveling so low that i probably could have hit it with a bb or pellet gun...500ft altitude or so.\r\n\r\nthis first sighting was followed by 2 smaller pill-shaped crafts (maybe about the size of a private jet). these sightings were less dramatic, but both just as intriguing as the large triangular craft. both were black in color with one light on each end and again, both were completely silent and at roughly the same altitude as the large triangular craft, but at roughly double the speed. \r\n\r\nthe first pill-shaped craft was traveling in the same direction, but about 100-200 yards to the east of the triangular craft, about a minute after the first sighting. this first one had unwavering yellowish-white lights that were perpendicular to the flightpath (like the wingtip lights of a plane).\r\n\r\nthe second pill-shaped was traveling more in a northeast direction, except, this craft's lights were unwavering white lights and were parallel to the light of the first pill-shaped craft (the lights were lined up on a west/east axis) while traveling from the southwest to the northeast, passing directly over my head. this one occurred as i was on the phone with a friend at 8:53pm. \r\n\r\ni stayed outside for a while longer, trying to comprehend what i saw, on the phone with my friend while numerous (maybe 4-5) other single white light crafts shot around in the distance over the next hour or so. i've never experienced anything like this and thought that i would have seen something on the news but there doesn't seem to be any other account of this sighting...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:23:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

cathedral rock from the bedroom. we had been eagerly awaiting the house's exterior footlights to turn off on their automated timer so we could more clearly view the stars at night.  the exterior houselights automatically turned off at approximately 11 pm. i called my fiancee into the room to see the stars, when i peered carefully at cathedral rock's silhouette in the darkness.\r\n\"come look at this. am i crazy, or is there a star in cathedral rock?!\" i asked. the bright star-like light was definitely below the silhouette of the rock formation.  he saw it too.  we both strained our eyes to decipher it from this distance - possibly a mile away, possibly less. as i peered closer, i realized there were in fact three lights stacked vertically, and extremely close together.\r\nas my eyes adjusted to the dark, i took in the view of the land between us and cathedral rock.  earlier in our stay, we had been informed that the land down below our guest property belonged to an eccentric organization of people who believe they can communicate with aliens.  we laughed that off as just the type of quirky personalities who flock to sedona.  because of this info, we did notice when a few white pick-up trucks were visible pulling through the property below during daylight hours.  people appeared to be doing work on the property. we chuckled mockingly, \"i guess the 'alien-cult' people are working on something down there.\"\r\nnow, in the darkness, i could see that the areas of land where the trucks had been working by day, had a series of lights on the ground, evenly spaced throughout the property. from this distance it looked as though the \"alien-cult\" had created a system of beacons on the ground.\r\nfrom our angle, the star in cathedral rock appeared to be hovering, centered among their beacons. \r\nmy fiancee pointed out that the lights now seemed to be two. distance was difficult to judge in the dark, but the uppermost light appeared to be hovering, wobbling back and forth high above the ground. it cast a soft bluish glow downward in a spray, toward the lower light.  the lower light, which seemed much closer to the ground, matched its movement, shifting back and forth in concert with the upper.\r\nthis went on for hours.  we strained our eyes to decipher what we were observing. at times he thought the upper light seemed to be moving closer to us.  i had difficulty perceiving that distance change. \"it almost moves like a drone,\" we would say. \"but no drone stays up for hours.\" anytime the spray or glow would shift up or down, i questioned my eyes, and asked if we were looking at the glow of headlights.  at one point, an actual set of white headlights and red taillights moved across the grounds of the property, toward the lower bluish star. we thought for sure a white pick up truck was approaching the light to interact with it. the star did appear to move in response to the approaching vehicle, but then we saw the truck speed away. this interaction made it more clear by comparison that the bluish light was not headlights.\r\nas the hours passed, we wondered if the two hovering lights were a probe, and if the emitted glow was scanning the ground.  we sat in bed watching the strange lights until sleep overcame us.  we awoke in the morning to no sign of what we had seen the night before.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

researching dr steven greer and all his knowlage on this subject i also started mediating daily. after i learned about the ce-5 protocols, i practiced them nightly after meditating with no results. on june 21 i started a deep meditation at 11pm, while still meditating i began the ce-5 protocols, after i just got done doing it twice, i got disturbed out of deep meditation by a loud high pitched ringing noise in my head. like i always do after meditating i was looking outside my windows, after not seeing anything for a few seconds i had a really big urge to take a picture of the sky. at first i didn't notice anything as i forgot my flash was on, i took 2 pictures after another with the flash on by accedent, and a couple more with out, after i went back to look at the photos i took, the

consequently i was engaged in that activity one late afternoon on or about march 28, 2016.  the atmosphere was crystal clear with intense blue skies.  i was facing due north and, turning slightly to my left, i noticed a four engine bomber, emitting condensation trails, flying an east to west heading.  when the plane was somewhat overhead i noticed a cylinder flying from the e.N.E. to the s.S.W. and when the bomber was directly overhead it passed under the cylinder such that they visually formed an \"x\".  it's hard to estimate the vertical distance between plane and cylinder, but if i were the bomber pilot i'd be very worried especially if the cylinder were to appear on radar, and how could it not?  from my vantage, the cylinder was about the length of the plane but about four times the diameter of the other craft.  after transiting the cylinder, the plane continued west and the cylinder was lost in the sun's glare in the s.S.W.

at about 2:00. i watched as this ball \"firework\" hovered in the air as a solid, pill-shaped light. as i got closer to it, crossing thunderbird rd about a minute later, i noticed that it was dripping

at 2:30. the \"drone\" light tfizzled out and immediately, a second one lit up about 5 degrees below the first. this time, the molten area was facing to the west. then the first one came on again and
