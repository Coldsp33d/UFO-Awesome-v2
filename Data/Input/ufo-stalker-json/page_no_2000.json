boston. it was about 9pm when we noticed  some lights in a v formation traveling west to east over the highway. my first thought was that they were military jets of some sort. \r\n however the formation was not very tight and looked a bit sloppy if i had to say. there were about 5 objects that from our perspective were orange lights that had a bit of a sparkle to them. \r\n i ruled out a satellite or planes as the way they were moving seemed odd and were below the clouds. i pulled over in a rest area and got out to get a better look ( there were four other people in the vehicle that also saw this.) the formation of 5 began to diminish in luster and blinked out or faded away. then two more trailing those came over the tree line aprox 60 degrees from the horizon - there wasn't any sound. \r\n  i took a  video with my blackberry and was able to capture one of these objects. the quality is not too good but it appears to flash or sparkle - not like any aircraft i've seen ( the moon is also in the video). about three more came over the tree line and traveled to the west before they too faded out (all object were moving rather slowly). almost like when a satellite moves out of the sunlight. it was very weird to see this and i immediately thought of how similar it looked to video i've seen of the phoenix lights. the color of these lights were orange and steady - in that they didn't blink like an airplane. i'm not sure what these objects were, but they seemed very out of the ordinary.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the o'hare (ord) holding pattern were passing by every few minutes.  an object caught my eye, much lower in my field of vision than the planes, and moving in the opposite direction of the typical o'hare bound jet.  immediately, i recognized it as not being an airplane, as it was spherical, and chrome/metallic, very bright from the sun.  it also had a triangular \"halo\" shape around it.  i felt like my eyes had a hard time focusing on it, which was a strange sensation.  it almost appeared fuzzy around the edge of its shape. it seemed to move fairly quickly, but very smoothly.\r\n\r\n there were quite a few puffy clouds in the sky, and it stayed in front of the clouds as it passed by, so it seemed close, maybe 5-10 blocks away. from what we could tell it was not more than a few hundred feet in the air. it did not appear to be very large.  i shouted out \"what is that?\", and one of my friends was able to see it as it passed by as well, and gave almost the same description of the object afterward.  our other friend did not have her glasses and could not see it. it traveled on a north east trajectory, and disappeared behind the building. it was actually moving away from o'hare, and toward lake michigan or a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nanother friend, who was not there, later asked if it could have been a mylar balloon.  i did not think this could be the case because of the fact that it did not waver or flutter, and traveled on a perfectly straight path, beside the fact that it had the previously mentioned optical effect of being hard to focus my eyes on.  we had been watching the planes pass by for a while, and this was in stark contrast to what i saw as far as objects in the sky.  \r\n\r\ni felt somewhat befuddled by what i just saw, especially that there were so many jets nearby, and this was quite obviously not a jet, and not a balloon either.  it was not anything common.\r\n\r\nmy friend who did see the object had a racing heart, she actually made me touch her chest because her heart was pounding so hard.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24658,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8861136,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07192010-0017","longitude":-87.6273982,"occurred":1279501260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

a star gazer i was looking to the west to see if venus was still visable this late at night. venus had already set below the horizion but another well lit object caught my eye as i scaned the sky for other planets. i looked up to the big dipper and just off the handle was what i thought was another planet. it was as bright as venus has been the last several months as venus sets in the west. at first i was dumbfounded thinking of how i could have missed such a bright planet on previous nights that i had walked into my backyard and looked at the stars. i stood there stairing at the bright object when it started to shrink in size and brightness. the whole process took about 1 1/2 minutes but i have no idea how long this bright object was in the sky before i noticed it. the whole time the object stayed stationary in the sky as it shrunk in size until there was no evidence that it was ever there. i saw the same thing on the next night, 07/18/2010 at aprox 10:10 pm cst but this time it was about 30-40 degrees straight east of the big dipper\r\n\r\nthis is the 4th time i have seen this strange light the first being about 6 years ago in the late winter and the last before these latest sightings was about 2 years ago in the summer. i have lived in the chicago o'hare since age 1 and i'm now close to 60. i know for a fact that it wasn't an airplane or airplane landing lights, i have grown up with all kinds of airplanes flying overhead and this wasn't a plane. the 3 times i have seen this bright light it seemed to last about the same duration of about 1 1/2 minutes in lenght, the last one about 1 minute. there are no other lights other that the bright white light that stays stationary. the altitude that i see these at is very high so the thought of a helicoptor is out the window too. to describe these the best i can it would be like  you were down at cape canaveral standing under a rocket as it is launched straight up. for a while the rocket engine is very visible but as the rocket gains altitude the rocket engine shrinks in size from very large to just a pin point and then it's gone from sight.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":24656,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.9849997,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07192010-0015","longitude":-87.8999314,"occurred":1279432800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279579183000,"summary":"Bright

said she was seeing something weird in the south sky. i went out onto the back porch to see if i could see it as well and i could. it was huge. it was a large spherical object with what seemed to be clouds around it. it was orange and there were flashes from what looked like lightning. i quickly checked local weather radar and the lightning map, there was nothing on it within 200 miles of us. it stayed in the same place over the ridge of the valley we live in. the wind was blowing and there was not another cloud in the sky, but this didn't move. it was for the most part stationary for about an hour and then moved away from my location heading southeast. i thought at first that it must have been a lightning storm, but the way it just hovered in place and pulsed orange and flashed blue i discarded that idea. i talked to her on the phone asking her questions till she got back. she saw the object the whole drive back to the house after leaving town. she said she saw it above a corn field moving following the road for awhile. she impressed upon me the size of the object being larger than one of the huge barns out here. i would love confirmation of what i had seen whether it was just an electrical storm or if it was a ufo. tried to get video but by the time i thought about it, the object had finally moved down past the ridge. i have not heard any other people around here talk about it, but it was out in the country after 10:30 at night.

lights appeared in the sky above the tree line, at about 30 to 40 degrees inclination from the horizon.  the lights appeared as if from nowhere.  at first glance they appeared to be radio tower

us in a different campground, at the same time.  he also witnessed the lights as he was leaving a nearby amusement park (about 1/2 mile from my location).  i watched for 2 or 3 minutes.  my wife, who also saw the lights dismissed them as radio towers and walked on.  i did not stay and watch them, but when i got back to my camp sight, several hundred yards from the ice cream stand, the lights were still there.  at that point, i tended the fire and visited with my family.  rather than lose sight, i lost interest in watching them, as they persisted.  i do not know at what point they disappeared

relieve herself. i had walked out on the front porch and then out beside the house on the north side and just stood there looking for her and enjoying the night air. i had not turned any lights on because i like to look at the stars at night and while looking to the east of my house at an app 45degree angle in the sky when i saw this object blinking, or at least that is the best way i can describe it. at first glance i thought it was either a plane or a planet because it was much larger than a star. \r\n\r\ni stood there watching it for a few minutes and determined it was not a plane because it was stationary, then it started moving, back and forth and up and down. the object was shaped like a barrel with a smaller barrel at the top and has more than one color of lights on it. the size of the object was app twice the size of the eraser on a lead pencil. this went on for app and i will say 20m minutes because i felt like i had been there for some time as my legs were getting tired from standing still. i thought about getting my cell phone and trying to take a pic of it and went back on the porch and let my dog in the house. after i let her in i decided to see if it was still there so i walked back across the front porch and out beside the house and looked up again and it was still there. this time it was larger than before but still seemed very far away, how far i would not like to guess because i have no way of estimating. if someone were to ask me to guess and let's say the object was the size of a 747 i would say it was maybe 10 miles away. this time something was different, as i stood there watching it there were some strong feelings of dread that came over me and also like i was being watched. this was a little unsettling so i just went back inside and didn't go back out. i checked the next night at app the same time and nothing was there so, whatever was there the night before was no longer visible.\r\n\r\ni do not drink or do drugs so for me to imagine this is not probable. i do not know what it was, only that it was not an airplane or a planet because of the way it moved and because it was not there the next night so due to those

Bloomfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On saturday, july 3, my mother and i had been watching the local lake association's fireworks display from the comfort of our living room.  our west window had a perfect view of the fireworks that were launched over the lake.  after the \"grand finale\" at about 10:40, i got up to put the dog outside one last time for the night, and went our our back door.  i looked up towards the western sky and saw several pairs of bright orange lights moving from the wsw horizon (roughly the \"8:00\" position) in a nne direction.  the lights were each at least as bright as venus, which was still visible in the western sky at that time.  they just immediately struck me as very odd due to the orange color -- had they been the traditional white/yellow light of airplanes, i would have just assumed it was a group of planes traveling together in some sort of formation.\r\n\r\ni immediately called out to my mother \"quick, look out the west window, there are ufo's in the sky\" -- only half jokingly, because the lights were just so wierd.  at the very same time, my mother was calling out to me \"what are those lights?\"  they struck her as very odd, too, her comment was \"are we being invaded?\"\r\n\r\ni went outside to get a better look. over the next roughly 10 minutes, there were probably a total of 8 to 9 pairs of these orange lights, traveling from the 8:00 position on the western horizon to the area of the big dipper constellation, which was in the northwestern sky perhaps 3/4ths of the way up from the horizon.  the lights appeared on the horizon generally about every 60 to 90 seconds, and at most times there were probably 2 sets of them visible in the sky.  it took each pair of lights perhaps one and a half to two minutes to move that distance -- they appeared to be rather slow-moving.  \r\n\r\nwhen the lights got quite high in the sky, most of the way towards the region of the big dipper, the lights dimmed and then finally went out entirely and the objects were no longer visible.\r\n\r\nat perhaps 10:50, about 10 minutes after the first objects appeared, there were no more to be seen, and i thought they were gone.  after about 5 minutes, another 3 or 4 pairs of objects appeared following the exact same trajectory.  the last of these disappeared and i waited another 2 or 3 minutes and went inside -- i noted it was 11:03 pm when i came inside at that point.\r\n\r\ni have no idea how high or how far away these objects were.  when the lights first appeared, i should also note that i could see at least 3 planes in the sky in the same general region of the sky as these lights.  one of the planes was very low, with a single white light and moving from se to nw, possibly to make an approach to oakland pontiac international airport about 3 or 4 miles to the nother.  the other two planes were probably commercial passenger jets -- higher up, and flashing white, red, and green lights, one traveling from the nw to the se, the other very high and traveling almost due west to due east.\r\n\r\nthe unknown orange objects may have been low enough to be at the altitudes that small private planes fly at, or, for all i know, they may have been in orbit.  i should note that it was a very clear night, and even at that late hour there was still a glow of twilight on the western horizon, so it's possible, i guess, that if these were objects in orbit the light may have been the last rays of the sunlight bouncing off the objects.  i have seen the space shuttle in the international space station before, and those actually move in a similar manner to these unknown objects, but on those, when i saw them, the light was a very yellow light similar to venus, not orange.  so, still kind of odd in my opinion.\r\n\r\ni couldn't detect any noise from the objects, but as i said, i have no idea how far away from them i was, and also, it was a very noisy night, with a lot of fireworks and firecrackers still going off, and a noisy party somewhere a street or two over with rock music playing on a p.A. system and people laughging and hollering.  \r\n\r\ni find it hard to believe that a lot of people would not have seen these objects.  since it was saturday july 3rd, a great number of people were having parties and get-togethers, and it was a perfect, warm, clear, beautiful evening, and there was a lot of activity in the area, a lot of cars on the road, and so forth.  since over 1.2 million people live in oakland county, michigan, i find it really hard to believe that a lot of people wouldn't have seen these lights, and i find it even harder to believe that they wouldn't have struck others as odd, too.  \r\n\r\ni truly don't have a clue what these objects may have been -- some kind of squadron of old planes or ultralites traveling to an air show?  military planes?  had the lights been white/yellow, i would have thought so.  i did ask my brother-in-law, who was a cargo pilot in the airforce during the vietnam era, and who still is a private pilot, and he stated that planes would only have white/yellow lights, plus the blinking red and green wing lights on larger planes, but i suppose even  he could be wrong. satelites?  any that i've seen reflecting the sunlight were a more white/yellow light as well.  so, what they were, i truly don't know.  i just know i haven't seen anything that color before moving like a plane moves, and definitely not in pairs and groups.  i carefully watched the local news that night and for the next few days, checked the local papers, and looked online, because i thought this might be a newsworthy event, or at least someone might offer an explanation of these lights.  since then, i've done a lot of searching online, and i haven't found any references to this event.  it still baffles me because the lights were just such an odd color of orange, so unlike any aircraft i've seen.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":24634,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.6063608,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07182010-0026","longitude":-83.4336719,"occurred":1278222000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279514961000,"summary":"Groups of bright orange lights traveling from sw to ne.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"America/Detroit","timeZoneName":"America/Detroit","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":14,"locationName":"Union Lake (W.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i were attending a conference being held in sam's town casino and hotel in las vegas, nevada (5111 boulder highway, las vegas, nv 89122, 702-456-7777).  the conference ran from wednesday, june 23 through friday, june 25, 2010.\r\n\r\nafter dinner on wednesday, june 23, 2010, my wife and i returned to our eighth floor room around 8:05 pm.  we decided since our room offered a lovely view facing approximately southwest, we would position our two chairs facing the window, prop our feet up on the windowsill and drink our sodas while we watched the sun set.  we began our sunset viewing around 8:15 pm.\r\n\r\nat 8:20 pm, i observed a small, dark, circular object moving in an erratic pattern to the southwest.  after observing the object performing rapid directional changes (northwest to southeast) including apparent right-angle turns and apparent hovering behavior, i pointed the object out to my wife who was initially looking north of where i sighted the object.  she immediately was able to see the object in question.\r\n\r\nthe object soon began to perform amazing flight characteristics including dramatic loss in elevation followed by sudden stops, severe changes in directions and altitude fluctuations, apparent right-angle turns, looping and hovering.  during the first 10 minutes of observation (from approximately 8:20 pm to 8:30 pm) the object appeared to be between 3-4 air miles away from our location.  this distance determination was based on the object appearing in front of structures that were located between interstate 95 to the southwest, and mccarran international airport which was located approximately 4.8 air miles from our hotel.  the object's size appeared to be about half the size of a small airplane, with an apparent diameter of perhaps 10-15 feet.  as the observation continued the object's flight characteristics became even more dramatic.\r\n\r\nthe object's flight maneuvers included hovering, rapid losses in elevation, continued looping, right-angle turns; however the more we observed the object.......The more we both noticed its shape appeared to be shifting as it traveled over the las vegas area.  the object first appeared as a small, dark gray dot or disc.  as we continued to watch, the object's shape seemed to shift from a disc, to a triangle, to a tear shape.  at several times during the event i observed what looked like bluish smoke around the object, but not smoke you would expect to see from an exhaust.  the bluish \"haze\" seemed to outline the object as it flew, but would dissipate at times.  i recall noting the only time i observed this bluish haze around the object was during sudden directional change.  sometimes the object would present itself as a triangular feature and apparently tumbled end over end as it flew.  at times, it would also appear to be split down a horizontal long axis with both sides moving almost like the wings of a bird.  the time was now about 8:30 pm, and my wife and i were discussing what this object might be.  we discussed the following possibilities: kite, flock of birds, remote controlled airplane, unmanned military device, ultra-light, small stunt plane, etc.  none of these possibilities seemed to fit the characteristics of the object's motion.  we dismissed all or most of these possibilities based upon these conditions:  there was absolutely no wind that evening...It was dead calm outside, the object was too far away to be a small remote controlled toy, the object shifted shapes as it flew and the possibility of someone conducting tests near a major airport traffic area was unlikely.\r\n\r\nfrom 8:30 pm to 9:00 pm, the object began to gain altitude and move away from us towards the southwest.  the object passed right over mccarron airport because we could observe the planes being between the object and our hotel.  i commented to my wife several times that someone on one of the airliners had to be able to see the object because of their proximity to the object.  during our last 30 minutes of observation, the object moved perhaps 5-6 air miles away from us, and we could no longer observe shape-shifting characteristics or see the bluish haze.  the object did gain several thousand feet in elevation as it moved away from us towards the southwest.  although the local weather was absolutely calm and relatively cloud-free, there was a band of clouds which appeared to be 3-4 thousand feet in elevation and running in a north-south orientation.  during the last 5-10 minutes of our observation, the object gained elevation and continued to move away from us until it disappeared into the cloud bank at approximately 9:00 pm.\r\ni remember telling my wife that i wondered if anyone else with a west-facing room had observed the object from our hotel.  i then excused myself to use the restroom.  while i was in the restroom, i heard my wife utter, \"now that is weird\".  \r\n\r\npost-observation event........At approximately 9:20 pm i asked me wife about her statement.  the following is her personal account of her post-observation event.\r\n\r\n*(wit's name deleted--sgonzalez/cms). observation...\r\n\r\nat around 9:10 pm, i heard a loud noise outside our hotel window.  a two-man helicopter equipped with a large search light was hovering about 100 feet from our window, and perhaps one floor above us.  at one point the search light beam was focused on our room.  the helicopter was black, had no markings, and i did observe two people in the craft.  the helicopter circled the hotel twice that i was aware of, and then flew directly to the location my husband and i first observed the mysterious object.  the helicopter flew around the general area where we last saw the object disappear in to the clouds to the southwest.  the helicopter eventually went out of sight and this event ended just prior to my husband returning from the restroom.  he did not observe this event.\r\n\r\nfinal thoughts...\r\n\r\nmy wife and i waited until 7/18/10 to file this report because we were hoping someone would have reported it before us, and that a logical possibility could be determined for this object and its flight behavior.\r\n\r\nduring our internet research, my wife located a similar report that a woman filed in the salt lake, utah area.  please visit the attached link for details.\r\n\r\nhttp://naturalplane.Blogspot.Com/2010/05/ufo-possible-thunderbird-sighting-salt.Html\r\n\r\nalthough this report is rather poorly written, my wife and i were amazed how similar this person's sighting was to ours.\r\n\r\nplease feel free to contact us if we can provide more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n
