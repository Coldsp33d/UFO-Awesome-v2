it didn't deviate one bit. i thought maybe it's a plane from a very, very far distance away moving toward me. but at the same time it didn't move, and even if the object was moving toward me it should be getting slightly bigger or smaller if moving away. \r\n\r\nat that point i heard my puppy and turned to see her doing #1 in the grass, when i turned back the object had dropped over a foot lower and about the same distance to the right/north. i'm not sure the exact mathematics on it, how big this was or how far away it was. but due to the distance it looked to be, i can't think of any plane that could or would hover motionless for ten minutes and then move in the amount of time it did and stay motionless again. the whole time i couldn't make out a shape. i just thought it looked like the brightest star i had ever seen by far, without comparison. at least 100x brighter. it was a radiating light. it wasn't yellow, or white, and there were no blinking lights around it. it seemed to have a tinge of green. you know when they o a whitening gum commercial and the tooth sparkles, that's what it did. it wasn't glowing, bright rays of light glinted off of it. i looked up stars and planets in the night sky and we're not supposed to have anything visible to the naked eye until august.\r\n\r\ni went inside to make sure everything was closed and locked, after that i made sure my son was asleep. it was five minutes at most. i went back out and it was gone, nowhere visible in the sky surrounding our backyard. \r\n\r\ni don't know what this was, maybe there is an explanation i haven't thought of. i just can't imagine what that might be. if anyone saw the same thing or has an answer i'm all ears.

myself that if it kept going i would attribute it as some sort of silent brightly lit satellite or plane or something. but what it did next is what convinced me it was not a balloon or any other earthly thing.\r\n\r\nfirst it was silent with no red lights flashing or any lights flashing. i noticed also that the craft wasn't going so much north as it was going higher into the sky. so it appeared to slow down but was still moving. it went higher into the sky and appeared like a star with the sum reflecting on it except that the bright light surrounded the celestial as opposed to having one side brighter than the other.\r\n\r\nit continued higher and higher and i could still see it until it just looked like a disappearing star in the sky. it never finished it's direction north but went away, appearing like it was but really just going higher until it disappeared. it definitely was not a balloon because there was no wind to speak of and only a gentle breeze once in a while.\r\n\r\ni know something is happening because i can feel it, i've had more visions of it lately and i have a sense of expectations of seeing them and experiencing them even more. i also have the

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the morning of the 18th of july at approx. 1:47am, i was in my living room and decided to go outside for a cigarette. it was later than i usually go to bed as my 15 week old daughter was having trouble getting to sleep. as i lit the cigarette i noticed 2 orange lights in the distance far away from the rooftops. today was the first day of a bi-yearly festival so i thought it was a couple of fireworks going off. i thought i'd keep my eye on them as the fireworks should of finished at 11pm and it looks like people were still letting them off.\r\n\r\nthe first thing that struck me was the silence, i live close to where the festival is taking place and the fireworks earlier in the night where like artillery going off in my back garden. these lights were silent and after several seconds they were still in the air and not making the usual whistles or exploding. quite unusual, i dismissed them as fireworks but they were moving closer so i thought they were airplanes as there's an airport in the next town from us.\r\n\r\nas i kept watching i noticed they were not airplanes either. they were moving far too fast and were far too bright. when airplanes pass over they are very slow and usually 2 or 3 red blinking lights and a constant white one. the 2 objects where moving very fast and where bright orange. it's hard to estimate a speed, but comparing it to airplanes passing overheard at say 600mph after flying for 20-30 minutes, these objects where flying about 3000-4000mph. they covered the night sky in about 30 seconds. they couldnt of been fireworks as the festival is about 1.5-2 miles away and even though i could see and here the fireworks vividly, i've never known fireworks to travel that high up and that distance before now.\r\n\r\nboth objects where flying fast and high, one of them sped up as to catch up with the other. after seeing them fly flawlessly straight for two minutes, the one catching up seemed to turn and then both of them sped up faster and disapeared within the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nmy first thoughts were curiosity over what i thought they might be, then intrigue of finding out they aren't what i thought. when i realised what they weren't i started to think about what they could be. it didn't even occur to me that they could be anything unidentifiable until they got about halfway across the sky, i felt excitement over witnessing it but somehow i over-rided my awe and ran inside to get the camera. i'm still feeling a little excited even now.\r\n\r\nit was a pitch black night with only a few clouds in the sky, it had rained a little earlier in the day but cleared up in the afternoon. the only way i can describe them where two very bright orange lights, i couldn't see what shape or size they where. but compared to air traffic, they seemed like they were not as high up, but where moving extremely fast. i watched them for approx. 2 mins before i ran inside and picked up my digital camera which took about 20 seconds maximum. they were still there when i returned outside and managed to take 3 photos, i witnessed them for a few more seconds before one of them increased speed and changed direction slightly. then both of them increased speed and disapeared. they didn't disappear over rooftops, they just seemed to of gone up.\r\n\r\ni only managed to get one clear shot of the two orange lights. the 2nd seems to show an outline. the 3rd didn't seem to capture anything but i've included it anyway.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24600,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":52.143819,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-07172010-0024","longitude":-0.459771,"occurred":1279443000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279427247000,"summary":"Two

jacksonburg rd from state rd., heading east towards jacksonburg. shortly after making the turn i noticed four objects in the sky. the easiest way to describe them is that they looked like amber-colored streetlights. they appeared only as lights -- i could not see any shape or object around or near them. i'm not an expert on judging distance, but, to me, it seemed like they were somewhat above the area where highway 503 cuts through 744 (about three or four miles east of me).\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw them they appeared in a nonuniform cluster. they began to pull slightly and slowly away from each other -- two moving up and out and the other two moving down. then, one after another, they blinked out disappearing, only to blink back and reappear again one at a time in order.\r\n\r\nas i continued driving towards them, i lost sight of them due to a curve in the road and stands of trees and buildings blocking my line of sight. when i spotted them again, they were in an entirely different formation, a descending line from north to south, something like:\r\no\r\n\r\n   o\r\n \r\n      o\r\n   \r\n         o\r\n\r\nthey again, in order and one at a time, blinked out and reappeared.\r\n\r\nat this time, i also noticed what appeared to be an airplane or helicopter to the north of the lights. it stayed roughly in the same area just away from them to the north for the next few minutes as i observed them while still driving towards where i assumed the lights were above.\r\n\r\ndue to the road, i lost sight of the lights again. i finally came to the clearing where the highway intersected with highway 503, but they were nowhere to be seen. i stopped my car and waited a moment, but they never returned. i did notice what i'm only assuming is the same plane or helicopter i'd noticed earlier (i think it was a plane since i couldn't hear it) heading rather rapidly south towards cincinnati.\r\n\r\nthe sighting, although with moments where i could not see the lights, took about 8 minutes. this is probably about double of the average time to travel this distance, but i had phoned a friend to tell him about what i was seeing, and being on the phone and mostly watching the sky instead of the road, i was driving a fair bit slower than normal.\r\n----\r\n\r\ni later learned that a hot air balloon festival is occurring this weekend, starting the day of my sighting, in middletown, oh, approximately 15 miles away. i don't believe hot air balloons are what i witnessed however, for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. i looked up the schedule for the festival in middletown. there was a \"balloon glow\" event scheduled that night, but it went from 9:00-9:30, and would have ended roughly 15 minutes before i noticed anyway. there was a pyrotechnics event from 9:30 to 10:00, but the object i saw were definitely not fireworks.\r\n\r\n2. the sky wasn't that dark yet, and i believe i would have seen the shapes of the balloons themselves if that's what the objects were.\r\n\r\n3. the lights themselves simply did not appear like the flames of hot air balloons. they were consistent and did not flicker, and when the objects blinked back and forth it was an instant switch -- the lights did not once alter shape or brightness. the size of the lights as well seem like they were far too large to be a balloon 15 miles away.\r\n\r\nthat said, i'm still not sure what i witnessed, and for all i know, despite having doubts, it very well could have been lights from the balloon festival.

though the sky and to the south west of my porch, i noticed a red glowing object. it was not a plane or helicopter because there were no flashing lights or movement. the object was steadily hovering. as i continued to view the object, i quickly noticed it was much brighter and larger than a star would appear. about a minute into viewing the red glowing object, i noticed 2 small blue balls of light which came from below the glowing object. 1 of the balls of light quickly dropped down and i could not see where exactly because of a neighbor's trees. the 2 ball of light remained beside the red glowing object. about 30 seconds later, the second ball dropped quickly downward. and again, i could not see where it went being blocked by the neighbor's trees. not much longer after that, the red glowing object quickly flew downward. as if it was trying to hide after being spotted. the downward movement was not a free fall by all means, it was a very quick downward decent. i lost visual of the red glowing object after it feel below my site of view under the neighbor's trees. i quickly ran inside to grab my camera in hopes i could catch it lifting off from where ever it may of landed. i stayed out side for another 45 minutes but never saw the object again. i was in complete shock seeing it from the first moment to the last moment. even while continuing to wait for it's reappearance, i knew exactly what i witnessed. this was not a comet, plane, helicopter or even a flare. i've witnessed them all during day & night, what this was could not be compared to what i witnessed. i almost got the sense it knew it was being watched. when the thought of grabbing my camera came across my mind, that's when the object started its quick decline.","distance":"Over One
