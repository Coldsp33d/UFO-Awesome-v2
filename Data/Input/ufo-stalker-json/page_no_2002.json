every night since 1986.  in around 1994 mufon of orange county and me did a 2 day investigation of these lights.  mufon told me they are airplanes or they are coming from disneyland.  disneyland is 10 miles away, and the lights we witnessed coming in at 2 at a time every 30 seconds were about only 300 to 500 feet away.  two years later jan harzan who was a mufon investigator told me that the lights in that investigation went into mufon's records as \"unknown\".  then he continued saying, \"meaning ufo\".\r\n\r\nsome of the lights in my photos show them either entering or exiting another dimension.  you can this, as the lights look half or partial.  almost all my photos show lights that can be mistaken for lamp lights, however it you compare photos you can see that the lights must have been moving by other nearby lights or by background.  i never changed my location while photographing the lights.  also what came out on film was nothing like what i saw in most cases.  the photo of the small white light up near a building is too small to be the moon.  before i photographed it it looked like a small dot, and not a light at all.  the smoke picture is a complete mystery to me being that i never remember filming it or anything like it.  i am sure you agree it is not from any natural source.  and the 2 objects under the street light were the first 2 objects i photographed.  they appeared one after the other.  peter davenport from the ufo reporting center told me i sent him street lights, as though he did not see the objects under the street lights.  i believe the white lights might be ufo related besides the white light on top of the shoe city building.  i do not know what the orange/red lights are.\r\n\r\nbetween 2003 to 2005 i filmed these same type objects.  i used a samsung camcorder with a 880x digital zoom, so i was able to get right up to the objects.  i did not use a tripod, because the objects often would vanish before i could get a fix on them.  however i filmed upclose objects that resembled jupiter; with an eye on its surface that looked around robotically then disappearing into the object; objects that partially disolve then go back the way it was; objects that show black carbon type clouds that quickly run over its surface; small white lighted objects that form perfect triangles and rectangles then slowly move on.  i accumulated 8-hours of footage, and recently after editing i have 1 hour of my best footage.  it was produced as a dvd by o.C. media.  and it is not bad for not using a tripod.  if you would like a free copy of it please let me know.\r\n\r\ni got the impression that you are very discreet about contacting people with evidence.  if you do not want to contact me then it's okay, but may i ask you to let me know if you were able to successfully open my upload of my photos? again this is the last time i will send them to you.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\n*(wit's name deleted--sgonzalez/cms.

and her mom went to get xmas tree, on the way back about a mile back on her property on a dirt rd. we were on \"the top of the world\" so called, the highest elevation behind day ave. 7900-8000 block away from the main highway, geographic information should get you to that big hill, there was a oil pump on the hill. it was dusk, i saw out the corner of my eye a streak of light from one side of the sky to the next and stop at a dead stop. and then to another side of the sky and stop, i told her to stop and we all got out, more than one object repeated this in no random order, and no particular pattern, i would say approximately 40-50 of these fairly bright lights that resembles something the size of a lg. remote control aircraft, i'd say a 1000-2000 ft or maybe more in the sky. we sat and watched this light show for it seemed like an hour, it was almost dark and they thinned out, we were excited about it, knowing it had to be something unmanned, or not from this world, we headed back to the house 7976 day ave. navarre oh, the site of a 1800 log cabin and old barn, over to the right of the mobile that used to be there me facing the mobile, i heard a low pulsating hum, very powerful like a whum whum whum whum, kinda sounded like someone with 20 15\" subs really loud in the distance, i saw outta the corner of my eye while bringing the tree in the mobile a incandecsent light, i looked up and over the trees couple hundred ft. up or so a very large object hummed along very slowly.Looking at it i noticed a colorful fog in a reccess in the underside, the colors remind me of oil in water, but looked like a gas, in combustion of some type, swirling in this contained reccess, i didnt notice any standard aviation markings as i know is mandetory like blinking lights or any thing of that sort, i watched it for a second and ran inside, called hopkins airport and asked if there long range radar could pick up something that far away, they said its probably a blimp, the only two operational blimps in cleveland are fuji, and goodyear blimps. they gave me the numbers to the hanger, i called i believe if my memory serves me right and agian the date and time are approximate, goodyear said there blimp was in the hangar, fuji said they where over cleveland, i might have these reversed but none the less cleveland is 50+ miles away, and they where doing arial veiws of a football game over the old stadium. they said to take a picture, but when i went out it was gone.\r\nwe never said a word agian about it until i was reminded of the experience, i didnt want people to think i was nuts and there wasnt anything on the news so i wrote it off. 16-17 years later, im deciding to report this. i gave the whole experience thought, i believe the little objects were scouting the area to make sure it was safe for the mother ship/ secondly potentially jamming any radar from picking it up, i dont know why our land??? my x's 70 year old mom still lives on the premise and remembers everything,which i just found out, my 14 yr old son i never saw because of break up lives there now, i just reunited with him on the phone yesterday. my x also remembers that night.

flashing object larger than a planet and slightly elongated moving into the top of a line of pine trees. it was much brighter than anything i have ever seen in the day light which is what drew my attention. the object moved laterally to my left behind the tree tops, emerged on the other side, and began a slow vertical ascent. i pointed this out to several co workers. my boss also took note of this as a very unusual looking object. he hurried outside to get a closer look, and i followed shortly. when i arrived in front of the building in addition to my boss, were two other co workers who were out smoking at the time. all four of us were now oberving the strange object in braod day light. it was not like anything any of us have ever seen. in the time it took me to go downstairs and outside, it had risen higher into the sky and was now almost directly over head. in a completely cloudless crystal blue background there was no reference for the altitude or size of the object. smaller pieces appeared to be breaking away and falling rapidly. this effect was noticed at least three different times. after approximately ten or fifteen minutes of maintaining a relatively stationery position, it appeared to begin falling. you could almost see a tumbling type effect and it began to get substantially larger. at this point i made a run for my phone with the intention of getting a picture. i told another friend of mine in the office about it on the way to my desk. he headed outside while i found my phone. by the time i came back the object had fallen below the tree line although the fifth witness did observe the object before it went out of sight. my boss actually jumped in his car and took off in attempt to locate the point of impact. it is tough to estimate how near or far this may have been without the ability to get a feel for the altitude. there is also no way of knowing if the object was purely reflecting light, or giving off it's own. it was remarkably bright in the light of day, and at no point did it ever go completely dim the way an airplane does when its angle in relation to the sun changes. it also lacked a consistent shape. as earlier stated, it first appeared oblong, and seemed to change. i believe we were probably seeing it from different angles. i have not seen any local news coverage so far, and was hoping you have encountered similar reports. i would love an explanation of what this may have been!!\r\n\r\n\r\njoseph d schaefer

the bottom in equilateral positioning. the lights glowed from red to yellow and there was a green aura or haze around the outside. it was estimated at approximately 100��� agl headed 360 degrees at about 50mph. they were frightened and quickly climbed out of the pool and ran into the house so hastily that one of them slipped and fell and scraped her knee. the parents were asleep, so they did an internet search and located contact information for mufon. the next morning, they told one of the witness' mother. at 2330hrs that night, they saw the same object at a much higher flight level (1500��� agl) headed 240 degrees. they ran inside, alerted the one's mother; and she came outside in time to see it disappearing over the trees south-west of their position. the mother's description was very similar although she admits she only saw it briefly and much further away. geographic survey of the area includes mild rolling hills, farm land, woods, pasture; affording low levels of ground

the various stars like we commonly do when we're outside. my husband had reported a sighting approximately a month ago of lights in a y shape behaving in a weird manner. i never got to see those but.. as we were looking at the stars, i looked to the sw and so far distant in the sky, i saw what appeared to be 2 white moderately bright stars flying side by side in an upward motion towards a 1 o'clock position if you were to compare to a clock. they went up at a medium speed but too fast to be an airplane. the two stars were quite distanced from each other so i don't believe it could have been lights on the wings of a plane. they moved somewhat erratically but flew towards the 1 o'clock position slowly up and exactly side by side. i was frightened when i saw it. it was like nothing i had ever seen before. i am not one to quickly believe this stuff, and it freaked me out after having heard my husbands story. it seemed odd and ironic to me that it could be happening again, just this time i'm having the opportunity to see it. i called out to my husband and said \"what the hell is that!\" he couldn't see it at first as i pointed, not removing my eyes from the white starlike lights. they were moving, travelling and i couldn't believe my eyes and i was trying to figure out what they could be and my husband finally spotted them. i must have looked away at my husband to see if he saw them because when i looked back, i could see them slowly fade out and they were gone. my husband says that he did see the two lights/stars except by the time he saw them he said they were moving down together side by side. i have no idea what these lights are but, it's the first time i've ever seen anything like this and i am totally freaked out and somewhat frightened. i went outside just a while ago to see if i saw anything else and there's nothing but pretty stars. i just can't explain those lights. it wasn't a plane, they weren't stars because stars do not move together side by side in an upward fashion moving kind of erratically, or jiggly as i will call it. it just makes no sense.

(this thing was giant, but thats another story.) \r\n my commotion brought my girlfriend out to the yard, she was trying to help me spot the bird when she noticed a weird \"something\" flying. at 1st glance i thought to myself \"just a helicopter\", less than 2 seconds later i knew i was wrong, but could not figure out what it is. after looking at the video i still can not figure out what it could be.\r\n it flew very slow, i heard nothing coming from it at all, it seemed to be moving along at a constant rate. it was very windy out, the bird i spotted was \"kiting\", i do not believe this object could be a balloon floating along at all, it is not a plane or a helicopter.\r\n once i realized i had no idea what i was looking at i became shaky, nervous.\r\nin my mind i thought my god its like videos on the internet.I think i was in shock, perhaps just getting over it.\r\n \r\n  i did my best to video tape it, i had great difficulty seeing it in the viewfinder of my camcorder, so i was often catching it as it got out of view, but there are a (very) few very good closer frames in the video. i apologize for the poor quality of the video overall. i stayed outside until my camera battery died, then came inside uploaded it (from sony handycam, using sony picture package software to video capture it from the camcorder to the pc), then reported it here to mufon. you can see my last sighting of the object in the video, it flew over the hill behind our house and the roof of our house blocked it from sight.\r\n the only thing ive done to this video itself is as follows.\r\nrecorded it using sony handycam digitial 8\r\nuploaded video from camcorder via video capture to pc using sony picture package software that came with the camcorder.\r\nrecompressed the video using virtualdub and divx fast motion codec.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":24572,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.1022067,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07162010-0024","longitude":-75.9125138,"occurred":1279335600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,   Cigar,   Oval,   Saturn-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279345955000,"summary":"Unknown object going across sky.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24572_submitter_file1__100716021.avi"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Binghamton, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:110543"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"West Chester","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i was up on the 5th floor of westchester medical center looking out the window toward 75north. all of a sudden i looked up and saw a huge fireball, my first reaction was maybe it was a small comet burning up. my second reaction was we were about to be bombed, then it seperated into three pieces, the middle piece remained larger than the two pieces on either ide.  they all maintained equal distance  from either as they spread apart. then they dissapeared and as fast as they went two came back and then two more appeared to form a diamond, then a fifth appeared on the bottom right. the two on the left and right dissapeared and appeared lower, then bottom left light moved diagonolly toward upper right. i tried to get my video camera on my droid to work but it wouldn't penetrate the window. i ran down five flights of stairs out the back door and as i turned the corner two were left litterally zipping back and forth  and then they were gone as fast as they appeared. this went on for atleast ten minutes.","distance":"501 Feet -

was very beautiful possessing all the colors of the rainbow.  it looked like a ball with a stick coming from it on the top.  the ball quickly spun in one direction, and the stick in the opposite

a lot of it looks like lamp lights, but if you compare the lights with background and with each other you can clearly see they are not all lamp lights.  one photo looks like smoke.  maybe it is, but i

to cool off.  my son was getting frustraded from the heat so i said to him to look up at the stars with me (trying to get him to change his focus) but he wasn't interested and went off to ride his scooter.  my husband and i just sat there with our head tilted back looking up and i said (light-hearted), \"what if those arn't stars and are ufo's watching us?\" no one commented, we all just sat star gazing.  it was about maybe 7-8 min. since my comment when my husband said excitedly, \"look at that one! it's speeding across the other 2 passing them up!!!\"(meaning stars) we all stood and looked up and could clearly see this one bright \"star\" go across the sky passing 2 other stars until making a complete stop.  my son asked what it was and we told him it was a falling star so not to scare him and asked him to go inside to check on his sleeping sister.  once my son was not around we all started talking about what we had seen.  it was definately not a falling star...It did not dissipate.  it went from one spot to another without loosing it's brightness.  it definately got our attention so now we were all staring up into the sky wondering if those really were stars we were watching so now my light-hearted question seemed more intense.  i don't know how much time went on from one sighting to the next (we remained outside for maybe 20 mins. or so) but i can say that we did see a total of 3 \"stars\" at different times and areas of the night sky and each one zoom from one point to another, across the sky!  we also noticed there were 3 brighter stars very far apart from eachother but formed a triangle if you were to connect the dots. i couldn't tell what the distance was only that they looked as if they were as far up as stars are.  we would have loved to remain outside but our parenting duties called us in!  by the way, this is the second sighting i've had i just never reported the 1st one which was in north whittier, ca in 2006.  this would have to be a whole other
