meteors.From my point of view i could see practically from horizon to horizon, except for a few trees that were tall enough to distract my veiw. as i was lookng i saw a bright spherical light that kind of looked like a star but much brighter than the planet venus and moving quite oddly. it suddenly appeared just above the horizon(i think western)and moved from horizon t horizon passing directly overhead,except it wouuld move roughly 10 degrees almost in an instant then make a huge \"u\" shape just as quick then again com to an instant stop. im guessing the top of th u about 20 degrees and from top to the bottom of the \"u\" about thirty degrees. it repeated this same pattern until it disappeared at the opposite horizon. over the years i've had an interest in astronomy, so i understand some physics and understand inertia. i know this could havent been man made because anything moving like that wouuld destroy itself. i have only told a few friends and family about this over the years. the main reason im reporting this now is that i would like to know has or did anyone seen this? then about 2 years later i experienced missing time while driving,however i dont know if these

side note, i am surroundined by aviation and easily reconizeable aircraft both day and night.\r\n\r\non the morning of 10 june i walked out of the building i work in to get get some air and reflect on the early morning chaotic activity. the only area that has doors and windows is the front area of this building. it has a approx. sw footprint when exiting the main entrance. \r\n\r\nafter i walked through and beyond the entrance from the building, i panned the surrounding area both ground and sky. as i turned and looked to ne ( more easterly ) i noticed a very bright star looking light. i found that odd because it seemed intensely bright. at first i thought an unuaslly clear bright morning star?? the building i work in has lighting rods around its outer perimiter. as i watched this bright light ( myself remaining stationary ) it had movement across the sky against the rod.\r\n\r\nthe sky was mostly clear. some whispy broken cloud masses were visable. it had an apperance as a fixed wing aircraft on a approch pattern at night.\r\nvery bight as it approched.\r\n\r\nas i watch this aircraft/objet travel from approx. ne to sw direction it beacame clear to me that this wasn't the usual aircraft seen around here.\r\ni asked one of the personell in the building to come out and look.\r\ni point out the object to this person but because he is near sighted and was not wearing his classes he couldn't make out the details i was talking about. at this point is was about at an apex to our location.\r\n\r\nthis person cannot or will not collarate this event.\r\n\r\nthis object remained on

witnessed/saw. unless i ran running around like a chicken with my head cut off.\r\n\r\nafter all my years of hearing about these kinda things i am really stumped.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

(obviously, it was a lot darker outside during my sighting than the sighting in the video, but everything else is similar). off to the right of the dipper formation, were four objects in no particular order or formation that slowly moved together to form a crescent shape or half circle. during this time, the dipper formation stayed in place, with all objects now dimming in and out. eventually, the object at the bottom of the crescent began to flash wildly, first in it���������s ���������natural��������� color, then in dark red and blue. it struck me as sort of like a morse code, or signal of some kind, and i assume it was ���������communicating��������� to the dipper formation, at which point i got spooked and went downstairs to make coffee as this was all a bit too much for me to handle. i���������ve always been a skeptic about ufos and this has pretty much shaken up my whole world view. i can no longer deny that ufos exist. in the video link i provided, it appears that formation is regrouping into separate formations, and i can only assume that is the activity that i was witnessing, but i didn���������t stay to witness the whole incident because i was pretty shaken, so i can���������t say what eventually happened. when i worked up the courage to come back up to my bedroom and have a look out the window about a half hour later, both the dipper formation and half circle formation had gone, nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nat first, i thought i was looking at stars, but then i noticed they were arranged like the big dipper, and i knew that the big dipper would not be that low in the sky or as bright as they appeared. i have not seen this dipper formation in the eastern sky before or since this particular evening.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":24541,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4488374,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07152010-0017","longitude":-122.7054514,"occurred":1256451600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279252502000,"summary":"10 ufos over santa rosa, california (six in a big dipper formation, four in a half circle).","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":263,"locationName":"Santa Rosa, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:111050"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Cleveland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was a teen-ager and i was finishing up cutting the lawn (i still lived with my parents).  it was dark but i was on my dad's lawn tractor (it had driving lights).  something caught my attention up in the sky.  it was dark out but starry.  i could see what looked like lights in a triangle shape that were not the same color as the stars.  they were orangish.  i thought it was a helicopter, as whatever it was, it was stationary.  i made a few more rounds in the yard and kept looking at the object.  the more i thought about it the more i realized that it was not a helicopter as there were no flashing lights, let alone no red or blue lights.  i started to get freeked out and shut off the lawn mower to try and hear the object;

i was curious if the ufos were still active.  after 20 minutes of watching the skies from my bedroom window i saw a red orb appear, it was approximately 2 miles away. it was visible for 30 seconds before vanishing. other ufo watchers several miles away reported seeing no activity on this night but i believe that the low altitude of the orb combined with the hilly terrain of western pennsylvania placed the orb out of their field of view.","distance":"Over One

as the sun was starting to set.  i noticed a light that looked like static at first, and then a bright pure type of light that was constantly lit.\r\n\r\nit turned into two lights and appears to hover.  it appeared to get brighter which made me think it was coming straight downward at me until if finally moved to my left which is south.  the dec was between 70 to 85.\r\n\r\nthese two lights moved together slowly, then stopped for about 3 minutes and hovered when a commercial airplane going from west to east on the north side of my house.(assuming it was headed to dtw airport)  when it passed, these two lights moved again going slowly back to the north right over my head.  it stopped again and the two lights merged together as one and it looked like the light winked out.\r\n\r\nthere was no noise at all.  i was upset with myself that i did not run to get my camera because i was afraid by time i got back it would have been gone.  i have to say i got the worse static shock when i opened my slider door to get back in my bedroom.  it shocked me so bad it freaked me out, it's probably unrelated, but it made me curious if it had anything to do with this siting.\r\n\r\nthis lasted for about 5 minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

it.  i called my parents who were inside on my cell phone to come out and see it.  they didn't make it out in time to see it, it went behind a tree and i lost sight.  i later saw that the iss was making fly overs that week so i figured it was that, however i watched 4-5 of the flyovers after that to \"see it again\" but even the brightest -4.0 magnitude was easily 100x smaller and not as bright as the ufo i saw, the iss was also not red during any of its fly overs.  i then googled \"ufo july 4, 2010\" and found one video that was the exact object i saw.  unlike many of the ufos that day mine was a single globe instead of the triangular formation of 3.  there could have been more around but i was very focused on that one that i did not check the rest of the sky around me.  it was not flashing or strobing.  we have many planes that fly over our house so i know it was not a plane of any kind.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24535,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1536674,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07152010-0011","longitude":-81.3578859,"occurred":1278309780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279224751000,"summary":"Red

pull over sites off highway 2 to get a view of the city's lights. i parked and walked away from my vehicle towards the canyon that runs parallel to the road. i stood there for about 5 min when all off a sudden i noticed a green falling star streak the sky in front of me and fall in to the canyon perhaps a couple hundred yards from where i was standing. i paid no attention to it since i had already seen these (green falling stars)up in northern ca. aprox 5 min later, i heard the bushes below being tangled with and as i turned to see, i noticed this \"being\" walking up the trail towards me. it walked right up to me and stood there. i could only make out the silhoutte as being very humanlike but with short legs, i could not see any facial features, perhaps the head being a little oval/longer than the average human head/shape. since 4 years have passed, i have faint memories but at the moment i suspected it being covered in fur/hair from head to toe. it stood there and i was in disbelief, i knew what i was seeing but my brain was swirling in all directions. maybe a minute or two passed and i stomped the ground to see it's reaction, immediatly the \"thing\" jumped as if scared and turned and walked to its left (my right)and stood there facing me once again.As it had turned, i noticed a white patch of something on its lower back. i immediatly turned around and went to my car and left. no noise of any kind was emitted at all through out the encounter.\r\nvisibility: lights of city provided excelent visibility as if it where full moon.\r\nexact location: hwy 2 angeles crest highway, turnout located about 1 1/2 miles north of last house heading in to park. about 1/2 mile before the ranger station. \r\ndescription of creature:human silhoutte, about 3-4 feet in height, covered in short hair,walked on two short legs just like a human being, no facial features where visible.\r\nconclusion: 25 yrs hiking in the park, never seen anything like it or even walk like it, definetively non native animal, called forest service and got laughed at.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
