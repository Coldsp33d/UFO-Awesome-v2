around 2045 my wife went to bed and about 5 minutes later the dogs started barking and acting up. i stepped outside the back door to smoke a cigarette and check to see if anything was running our cows or raiding the chickens. i didn't see anything out of order, and the dogs stayed in the driveway, instead of chasing anything out of the pasture.\r\n the past month we had several bats that would feed over the pond at dusk. while finishing my cigarette i decided to scan the sky to see if i could see any bats before the light faded. \r\n in the north east sky i noticed a bright star or planet, low on the horizon, just above the trees that line a ridge that runs in that direction. i then looked up in the sky to see if there were any other stars visible. i remember seeing another star and thinking that it wasn't near as bright as the first star. i then looked back and noticed that the first star had moved from it's initial location. i then noticed that it was slowly moving, almost floating, in a south east direction. it appeared to be one bright light, blue at first, it then turned white and then settled on an orange color. the light did not blink or pulsate. it was definitely not a plane's lights or a shooting star. \r\n i could not determine the size, but i did notice that although it was making no noise the dogs continued to act up and bark. i then went inside and woke my wife up and had her come outside. she could also not identify what the object could be. she then turned the air conditioner off, so she could verify that it was making no noise.\r\n it then slowly floated in a straight line, with no apparent changes in altitude until it went over the ridge and we lost sight of it. i went inside and looked at my watch, it was 2110. i also noticed that the dogs had settled down after i went back outside to look at the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

because our house sat back down a dirt lane from the main street.As we rounded a curve in the road i felt that something was behind us up high...It wasn't that i heard it, it was a feeling as if i could feel a pulsing,humm. i turned and looked up at the tree, which was a huge grand oak tree. an there was a thing that was spinning on the outer edge but the higher center part seem to be still. it was shiney, but i was looking trying to understand what i was seeing. i was looking for wires something to make what i saw make sense as to how could this just be spinning in mid-air standing still.I didn't see anything...I heard a voice say to me in my head \"come with us,\" i just said in my head \"no,i have to stay with my brother,\" i could not see leaving him down that road alone. i was not afraid or anything it was very surereal. it started to move away...It seem to bend the light because it started to close in on itself and look like the sky and clouds as it moved away not far from where it hovered and i could tell it just seem to take off real fast as it changed to look like the sky.\r\n\r\nmy brother and i just turned around and started walking to catch the bus, i looked back i think once and pulled him closer so they wouldn't try to come back and take him away. we never talked about this all these 30 plus  years, i didn't run to the bus diver and tell him.I never said one word to my parents.\r\n\r\nbut this december of 2008,i was having to have major surgery and my family came to ******* because things didn't look good for me.The only person i ever told my story to was my then 15yr.Old son. when my family and i were all sitting in my den he said to me \"mom, ask uncle **** now about it.\"i felt ashamed...What if this was something i made up in my head...Then my brother said to me \"i know what you want to ask me...Did we see that ...,\" i started to cry all these years i thought this was something very crazy some how i made up in my head and my eyes had played a sick joke on me...But you can't tell people you saw something like this...No way in hell this would be believed........I asked my brother to just tell me what he remembered it is just the way i saw it completely.\r\n\r\ni saw a metal shiney thing that seem to bend light it was oval and seem to get larger after it stood still with just the outer portion spinning really fast.It seem to get smaller and bend the light to look like the sky and clouds just like a camillion would.\r\n\r\na lot of people seem to think these events that are reported are just by crazy white people looking for attention, but i'm a sane black woman and this happened, why we saw it, why they wanted me, i have no clue but it did happened and i will take a lie detector test to prove it to anyone,this fact will go with me to my grave....

(polaris) at first glance since it was so low and bright i thought it was a helicopter but there was no noise. and it looked like it was only about 300ft off of the ground and was moving very slowy. i would say it was going about 12 mph almost like it was floating. being completely amazed i of course forgot to grab my camera but as it flew over our house i got a good look at it. it was about 200 ft in diameter and was emitting a white light from its spherical center. it had four rotating rings around it that were definately matalic looking and were roatating pretty fast. after 1 minute and 5 seconds it shot up wards into the sky until it was a dim ball of light and then disappeared completely. my wife quickly checked the time and it wass 10:10 pm. so it would have appeared at 10:09.Its location was 31 degrees north by 81 degrees west. i have provided a ruff and quick sketch of the object from what i could see.","distance":"101-500

large windows at the foot of our bed. as we chatted i noticed what appeared to be a falling star. not that there was a falling movement to the object but it appeared to come closer to us. this is the movement that caught my attention and made me get out of bed to take a closer look. upon closer examination, i noticed the somewhat rapid yet slow zig zag movement of an object in the sky. as the object turned there appeared many lights in a row along the side of the object. i'm not sure of the exact shape of the object but i'm going to say it was triangle with a bit of elongation to it. at first i thought it to be a falling star, then a plane, then a helicopter. however, the longer the object stayed in the sky, i began to realize it couldn't be 'normal' aircraft. \r\ni told my husband, he fetched his camera and we walked out onto our deck to look closer. it stayed the same for about twenty minutes. we observed the object while comparing it to the other stars in the sky. we both came to the same realization that this had to be a ufo. we continued to watch the object when, to be honest, i was immediately scared when i realized the object i was looking at couldn't be 'normal' aircraft. i then went into a stage of curiosity followed by worried then by \"i don't want to believe this is really happening\" . it was at this point that i decided it couldn't be anything so i was going to ignore it and i went to bed. only problem is, i can't stop thinking about what we seen. thus, my reason for sending you this information. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

p.M., i was putting something in the trunk of my car.  as i headed back into my house, i noticed an extremely bright light in the sky behind my house.  i was immediately struck by the brightness of the object because it had just turned dark.  i observed it for a moment or two, wondering if it was a planet.  when i realized that there were no other stars in the sky yet, i became more intrigued.  i therefore decided to observe it longer.  5 minutes turned into 10 minutes, and i called my husband outside to ask him what he thought it was.  he first thought it was a planet or the \"north star,\" but as he observed it longer, he thought it was \"a little strange.\"  the light was not moving and made absolutely no sound.  after approximately 10  minutes, my husband decided to go back into the house.  i, however, remained transfixed, and continued my observation for approximately 30-40 minutes longer before i decided to go back into my house to get my camera.  at approximately 9:15-20 p.M., i took photos of the light. during the entire 40-45 minutes of my constant observation of this light, it remained in relatively the same spot in the sky.  [it is important to note that we live less than one mile away from the mercer county airport and literally see planes landing on the runway (running west to east) through the trees in our backyard.  this light, however, was directly north, and during my observation of this light, continued to see planes fly in front of it.]  as i began to take pictures of the light (which visually remained static) i noticed that when i found it in my camera viewfinder the object appeared to be moving very rapidly and quickly in a haphazard way.  when i moved my eyes away from the camera to observe the light, it appeared perfectly still to my eyes!  i took 8 pictures of the light on may 15th. after i took my 8 pictures, the light simply disappeared. during my observation of the light, i was not frightened, simply intrigued and highly curious about what i was observing.  it is also important to note that i was seeking some confirmation that it might be an airplane flying south, however, at no time did i observe flashing beacon lights.\r\n\r\nthe light appeared again in the same relative spot in the sky on sunday, june 6th, 2010 at approximately 8:00 p.M.  my husband and i were returning home and i noticed the same very bright light as i got out of our car.  it was earlier than the previous 5/15/10 sighting, and the sky was somewhat lighter. again, there were no other observable stars yet in the sky, thereby highlighting the intensity and oddness of this particular light. i immediately retrieved my camera and took 7 pictures of the light.  i observed the light intermittently (i.E., i kept coming outside from the house to check on it rather than strictly observing it as i did on 5/15) for approximately 40 to 50 minutes. just as in the first sighting, the light remained static (to my eye) and remained in the same relative position in the sky.  the final time i checked, it was gone (approximately 9:00 p.M. or so.) since my two sightings of this intense light (and subsequent review of my pictures), i am highly curious about it and am hoping that someone can explain what it is to me.  i now find myself looking for the light every night, but have not seen it since the 6/6/10 sighting.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":24511,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.2214534,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07142010-0014","longitude":-74.7397584,"occurred":1273980600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1279137568000,"summary":"Observed very bright, static light in sky behind my house on 2 separate nights.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24511_submitter_file1__JustinsGraduation101.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":59,"locationName":"Trenton, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:111554"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Buena Vista","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I take my dog out about 10pm every nigh.  a month ago i took her out and was looking up and saw a star-like object and it was moving.  i thought it was a satellite but it was moving faster.  when it made a perfect 90 degree turn it was obvious it was military or something else.\r\n\r\nthe turn radius was not a \"standard rate turn\" as defined by the faa.  \r\n\r\ni watched it go out of site.  then another came and did the same maneuver.  \r\n\r\nthose sightings were not reported to mufon.  i wasn't sure if they were military or not.\r\n\r\nlast night at i took my dog out early.  when i cam back in and laid down i saw an object out my window.  at first i thought of jupiter.  but it was to far north.  jupiter comes up in the se.  it also was not a bright as jupiter.\r\n\r\nthe object was 30 degrees off the horizon and n 60 degrees.  as it was sitting still i guessed it's distance in relation to the mountains to be about 30 miles.\r\n\r\ni got my binoculars and then it started to move north and dim.  i tracked it for about 15 seconds as it dimmed and went out of site.  \r\n\r\nthere were no aircraft lighting.\r\n\r\nthis was not a conventional airplane.  they don't sit still!

(what is now south beach) i was approximately six or seven years old.  i believe i was in second grade at the time.\r\n\r\nevery day, when my father would come home from work, we (my mother, father and myself) would walk over to the beach which was a block and a half from our bungalow.\r\non the beach there is a small coral wall approximately 2' high that runs the length of the beach.  we would enter thru one of the openings and walk down the beach to the shoreline.  on this particular day there appeared six ufo's right over the shoreline of the beach.  they were very very low and were directly over the shoreline as well.  they were in a kind of v formation.  there was no point to the v but they were staggered two by two by two.  each set of two a little farther apart than the previous two.  the amazing thing about these ufo's was that they were going at walking speed.\r\n\r\nas my mom, pop and myself walked toward the shoreline i watched as people from the street and all over the beach started to walk quickly and even run toward these ufo's.  a crowd gathered and everybody on the beach was walking with the ufo's.  this lasted for about ten to fifteen minutes and i could clearly see the ufo's from the their underside.  i can't say what size they were because in retrospect i was a child myself and a lot of things looked big to me.  however, they appeared really big to me.  there was a light pattern on each of them, all clearly the exact same as each other.  there was no sound coming from the ufo's either.\r\n\r\nwhile everybody was walking with the ufo's there appeared two jets coming from the south.  homestead air force base was about 20 to 30 miles from south beach.  they flew down toward the ufo's going over the shoreline and as they approached the six ufo's they split off at an unbelievable speed in six different directions upward.  they went so fast that as the two jets approached in their downward flight towards the ufo's it gave the impression that the jets were standing still for a brief moment.  as the jets screamed by the crowd on the beach, the ufo's regrouped way up in the sky and came back down to the shoreline exactly where they were before.\r\n\r\nit took the 2 jets quite a while to get back up and circle around and come back down towards the ufo's.  again, the ufo's split in six different directions, only this time they didn't come back down to the beach.  in a brief moment they were gone in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nthe next day, in school, the teacher asked how many students had seen the ufo's.  as i recall it was somewhere between half to three-quarters of the class.  she then asked that we draw what we saw.  this was extremely interesting to me as everyone drew the ufo's that they had seen and some were round and some were oval.  some looked one way and some looked the other.  however what was extremely interesting to me even at that time was the fact that no matter what the shape they perceived, the light pattern on all the ufo drawings was exactly the same.\r\n\r\nas the years went by, since i had seen this event at such a young age with my mom and pop, what has been the strangest thing about this event was that when people questioned the existence of ufo's, having seen them myself, my view wasn't that the people who saw ufo's were nuts, but people that hadn't seen them and didn't believe in them were nuts.\r\n\r\nmy mom recently passed and the day before she passed she asked me if i had remembered the event that had taken place on miami beach when i was a child.  i told her that it had been the most momentous event in my life and i realized the it even eclipsed kennedy's death.\r\n\r\nover the years my dad, who passed away in 1991. would talk with me and he had a hard time acknowledging this event.  he could describe it in detail but he just kept saying that it wasn't a ufo event, but something we just didn't know about.  he was born in 1903 and saw a lot of things in his life and this was just something he couldn't grasp.\r\n\r\nobviously, i have been fascinated by ufo's since that event.  i've become a fan of science pertaining to the multi-verse and have found that the amount of galaxies and stars out there are so immense that if one billionth of one percent of the stars that are out there have intelligent life on them, then there would be billions of life forms in our multi-verse.\r\n\r\ni belong to the south florida int'l press club and at the last meeting i found some of the reporters that think they remember the incident on miami beach at that time.  i have also looked to try and find pictures of the six ufo's and actually found a picture of them, not in miami beach but in houston in 1956 flying in the same v formation.\r\n\r\nwell, that is my account of my encounter with a ufo sighting and i just wanted to get it on record, as it has been the biggest event in my life and i am very grateful to have been part of actually seeing not one, but six ufo's.\r\n\r\nif you have any questions or i can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me at any of the above contacts.\r\n\r\ni

deleted--sgonzalez/cms), 25 years old. his face suddenly changed to a look of surprise while talking with me and sat back and said \"what was that?\" he described seeing a white object, possibly a white sphere with a trailing tail, zip out diagonally from behind a tree out the window behind me and shoot up into the sky. he doesn't think it was a firework because it moved much too fast, and was too \"perfect\" in its shape and tail and trajectory. he thought it could have been some sort of \"craft,\" but knows it was not a conventional craft. it was enough for him to say that it was the first time he's ever seen an unidentified flying object, by definition. a facsimiie is attached to this report, made with a picture taken within 10 minutes of the actual sighting, so the picture's conditions are essentially as they were when *(name deleted--sgonzalez/cms) saw the object over my right shoulder out the window. ironically, *(name deleted--sgonzalez/cms) mother saw what she

and have been trying to head outside every night at that time and watch the skies. we had missed it the last two nights. tonight, we stepped outside and within a minute a bright white light showed up, northeast of my position. above it, a plane was at an incline with faa lights blinking and i could see its wings clearly. i grabbed my binoculars and watched the object fly across the sky at a slow, steady pace. it had no blinking lights and the object itself was so illuminated that you couldn't see it's shape or any detail. it looked like venus does when it's closest to earth. due to the path that it took, i saw at least 180 degrees of the object and yet i saw no details or edges. the intensity of the light stayed consistent as it flew over the back of the building behind my parking lot and out of my vision. the whole sighting lasted about 3 minutes. i have had numerous sightings from the same location and this is by far the most intriguing. the pilot of that plane had to see something and i watched about a dozen more planes fly through over the next several minutes. i'm located close enough to several airports (o'hare, midway, milwaukee) to see some of their traffic and am an avid sky watcher. i know what a plane looks like, what helicopters look like, even what potentially hazardous asteroids look like as they burn up in our atmosphere... this was different. i was very excited during this sighting and have had a hard time calming down. it was as if we walked outside at the exact right moment to have that experience.
