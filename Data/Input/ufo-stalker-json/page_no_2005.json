south. it would get dimmer, then get noticeably brighter. it did this several times and then got dimmer and disappeared right before our eyes. it didn't fly into clouds, it didn't go behind trees, it just vanished.\r\nlater,at approximately, 10:49 p.M. est(i looked). at first we saw 2 craft coming in opposite directions, then flew out of sight. they had multiple, different colored lights that would blink in a pattern never before witnessed. lights at all four ends or sides of the craft would blink, then a line of lights across the middle would blink, then light up all at once, constantly changing patterns. they were red, blue, white, orange, and green. there was no sound at all. \r\n a short while later, we saw three coming in from different directions. one flew over us, then went into full reverse, then started going up as if ascending in the atmosphere. it ascended, getting smaller and smaller, until it was out of sight. the other two flew in close proximity to each other. flying in opposite directions, but came very close to each other, closer than i've ever seen aircraft or planes fly over central indiana and i'm 42 years old. \r\n  after this sighting, we saw craft all throughout the rest of our time outside. sometimes we would see one, sometimes two, usually two, but only saw three at once that one time. all together, i would say we saw between 18-20 craft. sometimes they would be low, sometimes so high you could barely see them. they would sometimes fly fast, sometimes slow. there was no rhyme or reason to their flight pattern or the pattern of the blinking lights, however, the one that ascended did blink in a more steadier pattern than the others. this started @ 10:49 p.M. est until we didn't see any for awhile and went into the house at @ 12:00 p.M. est.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with

the sse from me and at about 40/45 degrees from horizion, that were too level; and were blinking as if signaling each othet.\r\n     so went and got my camera(kodak easyshare z612) and tripod, set it up and put it on video mode, did 1st. filming, then did 2nd. video( one that i'm sending, then made 3rd. one.\r\n      after start video,zoomed in and was astonished to see what i was seeing. on 2nd. vid, went to get wife to confirm what i was seeing. as i was away lights seemed to close distance by about half and 'nosed down'.?The left light seemed to blink more then the right one. i thought that it was just a rectangle shape, but after watching vid. seemed that it was 2 tr3b's(black triangle)sitting beside each other( seemed like it was watching me)! on video, then noticed red lights in 'back' of craft(s).Also halfway into video a plane files into view between lights and my postion. made last vid.(3rd.) just a few seconds long and had to get ready for work, so went inside and downloaded videos into computer. was amazed when i checked it out( had not seen red lights with eyes outside), also did not know it had moved closer by half,and 'nosed down'.\r\n      a few days before was taking pics of clouds and found a black triangle(blurred as if moving very fast), in one picture.\r\n      in 2007, my wife took a pic of very intense lighting storm and upon looking on

interesting to observe. it becomes overwhelming. they have now begun to come to my home. my mother who temporarily lives with me saw one of these circular object in the front yard a day ago. she stated that at first when she noticed it, it was glowing and stationary moving only side to side and up and down in small bits. and then suddenly without warning it disappeared. i explained that i have seen the object that she described and that they seemed to exhibit simular characteristics. and that what she described was normal. i have seen some of them up close (within 100 feet) and that they don't seem to pose a threat at this time. they seem to be as curious about us as we are about them.  so far they seem to be trying to establish a rudimentary launguage with me. so i am trying to

still travelling in the same direction started to fly for lack of better words all goofy like, it slowed then dipped down then came back up. after doing this a few times it straightened out and

spotted a very bright, high up silver 'object' that i first thought was a plane with a banner trailing behind it until i realized how high up it was , didn't appear to have any wings and was stationary.  i pointed it out to my stepfather who was driving and he too thought it was very odd.\r\n  it was very bright silver and there were absolutely no clouds in the sky\r\n(the clearest sky i've seen in a long time) so the object stood out like a sore thumb and we were studying it for about five minutes, long enough to realize it was not moving at all, or if it was, incredibly slowly.\r\n  mulling over what it might be, a blimp came to mind as it was stationary and very silver, but it was too thin and incredibly high up... i estimate at the height it was, about the size of three 747's in length, slightly pointed ends and in between a blimp and cigar shape... longish, rather than cylindrical like a cigar or bulbous like a blimp.\r\n  area spotted.... on the drive from midland and kingston rd. along kingston, to birchmount rd and kingston rd. south-south-west over lake ontario.  because there were no clouds it made it difficult to estimate how high up, just that it was very very high.\r\n  at a stoplight by birchmount+kingston, our view was blocked from the object by a tree for about 10 seconds and when we were past it was gone!!\r\nthere was no way to miss it, there was nothing else in the sky, not even the odd contrail and like i said... it was stationary and very hard to miss in an empty sky as it was reflecting bright silver.  it left no trace of it being where it was, or where it went and i scanned the sky for a good ten minutes more to no avail.\r\n  i hope someone else corroborates this sighting as i would like confirmation other than my stepfather who is rather skeptical of any possibility of things not man-made even though he clearly saw it and remarked how odd it was.\r\n sorry no photos as i do not own a cell phone... would not matter anyways as a telescope or high powered binoculars would have been needed for detail.","distance":"Over One

brick and point pleasant are good sighting grounds. i also saw some on the 4th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

time.  i reside in manhattan kansas and have a porch that faces out west.  watching the early night sky brings much enjoyment; this evening brought a great shock.  i am standing on the sidewalk in front of my house.  \r\n\r\nafter 10 minutes, a strange color and movement caught my attention at the tree line in front of me.  at approximately 9:25pm, a small orange orb appeared over the nearby tree line.  the orb measured approximately ��� inch and was low in the sky, not much above the trees and appeared to be close in the sky.  it slowly pulsated, going from bright to very bright and back to bright again.  the color of the object was rich and seemed to encompass the entire object.  the orb appeared from the north and moved south over the tree line, moving slowly.  to my vision it then began moving out west.  as i stood in shock i noticed a glimmer over the tree where the first orb appeared.  a second orb, more red in color was now moving in the same direction as the first orb.  this orb was the same size and appeared to move at the same speed.  the only difference was its red-orange coloring.  it also pulsated.  at one point i could see both orbs and could contrast color.  the first orb continued moving south and west and eventually my sight was impeded by trees.  the second orb continued on the same course.  before reaching the trees that blocked the sight of the first orb the second orb began to flicker and then dim.  it went out and all i could see was a dark speck moving in the sky.  the total transit time for both orbs was approximately 3-5 minutes.  i stood in shock for a few minutes and ran in to check the time.  it showed 9:38pm.\r\n\r\nit may be important to note that manhattan is approximately 15 miles east of fort riley, the local army post.  on the east side of the army base, nestled between the base and manhattan is the manhattan municipal airport, roughly 10 miles outside of town. \r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this in the skies around here and was shocked to see something so strange.  i���m from an air force family and have spent time around military bases and air shows ��� this was like nothing i���ve ever witnessed and instantly created uncomfortable feelings and a strange sense that these things didn���t quite belong.  the color was strange and slightly diffuse, more like an aura than a light.  my eyes were glued to the orbs and i was restless, warring with whether or not to risk running inside for a cell phone or camera.  i judged they���d depart too quickly and stayed.  during their appearance all i felt was that these didn���t seem like aircraft i had ever known.  afterwards i���m still uncertain what they could be.  i did wonder during the event if this was rousing either the airport or fort riley.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

lake to watch the fireworks after sunset, which was around 10pm.  the fireworks started normally, and then after only a few minutes they stopped.  after a few minutes i looked to my left and saw what looked like an orange ball of flame float over the trees and follow a straight line across the lake, disapearing into the sky on the other side.  it was traveling at pretty fast pace, like a plane in the sky would, but it had no blinking lights, just a round orange glow.  shortly after it disapeared, i looked back to my left, and from the exact same spot in the trees came another one of the exact same size, which followed the exact same path as the first, disapearing into the same area of sky on the other side of the lake.  when that one had disapeared, i looked back to my left and another one came out of the trees!  it too followed the same path.  half-way through this one's travel the fireworks started back up again, and it looked like it floated in the area where they were exploding, but it was not effected, so i thought maybe it was floating higher than the fireworks were.  after this one there were no others for about 15 minutes.  then as the fireworks were nearing their finale, one more took the same path as the other three.  everyone on the pontoon was very confused and we spent more time trying to figure out what the ufo could be than watching the fireworks.  afterwords, we asked a few other lake residents and some of them said they were helium balloons with candels in them, but i've always known helium to be combustable, and i didn't think a helium balloon would travel the same path without lifting higher into the sky and eventually popping.  i'm still not quite sure what it was, but it definitely made for an interesting fireworks show.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24470,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.1400073,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07122010-0022","longitude":-85.9159037,"occurred":1278221400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1278991495000,"summary":"Balls

light changed and the angle we saw it the object was moving very slowly and hoovering for quite some time so we all got to see it clearly for about ten minutes until we finally lost sight of it behind
