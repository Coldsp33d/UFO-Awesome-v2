completely dark yet. my sons and i were in the pool. i put my head back to dip my hair into the water... when i saw a bright red glow approaching from the distance. one of my sons saw it at the same time, and we both said \"what is that?\"  it was traveling at the speed of a plane, and as it approached.. my younger son and i saw something behind the glow... almost like a parachute shape, but translucent looking. my son said it looked like  a glare on something behind the light. but then that shape went away, and all we saw was a red fireball. by this point, it looked like a plane on fire. my older son called for my sister to come outside.  we stood in shock.. it looked like a plane in flight that was in flames. we could see the burning flicker of flames. we were scared because we thought it was a plane on fire and we were just waiting for it to fall... and my mind was thinking, \"how can a plane still fly if it's on fire?\"... but it continued on in the distance until it could no longer be seen. once it was gone, we realized that it could not have been a plane because there was no noise. it was completely silent. once the reality hit that we had not seen a plane on fire, we knew it was a ufo... and i wished i'd looked at it as one from the beginning. there were no other reports of this to the local news station when my sister called, and no one else i know saw it. people keep saying it was a weather balloon or hot air balloon that we must have seen. yeah right. i've seen both, and this was neither. a hot air balloon has no forward propulsion, and it was so close that we would have seen the balloon. two things we noted... 1. it followed the same path that planes had flown from over us earlier. 2. we noticed what looked like the remains of a thick jet stream breaking apart over us shortly afterward. we did not get a good picture, because my son did not find the phone in time. by the time he got it, the object was in the distance... just before it disappeared from  sight. when i enlarge the photo it is too distorted. the sky was darker by then, and it looks pixelated. there is only a red dot.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

premonition/feeling. a feeling i was getting urged me to roll over. so i rolled over, and visible was a thick, white beam, about as wide as a gallon-bucket of paint, piercing through my bedroom wall from the outside of the house in the opposite side of my room. from there, the beam pointed at an angle to about the center of my floor, and pierced down through. a faint, almost electrical hum was audible, as well as a hazy, light smoke that was only visible in the path of the beam. this beam was very dense and bright itself, but it only slightly lit the rest of the room. \r\n\r\ni felt rather nervous and worried (but oddly enough fairly calm), not knowing what i was seeing. but rather than get up to check things out, i automatically rolled over and pulled the covers over my head. from there i'm not sure if i actually fell back asleep right away, or what. i usually have trouble sleeping, especially if something has made me alert, but i don't remember anything else until the next morning.\r\n\r\ni walked downstairs into the kitchen where my roommate, who had the bedroom located directly below mine, was. i mentioned to her that i saw something strange in the early hours of that morning, and that's when she asked me if i was refering to the light. i was glad to find out that i was not the only one who saw it, and she began to describe what she saw. \r\n\r\nshe told me she saw a beam of light coming through the center of her ceiling and it came down at an angle to the opposite corner of the room from which the beam entered my room. in addition to the beam, she said there was an incredible bright light shining through her window. she says she got up and closed her blinds to make it go away, and then she went back to bed.\r\n\r\nthe fact that she saw the same beam i did, pointing in the same direction at the same location, shining through my floor and coming out of that point in her ceiling, really makes me wonder to this day, if there was just that beam, or something more. my blinds were closed and i had a blanket hung up to block out most light, so i did not observe anything bright coming through my window.\r\n\r\nas well, i am alarmed at how calm i was facing a scenario that would scare the daylight out of me if i saw it right this moment, which makes me curious as to whether i fell back asleep at all, or whether through my own will or others' intervention, i don't want to remember...\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

late one spring night with my mother and two older siblings when i noticed unusual bright stars out of the corner of my eye. i turned to see what was so unusual about these stars. as we drove closer, i realized between these stars, i couldn't see other stars. i felt a bit frightened, but definitely more curious.\r\n\r\nthe ufo hovered just over the top of the pine trees at the southwest corner of the property. the top of trees was only roughly 20~25 and from where it was hovering, it would not be visible from the house as there would've been trees blocking the view.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was triangle in shape with lights in three corners, which seems to be a normal sighting. i'm assuming it made no noise, i was in a moving vehicle when i saw it. it appeared black in color but it was quite dark that night; no moon light. the size of the object was roughly 70~90 ft in length.\r\n\r\nwhen i was within 700~800 ft from the ufo, still in the vehicle, it slowly started to drift towards to south west for a few seconds before rapidly accelerating in the same direction at a speed where it was out of site within seconds.\r\n\r\nmy older siblings were in the back of vehicle asleep and my mother didn't see anything as she was driving. my father was in the house during this time. once we were parked in the driveway, i got out of the vehicle as though nothing had happened. i walked to where the ufo had been hovering and looked out across the field in the direction it had gone.\r\n\r\nto this day, i still question if i saw anything at all. what it my imagination in conjunction with being tired causing me to have dreams while being awake? was there anything there at all? was i hallucinating? was it actually stars i was seeing?\r\n\r\ni always feel as though i did actually see something. i second guess myself to this day even as i second guessed myself at the moment i realized i thought i was seeing ufo. i never believed in ufo before then. from then on, i started to wonder profusely.\r\n\r\ni have never spoken of this to my family. i seldom speak of this to anyone unless they tell me they've seen something like it. i don't want people to think i'm 'crazy'. on the rare occasion when i do speak of the event. i am overcome by terrible goose-bumps and teary eyes. i have never seen anything like it since.\r\n\r\nthough i have never seen anything like it since, there

evening. i looked to the west and noticed a hovering red light that i thought was helicopter leaving the area. we\r\nhave helicopters leaving from ball hospital in muncie, indiana near here and they fly over our house from time to time, coming and going.I didn't think much about this light until i looked over to the same spot and\r\nit had yet to leave. i looked to see if it was moving, either towards us, or away. i realized that it appeared to be stationary,noted that it was reddish/orange and was hovering. i called my husband in his shop to come out to see this light . we got our binoculars out and tried to focus on the object. it was hard to keep a focus on it as it was vibrating/oscillating. it was in the air over chesterfield ,indiana for about 25 minutes total. it had gone a little more west, faded, then came back, hovered and while my husband was out in the road looking at it, it\r\nbasically disapppeared.\r\n i didn't have any particular feelings when i saw this. just being inquisitive about why a light would be in the area and stationary for such a long time. this is the first time we have seen anything like this in our area.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24440,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.1098296,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07112010-0019","longitude":-85.6772941,"occurred":1247197380000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1278890695000,"summary":"I

putting the dog in the laundry room for bed.  i saw a bright orange sphere that somewhat resembled a glowing hot air balloon or 'clouded flame' moving from the east.  it was too bright to be a plane headlight and there were no blinking lights as a plane would have.  as it approached it peaked my interest as it seemed too low for an airplane and i knew if it was i should hear something.  not wanting to take my eyes off it i tried calling my wife with my cell phone to see if she had her phone nearby at 10:31 pm ct to have her come look.  i then turned on my phones camera and took a picture at 10:33 pm ct.  i watched it pass, and as it was moving away to the west with a very slight (barely noticeable) southern curve there was more of a faint bluish glow on the back side, not bright light like the front, and i could see somewhat of a counter-clockwise vertical rotation.  i snapped 2 more pictures at 10:34 pm ct in the general direction with my phone, i couldn't see the object but could pinpoint the area based on the lights on the ground.  before it moved off i ran inside to see if the wife was busy to come look, but took too long and it was gone by the time we went back out.\r\n\r\nat 11:04 pm ct i was in the driveway making sure the cars were locked and smoking one more cigarette before bed.  straight up i saw 2 small very distant white lights following almost in tow of each other moving south to north.  i would have written it off as a satellite if there was only one but being 2 i was unsure.  once again i snapped another picture in the general direction but haven't reviewed that photo yet.\r\n\r\ntoday my wife was curious and 'googling' what i told her and made me want to fill this out.\r\n\r\nthe first picture i added is the front view.  the 2nd was trying to capture the rear view.  the 3rd image i added a circle around the general area i think i remember it being.  hopefully you have some better photo software and can see more than i can.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

the horizon. it was still and appeared to brighten periodically. i observed it for several minutes as it stood still. it started slowly  moving toward the se. i followed the object using 8x32 binoculars. it appeared to be boomerang shaped, thicker in the middle back side, and was at very high altitude. i would estimate the altitude at >100,000 feet. my altitude estimate is based on the amount of binocular focus adjustment that i had to make to get the object into focus, above that normally required to focus on cross country commercial jets traveling at 35,000 feet. i would estimate its size as equal to or greater than a commercial airliner.\r\n\r\nwhen i had the object in focus, it appeared that it slowly rotated about once every 5-10 seconds, as it moved forward. it reflected the sunlight more or less brightly as it rotated. the surface was metalic and white to orange in the color reflected. as it progressed toward the more intense sunlight of the se and nearby trees, i

a little after midnight and as usual looked out my window to see what is going on with all these crazy lights in our little valley and on the hill in front of my house was an electrical looking tower where there isn't supposed to be one, it was pulsating very bright white lights. i watched it for awhile but since i am experiencing these strange lights nightly for months, i soon went back to bed.\r\nthe usual lights i have previously described were there as well. but in my last report i forgot to mention that when i have been out of town i have experienced the same usual lights...I have seen them in stockton, cobb mtn and up in fortuna, ca...The large one hovering in the night sky that looks like a large star, the large ones that are either golden, white, or light blue that look like crosses and also look like their reflecting off windows. sometimes they are but on a recent visit to my sister's i found out differently.\r\ni took the dog out @ 1am and noticed the large golden cross looking lights that looked like they were reflecting off windows in the church across the street. i hadn;'t been there in a while so i thought the church had built additions. when i went out in the morning where i had seen the 'reflecting' lights it was just open field! there were 8 of them.\r\ni also forgot to mention these stationary lights that are white and look like a bug or something. there are always about a dozen of them in the night sky, in every town i have visited lately. you can tell they are not stars, they are not satelites as they are just a few hundred feet from the rooftops. they are here everynight and i feel they are just watching...\r\nwell, i certainly hope somebody else here in hidden valley lake will come forward and share their experiences.\r\nuntil next time...\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24437,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9662407,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07112010-0016","longitude":-122.6243728,"occurred":1278745200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1278882573000,"summary":"There
