of the michigan chapter,i mentioned a purple double orb connected top small and bottom a little larger. i told him i thought it was my late son come to see me as it was his birthday, i also mentioned the red light in my room every night for appox. the last year. he told me he would like me to talk to a friend of his that deals with the paranormal, well and good, but that did not come to fruition. since i talked to him i've had white lights in my room every night but 3. that was directly after i talked to my neighbor and she suggested i talk to a medium. the lights stopped for three nights, and then came back every night since. the red light showing me visions of past lives i was was able to catch three times as i'd trained myself to keep my eyes closed after waking, and just cracking my lower eye open. i woulde see the red glow and turn my head quickly. it had to blink down once and come back up before going out for good. to the white orbs, as far back as 1992 in my other home, i would be lying in bed with my eyes shut and sense a white light over my head, i would open my eyes quickly and it would be gone, and within seconds of closing my eyes it would be back. i would smile thinking it was my late son, maybe so maybe not.  after the purple orb i'm not so sure. i thought i was being electrocuted, i woke up three hours later. as to the white orbs, i;ve seen them on one occasion. i looked with my lower eye into my dresser mirror and was shocked to see my room in a pinkish color it is painted dark maroon and then the orbs drifted into my line of sight, one the size of a volly ball the smaller one the size of a tennis ball. ahh thats what they look like i could never catch them by just opening my eyes quickly like with the red one, a single red one. gentleman i thought for a long time these were my angles visiting, as i read the bible every night when i get in bed, and always say lastly and thank you lord for keeping my angels around me whenever possible. i think we're cracking the code, angels and et's are one and the same, and before i forget it i've had a growth in my fore finger since 2003, it does not hurt,it's just there. i've come to believe over the last year that they are all connected, spirits, god, et's all of it, connected. i can't go into all of it in writing. i can't set that long.  you have my number, i really don't believe a person

i called my friends too (we all lived within less than a mile of one another.  no one knew what it was, so i called our radio station, wksr, in pulaski, tn and talked to mr. nate street, who broadcasted it over the radio.  at about 15-20 minutes later, the object suddenly just zoomed away toward what i would say was lawrenceburg.  i searched the skies, but could not find it anywhere.  by then other people has started calling in about something flying through the air toward lawrenceburg back toward the lewisburg area and throughout pulaski.  \r\n\r\ni called wksr back to find out if they had any idea what it was and they said they would call red stone arsenal in huntsville, al.  the next day at school, everyone was talking about the flying saucer or whatever it was.  some people reported hearing a \"whooshing sound\" over their houses and people outside said something \"wizzed\" through their area.\r\n\r\nthe next day or two, wksr, reported that the base in huntsville said it was a weather baloon.  there is no way, no way that thing could have been a balloon; ballons don't just stand totally still in the air without going up or moving.  this thing flew so fast, it was hard to imagine just how fast it may have been going.\r\n\r\nthe other thing that has always puzzled me is i don't know how long i was on the creek bank.  i have no idea, except that my mom asked me where i was for so long.  at the time, it never occurred to me. anyway, it soon was lost in time and not talked about.  for everyone but me.  \r\n\r\ni have a lot of loss time that cannot be accounted for.  i was in the 10th grade when i saw the object but never knew anyone else had complained of missing time, but me.  for years i had what doctors called \"cluster headaches,\" then termed \"vascular headaches\" when i moved to nashville, tn back in the early 1980s. i often had blackouts, winding up in very strange places, like arising from hedges on the college campus i attended, or walking down a road on the other side of my hometown.  when i moved to nashville, i continued to have the blackouts which scared me because my daughter was around two or three, and i would wake up with her trying to wake me up off the floor where i had fallen or sitting next to me because i had had a blackout. she and her dad witnessed many days of my screaming into pillows because my head would hurt so bad.  i had missing time and cannot account for my whereabouts from around 1975 until around 1998 after i was in a near fatal car wreck.  i was semi-comatose for about 10 months and thank my then husband for caring for me, along with other family and friends (thank you all for your help, if you read this, you'll know who you are).\r\n\r\none day while i was trying to sit up, my nose started to bleed profusely.  my husband got a towel and tissue to stave off the blood, but it poured right through the towel, so he helped me to the kitchen sink and was about to call the ambulance, when all of a sudden, i started hollering that there was something in my nose and it hurt so bad, the blood was pouring down the sink drain and all of a sudden we hear a 'metallic' clink, clink going down the drain.  i told him to get it or take the pipe a loose, but it was too late.  he did take the 'u' trap out but there was only blood, nothing else.  soon after, my nosebleed subsided and we both looked at each other and wondered what it could have been. we speculated that it may have been a bond fragment dislodged during my wreck, but i shook my head and said \"no way\" that was metallic and no one could ever tell me any differently.  it took me a couple of years to regain my mobility and somewhat regain strength through physical therapy and plastic surgeries. afterwhich, i had no more missing time and my pharmaceuticals for my 'vascular' headaches disappe, along with my blackouts and missing time.     \r\n\r\nthe weirdest thing is that whenever i have openly told someone about my experience, they too have encountered a ufo in some form or fashion.  it's like we are total strangers and for some reason after just exchanging pleasant conversation, the subject just seems to come up.\r\n\r\ni have often sit outside and mentally asked them to come back and get me.  i don't know why, but i still look in the sky to find them.\r\n\r\nduring 2007, while picking up my kids from music school, on two separate occasions, both on a monday evening around 6:45 p.M. each time,on our way home on i65 south, we saw three lights in the distance, spaced at least a mile or more across (from the interstate all the way across to franklin road, slowly moving toward the south.  i pointed it out to my children and they both agreed that no plane would be flying that low or was that big.  the second time we saw it, it took a slightly different route and i tried to follow it as far as i could but it veered toward i24 east as if headed for smyrna or murfreesboro.  i drove up a hill and we watched until it was out of sight.  i told the kids we could not have been the only ones to see it, but there was no news about the strange lights on the news or radio.  we know what we saw, but don't know what it was.

approximately 100 miles south of a town in thr southern portion of connecticut, which either puts me in southern new york or northern new jersey, and i was looking at the sky, and from behind a cloud that was to my right, a black, metallic sphere about the size of a marble, possibly a penny, flew out from behind the cloud and for several seconds was in plain view before flying behind some trees and apparently disappearing. my first thoughts were probably something along the lines of, \"holy crap! a black sphere is floating across the sky at high speeds!\" pretty much, this was a sphere that was black and metallic. it had no blinking lights or moving parts, nor did it have any trails coming off of its back. it was shiny too, almost to the point of being as bright as the sun, but it could have been reflecting the sun's light off of its metallic surface. if flew in a straight line from the clouds to the trees, and disappeared, either by landing, some sort of cloaking device, or maybe it just went behind the car. i spent about fifteen minutes looking for any other of these objects (none of which i found) and afterwords attempted to tell a couple close friends, who asked if i was joking, like if i were to say yes they would call me crazy and hit me over the head with the nearest available object. i have not given my address and phone number because i am 15 (almost 16) and my

grandparents' home on airport property to collect their mail while they were away.  this was in the area of linthicum [near glen burnie, between baltimore & annapolis, near what is now baltimore washington international] \r\n\r\nthe b&o railroad ran parallel to baltimore & annapolis blvd.  we were driving up poplar ave towards the tracks when my mother stopped the car.  something was traveling above the tracks, moving slowly, from right to left.  it appeared cigar shaped, but maybe have been a disc, but looked different because of the angle. it was silver, but not shiny.  more of a brushed metallic finish.  this was not an airplane.  i grew up at the airport, and spent as much time there than i think i did at school.  planes i knew.  this craft/ship/vehicle had multi-colored lights down the side that 'chased' firing quickly and gave the vessel the appearance of moving more quickly than it actually was.  it was large, bigger than a locomotive.  it was perfectly silent.  we watched for about ten, perhaps 15 minutes as it travelled up the tracks, and gradually descended into the gully where the tracks ran, then quickly, it climbed up above the trees, made a hard right and sped off into the sky.\r\n\r\nwe weren't afraid.  it was facinating, and there was a sense of wonderment about the whole episode.  \r\n\r\nthis same craft was reported in the baltimore sun paper as having been seen in the area of hampton roads va, where it went underwater and traveled north, then surfaced at the mouth of the chesepeake bay.  \r\n \r\nthe sighting was reported by telephone to the tower at friendship airport and the civil air patrol, but there was never any report made.\r\n \r\nmy mother and i were two of the witnesses.  my grandfather was superintendent at the airport, and gave us the numbers to call in the reports.  this was on a friday or saturday.  on monday, our class had a report due on current events.  we were warned by my grandfather not to talk about it, because we might get a 'visit' [he never said by whom].  someone else  in the class had the article from the sun paper and used that as his subject matter.\r\n \r\ni've contacted the archives of the sun, and have checked other papers in the area as well.  the washington post was a possiblity but they had no coverage that i could find.  the news american has since been purchased by the sun [in 1986] and they had no coverage either.  i have not found any information in the project bluebook files, at least not in what's posted online.\r\n \r\ni am wondering if this may be related to a close encounter at about the same time in canada, where a craft landed in a field and a polish engineer received burns and radiation-like symptoms for touching the craft [it was featured on unsolved mysteries around

the subdivision so we went down a street that it was about to cross.  it slowly moved over our car and we then saw it change into a different red upside down parachute look.  it also started to get more clear and not so fire red.  it then took over only to come back about 20 minutes later for a brief time to hover once again then suddenly disappear.\r\n\r\ni'm not the type to ever report

metro airport all my life and this did not look like a plane. i can't say much about what i saw, but just want to see if anybody else saw this same object.  it was silver, cigar shaped and moved like the speed of a plane, but something was different about the trajectory and fluidity of this objects movement.  i really wanted to say it was a plane, but i could not come to that conclusion.  also, this made no sound as all planes do and was not coming from the airport or into the airport.  this object was moving from north to south.\r\n\r\ni saw this object while i was riding my bicycle in which i do daily.  i have seen hundreds if not more planes over the years and this one caught my eye as just being different.  again, something just seemed different about this object.  it moved move smoothly than the average plan.  honestly, it was a little too far to determine what it was, but looked different.  the feelings i felt were just normal for i could not determine what it was exactly.  i would of felt different if i knew for a fact of what it was 100%.  i took a camera phone picture of it, but was a very bad one.  if i was in a car i would have followed it from north to south, but on a bicycle i would have had no chance.  just want to see if anybody else saw this object.","distance":"Over One
