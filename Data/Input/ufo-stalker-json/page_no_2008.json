the north east for about 20-30mn in total.\r\n\r\nthey looked like orange lights flying fast and high, we thought it could be balloons but there wasn't a strong wind tonight to explain their speed and directions: they seemed to go high first on the south west, some looking like dancing with each other, and then crossing straight over london to the north east.\r\n\r\nwe caught it on camcorder and

strobing, light.  from point of observation, object was about 5 degrees in elevation at a heading of about 345 to 355 in azimuth, relative to north. range was estimated to be about 2 to 2.5 miles from point of observation.  observation was made at ground level (sea level), approximately 400 feet from tampa bay (this object was in weedon island state preserve).  shape of object could not be determined due to the object strobing white, then changing color to orange, then red, then back to white, and then repeating this color shift.  object has been observed now for about 45 minutes and the st petersburg fl police has been notified of the sighting. size of of object could not be accurately determined due to low light conditions (night time), however, it is estimated to be approximately 100-200 feet in diameter.  object drifts slowly in a primarily north-south motion (relative to itself (north-south not true north-south)), and moves (drifts) no more than one hundred feet if an imaginary central datum point was set.  drifting could also be described as being random in pattern when the object varies from the north-south plane of motion.  object also emits smaller strobing objects primarily of orange and red color, and has these objects strobe out from the main body no more than a distance of 100 feet (staying relatively close).  these smaller strobes are illuminated for less than 2 seconds from the time of it being strobed from the main body. after this time these smaller strobing bodies extinguish and do not re-illuminate.\r\nend of report.

my dog and happened to glance up.  i noticed a large venus size and shape orb...That was beneath the clouds.  it was moving slowly eastward.  suddenly..It abruptly turned south and then went straight up to star level and faded away within 2 seconds.  i estimate it went from in our atmosphere to outside our atmosphere in 2 seconds.  in other words...It went 80,000 to 120,000 feet in 2 seconds...Without one sound.  no emissions...No chemical trails.  \r\n\r\ni have lived near o'hare airport my entire life and know full well what a plane looks like.  this was not a plane.  it was

will see it...And you will agree...It is not from earth.  i highly doubt the military would be testing anything with that extreme speed right near the highly populated suburbs of chicago.  i have seen this blue-white orb moving along before...Even closer than tonight...And i am now convinced that it is not only under intelligent control, but i am convinced that whatever it is that i was lucky enough to see again...Is definitely not from earth.  nothing we have could have chased that thing down.  \r\n\r\ni wonder if radar caught it, but i have no idea...And i probably will never know if someone is/was tracking this thing.  i posted this to share information, but also in hopes that by some freak chance...Someone around here looked up into the sky at the same spot i did...And saw the same thing.  again...That would not be the first time for that, either.  other people in illinois have reported this same thing...To this very site.  why did i get to see it?  my answer is because i tend to look up at the sky more than most people do.  look up between 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm and you just might see it, but good luck sleeping after.  you will be up half the night wondering what you just witnessed.  if i had my video camera with me...It would be so hard to zoom in and get a good shot of it...But i will keep trying.  it was too quick to get the angle on it...Even if i had a

bright gold object crossing the sky from east to west. i watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth. the object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. later that night, i saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed. some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray. at about 3:00am on the 8th of july i saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet. the object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head. i was unable to discern its shape. it then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star. but if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn���t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device. then i noticed there were other ���stars��� in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion. as i watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds. then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars. \r\njuly 8th 2010, dusk.\r\ndue to the prior night���s events, i found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. from this vantage point i witnessed hundreds of these ���stars��� crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth. they moved so slowly that if i hadn���t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, i never would have noticed. but i did notice. and as the ships reached earth the sun went down. but just before it was totally dark, i caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships. to my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. it hummed soothingly. the other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets. occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights. the ships then circled around seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars. i stayed up all night watching the ships that remained. some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. i got some footage with my cell phone. but the quality is pretty low. also, they knew when i was about to take a picture because almost every time i raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern. i talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me. for a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. so i said, ���okay, i���ll but my camera away.��� then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, i saw a golden light arise over capitol hill. it neared me. when it flew past, i saw that it was another ship that had just come in. then i walked home and went to bed.

happened to glance up at the sky westward and noticed that one of the stars seemed to be pulsating. at first i thought that it might be venus or a satellite moving across the horizon towards the north when it started moving rapidly across the sky. i know it was not a airplane by the rate of speed and altitude when the object made a right angle turn downward and then another right angle turn south and never changed it's rate of speed. as the object got about halfway back across the sky where i initially noticed the object, the object turned upward in an arc like turn while it ascended to where the object appeared as a little point of light instead of the bright star i originally thought that it was. it pulsated 4 or 5 times and then descended as quickly as it ascended back down to about the level in the sky where it started from. at this point i'm losing it because this can't be happening and to make sure that i'm not crazy, i pulled out an l.E.D light i had in my pockect and started flashing it at the light and the light maved towards my direction and aligned itself with my position, this is when i noticed a second starlike object to the first objects left begin to move across the sky in a loop the loop type fashion  so i started flashing the l.E.D. at this object also and it seemed to respond by stopping, descending and pulsating in accordance with each flash from my light. to my astonishment the first objecttraversed the horizon in a triangular direction which as far as i know convetional aircraft can not do. i must have played this game of flash and pulsate until dawn. as the dawn approached both objects seemed to ascend and as they became small points of light in the sky they were joined by a third light. the morning sky became brighter and the the objects appeared to fade into sky. i found myself thinking that i must be losing my mind and why am i witnessing this by myself, nobody is going to believe this. i found myself wishing that whatever it was that i saw, if it is extraterrestrial and they were trying to communicate with me, why won't they come on down? i plan to be in the same place around the same time to see if i was just seeing things or was my mind playing tricks on me! this time i will bring my video camera to record anything that takes place. here's to hoping i'm not crazy.

traditional date of the 4th.  my home is situated where the fireworks are visible from my yard and i decided to snap some pictures of the displays.  i took a total of 23 shots between 9:46pm and 9:56pm (eastern) with most of them being from the same vantage point facing south.   many of the photos contain odd lights that are not firework embers, and i���ve attributed the lights to being as yet unexploded ordinances or stars and planets that were momentarily visible through smoke and cloud.  and some of the photos show ���orbs��� that i attribute to particles in the air near the camera lens (see photo #01 at 9:46).  but there are blue spheres that appear in various sizes, locations and light densities (meaning level of brightness) in a few photos that i cannot explain away.   they are quite bright and well defined in 2 of the photos. \r\n\r\nin photos #14 (9:49pm) & #17 (9:52pm), a blue sphere is visible that is fairly large, very distinct and surrounded by light.  enlargement of the anomalies shows a clearly 3-dimensional blue ball shaped object at the center.  the anomaly appears on the immediate left edge of the firework display in photo #14 and to the right of the display in photo #17.    this blue sphere does not appear in photos #15 (9:50) or #16 (9:51).  nor does it appear immediately after photo #17 in either #18 or #19 which were also shot at 9:52pm.  \r\n\r\ncamera used:  olympus camedia digital d-540z, 3.2 megapixel\r\n\r\nduring the entire 10 minutes in which i snapped pictures, i rarely looked at the scene via the naked eye. i primarily viewed the fireworks through the camera, so i did not see the blue spheres until the photos were viewed and downloaded into my computer.  perhaps they are just a trick of the camera, but i submit the photos for the viewer to decide.  \r\n\r\n(ref previous case file 18088)  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

airplane.The plane was traveling straight towards myself in the west direction.There is an airport some 10 miles away so i thought i was watching a plane.I notice the sound of the engine was not that of a normal aircraft.It had 3 ligths in a triangle pattern one green light in front and two red lights in the back.All three lights were flashing slowly.It got closer i noticed the sound saw the lights as it got directly above me it vanished along with the sound.I have been watching planes come and go while waiting for my wife and i have never seen a plane travel this route so low and in this direction.The feeling i got after i saw this was very shocked because i had never seen a plane suddenly shut off all lights and engine sound too.It baffled me.I have also seen lights that seem to keep their distance from me but also seem to follow me.I will drive to tampa and pick up my 2 sons and have a light some distance away from me but travel along with me like (it) thinks that i do not notice this thing off in the distance keeping up with me.It has done this to me more than a couple of times.It looks like a star but its way to bright be a star and star do not fly ahead of you about a couple of miles and sit there until you catch up and then take off another couple miles ahead and sit and wait for you.Well thats all for now.\r\n\r\nthank you

went out on my back patio deck with my wife my daughter and nephew at around 1010pm i seen the first object flying towards my house maby 25000 ft in hight ,through my binauculars the objects looked disc shaped which my nephew also confirmed their was no noise at all and i have to mention commercial planes fly over alought so i know the differance plus these objects were one solid color the second object got really bright several times i scan the sky's every chance i get and i can tell you they deffinately were not any conventional planes the sightings lasted untill they went out of view about 2 minutes after they were out of sight three large planes flew over they sounded louder than the commercial planes do but with all the exitement i couldnt say for sure they were military but it certainly seemed weird that they would fly by right after these objects did they were travelling at a steady pace changed direction slightly to the right and headed in the direction of port morion if you were to draw a straight line, over the last four to five years i have seen several very interesting objects the very best were a kind a chevron shaped object which looked semi transparent almost like the colors were moving around constantly because you could see the night sky in between the color which was a pinkish red the left wing tilted downwards then it straightened out then the right wing tilted then it started to accelerate very quickly i reported that sighting to brian vike's web site if it's archived their the report would have more than i can remember now,another night when i got home from work around 11:15pm i went out for a smoke and while i was standing on the side of my house talking on the phone i commented on how dark and clear the night was to my friend who got me interested in ufo watching anyway when i turned my head to the left i seen a very bright amber orange light flying towards me so i ran in the house and went to the back patio where i watched this object fly by very slowly at first then it started to accelerate and climbed very quickly in altitude on what looked like at least a 65%incline until it went out of site those to sightings happened approximately 2 years ago that sighting was also sent to brian vike,so that's it their seems to be a fair amount of activity in this area and i thought it would be nice to share it thank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24374,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.1465199,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07092010-0008","longitude":-60.189874,"occurred":1278565800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nova

summer's night in florida.  viewing toward the east and scanning the constellations that were unusually bright for this time of year, i focused on scorpio to the south/southeast.  after a few seconds of viewing scorpio, i wondered if sagitarrius was above the horizon yet.  as i moved my view more to the southeast suddenly a large bright yellowish green circle appeared out of nowhere.   it was high in the sky and just east of scorpio trailing a short streak of silver-white plume moving straight northward with incredible speed.  and then disapeared just as suddenly.  the total viewing lasted approximately three seconds.\r\n\r\ni orginally thought i had witnessed merely a common meteor.  but, after further thought, a meteor the size of this object would have left a much larger trail and made a brilliant flash of light upon disintergration.  if it were a meteor it's size alone would have lent it to trail completely across the sky.  and the object just vanished with no final event.  no flash, explosion or anything.  it just switched off and disappeared.  as an armchair astronomer this event consummed only about three degrees or so of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nnote:  the attached image
