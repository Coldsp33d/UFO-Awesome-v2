10 to 15 bright amber/orange orbs of light. the lights were perfectly round in shape. i immeidiately thought wow those are cool fireworks.. then i pulled off to the side of the highway and just kept watching them ,i managed to get three pictures with a proffesional canon 20d dslr   using my 300mm lens , :note, i actually had time to reach into the back seat grab my camera select wich lens i should use attach the lens select my camera setting's, and the subjects were still hovering?? at the time of the photo's the objects started dispersing and slowly dissapearing one by one.. i have never seen anything like this in my life and i was trying to make sense of it for days and days?? what kind of objects stay in the sky like that are just hovering ? and mostly why did they move in different directions? i was thinking maybe flares? but  the wind would have made all of the fireballs move at the same rate in the same direction.. at first all of the orbs were in a group spread out over what seemed to be a mile or so then they all just drifted in different directions at all different speeds ,some moved away fast ,while others hovered , then three past me traveling east and just vanished? ? i am freaked out , i am an avid astronomer and see moving things in the sky all the time, i have quite large telescopes and always come to a solution that is in the end is\"man made\" this was way beyond just a light in the sky ,it was close to me, two planes flew over it right as it happened \"1\" 747, and \"1\" small cesna-172, theese objects were not anywhere near flight altitude ,i fly with my brother on occasion he is a lisenced pilot, i also noticed that others on long island saw the same thing on the same day ,\"at the same time\"!!! please email me if you also saw this or if you want more information and pictures.. ---> [email address

from the 29th of june to the 5th of july. my yorkie was so frighten that she was hiding, so i thought that the best thing to do was to take her for a ride and show her what it was all about.  she love's christmas lights.  once she understood that the loud noise was related to the pretty colors she calmed down and we actually had a nice ride along the east side of wichita at about 9:45 - 10:30 pm on the evening of the fourth of july, 2010.\r\n     we turned around at our local super market and headed south of harry st on webb road on the south east side of wichita.  up in the sky i noticed an bright orange object heading towards us from a east by south east direction at approximately 300 feet high.  i thought it looked like a small balloon at first until it came closer. then in the middle of the circle there was what appeared to be a flame or a yellowish part with a darker part below in the shape of a vertical cylinder.  i thought at that time that it was a small hot air balloon of some sort probably set up by some pranksters in our local area.  this has happened here before and is very dangerous to our farmers fields. it keep coming in a straight line with out variance left or right or ascent or decent.  this didn���t make sense because if this orange glowing orb was being pushed by the evening wind currents then there certainly would have been some sort of noticeable drift. there wasn't.\r\n     about 20 mins earlier my dog and i were watching a neighbor family set off their fire works in front of their home in the street as it is our custom here.  they set off several \"shower of spark's\". we were parked down wind of them and had to move the car because the thick smoke was blowing into the car making it uncomfortable. the smoke came in gust's as it moved through the air and in a direct north direction. this is how i know for sure about the wind that night.  besides if you live in kansas, knowing about the wind is second nature. \r\n     as it floated over head i saw what i thought was a darker cylinder in the object was more like a flat bottom.  this thing what ever it was had dimension. there was a top and a  bottom and a round body that was glowing orange with a slightly yellowish center.  it had a set course and a set attitude. the yellow in the center did vary in intensity. at times it was more yellow and less yellow but not anything like a hot air balloon using its tanks to maintain a constant flight plan. \r\n\tit continued in a west by north west direction and it became harder and harder to see due to distance . the whole sighting lasted about 1 to 2 mins. i have lived around air force base's for thirty years and i have never seen any thing like this. \r\n     could this be a prank? possibly. but i would like to see somebody duplicate every thing that this u. f. o. accomplished in such a short period of time.  to duplicate this flight i would estimate would cost thousands of dollars in research and development and then thousands more to implement. could some body get lucky and set a luminous, lighter than air platform into the sky and accomplish what this u. f. o. did?  silent flight, a perfect flight path, constant altitude, no pitch or yaw flying against a wind current, an unknown propulsion system, an unknown energy source.  yea, i guess they could but i would like to reserve a crap table in vegas with these guys for just a few short hours.\r\n\tone other thing,  i guess a lot of other people saw these things in other parts of the country on july 4th, 2010.\r\n\r\ntruthfully,\r\n*(wit's

reminded me of the big dipper.  i fully expected the obols to drift down and dissipate as i assumed they were part of one of the fireworks.  it didn't take long for me to realize these were no fireworks.  the lights were more orange than red, perfectly round and continued to hang in the same position for at least the 15 minutes that i was outside with the dogs.  it slowly dawned on me that

parking lot. time was approximately 7:00pm. i noticed a white light going on and off approximately twice the height of the telephone poles following route 31 west. it appeared to be a helicopter at first, but as it got closer i noticed that the light was not flaring out like a search light - it appeared more like a laser. every time a car would approache where it was, the light would go out. \r\n\r\ni continuted to watch it as it cam right across from me, and there was a small red light that appeared to go in a circle underneath it. at the times that the white light was on, i could see part of the bottom of the craft and it looked like a dark metal with geometric patterns. i could hear the cars on route 31, but i could not hear the craft.\r\n\r\ni recently retired from a state government job and am a professional with two graduate degrees. i am also a vietnam era usaf veteran and have been on both sac and mac bases. what bothered me about this craft was that i could not identify a propolsion system. i didn't hear anything at all. it's edges were a bit...Hazy ...Almost like watching the air over something hot. it also appeared to shift a bit from side to side, but the light remained stable. hard to describe. i never did see the complete shape as it was dark out and the craft would probably not even be seen if it weren't for the red circling light and the white laser type light. my guess is that it would have been approx. the size of a bus and was moving at approx 15 20 mph.  \r\n\r\ni've been around large balloons and they still make noises from heating the air inside the balloon. this craft made no noise at all, and just followed the road. \r\n\r\ni waited until i retired to post anything on my experience. if anyone knows what this thing was, feel free to contact me. i thought it might have been a stealth military craft, but i knew people in the air force at the time this happened and they told me that none of the craft that they knew of was completely silent.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24357,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.2200583,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07082010-0015","longitude":-78.3869685,"occurred":599558400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
