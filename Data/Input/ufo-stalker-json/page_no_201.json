mentioned, happened to look up to see a perfect white crescent shaped object resembling a waxing or waning moon only about 20% of the size passing directly over head from east to west which was the opposite direction to the cloud movement that day. it was quite easy to see and focus on, it was completely white and absolutely perfect in shape with no markings, windows or seams visible. it appeared to be at high altitude as it was well above the highest layer of clouds, possibly as high as a jumbo jet as after spending the rest of the day watching the sky i had noticed the only other objects above that cloud layer were jumbos, only if it was that high it was much larger and faster approximately 3 or 4 times the speed and over 4 times the wingspan, it could have been lower though, it was very hard to tell with such a smooth looking object. the object was only visible for about 15 seconds as its path took it behind a small cloud and it never appeared out the other side. i tried to bring it to my friends attention but by the time he was able to look up it was gone. feeling like he might think i was crazy i brushed it off.\r\nnow for some speculation..\r\nat first glance i actually thought it was an extremely large spherical object passing earth through space. i know that sounds weird but its just the way it looked mostly due to how perfect the crescent shape was but when i realised i could not see the shaded part of the sphere as you would with a crescent moon i ruled that out it was also moving way to fast for that. it could be some kind of drone but ive never seen any aircraft that shape before, despite the hours of research ive done since and to my knowledge it doesnt make sense aerodynamically to make an aircraft that shape and it doesnt have any favourable stealth properties either... to my knowledge.  also its solid white colour and lack of markings just didnt seem right to

wasn’t much to see but when i zoomed in digitally afterwards i saw something really bizarre. a very bright (reflective?) object that seems to be kind of a vertical to the horzion hoop

the parking lot got out of the car and noticed out of the corner of my eye a light that caught my attrition to the direct south on the horizon. at this point the light had no shape but appeared odd because i couldn’t process what i was seeing, it looked like the thrust that you see coming out of a large rocket only if it was a rocket the thrust would be directed down towards the ground, what was odd about this light was the thrust appeared to be directed up towards the sky and so i stood there trying to figure out what it was. it appeared to be moving upwards towards space, the light changed the higher up it seemed to go, like turning down a flame to a camping lantern and continued to diminish in intensity growing smaller until it was no longer observable. i processed this as some kind of rocket or jet that just went so far up into the sky that it was no longer visible, i turned my head to the left looked to the east and took about 3 steps in the direction of my apartment still processing what i saw and again something in that same area of the sky out of my right peripheral vision. i stopped looked to the right, in the south the object appeared to change from a light to a transparent orb, at that moment my thought was it’s like a photo negative, it’s there, moving but i can see through it, then i thought that what i first saw was not moving towards space but rather moving from south to north and then becoming stealth. the object or orb traveled in the sky at approximately 500 feet between south ave and southern blvd. headed north. just north of youngstown is the youngstown airport with a military base. as the orb got closer to my location i could see detail on the surface, interlocking triangles shifting in sequence only i can see through it and it was moving with no sound, looking exactly like the icon of epcot in the epcot center at the walt disney world resort in bay lake, florida, near orlando. as the object moved to the north and away from me red lights like powerful leds started going off then stopped. i called 911 and reported it, about 30 minutes later a black unmarked helicopter with search lights was seen looking for something.

after the concert, i went into the woods to urinate. mind you, i had not even a drop of alcohol or any mind altering substances. the parking lot was full with cars and people hanging out and tailgating. it was approximately 11:30pm. as i was peeing, i remember my body feeling weird and a bright, bright light, i can't explain the feeling in my body more then that. then,  nothing, absolutely nothing. i started walking back to the parking lot feeling a little disoriented, is the best word. as i stepped out of the woods i realized there was nobody there, no cars, no people. i was beyond scared. terrified absolutely bewildered. i walked to a gas station near by, looked at a clock and noticed it was 4:06am. i had to call my father to pick me up because my ride couldn't find me, even looking in the area i went to pee. at the time, my only conclusion was someone slipped me a mickey some how. i've been struggling with this for years. i haven't told a soul except my daughter who is 4 about being abducted. i told her when she was 2 so she has no clue. i think about it every day. i was of sound mind, i have no other theory then being abducted. i'm probably the worst witness because i don't remember anything that  happened other then a weird feeling and a bright light. i've thought about hypnosis but i don't want people to think i'm nuts. it's very difficult to deal with for me. you are the only place i have reached out to, to give me any kind of answer. i know there's not much to go on but that's all i got.
