States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was traveling westbound on i90 at approximately 9pm or so and i noticed fireworks off to my left from the hoffman estates festival and slightly off to the right of the fireworks  i saw an orange light coming from that direction moving east/northeast.  i see planes all the time including large airliners as well as small planes and at a distance i thought this is what it was.  i quickly ruled out a large airliner as it got closer since it appeared to be at about 700 feet so i then thought it could be a small plane until it got even closer and i could see there were no red or blue lights or anything indicative of any plane or helicopter.  i could only watch it to the point out my windshield where it went almost directly over my car but it was sufficient to get a clear view of it.  my first reaction after ruling out any known aircraft was to think it was some sort of ember from the fireworks display but logically i knew this couldn't be the case as it seemed too large to be anything like that and it travelled fast and steady both horizontally  and vertical y relative to any fireworks i could see from the direction it came.  it was clear that the rest of the fireworks were doing their own thing and this thing was clearly staying at the same altitude and speed for the time i saw it moving away from the fireworks area.  as it came over my car, i struggled to see its shape and i almost call it round but it appeared to have some edges which i might describe as diamond shaped.  it had a glow to it, dark orange in the center fading to a lighter orange closer to the outside and then ever so thin maybe a grayish edge although it was hard to tell due to the glow from inside.  it was not flickering, bouncing or doing anything weird, it was simply a consistent intensity of a dull dark orange center to a lighter orange around the center travelling at a consistent speed and altitude.  i have always had an open-mind to such things and this is the very first time in my 40 years of life i have seen something so inexplicably different.  my question is, what was it doing there and where was it going and for what reason?  it obviously didn't care that people were seeing it or it wanted to be seen but why?","distance":"501 Feet - 1

denville nj.  i saw a formation of 7 or 8 lights flying in a nne direction. they were in a \"check\" formation with more lights on one leg than the other. they passed silently and i only \r\nobserved them for 3 or 4 seconds. the sky was totally cloudless so i \r\nknow they weren't reflected lights. they were solid, steady orangeish \r\nlights. no pulsing, no flashing. there were no blinking lights of any \r\ncolor associated with them. because i couldn't guess the altitude i have \r\nno reference to there size other than to say they would be about the \r\nsize of a 20 inch object seen at 45-50 feet. there was no trail behind \r\nthem and they moved in a straight line. i was outside on my deck talking \r\nto a friend who was waiting to catch a flight in california. i was \r\nsitting back looking up in a northerly direction. they entered my line \r\nof sight from behind and to the left, flying out of sight over the roof \r\nin a nne direction. has anyone else reported anything similar at that \r\ntime on that date? i did not make any other report of this incident to \r\nany official government organization as i was waiting to see if there \r\nwere any news stories in the paper that would confirm what i saw, but \r\nnothing has been printed. if you wish anymore details, and i'm sure i \r\nhaven't thought of everything you might want to know.\r\n  after checking with my friend, according to her phone log we spoke \r\nfrom 2:10 to 2:54 so the time of the sighting  was closer to 2:30 am. \r\nour property backs up on rt 80 with a tall sound barrier in between. at \r\nthat time of the morning there is very little traffic. as i said \r\nearlier, the sky was clear so there was no cloud deck to reflect lights. \r\nfurthermore the direction of travel of the objects was perpendicular to \r\nthe highway. i am not a trained observer, have not served in the \r\nmilitary or law enforcement. i am 48 yrs old and work for (**work info and home address deleted--sgonzalez/cms) nj if you wish to check an on line map. the objects didn't flash by nor did they just drift. at the speed they were moving and as quiet as it was then i would have expected to hear some noise but there was none. they were not fireworks and the precision of the formation leads me to believe they were not space debris or meteors. i hope this info helps.\r\n\r\nnote: ken pfeifer state director of investigations spoke to the witness today 7-7-10. we are getting more info about this sighting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the sun had just set, we were sitting on the tailgate looking at the neighbors treeline directly across the street, this line of trees from were we sat was roughly 150 yards away, that was our horizon, we witnessed what i would describe as a glowing orange ball wobbling slightly back and forth starting to clear the tree line in front of us and moving up. the ball was from my perspective about the diameter of a dime, if you held a dime out in front of your face next to where you see this in the air it was a bit smaller than a dime, it also seemed to be miles behind the treeline in front of us, but that was all we could see was the neighbors woods in front, i knew that he owned a couple acres behind there this could have been miles behind his property. because it looked small but i could clearly see it was orange and round like a ball. i watched it slowly wobble slightly left to right as it rose into the air. this went on for fifteen minutes as it slowly gained altitude all the while wobbling back and fourth, once it reached what appeared from my view point maybe two thousand feet in the air the orange light simply disappeared as if a lite switch was turned off. then about five to ten minutes later something behind and above us cast light onto the ground, very dim but enough to capture my attention, as i turned to look behind maybe a half mile back and around five hundred feet up, moving from right to left, in one motion, was a flaming ball that looked to me like a large, basketball sized roman candle ball shooting behind where we sat. i would guess its rough speed was around 40 miles per hour. it had a slight trail, and was greenish/blue with some white and orange coloring. it went to the left of our view a couple houses over but then went out of view because the land sloped down. i thought this was strange but didn't feel alarmed or frightened by the event, just curious, i thought perhaps someone shot a roman candle but because of its height, speed, burn time, and lack of sound, plus the neighborhood was quiet, i didn't know what to think it was. a month later at the same location, doing the same thing, sitting on the back of the truck, this time a couple hours after the sun had went down, we saw the same sequence of events, the orange ball across the street, followed by the flare/mini meteor object behind us, the only differance this time was that the flare/mini meteor object seemed a bit lower altitude this time, maybe only three hundred feet up, still moving from right to left, but i heard what i would describe as the sound of rock sizzling as it whizzed past us. this is why i call it a mini meteor. the first time this happened in febuary, then a month later. i was in the army stationed at ft.Hood texas at the time. i was off duty and off base when this was witnessed on both occasions, the town of kempner is about twenty miles west of the center of ft.Hood. when we saw the orange ball we were looking towards the south, ft.Hood was to our left, which would have been east, the flare object came east to west. i did read online after this sighting that in 1947 two soldiers stationed at what was then called, camp hood,(ft.Hood)  witnessed what they described as flare like objects in the sky. in both events i felt normal, no missing time or any strange marks.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":24331,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.089997,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072010-0030","longitude":-97.9935549,"occurred":917769600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

im writing you right now, cause im freakin out cause i just experienced the most unexplainable thing thats ever happened to me, and with our background knowledge and our better understanding to whats actually out there, i figured you'd be the only one who would hear me out and not think im nuts instead. ok... so i was driving back from going to blockbuster wanting to rent tapes, and it was closed, and i forgot to get cigs, so i have to go back out to get them, but besides that point, the trip was basically useless. so im about to pull in my driveway, and i notice weird lights in the sky. at first, i thought it was an airplane, cause it had blinking lights of blue and red, but dismissed that idea when i noticed how impossible the movements it was making. and as i was looking at it, though, watching it almost flying around, stopping for a minute and moving again to the next spot, i dunno if it was a trick of my eyes, or what, but i could've sworn i saw a very thin beam going down to the ground for a few seconds. at the moments when it was stopped. now, i know right now, i sound insane, but i swear man, i've never seen a ufo before, but this genuinely is true!!! i would never ever lie about something like this, if you ask anybody who knows me, they can tell you im the most honest person they know. anyways, so i started freaking out, and parked at the end of my driveway, in the middle of the street, just amazed at what i was witnessing. and wondering if it could see me. and i actually was speaking out loud to it, as if i was talking to it as if it were a person, \"can you see me?\" and when i said that, it slowed down and stopped for a minute, and then it went white and moved back as it blinked out. and i was like, \"holy ****, omg!!!\" and i stayed for a minute and noticed it above the trees which i was at first looking at it between. it seemed to be traveling across the sky, closer to where i was. this is when i really started to get the adrenaline pumping cause it was almost as if it was responding to me. so i slowly pulled in my driveway while watching it coming closer in the sky, and i parked and got out. now, here was my chance to see if i could hear anything, that way, as impossible it may have seemed at the time, i was thinking, maybe it was a helicopter. so, i was standing outside watching it get closer, and then finally passing me by slowly overhead, and continuing. no sound whatsoever as it glided smoothly in the sky, still with that light pattern (which was very unique also) of blue and red. the scarier thing?? as i watched it passby overhead, i saw another one doing the same from the opposite direction, over from behind me!! i looked in the sky closer and noticed a few of them!!! one or two doing that weird beam thing i said before!!! i was having a panic attack by then, ran inside. my mind was racing!!! and of course, i know it of course could be extraterrestrial, but my mind clicked with a scarier thought... that it could be some kind of top secret ****** up government ****!!!! anyways, i went on my back porch for a minute trying to find them again, but i didnt see them. im about to go out to the driveway again, cause thats more open sky, and see if i can find one again.

i was walking down the dean bridge.\r\ndean in general is covered by forrest, so as i was walking the bridge there was forrest on both sides of me. the tree lines of the forrest left middle viewing of the night sky. so i could see the moon and some stars, very pretty. but the trees wouldn't allow me to see the left or right side of the night sky. the bridge slants to the right side, so it was kinda hard to walk on it, espicially all the cars zooming by so fast.\r\nas im walking i look down on the floor and notice all the trash on the bridge. thats when i hear a strange sound panning into my right ear. the sound gets louder and louder. a description of the sound is hard to describe, but here it goes....Deffinately loud and i started to notice a rythem to the sound, it sounded very swooshy going back and fourth, before the craft came into sight i could tell that the sound it made was that of a very large scanning/radar device scanning planet earth, earth as in the dean forrest where i happen to be walking by. so while im still walking and hear it i look up to see what it is. then the giant hover craft slowly hovers into view, at first i saw the middle diamond triangle point. instantly i knew this was not a plane of any sort, it wasnt shaped like a plane, deffinately did not sound like any plane engine and no air plane flys so close to trees, electrical poles and even nearby stores and houses. the alien hover craft now takes up more than half the night sky. im walking forward while looking straight up at the sky, it got to the point were i could not see no such thing as night sky, only the massive size of this hover craft. so everything around became much more darker with no moon light. sense the hover craft afirst appeared it had some what random flashing lights in differant order and differant color.\r\nthe random colors inclueded red, white, green and yellow lights. the lights were located in differant spots, it felt like the lights would chose were to flash, so they never really flashed in the same spot, either changing possition or change of color in the selected possition.\r\nthe loud scanning/radar sound could still be heard. as it covered the night sky i felt a somewhat change in temperture, the heat around me elevated, like a mass amount of radiation being emitted from either the lights, or the hover craft technology being used. around this time i got another feeling as if time was slowling down for me making the sighting more meaningfull. this is around the time that one of the drivers see me, some random guy looking straight up at the sky, not even looking at the road. my guess is that the drivers didnt see the craft at all, cause it was too much above them. most had there windows up, if they had them down then im sure they coulda heard the futuristic radar device emitting from the hover craft. so when one of the cars honk a few times to get my attention, i wake up from the slown down trance that occured when the large craft body blocked the night sky view. i look back up at the sky and the diamond shaped hover craft is still there slowly hovering, making the same sounds and the same random order of flashing lights. at this moment i am beyond amazed like this was a life changing moment that i had been waiting for, reason being, my father is also a ufo fanatic and believes cause he too has had a couple ufo sightings, strange thing is that he too saw and encountered his first alien space craft when he was 17 in puerto rico. back too the diamond shaped craft. it was a mixture of both a diamond and a triangle, instead of a diamond back end being a mirror image of the front side, the back side was closed of and reconnected like that of a triangle. for the split seconds that the lights would shut off, thats when the craft hovered over the moonlight, so that would let me see the shadow, shape and color of the craft. the hover craft was deffinately dark grey to black in color, looked very sleek in design, it like that of a very futuristic science fiction movie, i too felt like for the first time in my life i was experiencing a sci-fi movie. even more amazed than before the hover craft slowly started to move past the dean trees so i could now see the back section of the craft with two points sticking out and reconnecting at the back. now the night sky and moonlight slowly came back into view. the craft kept on passing in its direction going over the tree line, and this whole time the craft was feets away from the tallest trees, which meant the craft was too close, this is deffinately a very close range encounter, and at such close range gave me the opportunity to really examine the craft and get full details on it. by this time i reached the road again so no more bridge. now only 25 percent of the craft could be seen, but the loud noise it made dimmed down as it got further from me. i can still hear te hovering, then it hovers pass the tree line, becoming out of sight, but for the next 30-50 seconds i could still hear the rythmic scanning device and the sound of hovering. it is now gone completely but still hovering in the area, i wish i coulda tooken a picture but i was too amazed, so the picture that will be posted on this, is a photo from another ufo sight of triangular crafts to give an example of its appearence. \r\nfrom what i know there was no missing gaps of time, like the betty and barnie hill case, so i wasnt abuducted, but i know that it deffinately noticed me. and its odd cause that was the night that i basicly ran away from my house and didnt come home for hours, and came home around 2 in the morning. my walk back was mesmorising. this was pretty much my perfect description of my first ufo/afo encounter. till this day, when ever im outside, i keep a constant look at the sky, day or night time, im searching and waiting for the ufo to hover by, theyve all been planes sense but i can tell the differance. its funny cause the next morning i tottaly forgot that i saw the hover craft, later in the day i remembered again and started to tell family and friends, ive told the story a good amount of times now. well thats it, i guess email me on what you think, or any questions.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24318,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.5442555,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072010-0020","longitude":-81.3707765,"occurred":1271484900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,

a larger massive diamond/triangular shape with smooth round edges.\r\n as i sat in the car with the engine turned off and the window down, i attempted to hear some type of noise...There was nothing. i

tracks, i had to follow in my car. still amazed, i was questioning what it was i just witnessed for the past 3 minutes. while trying to catch my breathe and sense of humor, i looked up  searching

airplane, but it was totally round in shape. i didn't notice any wings. that's when i got excited. i didn't hear any noise. it was moving se to nw in a straight line. i see planes all of the time, from passenger planes to military planes high in the atmosphere. the object i saw left no exhaust trails and moved faster then any flying object i have ever seen. it was only in view for less 30

briefly to speak with a neighbor who passed in his car, and then resumed my walk.  the street i was on runs north-west to south-east for a short distance and then curves to a north to south orientation.  as i rounded the curve headed due south, i received a text message from my son who was at work.  the text message arrived at 21:46.  i read the message and slipped my phone back in my pocket.  as i did so, i looked up into the southern night sky and immediately noticed two points of light which i initially thought were stars.  they were not blinking or flashing, were white in color, and were stationary, at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  the lights were side by side, and parallel to the horizon.  within a few seconds of seeing them, the points of light began a slow rotation to an orientation vertical to the horizon, with one above the other.  the rotation took about 3-5 seconds.  after moving to the vertical orientation they stopped and remained motionless for about 5 seconds.  by this time i had stopped walking and was standing stationary, in awe of what i was witnessing.  after remaining motionless in the vertical orientation for about 5 seconds, the two lights began moving in opposite directions, the bottom towards the east and the top towards the west, and an incredible rate of speed.  it only took 2-3 seconds for the lights disappear behind the trees on the eastern and western horizons.   \r\n\r\ni was startled and a little frightened by what i witnessed.  i am an avid night sky watcher and i am familiar with what airplanes and helicopters look like in the night sky.  the lights i saw were neither, nor were they meteors or satellites. the objects were obviously very far away, and to move the distances they moved in just a few seconds means they were moving incredibly fast.
