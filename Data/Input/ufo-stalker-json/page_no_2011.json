for the miami area and on march 12, 2009 at 10:25 p.M. i had my own personal ufo encounter. i was crossing back accross the street to my townhouse after going to a convenience store for a pack of cigarettes.I live on (*partial address deleted--sgonzalez/cms) and as you go east on it, it then becomes the \"96th street broad causeway\" which is over water and about a half a mile inland from miami beach/bay harbour area. as i looked in both directions, east and west for on coming traffic i saw a very unusual oblong object luminous and glowing just over the broad causeway in the east. puzzled by what i saw i continued to cross the street but instead of going in my home i continued to walk as fast as i could to get a closer look at this object. i was sure that if i just got a closer look i know i would be able to identify this object. i thought i might be looking at the side of a blimp or possibly an oblong balloon. there were definately odd things about it. it floated slowly, about 20 mph in a steady north by northwest direction heading into a residential area called \"keystone point\". it was completely silent. there was no writing, drawing or numbers on it. it had a definate luminous outline against the back drop of the dark night sky on it's bottom half and around the front and back ends. it was the upper half that i could not get a clear description of. it appeared unevenly sloped on top and seemed to narrow halfway down towards the tail end. there was a red light on the upper half, on top, mid center. there was another red light on the bottom half again, mid center. it's surface appeared to have silvery white metalic tiles that shimmered in the night sky. they were more apparent on the upper half and side and were shimmering in the night as if the object was reflecting bright lights off of it as though it were sitting in the middle of a football stadium and was covered in bright flood lights. i watched it for five minutes. it appeared about a thousand feet long and 200 feet high at it's highest point and about 1000 feet up. good year + met life denied it was there's. i discussed the object at length with (**name deleted--sgonzalez/cms), representing good year blimp. he stated that their blimp had already landed that night by 9:00 pm and was in the lauderhill area, not near me. he said the two red lights would have been beackon lights and it sounded like it was some sort of an \"airship\" but what kind he did not have a clue. it was not the other blimp by metlife because i would have seen the large snoopy dog logo on the side had it been there's. i had a clear, unobstrucked view of the object, taking my eyes off of it for only one second to see if anybody else was walking on the street, seeing what i was seeing. i was alone. when i realized that there was no logical explanation for what i was looking at that night i stopped dead in my tracks until it floated out of view.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

area in summer of 2003. event happened in early calendar summer at night (around midnight) on some night of probably late july or maybe early august. night was kind of bright thanks to a bright full moon.\r\n\r\nat late night (probably before midnight) i wanted to get some fresh air and decided to have a lonely ride in my car. i took my car from home (we were living between lake delton and wisconsin dells) and traveled at night through broadway (in wisconsin dells), then leaving wisconsin dells downtown area behind and taking right turn on some highway (from google maps i think it was route 16).\r\n\r\ni have traveled a couple miles east and then pulled over to small local dirt road (on left) ending in the middle of a corn field. i stopped the car, shut engine off and enjoyed the beautiful view of the bright full moon in front and above me while sitting in car (kind of in the middle of corn field it was). i kept my windows rolled down and enjoyed the warm summer breeze.\r\n\r\ni smoked a cigarette and at some point i noticed something odd. the sky got a little brighter than it was before, for some reason i started having a very strong urge to leave this place quickly, started looking around (nobody around, only seen maybe one or two cars passed on highway far behind me) and i noticed it got dead silent in this place.\r\n\r\nthen i noticed it. it was the moon!!! and actually it couldn't be the moon, because it was located now in a different spot on the dark sky, i also believe it appeared bigger to me than a while ago (couple minutes it takes to smoke a cig). not really knowing why it scared the hell out of me. immediately started the car and backed out of that corn field to highway shoulder and rammed on the gas pedal, i remember looking in the rear view mirror and seeing the \"moon\" now behind me while it was supposed to be on my right! geeeez ... accelerated like crazy and as fast as i could i started traveling back in wisconsin dells downtown direction. for a few minutes i was having this very very scary feeling that the \"moon\" was chasing me (maybe it was only trying to scaring me off who knows)... it all lasted maybe 10 minutes. once left the route 16 the feeling went away, everything returned to normal. moon was were it was supposed to be and there was nothing scary anymore.\r\n\r\ni will remember that feeling for a

in south st. louis city. at 10:13 someone yelled out, \"what's that!\" and pointed up at a 45 degree angle across the main street by my house. we could all see what looked like an orange pumpkin or basketball floating from our left to right. quickly another one appeared. they were traveling in a roughly se to nw direction, silent. it appeared that the bottom of the objects where a brighter orange than the rest of it, which appeared to have ridges as a pumpkin or basketball might. there was wind going in an e to w direction on the ground, but fireworks did seem to indicate that above ground the wind was more se to nw. the two objects floated mostly by our location, but went very straight along a 5 degree incline. it was as if they were on a \"rail\" in the sky as they did not quiver nor alter their speed at all during the time we could see them. when the two had mostly passed by, a third one came along the same route. the first two dimmed and went away while yet keeping the 5 degree incline. the third object got brighter as it went in the distance until i finally stopped looking at it. i got pictures but they were small and jiggly and didn't show anything definitive. they could have been chinese lanterns, though i haven't yet found any sold in our area with the shape these had. it was also quite strange that none of the three orange spheres changed the pace at which they flew by, although the wind was not so constant, nor seemingly as strong as these objects were flying fast. while i understand that it seems most reasonable to figure that the objects were chinese lanterns, it was not normal for three objects to fly in the wind at a constant rate of speed and incline, for the first two lanterns to \"burn out\" and yet increase in altitude as they burned out - and for the last one to increase its light intensity the further it got away. none of that is natural, so the lights were unidentified as far as some of us were concerned. ironically, last july 4th 3 orange \"flames\" flew by in the same general path as this year's, although last year the two witnesses agreed that the three lights literally looked like three licks of flames, orange fire without containers.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24302,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6323725,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07072010-0004","longitude":-90.1923042,"occurred":1278306780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1278489368000,"summary":"Three

vacation/rented property *(address deleted--sgonzalez/cms), when she saw two red lights appear above the horizon. she called to me to look which i did and saw a single red light before it vanished. i went inside to retrieve my binoculars, but it was too dark to see anything else. \r\n\r\nplease note that i am making this second report of the same type sighting i witnessed along with my son on a similar vacation, i think last year. it too was reported to mufon. this sighting was different in that after trying the binoculars, i went an got a night vision device, monocular in design (nvm hereafter)  with a minimal amount of magnification. \r\n\r\na few minutes later the light appeared again, followed by a second. both were well above the horizon with one at a higher altitude then the other. even though we both had heard the sound from a passing commercial jet about 10 minutes earlier (probably at 36k feet) we could hear nothing from these lights/vehicles. all commentary is based on what i saw by using the nvm from this point forward.\r\n\r\nafter about 20 seconds, the light on the right descended to a point equal with the other.  the two lights were absolutely silent and stationary until the two suddenly brightened to the point i had to look away. the lights lit the entire area below and around the vehicles but did not illuminate the crafts at all. the nvm was too bright to keep looking through and i looked away briefly. i looked back to see both dim from bright-white to the normal red. my wife was nothing less than amazed at how bright the lights were, as was i to be honest. after dimming, i could still see both while my wife could not see them at all as the lights had dimmed very low. it was only with the nvm that they could be seen after the two had brightened and then dimmed. the two remained stationary for about 20 seconds, then the one on the right migrated left and seemed to fuse with the other. the light remained the same color and intensity after the two \"joined\", if that is what they did...\r\n\r\nafter only a few seconds, the now single light began moving at a slow pace and without sound to the southwest. after crossing what i believe to be the western compass point the light split into two with one moving to the north such that it crossed the big dipper just below the \"pointers\".  after only a few seconds with both being seen in the nvm, the light that had moved towards the north also split into two separate lights. i followed the \"new\" light as it moved back towards the west. after a moment, the first light that had stayed in the west also came into view. subsequently, the western light split. now, there were four lights. these more pr less just faded away from sight after about 3 minutes. it was about 10:25 pm eastern at this point. i gave up as my arm was too fatigued to continue holding the night vision scope.\r\n\r\nthis episode is a replay, more or less of the event from last year which i reported. the only differences being attributable to the night vision scope this time, and of course the brightening of the lights of whatever these were. \r\n\r\nit should be noted that several aircraft were noted by the flashing strobes during this period, particularly towards the end. although it seemed as thought no less than two helos in the immediate area visible through the scope at the same time as two of the light made no moves to either get closer, or move away from the lights. there is no way these were any type of known aircraft; not helos, not harriers, most certainly not fixed-winged, nor were they the newer osprey. as stated in my earlier report of last year (maybe it was '08?) i am very versed in most aircraft types having grown up as the son of a marine helo driver. i have no less than 60 scaled models of aircraft on display at my home in raleigh. these vehicles made no sound. stood stationary without any detectable movement in a 20 mph wind, and got close enough together to appear to fuse into each other. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

a large firework went off in the air to the left of the objects (evening of july 5th and some people still setting off fireworks). \r\nthe sparks from the firework (which seemed to be several blocks from our house) spread in front but to the left of the 2 higher objects which gave imnpression they were much further away.\r\nmy wife said when she first saw the shapes -
