(not good at measuring distance anyway but my husband probably could give a better idea of that). \r\n\r\nas the second one was going further away, the fire seemed to die out some, then the flame came back. when first dying out i thought maybe we could see the flame much better from the front and not so well from the back because we were able to see it coming from a good distance away but not leaving us. but when the flame/brightness came back that once, it made me think that it was just disappearing. i don't know, it was just gone! suddenly.\r\n\r\nmy son has remote control air planes, little ones that you can buy at walmart. i know how these sound, this was no remote control item. i have seen the larger ones flown and you can hear them flying from 1/2 mile away, at least. it was no weather balloon or fireworks. it was controlled: height from the ground, mph, path, everything. we were all 3 in awe and absolutely amazed. we kept asking, what could it be? could anyone figure it out yet? it was not a flash, it took maybe 10-13 minutes while we stopped at the stop sign, drove a few feet, then stopped in the parking lot and stood out of the car watching both objects. i went to bed that night almost in tears knowing what we had seen. i am 45 and have never in my life had something so amazing that i could not come up some type of explanation. i wonder if there were others that had see them. there had to be! there was about 3 cars in the drive-thru next to where we stood and watched. these people had to have looked up to see what we were looking at and video taping with our phones. i wondered how do you call your police dept and make a report of something. when i mentioned that to my son, he was concerned that they would take him away because we were crazy but he knows what we saw was real. what, we don't know but it was real. someone would have to do a lot to prove to me that was not a ufo. it would have to be proven under the same conditions, air, moon light, time of night, etc. i would love for someone to prove it was something different!!\r\n\r\nvideo attachments are noted with date and time in the title. 7/4/10_22:32 and 22:34. the second one was started from my right, then straight above me then past me to my left. the first one i could not tell you exactly because we bailed out of the car and started taping so quickly. for the second one, i know more of where i was standing and my actions since i had time to video tape the first one and realize what i might be looking at.","distance":"101-500

myself were sitting on the back deck near the pool watching the sky for fireworks.  around 10:35pm i noticed a star that looked like it was moving.  i asked the 2 of them if they could also see it, they did and after we all had our eyes on the moving star it turned left 90 degrees and then vanished.  in our perspective.  we commented and joked to each other that stars are not supposed to move let alone change direction and then disappear!\r\n\r\nmy mom went into the house to use the restroom leaving my girlfriend and i on the deck watching the sky.  \r\n\r\nmy girlfriend was the first to notice what happened next.\r\n\r\nin the southern sky, not far from us (judging by the trees all around the objects had to be less than 1 mile away) we saw an orange orb flying fairly low (much lower than any plane).  with trees blocking the view of their entrance we saw the 1st orange orb fly from due west to east.  then another behind it.  then another behind that one, giving us 3 orange orbs flying in a line from west to east.  behind the 3rd orb was a small cluster of orbs, about 4 or 5 total.  they never broke their formation.  behind the cluster of 4 or 5 orbs was another 3 flying in a line just like the first three. \r\n\r\nby the time the first of the orbs was visible my mom returned from the house.  she heard us shouting and pointing at the orbs and she was able to also see them.\r\n\r\nthey passed our field of vision and then they were gone.\r\n\r\nthey looked like orange balls of light and emitted no sound.  they were moving pretty fast and never broke their formation, with the 3 in line at the start, group of approximately 5 in the center and 3 more finishing the tail of the formation.\r\n\r\nwe were all creeped out by the experience.  we have never seen something like this before.  we immediately knew this was not a firework of some sort, nor plane or helicopters.  they were much too low for it to be a normally identifiable object.  we remarked how they looked close enough where a rifle shot could have hit them.\r\n\r\njust as quickly as they flew in to our view they were gone.\r\n\r\nthe rest of the night we watched the sky and witnessed 3 more stars moving through the sky, change direction and disappear, however we did not see any more of the flying orange orbs.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

family of four and nephew went camping a few km west of kennedy lake (about 40 4m east of tofino bc) . years ago my wife and i had spotted a ufo at kennedy lake while joking about one shining a flashlight into the sky. so since we were back in the same area we figure it would be fun try it again. so on the first clear night (2nd of july) once it became dark we started playing around with the red laser pointer and led mag flashlight. writing things in the sky and blinking them on and off etc. at 11:50pm directly over head we saw two bright white lights appear one traveling south to north the other traveling west to east. they quickly crossed paths then the ufo traveling north either disappears or traveled out of sight behind the tree cover. i could not tell for sure which. the opening in the trees above our heads was small so it was not in view for more than a a second or two. the the object traveling west to east we watched travel straight until it was out of sight in the distance (total time was about 2min 10 sec). it may have slowed down further away but it was difficult to tell. my wife did try and take a video of it with our camera but unfortunately it is not a very good camera for such things and the video looks like a star...Nothing like we saw in person. another interesting note is that after the ufo passed over, my wife went to check the time on her cellphone which was off since there is to cell service where we were camped. she took it out of the purse and it was on and had service. the phone was definitely off previously and it can not be accidentally turned on. she turned it off then back on and there was no service again. very strange.\r\n\r\n\r\nhere are my very rough estimates of the ufo:\r\n\r\n\r\napproximate altitude 1000'\r\n\r\napproximate speed 1800km/h i may be overestimating. \r\n\r\nno sound emitted at anytime.\r\n\r\nno smoke or contrail.\r\n\r\nit was a very bright pure white light. which seemed a bit dimmer in the center.\r\n\r\ni do not think it was perfectly rounds but close.\r\n\r\n\r\nif i held a 1 1/4��� diameter object at arms length that would be about the size of the objects directly over head. at 1000' alt i believe that would work out to roughly 500' in dia. these numbers could be off by a fair bit since it is very hard to estimate the size and distance of an object that i do not know what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am 100% certain this was not a meteorite, satellite, known aircraft...Or weather balloon.\r\n\r\n\r\nsince i am not sure what the international space station looks like from earth i thought i would look it out.\r\n\r\nnasa's website states that the international space station passed over port alberni (100 km east of our position) on fri jul 02 11:40 pm for a duration of 4 minutes\r\n\r\nmax elevation 71deg approach 16 above wnw departure 20 above e\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat you'll see:\r\nassuming the station is in sunlight, it should appear as a bright and fast moving star. the longest the station will remain in view to a ground based observer is 4 minutes. when passing directly overhead, the station zips from horizon to horizon is 240 seconds or less. for most locations, the viewing window will be 120 seconds (or less).\r\n\r\nthe time is close but the space station definitely is not what we seen either.
