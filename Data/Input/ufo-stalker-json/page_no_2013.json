general ese to wnw direction, i realized there was no wind to carry a balloon or parachute flare--the remnants of our firework mortars fell directly back to earth without drifitng away as would have happened with any breeze. \r\n\r\nthe object made no sound and did not flicker or strobe, but instead glowed brightly so that a bit of an aura or \"haze\" surrounded the object. we watched the object until it travelled too far away to be observed. at no time did we discern any change in direction or speed or altitude. \r\n\r\nthe event was not frightening, but was more of a curiousity. i felt that with an optical device or better ambient light it might have been possible to better identify the object. i would not have reported this except that i found so many other reported sightings of similar

fireworks display. she saw something unusual and asked me what i thought it was, so i looked to where she was pointing, and was baffled by the red-orange orb floating towards us. \r\n\r\nat first we thought it might be a plane, because it was smoothly floating through the air. however, its constant, intense light wasn't blinking. perhaps, we thought, it might be one of the fireworks or a flare. however, the light was traveling horizontally towards our home, and not straight into the air. its light didn't diminish in intensity, nor did it explode, have a trail of any kind, or make any sort of noise. \r\n\r\nspellbound by this unusual orb, we watched it slowly follow a precise path over our roof. for about two seconds it was close enough for us to notice how strangely the light behaved--it seemed to shimmer and be comprised of various colors. it wasn't exclusively red-orange; i noticed flashes of pink and green within the light. \r\n\r\ni ran to get my digital camera but, when i returned, found that the battery was dead. frustrated, i put the camera down and followed my mother to the back of the house, out onto the back deck where we watched it continue its path over us, toward the neighborhood behind ours. it was eventually obscured by pine trees. we never heard it make a single sound. \r\n\r\nwe went downstairs to get my father, then back upstairs to the front door. my mother pointed out a second orb (that looked exactly the same as the first one) as it made the exact same path over our house that the first orb had. \r\n\r\nin desperation--wanting some shred of tangible evidence--i hooked up the old family camcorder and plugged it in so it wouldn't have to rely on its battery. however, a camera that had been working just fine when i'd pulled it out a month or two earlier was starting to behave strangely and shut off sporadically. by the time i'd actually got it to turn on, the object had gone to the back of the house again, where my mother and father watched it from the deck. i gave up on the camera, but not in time to join them to watch it disappear behind the trees like the first. \r\n\r\nwe saw fireworks and planes in the sky on the night of july 4th 2010, but these two objects couldn't be classified as either. in retrospect, my mother and i wonder if they weren't two separate objects but were, in fact, part of a larger object. their identical path and behavior seem to hint they may have been somehow attached.
