States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of july 4th, 2010 at approximatly 2220 hours pacific, myself and three others witnessed three amber colored fireballs float across the sky from the town of enumclaw in washington state.  the estimated time of the sighting is based off of having just returned from a local city fireworks show which ended at 2205.  \r\nas we were unloading the truck back at my friends house, which is in a rural part of the county consisting of mostly farms, about five miles directly west of the downtown part of enumclaw, i noticed an amber/orangish light floating across the sky.  i was facing north and saw this first light traveling from west to east at about fifty degrees off the horizon.  the first thing that seemed unusual about it was the color.  i have lots of experience in aviation and it is unusual to see a single colored light not accompanied by other white or strobing lights.  this light seemed to flicker slightly, as though it was a ball on fire from the inside, but not trailing sparks or flames of any kind.  there was no noise accompanying the light such as what you would normaly hear from a general aviation or commercial aircraft.  the weather at the time is included below, and limits the object to travel under 3,000 feet in altitude such that if it were a ga or commercial aircraft you would be able to hear the engine from our location.  i called to my friends and pointed the light out to them after watching it for about 30 seconds.  after watching for a few seconds one friend pointed out a second light that had just appeared from the east side of the sky, also traveling west but a few degrees higher off the horizon than the first.  by this time the first light, about a minute into the sighting and now to the northeast in the sky suddenly dimmed and disapeared.  the second light also dimmed and dissapeared in the northeast about 45 seconds after it was first seen.  the third light was noticed right as the second was fading, this one travling from the north, up from the horizon, towards the northeast.  this third light at first appeared to be a firework being launched from a field in the distance where a small display was going on, but continued higher and higher and it became obvious that it was not a firework.  it arched its way up and about twenty degrees off the horizon began to weave slightly before disapearing 30 seconds later in about the same spot as the two others.  all three sightings occured withing the period of three minutes time.  we continued to watch the sky for a couple minutes longer but saw no more objects.  i remained alert throughout the rest of the night before heading inside around 0030 local time and noticed the white landing lights and strobes as well as the red and green wingtip lights of ga and commercial aircraft but saw no more amber/orange lights in the sky.\r\nthe only cameras that any of us had with us were cell phone cameras, which i attempted to capture an image with but was unable to get anything other than black sky and will not waste time uploading to this report as there was no evidence after reviewing.\r\nin reveiwing the sighting with my friends, the lights seemed very reminicent of watching the iss travel across the sky.  the lights all appeared to be of similar size and brightness as the iss, but a much more orangeish/amberish color. due to the weather at the time of the sighting, any possibility of these being planets, satellites or any other high altitude objects was ruled out among us.  chinese lanterns were considered but wind patterns were not in favor of that possibility.\r\nnoaa nws history shows the weather at 2210 on july 4th to be winds west/southwest at 7 miles per hour.  clouds were few at 1,700 feet, broken at 2,600 feet and overcast at 3,200 feet with visabiliy 10 miles. weather at 2230 was winds west/southwest at 7 miles per hour.  clouds were overcast at

display about 20 minutes earlier. there were 10-12 people who all saw the lights. across the street another 4-5 people saw it as well. one person said it was a hot air balloon with the burners lit. we quickly shot that thought down.\r\n\r\n the sightings were a few minutes apart. the first object flew in from the sw going east by ne. i would say at a height of 2000-3000 ft up.Air speed was 300 -400 mph based on what a single engine plane appears to be flying over head. it was two three times faster then that.  no noise was heard. in about 30 seconds we could not see it anymore. i contacted the local police department via 911 and asked if anyone else was reporting what we where seeing. they stated no.\r\n\r\nabout two to three minutes later, another light came in from the south and turned and followed the path of the first one. i called the police again and said we just saw another light exactly like the first one. they asked if we wanted an officer dispatched and we said yes. again, we heard no sound from the object. hot air balloons don't turn 90 degrees like the second object.\r\n\r\nwe all were like what are these things. everyone was watching them until it just disappeared out of sight.\r\n\r\na few of us gathered in the street talking about it. when the third object appeared; this one came in from the south by southeast. it flew to the same area as the first two objects and changed direction following the path of the previous two. i pulled out my cell phone and got 3 pictures one very bright. one showing the object smaller and further away and the last; it just looks like a red orange dot in the sky.\r\n\r\nthe police showed up around 5 minutes later. the officer was a women who appeared she did not want to be bothered with us. i told her we saw three objects and they all headed east. she said she just came form that way and saw nothing. i said by time you got the call they probably were over lake michigan already. she made no official report.\r\n\r\ni believe in what i saw, everyone saw the same thing. i guess i was the most excited by it. no fear it was like whoa cool. \r\nthey just flew off until we could no longer see them. each time we watched them for 15-30 seconds.\r\n\r\ni have no cable to take the pictures off the phone so i had to email them to myself i hope they are

grabbed some binoculars. while looking through the binoculars, i really couldn't make out any more detail other than it was a big orangish glowing light moving slowly in the sky. the light finally started to dim. only when the light was out completely, was i then able to see the actual full shape and size of the object. this sent chills through my body. it was a deep dark, much larger black

150 feet up we saw a bright yellow/orange glowing object (not flaming, but very bright and glowing) slowly moving horizontally across the sky from the southeast to the northwest.  it made no noise.  we chased it by foot as far as we could until we were stopped by a thick tree line.  the object travelled across the sky at a slow, steady pace for at least one mile until we lost sight of the object.  our neighbor's son saw it as well.  last that night, still mystified by the sighting my husband sat outside for a few hours trying to see the object again when he saw a semi-transparent object in the sky that was oval in shape and moved horizontally across the sky in the approximately location where the first object was observed; however, this object did not emit any light as the first object.
