each other.  they were neither fireworks, flares, weather balloons or aircraft that i could identify.  i then called my husband to look at them and he ran outside and he could not identify them either(he is an airline captain).  we watched as the group flew in loose formation at different altitudes.  my husband got a camera out of the house but was unable to get a picture of them.  as he was attempting to take pictures, a small airplane started flying over our house in a south/southwest direction towards portland international airport and as it approached the group of objects, from our line of sight, the objects started to independently blink out until they had all disappeared.  a military neighbor ran over to our house and said he saw them from the corner of his eye and could not determine what they were.  the objects did not reappear.  all of our reactions were that we had seen a group of ufo objects.  we were not happy that we were unable to get pictures of them before they blinked out.  there was a feeling of unreality of our actual sighting and we are still processing those feelings.","distance":"Over One

vanished as i took my eyes off it breifly, it only had seconds to move far enough for me to no longer see it. note that as the distance between me and the object grew, less of the orange light was visible. also its glow lost the perfectly circular shape as the light was only visible on the bottom half of the object due to the angle that i was observing the now disk shaped object. the red light was only visible directly under the craft. it only took a short distance for it to disappear. during the encounter, the object stayed relativly close to my postion, which was close to a large electrical sub-station. all three people in the car agree on the caracteristics and did not have characteristics of a helicopter, plane, blimp, etc.

evening i went outside (with my camera) to first water the flowers as it was scorchingly hot today & still the lingering hot air made it difficult to breath. i stood still for a moment concentrating of where in the sky to aim my camera , as i couldn't see the spaceships . i took 3 photos in total . the 1st one that i've aimed in the es direction only showed couple of tiny white dots on the iphoto screen . the 2nd photo once loaded it basically looked at first as a gray page, this photo was taken in the we direction, & once i begun zooming in by approx. 1 cm x 2cm squeres , than the white orbs begun to be seen.\r\nthese 2 photos i've pushed the zoom to 8x the maximum my camera allows , so the light orbs are a bit fuzzy . the 3rd photo was aimed at the direct w where the sun just went below the horizon level & the colorful bands can be seen (sun sets at this time of yr just to the left of the highrise building in the photo). again i've zoomed this particular image on the iphoto (the camera too was at about 5x zoom), & there were some white ufo orbs , some appeared further back , others obviously were closer as they are a bit bigger & there were also 4 black stealth type jets high up in the sky . there are also dark scratch like lines & dots those are the airplanes as the airport is to the right of the sun setting . but the most buffling thing in that picture is an \"object\" about halfway right side which i cannot determine of what it could be , & that's why i'm attaching it with this report . \r\nmufon's experts can better manipulate the zoom perhaps on photoshop as i haven't learned yet of how to use this application . \r\nbtw , the first image i contrasted a bit so the white lights would be more visible , due to the hight elevation they're very small indeed .\r\nalso , yesterday at about 9 pm & over the lake , but higher then the incoming 2 jets were 6-7 flushes in the sky , those were in the just past mid point between e to s . few hours later a helicopter was making rounds . that is the reason i wait few hrs to report these sightings & sometimes i don't

suddenly stopped, became tremendously bright similar to a camera flash, and changed colors from white to red.  after two or three seconds, it resumed its star-like appearance and continued to travel

just enjoying the july 4th holiday.  our backyard is very dark with no lights on so it's very easy to see the sky.  i was just sitting and i turned and looked in front of me in the sky and i saw what i thought to be a star.  i realized that it wasn't because it was much more bright and much closer than a star would be, it was hard to tell but it almost looked like it was above the house like 10 houses up the street.  it just stayed in one spot but i stared at it since it just seemed odd looking to me.  i asked my mom to get up and look up and she saw it as well.  at that point it started to move right and then backtracked and headed left at a steady rate and then just dissapeared.  we thought it was weird and sat back down.  about 2 minutes later i noticed another light in the same spot i had saw the other and as i stared i realized it was getting brighter like the last one i had seen.  i called to my mom again and she looked and spotted it too.  let me reiterate it was extremely bright.  i had my dad look too and he could see it, that's saying alot on how bright and how close it was because he has sight problems and can't even see the stars in the sky at all.  i could see it was staying in one spot but i could see it moving a little bit like trying to hover in one spot and then it proceeded to move left again.  at this point it went dim and started to pulse a much dimmer light at a constant rate as it moved.  my dad had trouble seeing it as this point.  of course we didn't have our camera since my sister had taken it with her to the shore.  we got out the binoculars and it was hard to see anything because the light around it just made it blurry when looked close up.  we followed it as far as we could before we lost sight of it behind trees.  very weird and unexplainable to me.  there were other planes in the sky at this point so i could compare to them and it was nothing like them, the lights weren't the same, it was much bigger or at least closer than the planes by far.  it didn't make any noise either, we can hear planes when they go by and we heard absolutely nothing, the fireworks had ceased too so it was completely silent in our backyard.  we sat out there for another half hour and never saw anything after that.  very cool in my

celebrate the 4th of july, on the southwest side of ypsilanti near ann arbor. my landlord was the first to see the objects approaching from the southwest. he said \"we're being invaded\" and drew our attention to the sky. i looked up and saw 6 orange orbs moving across the southern sky from southwest to northeast. my first reaction was that they must be some type of fireworks. but more of them continued to appear from behind a cloud, moving silently at a speed and altitude comprable to airliners. i didn't get an exact count but i estimate i saw 12-15 objects total, including one that was trailing far behind the others. i tried to get video on my iphone but the exposure was too low and the objects were not very bright. i can best describe them as looking like orange signal flares, but flares don't move like aircraft. they didn't move erraticaly in any way. they just kept a steady, straight course in a fixed cluster formation. they are similar to other lights that had been seen in arizona several years ago. they passed behind another cloud and i didn't see them again. i wasn't scared because they didn't appear threatening in any way. the children (ages 6 through 12) got excited but didn't seem scared. i imagine that, given the date and timing of the sighting, there are widespread eyewitnesses of this event, as many people happened to be outdoors looking at the sky at the same time. i hope someone got some more quality video than i did.

and brilliant with many stars. while gazing at the sky, on several occasions, we would see what initially appeared to be a star move across the sky, what was most captivating was that the objects changed direction very easily & at times made jerky movements as they moved along. we watched many of these objects continue until they were out of sight, though some would seem as if perhaps they ascended because they would appear smaller until they were out of view. \r\n\r\nthese objects did not flash or move like airplanes, in fact we had seen many airplanes during that time and clearly the objects were much higher and smaller than airplanes. the way these objects traveled was abrupt and the duration of time they would move suggested that these objects moved at a very high speed and covered a great distance in a short period of time.\r\nwe saw a total of 12 objects during an 1.5hrs.\r\nthe objects just kept coming, it was surprising and exhilarating it proved to me that there is

yard with my dog, when i witnessed in the sky an orange-red object, about 3x to 5x the size of a planet, approaching from the southwest approximately 25 to 35 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nthe size and shape of the object was difficult to judge at night, but the shape of what appeared to be a \"single light\" was round or spherical.  the object maintained a straight line course moving from the southwest to the northeast.\r\n\r\nwhen i first observed the object i thought it was an airplane off in the distance approaching our home, but as it got closer and went past my home overhead , i heard no sound and could not see any flashing strobe or navigation lights on the object.\r\n\r\nas the object approached and receded, the apparent size of the object did not appear to increase or decrease signficantly.  the object appeared to be at a constant altitude and moved at a constant/uniform velocity.  there was no change in the object's flight path, it moved in a straight line.  the total time i observed the object was about 30 to 45 seconds until it disappeared behind some clouds as it moved past and behind my house as it continued to move in a straight line path to the northeast.\r\n\r\nperhaps the object was a satellite in low earth orbit, but the size of the orange-red light seemed too large to be a satellite 70 to 80 miles above the surface.  if the object was a small plane at low altitude, i would have expected to hear engine noise, if the object was a jet aircraft at high altitude, i would have expected the object to have taken longer to traverse the sky, given the high altitude.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

fire. it had a glowing red to it, like molten rock. it was not a meteor and i dont believe it to be a satellite on fire, because i have witnessed that before. it was not a hot air balloon nor an airplane. there were no blinking lights on this object. it was hard to tell the elevation of the object, but its elevation was steady, it was not descending. it disappeared heading northwest and took about 20 seconds to disappear. this object was not a plane. it freaked my wife and i out, and we were not drinking alcohol when this occurred.
