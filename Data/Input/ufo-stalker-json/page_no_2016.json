i watched ,  it didnt seem like it was moving it seemed like it was searching, then all of a sudden the light just dropped into the woods and went out.    then i knew it was a ufo. \r\n so after i seen it land i started to run home and im running up my street which was towords where i seen it land and there again in the sky between some houses there it is again. immediattley i run across the lawns and into an open spot on a hill to get a better look and im focusing on it. the bright light  is dimming  and is accompanied by two smaller red lights that could be seperate or part of the same

looked over to the east-northeast and saw a red light off in the distance just above the horizon, it was not flashing, it was hovering just above the horizon, then it disappeared, i also noticed that the light on the cell phone tower about a mile to our east was not flashing, so either that was a coincidence or the ufo had an effect on the flashing cell phone tower light. the next day (july 3rd) at about 9:30 pm me and my cousin were riding our bicycles down our road, as we were riding, we were facing east, when we noticed the same exact light, and the cell phone tower light was not flashing. but we came up to a turn, and the corn blocked the view so we could not see it anymore. later that night, my cousin had gone home, but it was about 11:00 pm that same night, and me and my parents decided to go outside and look around for anything unusual, this time i had my camera in my hands and ready to go. thats when we could see the light re-appear to the east again, i immediately turned on the camera and tried to take the best photos of it as i could, then i switched the camera into video mode, and shot some video of it and i was able to capture the object disappear on video. the camera we have tends to not take very good photos of objects up close, they usually get blurry, but i still have that image just incase i need it (i still have the video too). the photo has two

River","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife, 5 year old daughter and myself parked the truck on top of the highest hill on the golfcourse which overlooks the toms river to get a good view of the fireworks display that was scheduled to start shortly after 9:00 pm est ... we set our lawn chairs up on the grass facing south towards the river where tens of thousands, if not 100 or more thousand people lined the river shores from surrounding towns to watch the beachwood nj fireworks display. both sides of the river banks were packed with people from all over, as was the river itself jam packed with boaters waiting for the show to start. all of the surrounding roadways were jammed with traffic and cars parked on shoulders and people walking the streets to find a view of one of new jerseys premier fireworks displays.\r\nthe sky was just getting dark with just a hint of lightness still glowing from the west where the sun had gone down below the horizon. as we sat facing south on our chairs, i looked up to my right towards the western sky , a very bright star was shining on the horizon due west .. and then they appeared. as i was looking at the bright star , suddenly out of the western skies came a brilliant orange glowing craft , i say craft because it was obvious that this thing was flying or being propelled thru the sky on a straight and level path of flight... it was not a shooting star or a meteorite, i've seen them before and this was definitely not one of those. i immediately focused my eyes in on it because it was the most brilliant orange glowing color i have ever seen , more brilliant than words can describe , imagine the most brilliant intense orange glow on a darkening sky and moving like an airplane across the sky .. not really fast, just a steady rate of speed ... but it had no white headlights or red or green strobe lights ... it was not really as high up as commercial airliners fly ... it was relatively low as it traveled almost directly over us from south-west to north-east. it was huge , it had no wings , it appeared to be cone shaped where the leading point was smaller than the back , it could have been triangular , but it was surrounded by this brilliant glowing orange that made it hard to distinguish its exact shape ... as it was slowly coming towards us in the sky i stood up and said \"look at that ... what is that?\" ... my wife and daughter looked to the sky and got up out of their chairs .. just then a second object appeared in the sky from the western skies , an exact duplicate of the first one ... on the same flight path like it was following the first craft at the same altitude and same rate of speed .. but these things were not of this world , they were nothing resembling anything i have ever seen in the skies ... they still hadn't passed over us yet, they were coming closer though after watching them cross the wide expanse of western skies from my excellent wide open view ... i knew they would pass over us pretty closely so i ran over to my truck and reached under the seat for my high-powered binoculars ... i grabbed them and ran the 10 yards back to my wifes side and and put the binoculars up to my eyes just as the objects were passing overhead at their closest mark .. i focused the glasses in and looked and studied the craft very clearly for a good 20 seconds before handing the glasses over to my wife for her to get a look ...  she then handed them back and i studied the craft as the continued across the open sky into the north-east and out of view.\r\nwe both agreed afterwards that those two objects were not aircraft and they were not meteors or shooting stars. what we had both seen clearly thru the binoculars were two identical craft under some form of propulsion traveling across the sky , one following the other at the same altitude and rate of speed .. the altitude was probably between 10 and 15 thousand feet , lower than commercial airliners for sure , they made no noise as they passed overhead .. completely silent ... thru the binoculars you could really see upclose and clear ... picture an object the size of the space shuttle cruising over your head not really too far up .. it had that shape and size ... almost a wedge shape , or triangular pointed leading edge and a wide back-side ... and it was glowing a bright orange and you could almost make out flames coming from it , not just from the back of it ... from the entire thing ... the whole object was surrounded and enveloped in these brilliant intense orange flames .. both objects exactly the same ... one trailing the other by about a mile or two .... both looking as big as a low-flying space shuttle totally ablaze and wrapped in glowing orange flames ... but just cruising across the sky as though they were being controlled by someone or something ... clearly on a flight path heading somewhere and under control ... totally silent.\r\nlater we saw huge military aircraft coming overhead , easily distinguished with bright white headlights, flashing strobes on both wings , lous enormous engines ..As they flew over. even the commercial airliners flying 20-30 thousand feet overhead could be heard .. and their flashing strobes could be seen. but the two objects we saw were much lower and were totally silent ... with all the people watching the sky that night waiting for the fireworks , i'm hoping someone got to take some pictures. lets see if anyone else comes forward with a picture.

almost the exact same place above our house. there were multiple witnesses to the first sighting that i did not see. so on july 1st at approximately 4 p.M. i stepped outside my house to smoke a cigarette. i was actually thinking about the sighting my friends had the week before and started to look around in the skies. i spotted something almost directly overhead and starred at it for a few seconds and grew excited. i screamed for my friend who lives next door to come out and take a look because he had seen this the week before. i asked him if this is what he and the others had seen the week before. he said yes very excitedly that i was seeing it. as we stared at the object we noticed a similar object move in from behind it. the second one began circling around the first. i asked my friend for his binoculars so i could get a better look. it was totally frustrating because i could not find the objects through the glasses even though my friend was able to. these are cheap glasses with no adjustable range. my friend stated to me what we were seeing 2 sphere like objects with one seemingly dancing around the other one. at this point we probably had been watching the objects for about 15 minutes. my friend walked away for a moment and to me what appeared to be a cigar shaped object appeared. the 2 spheres seemed to be following it. after looking up for another minute or 2 the objects just simply vanished. i have no idea what we saw but i can tell you without a doubt this was not an airplane or helicopter. i know you hear about single eyewitness accounts but to have so many people see the same thing at the same time, there has to be something to it. i also took pictures of the objects but they were so high up i am not sure if you be able to see the objects or not. this is very very exciting to me. i was so bummed that i wasn't around the week before to share the encounter with my friends. the objects they saw were in gthe skies for over 2 hours in the same

for the duration of the sighting which lasted a minute and a half. it was almost a clear day with a few clouds here and there and the sun was still out. the object appeared to be as high as the plane and we did not notice it until the plane flew overhead. the object could have been there prior to the arrival of the plane but it is uncertain when exactly it was visible. it had a defined shape to it
