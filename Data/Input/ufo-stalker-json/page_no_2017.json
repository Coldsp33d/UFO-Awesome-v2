to what i saw on the evening of june 9th at 9:30pm as i turned off of stony point road onto pepper road.\r\n\r\nas i turned onto pepper road, i noticed an object hovering motionless in the sky to my left and two or three pastures in front of me.  it looked about the size of a helicopter and was fairly high up at the altitude that one would expect to see a helicopter flying, but it had no flashing lights and no red or green.  it looked like a close collection of three bright whitish-orange lights just hovering.  i've seen strange lights driving through there before, so i had the thought 'well, if you're a ufo, then flash.'  immediately after thinking that thought, the object descended at rapid speed directly towards me.  needless to say, i was quite startled by its approach.  it went from looking like a collection of lights, to looking like a translucent enormous wing with a bright light on each end.  the closer it got, the wider apart the lights became, although the lights stayed connected in relation to one another, as if on the tips of a straight wing.  as it got to about tall tree level over pepper road, it banked hard like a conventional plane would do, but at a rate that no plane could do.  it turned over the trees and cattle ranch at the intersection of jewett and pepper roads and moved west.  as it turned and departed, i could see the lights against the western sky which was still a deep turquoise after sunset.  if it had been a conventional aircraft, i would've seen it silhouetted against the lighter sky and i would have heard engines.  i heard nothing, and at best i saw something translucent between the two lights, as if it was an enormous wing.  when it banked, it was three times the size of the rancher's house and was very low in the sky.  if that rancher had been looking out his window, he would've had the same experience as the family in the 03july2010 event id 24103 had.  he would've thought an enormous craft with two bright lights on it was going to hit his house.  i sped up to follow the craft, but a two-decker several axle livestock truck was lumbering through the intersection of jewett and pepper road, so i had to stop and wait for it.  by the time i got to the west side of the rancher's house and out to open pasture again, i could see no sign of the object.  \r\n\r\ni'm not a nut.  i'm a phd scientist and i know that i saw something incredible.  a friend has suggested that i saw lights reflecting in my windshield,  but pepper road is dark.  there are no lights to reflect.  no cars were behind me or to the side of me.

(if it was way up in the cirros-stratus cloud layer, it would have to have been going very fast; therefore, i believe it was much lower.)\r\n\r\nat first, i said to myself, \"oh, it's probably a fireworks display.\" (you know... when the rockets go up and then burst into all the sparklers, you get burning red embers coming down from the sky.) this was different however -- it was tracking like a helicopter hovering in our direction. there was no sound of any prop or jet enging or chopper blades. off in the distance i heard fireworks going off. but right above in our local sky, all was silent except for this thing as it headed in our direction. dad was resting in the room and mom was watching tv. the front door was locked so when i realized it may have been a ufo event, i ran to the front door, opened it and stood on the front steps and looked up at it. at this point it was in the sky over our general street area (but apparently higher up now) and it made a 90 degree turn to the right and was beginning to head out over the bay towards the ocean. i called out to mom and told her i believed we had a ufo and she came outside and also witnessed it. we watched it slowly tracking to the southeast towards the beach. i ran inside and got my olympus c2100 digital camera, hoping to capture a picture before it was gone. i took two photos. the first photo (although not zoomed in) caught the object and it's light display. the second photo i tried hurriedly to zoom in and pressed the shutter button but it was too dark to see where it was in the viewfinder and unfortunately my zoomed in shot missed it out of frame. i have uploaded the pictures to the computer. i kept the original unedited photo but did make a cropped, close-up second copy to show it better. i will post the photo here shortly.\r\n\r\nsome more comments are in order: first, i am a pilot and this object had no navigation lights (such as red/green and white on the tail.) second, there was no engine sound. mom thought it may have been a blimp type of craft -- but those have turbofan types of motors which are very loud. third, i pondered whether this was one of those laser lights that establishments use to light the sky through the clouds to attract attention to their business or event. however, i feel this was more like a craft flying than someone pointing a large beam of light in the sky and moving it around. it can't be a meteorite either because it made a 90 degree turn and was too long an event to be a burn-up in the atmosphere. fourth, this is my second ufo event on long island (about 20 miles away from the other event). the previous event i witnessed occurred in calverton near the closed military base there. similarly, we live about 12 miles from an airport with a military base. (i actually learned to fly at this airport.) fifth, if i was not seeing double vision and it was indeed triangular, perhaps when it turned towards the ocean, i was looking at only one side of it.\r\n\r\nfinally, i wanted to say that if this was something special (be it military, otherworldy or even a paranormal/spiritual event) i do feel the timing of my witnessing it was important. another 20-30 seconds not getting up to go to the window, i would not have witnessed it. therefore i feel i was connected to this event. or perhaps i heard them calling me.\r\n\r\nphoto note: i have the original larger, uncropped unedited photo which is available for analysis if you need it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":24095,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.8077378,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07022010-0017","longitude":-72.619552,"occurred":1278054000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1278139486000,"summary":"Hampton bays ufo cigar-shaped red and white lights near airbase.","tags":["ufo","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24095_submitter_file1__P7020001A.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/24095_submitter_file2__P7020001B.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Hampton Bays - Westhampto, New York","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:116873"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Augusta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was taking my puppies out last night about 10:30 pm and discovered someone had turned off my motion detector porch light.  as i was waving my arm in front of the light not realizing that it was off, i noticed a bright star-like light in the south eastern sky.  it was bigger & brighter than any other stars that i have ever seen and caught my attention for that reason. i live about 20 miles from the city of augusta in the foot hills of the mountains, and so with out any background light this anomoly was very clear and noticeable. when i was watching this bright light, a smaller star like light came from the southern sky, moved right up to the first light, then flew at a very rapid speed off at what seemed like a right angle into the northern sky.  there was no sound other than the normal night sounds. i got very anxious and switched on the porch light, when i turned it back off both star like objects were gone. i hurried the dogs in the house, and several times i checked out of the window facing the same area, but saw nothing more out of the ordinary. it or they were gone. i grew up as an air force brat living on military bases and have never seen any kind of flight  vehicles that could maneuver with such speeds and at such changes in angles, in total silence.\r\n\r\nthis event happened so quickly i did not have time to even think of photographing it. i always thought these kind of things happened in the big cities, not in rural maine where we only have a couple of buildings with 10 stories.

finding that this was not a normal aircraft. i am not good at judging or remembering exact times or days. like most females i can tell you details about the landmarks on a route but don't know the street names or distances for a familiar route. that being said... i was so e time between 8:30ish pm and 11:00 pm on tuesday, june 22. i  went out several times that evening to relax with my kitty. i stepped out onto my porch to call my cat.  as i stood facing west, i noticed a larger than normal and extreamly bright orange flashing light to my left, south.  i walked over to the south of my patio onto the grass to keep sight of it. i watched as the object appeared to decend while traveling north/east. it leveled off and continued heading east. at that point the extreamly bright orange light was alternating with a white light.  it flew lower than the other helicopters in the air that night.  when i was walking to the south of my yard to keep it in sight, i felt an unsettling feeling because it made no noise. as it continued east i lost sight of it since it was flying so low. at about the time that i began to loose sight of it, i noticed a second light traveling roughly the same path. i quickly recognized the second craft as a helicopter. it had different light colors and normal flashing lights as well as being noisey.  it turned to go in the same direction as the orange lighted craft went. the second craft was also flying at the usual height and i also noted that it moved less smoothly than the first craft.  my mind wants to associate the first craft as a helicopter, but the peculiars of the first craft were unlike everything that i normally see. we have a lot of air traftc around our home.  i have always enjoyed gazing at the sky and the clouds, aircraft or stars. i have never ever seen such a bright and very orange light. i searched the web trying to find a type of aircraft that uses an orange light like it, but found nothing as far as legitimate crafts that have such a light. this was bright, larger than normal at durring the evening hours that people are up and about. if anyone else in northern phoenix saw this or knows what it was, please post your description too.  it did not occur to me to get my camera because i was fixed on keeping my eye on the weird light.

...What the hell could that be?\" and other comments of the sort.  then what happened to the forth and the third orb happened with the second.  it shrank in size and disappeared.  the about a minute later the same happened with the last orb and they were all gone.  i tried to take a few pictures with my cell phone but there was too much ambient light from the restaurants, shops and streetlights.  nothing showed up.  after it was done, still more people were approaching us with the same response, \"...Oh my god did you see that?\", \"that was awesome!\", ...Oh my god, what the hell was that?\".\r\n\r\nthe accounts of my two friends that were outside first, said that when they first saw the sight the orbs they seemed to be \"dancing with each other\".  they said that they were still divided in two groups of two.  each pair was following a criss-cross flight pattern of their own; they were not synchronized with the other pair.  they also said that when they first saw the orbs that they appeared to be at a lower altitude then when i was outside because they were larger in size.  they said that as they were \"dancing\", all four were moving away at the same slow and steady speed until the altitude that they rested at when i stepped outside.  my one friend said that when he first saw it, he thought that someone let something into the sky that might have had a flame attached.  he said that it was when the \"dancing\" started, that he knew that it was definitely something else.  he said that with the flight pattern that they were demonstrating that there was no way it was just an object floating through the wind.  he said it was too precise and beyond anything \"normal\" that he could imagine.\r\n\r\ni am a skeptical person by nature; however, my personal belief regarding extraterrestrial life is that we would be small-minding to think that we are the only beings in existence.  all i know is that what i was looking at was certainly not a plane, nor a helicopter.  i would say that the size of the orb when i saw it was approx. three times the size of the north star.  i would have to say i was excited to witness the phenomenon for the mere potential that it could be a once in a life time sighting, whatever it may be.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":24087,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.029577,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07022010-0009","longitude":-75.221652,"occurred":1278050700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1278104410000,"summary":"Four pulsing orange orbs.","tags":["pulsing"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:116881"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Boynton Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I walked to the beach and decided to take a picture of the ocean with my cell phone camera. since the water looks more beautiful when viewed through my polarized sunglasses i decided to take two pictures. one through the lense of my sunglasses and one without. \r\n\r\nin the picture i took through the sunglasses you can see the blip in the background. the pictures were taken seconds apart. i didn't notice the blip until i reviewed the pictures on my computer when i got home.
