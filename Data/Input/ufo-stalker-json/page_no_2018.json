indianapolis. i took note of the time which was exactly 10:15 a.M. as i looked at the clock on my satellite radio. i was about one or two miles south of u.S.40 (washington street) i saw straight ahead of me a cylindrical object flying west pretty much parallel to the horizon. the position of the sun at that hour and the clarity of the atmosphere made the object gleam a brilliant white. about a month ago we had seen a cylinder going up in the sky which we were never able to see wings on. it looked like a cylinder with a band around it. that sighting coupled with how bright this object made me keep my focus on it even though i was certain it was a plane on it's glide path for indianapolis international. i lived in that part of indy for several years and had seen planes on that glide path many times but i wanted to watch it long enough to see the wings. then i caught sight of a brilliant white sphere well above the plane travelling in a downward path at an angle from about 1 o'clock to 8 o'clock. at first glance it appeared to be on a collision course with the plane but in just a few seconds it became clear that if it continued on it's same trajectory it would be far behind the plane by the time it reached that level. i watched it for about 15 seconds and then it faded away. i say faded but it went from brilliant to gone in less than 2 seconds but still you could tell it was going to become unable to be seen before it did. i am a mufon f.I. so i read the last 20 reports daily. this sphere disappeared exactly like the orb did during the first few seconds of the video 0016

to the backyard of the bar, grab a lawn chair and find a spot on the beach. up till that point, i have never been there but heard a lot about it, so we went. got some beers, and went straight to the back. we were sitting on the beach, and i was taking it all in. it was decently crowded but not packed. the night was beautiful, not a cloud in the sky, and the sun was almost going down. not only 5 minutes of being there that i put my head back, looked straight up and saw 2 circled ufo's fly right above me. they were side by side, and the right one looked like it was trying to go faster than the other (almost like 2 cars racing on the street). i looked over to *(initials deleted--sgonzalez/cms) and was about to say something but before i could even get it out i decided not to say anything. they were gone, and i didnt know what to say. i could not believe what i saw. the flying objects appeared to be complete circles, same size, and their color was the actual color of the sky at the time which was a yellowish white. (almost like they had camouflage). when i realized they were gone, i looked around to see if anyone else noticed what i saw, but it looked like no one did. my heart was pounding, and i was trying to put together in my mind what just happened. i thought maybe they could have been stealths(ive never seen any fly) but they were going way to fast, and like i said, the right one seemed to be racing with the left one. i know this happened a year ago but i havent been able to stop thinking about it. the flying objects seemed to be on an actual route almost like they use it all the time. i now live in west hollywood, but i recently talked to one of my old co-workers (who i told about the incident before) and she told me that her friends were there one night just a few weeks ago, and both saw ufo's. she explained their experience not the same as mine, but they saw lights over the lake(lake ontario). i wish i didn't wait this long to report this, and i wish i went back to marge's before i moved out west, but i wish i could go back. because i swear, if you sit out there one night, someone might see the samething, i swear that the flying objects seemed like they were on a direct path (almost like they use it all the time). flying straight north right over lake ontario into canada.

Albert","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Please, this is a true story that took place on december 23rd of 2009.  i was in prince albert, saskatchewan and there is a local legend of a ghost train that appears on an old railroad track located in the woods just off an out of town road.  i decided to check it out as i was on my way to town.  it was 1am.  i was driving for a while and i decided i needed a stretch, have a few cigarettes and get back on the road.  i parked just off the road and made my way through the field to the woods.  it was extremely dark.  i heard some quick footsteps.  i got scared but figured it must've been a baby deer or a fox or something.  i remember then smelling a strong odour.  it smelt like chemicals, strong enough to make you cringe and tingle your brain.  that's the last i remember of being in the woods.  i must've passed out but i awoke and i was being led in a dark hallway.  something was communicating with me.  it told me \"not to worry,\" and that \"you will not be harmed.\"  for some reason i trusted it.  the platform we were walking on seemed to cushion my every step.  the creature appeared to be communicating with others but i couldn't see anything else.  finally we approached this spherical room.  we entered but nothing was in there.  just two weird looking seats and the enterance.  a dim bluish light illuminated from above.  at this point, i thought i was dreaming.  the \"thing\" that was leading me appeared to be some sort of creature.  it invited me into one of the seats as it took the other.  this is where i observed its appearance.  it was very short.  it had dark skin.  it had a large head with two large dark eyes.  it had a visible nose but no visible ears or mouth which is weird because it had a voice. it also had long limbs and long fingers.  it appeared to have some sort of engraving on it's chest.  it also appeared to be injured.  this creature and i had a conversation.  it spoke to me.\r\nit asked me, \"what are you?\"\r\ni responded, \"i'm a human being.\"\r\nit then asked me, \"and this is your home, earth?\"\r\ni responded, \"yes.  why are you here?\"\r\nit paused for some brief moments.  then it said, \"because the humans will face the exact same fate that the ithileceus faced.  the creature stated \"ithileceus\".  i'm guessing that's how you spell it and i'm guessing that's the race of the creature.\r\ni asked, \"and what's that?\"\r\nit replied, \"extinction.\"\r\nbefore i asked another question, it continued.  \"if the humans don't build an ostisuphrymicous, during the year 2065, they will parish and your world will become their world.\"\r\ni asked, \"what's an os-tis-u-phrym-icous?\"\r\nthen a small desk appeared from above us and landed in between us.  a small sphere appeared.  it seemed to emit some sort of energy.  the creature just stared at it.  it started to glow and i felt all my energy drain from my body.  then it stopped glowing.  i felt exhausted and vulnerable.  the creature said, \"this one was built for use against your kind just in case you happened to portray some level of hostility.  but after some observation, your kind is at most, harmless.  we used the last of our resources to build it.\"\r\ni can't describe the sphere with words.  i probably could only draw it.  i asked the creature, \"where are you from?\"\r\nthe creature replied, \"i am from a place far more advanced than this one.  approximately a thousand times more advanced.  but my home is now home to invaders.  my race was completely destroyed.  i as well as a few others are all that remain in existance.\"\r\ni asked, \"why are you helping us?\"\r\nthe creature replied, \"it is in our nature to aid those that we cross paths with.  it appears that your planet is in a collection of several planets and as a group, appears to be in the path of the invaders that have taken our planet.  i am simply warning you of what's to come.\"\r\ni still believed i was dreaming.  the creatured seemed to be able to read my thoughts and my feelings.  the creature said, \"as victims in a massive slaughtering, this makes us brothers in this universe.  if you don't survive, at least you will die fighting.\"\r\ni tried to comprehend everything that was being told to me.  but i just couldn't believe it.  the creature extended it's hand out as to shake my hand.  i reached out too and as our hands touched i went unconcious.  the next thing i know, i awoke in my bed.  my clothes were still on, as well as my shoes.  but my watch was missing.  so was my wallet, my phone, my ipod, my cigarettes and my lighter.  i looked outside and my car was nowhere to be found.  i asked a friend to drive me where i had stopped the night before.  my car was still there but nothing else was found.  i called my phone several times using my friend's cell and each time there was an automatic pick-up.  each time i heard a weird humming noise, like a light saber and occasionally a beep.  during the fourth call, it cut and all i got was the operator voice telling me the number was not assigned.  after that day, i had several dreams of a global takeover, more than 6 to be exact.  this incident is truly chilling and disturbing and i've questioned our reality and my existance ever since.  this is a true story.  please believe me.  this incident happened to me.  please e-mail me if you want to see the pictures i drew of the sphere and the creature: [cms/tg/pid]  the creature warned me of the year 2065.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24066,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.2099694,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07012010-0005","longitude":-105.7440505,"occurred":1261555200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Saskatchewan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1277998681000,"summary":"This

the 27th my friend and i went outside to talk and we were seated facing west. i was looking up to the southwest a bit when a bright flash of light with a diamond shape object in the middle just appeared. it came in really fast through what i call a portal with a bright flash of light. as it entered it stopped in the sky almost as fast as it came in and floated slowly from my left to right, a south to north movement as i could tell. \r\n\r\nafter the initial bright flash of light as it broke into our atmosphere and as it began it's glide/descent, the light quickly faded but not light instant on instant off. it just dimmed but as the celestial craft dimmed it also began to cloak or transform into a small light behind the foliage of the tree. i could see the small light just either go away from me or disappear altogether. my friend witnessed some of the event but not all; from the dimming glide to the small light. this event took about 10 seconds or so.\r\n\r\ni was in total awe but the initial reaction i felt was that stir in your stomach and that tinge of fear that comes from seeing something so celestial you just know it is not of this world. i thought. \"oh my god\" and i exclaimed 'what is that!?!\" which was then when my friend pulled the focus. i could see the object/craft so clearly as it entered our airspace, and i say that because i have seen many things concerning outer/inner world phenomenon like fireballs screaming across the sky, meteors striking our atmosphere so hard i could see the outer layer of earth's atmosphere and even sightings of ufo's floating in the sky. this brightness entered our earth and came to a halt as if it was the easiest thing an aircraft could do.\r\n\r\nthe second sighting came at 9:35pm the very same day, sunday 27th and lasted more or less about a minute. me and my friends jokingly said, \"let's sit outside and lets see em again.\" we looked in the same position and my friend says,\"here they come\" but in a joking manner because he saw a bright star coming at us. he said it again, and then again and i realized the pitch in his voice changed and this object was moving straight towards us.\r\n\r\nit was moving, no gliding across the sky from west(southwest) to east(northeast). it was in perfect view and i could see the diamond shape craft/celestial with a light that was so bright and . . . pure. i mean, i can't really describe it because i have never seen such beautiful white bright light like this celestial emanated. it was smooth as glass and it was so bright and white there was this hue of blue in the center of the diamond shape... incredible beauty of light! it was so . . . pure\r\n\r\nit was too early for a star to be this bright. even venus was dim because there was light in the sky still. this was as pure brightness and a color of light i had never seen. as it moved across the sky it was unworldly in its movement. by that i mean unlike any aircraft we know today. not like a plane or even a high flying jet aircraft. they all move with a worldly rhythm but this moved so effortlessly across the sky at a pace that is not of this planet. it glided without movement or turbulence of any kind and the brightness of the light never wavered. it stayed beautiful and bright throughout the course of it's flight until it went out of our vision. it moved from west to east and it was silent and perfect! no sound came from this celestial at all. i ran from one yard to another yard to follow the flight path and i tried videotaping it but i could not capture it. i'll look again but it was dark on camera.\r\n\r\ni know something big is happening. it just falls into place with what i know is occurring with the planets. my psychic ability tells me that we are in a transformation for all the human race but now i realize this is on a much larger scale than even i had foreseen.\r\n\r\ni am still in awe and i know this is not just another sighting, i just know that. seeing something move across the sky is one thing; watching a diamond craft/celestial enter our airspace, and come to a halt like it did with such ease is another. maybe it didn't know, or care, that i saw it enter but it wanted us/me to see it later that evening. it was clear and not fuzzy, it was close and not far away although i cannot tell the size from its flight. it looked huge when it entered the portal early morning but much smaller when we saw it later. i/we saw it clearly and it was, for lack of better words, beautifully perfect.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

illumination it would gradually fade back out to the point that you could no longer see it. then about 45 to 120 seconds it reapeared in the exact same way, but this time it had moved what i would say was about 50 feet down and slightly left. after it faded out the second time it reappeared once again in the same way but this time it had moved upward and to the right and had traveled an even farther distance than the first time (you could not see the object move at all), then it proceeded to fade out yet again. then it appeared again this time almost straight down what seemed about 40 to 50 feet. it continued to keep this up for 6 to 7 times each time it would relocate continuing to have moved a large distance with no set time between each appearance. after 6 or 7 times i never saw it

(i was at work and had just gone on my break)  he asked me to look outside and in the area of the sun and tell him what i could see.  he stated that he and his wife were in indy on medical business and that another person seeing these things was in lafayette.  i went outside and at first glance didn't seen anything except some cotton wood flying, some bugs and a few flying spider webs, all flying with the air current and looking quite pretty in the bright sun and clear blue sky.  then suddenly i happened to notice something quite different.  the object i saw moved out from the corona of the sun was clearly a much higher altitude than the bugs and other debris flying around.  this object was moving against the air current that was propelling the other debris in the air.  it stopped. held steady it's position for well over one minute (which is like a century when you are watching, btw) and then proceeded to move back into the sun, where i was no longer able to see it.  it was quite large.  with that, there appeared a whole host of other odd moving \"things��� at one point there were so many that it gave the sun the appearance of an atom with all the molecules circling about it.  it was that kind of movement and it was simply spectacular to watch.  i���m my 51 years, i have enver seen anything like it.  i had to go back in to work at 11:30 am and it was still going strong.  i want back outside again at 1 pm and it was still going on.  by 1:45 pm it seemed to be waning.  a number of other employees wandered outside and watched the show, as well.  i would estimate that at least 15 people that i know of went outside and observed the strange lights.  like i said, i did see a lot of cotton wood flying about.  as well as bugs and, to my surprise, quite a lot of spider web material.  i have read about the high air spider webs before but never seen them until today.  they were very pretty to watch.  but not anomalous in

to the object (triangle), and this time, i could actually hear a low decible humming sound, though very faint, when the object started to move away from me in a northerly direction, i did not notice

some fresh air, i decided to go pet our cats, and i looked to the southeast and noticed what appeared to be an orange orb off in the distance, so i my curiousity caused me to keep my eyes on it, but as it approached slowly, the orange orb like light dimmed, and a bright white spot light came on, and was shinning on the ground, i ran inside and grabbed our telescope to see if i could make out any details. as i came back out, it was really close, less than a mile away, it appeared to be anywhere from 500-1,000 feet above the ground and moving at about 50 to 100 mph. i set up the telescope and was able to find it (it is very difficult to follow moving objects in telescopes), i could see three white lights (not flashing) in a triangle formation, and a red blinking light between the center and rear. but then it started make strange manauvers, it appeared to bank to the right and actually roll completely upside down and then roll back over (did not make a 100% roll manauver). i'm not sure how many times it did this, but it was alot. it also decended 50 or 100 feet several times and then ascend back to the altitude it was at, almost in the blink of an eye. there was no sound at all, even though it was almost directly overhead, it banked over to the left and the back to the right and continued northbound in a straight bath towards vincennes. i ran inside to grab my camera but when i came back outside, it was gone. i did strongly think it might have been an aircraft having problems, but considering how it decended and ascended almost instantly, gives me very little doubt it was any aircraft that i know of.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

glittery red oval/circle rise above the tree line, we thought it was a plane but there was no sound, within about 20 seconds a second one rose up behind it.  they slowly rose and went west up into the sky towards a large black cloud and could not see anymore due to it being too far away.  we watched and ended up seeing at least 18 of these over the coarse of 20 minutes prior to going into the house (there could have been more but the mosquitos were getting too bad) like i said we intially thought these were planes but there ended up being too many of them and it was silent. we would see one rise and then another would shortly follow and they would all follow the same path of floating up into the sky while going west.  there seemed to be about a minute and half wait before we would see the next one rise and then one follow in about 20-30 seconds.  they all looked alike.  there is no airport in the area and then we considered if they could have been some sort of weather balloon.  there were 6 of us tht witnessed this and none of us have ever seen anything like it. they all seemed to have the same pattern and float up and rise very controlled and at the same speed. we were all excited by it and also baffled since we could not figure out what this could be and are unsure who to ask.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
