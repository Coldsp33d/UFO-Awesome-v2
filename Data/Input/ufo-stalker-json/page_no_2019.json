no explanation for.\r\n\r\nas i sometimes do, i parked my vehicle on a hill here in grand terrace that overlooks the railroad line that runs from riverside to colton. as most of you already know, i am a huge train geek, and during my lunch i sometimes either walk to this vantage point, or dive, so that i can watch trains go by while i eat.\r\n\r\nat about 1:30 pm pst i took my normal position on top of the hill and began to eat my lunch. while i was sitting there thinking about some of my recent interactions with fans and fellow authors about the now controversial dvd release of \"destroy all planets\", i noticed a silver metallic object in the sky traveling from east to west.\r\n\r\nas the object passed by, i noticed that it seemed to reflect the sunlight and i didn't notice any wings. i thought that this was an odd angle to view an airplane, which is what i assumed it was. i also noted that i hadn't ever seen a plane at this low altitude in this area of the sky before. upon further investigation, i also noticed that this, 'plane', didn't seem to have a tail fin. it looked about the same size a commercial jet, oval in shape, larger in the front tapering towards the tail.\r\n\r\nas the object traveled to about 3/4 of the way across my point of view it simply vanished. now when i say vanished, i mean it disappeared, slowly, like someone turned it off.\r\n\r\ni sat in place for another ten minutes surveying the sky for the object and could not locate it anywhere in the heavens.\r\n\r\nthe sky is bit hazy today, but there are no clouds, or anything else for that matter, for this object to have flown into. it just disappeared right in front of my eyes.\r\n\r\nin my estimation, the objects flight path would have been directly over riverside.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

had her watch the same star.  she verified that it was indeed moving in a very erratic pattern.  we continued to watch and this object would move rapidly in a northerly direction, stop, make a 90 degree turn and speed away, only to stop, then move at a very rapid rate again.  it raced across the sky then perform a v pattern, then it would stop and be stationary for a few minutes then start the erratic movements again.  this object started at about 70 degrees off the horizon and continued to rise during the time watched.  i watched this off and on until 4:00 am at which time it had climbed to being approximately 95 degrees off the horizon.\r\n\r\ni contacted friends here in the area who also watched this object for a time and saw the same thing i did.  i also have a friend who lives

was nighttime, so the lights from vincennes were shinning up onto the clouds and made them look tan-brown, but the ufo was about a mile south of vincennes, and we were able to clearly see an actual triangular shape, it appeared to be either black or dark grey. the rear had 3 very bright white lights flashing from left to right and a panel of dimmer white lights that were pulsating on and off. we could see a white light at each of the 3 corners and a red flashing light more towards the rear not exactly in the center. the sides had, what i took, were circular windows with a bright white light inside the craft. when we drove direcly beneath it, there was no sound that we could hear, and definetely no thrust at all. i've been to over 10 airshows in my life, and have witnessed the vertical take off and landing \"harrier\" which is very loud. we got to where we were going ( i do not remember exactly where) and we got out of the car, and we saw the object move very slowly over us (around 15 or 20 mph) and was about 500 feet in the air, then it banked to the right, stopped, and then accelerated off to the northwest at over 100 mph, and disappeared behind the trees and off into

i could see two white lights (not flashing) on the front end of it, and a blue light (not flashing) on the corners (not the front corner) and a white flashing light on the bottom towards the rear, as it past, i estimated it to be travelling at around 50 mph and at an altitude of 500 feet. it made no sound whatsoever. the rear had yellow-gold pulsating lights. the object looked triangular, and i estimated it to be about half the size of a football field, its motion was from east-northeast to west-southwest. i attempted to take a picture of it but the object did not show up in the photo. i did get a little nervous, but like i said, i have seen these things before, this is the 6th time, so i was'nt scared. i lost sight of the object as it went behind a ridge with trees.","distance":"101-500

the nights were much darker back then and the city lights were not as much of an issue as they are now. i have always been interested in ufo's and our family would spend many hours looking for satellites on clear nights. i am not sure of the date when this occurred but i think that it was in the early fall. i was in my front yard just looking around trying to find a satellite when i noticed one coming up from the northern horizon. it was moving at a constant rate and was about as bright as a bright star. i thought it was cool and continued watching it. to my surprise, when it was directly above me, it stopped. i tried to continue watching it but my neck finally got tired and i looked away. it was so clear that night that when i looked back up i wasn't sure exactly which star it was. at this time, a friend of mine who lived across the street from me came over to visit. i told him what i had seen and he became very interested and decided to hang out with me. we continued watching around the sky looking for anything else. we occasionally looked up to see if the one that stopped was still there. the next thing that we saw came up from the opposite horizon about 30 minutes after the first one and it could have actually been a satellite since it passed directly overhead and continued until we could no longer see it. it looked identical to the first one. then the big event occurred. about 45 minutes to an hour after the second satellite disappeared and from the same spot that it disappeared from, we saw four of them come up from the horizon. they were all exactly the same size and brightness. while they were moving toward the sky directly above us, they were doing tricks like flying circles around each other, they would fly apart and then zoom back together, one or two would stop and let the others go ahead and then they would instantly catch up with them. the next thing that happened let us know that the first one that i had seen a couple of hours ago was actually still there. as the group of four reached the sky directly above us, a fifth one joined them and moved off with them. it was like they were picking the first one up on the way somewhere. all five of them were kind of playing around as they flew off and finally disappeared. i have always wished that i had a telescope back then so that i might have been able to focus in on the one that was directly above me for a couple of hours. i am not sure what they were doing but i have always thought that they had been stationed around the country or earth at the locations of big cities to observe. although i have never had anything like this happen again, i have seen many satellites over the years. at least i think that they were satellites.\r\n\r\nthank

very bright light slowly travelling north, maybe 2000 ft agl. me being an aircraft mechanic and student pilot, was very puzzled. why aren't are there any nav lights or a rotating beacon? absolutely no sound what so ever. while explaining to my sister what we should be seeing (red and white nav lights, a rotating beacon and possibly strobes) the light turned east and flew away from us disappearing amongst the treetops. the intensity of the light never diminished, even when clearly flying away from us. my sister and i talked about what we had just witnessed. minutes later i was able to show her 2 examples of what we should have seen. an aircraft travelling south-southwest rumbled past overhead.. we could clearly see all three nav lights and hear the drone of the prop. even as it flew past we were able to see and hear a jet at altitude. we could clearly see the contrails and nav lights in the twilight. \r\n\r\nthe next night my mom and my son accompanied me around the fire. i was explaining to my mom what my sister and i had seen the night before. again i was able to show her an airplane flying across the night sky. showing her the correct lights and sounds. almost immediately we observed an indentical bright light travelling the same directions(north gently turning east)fly past. the light took the same flight path as the night before. no extra lights and no sound, just an intense light clearly under intelligent control. i reached for my digital camera and set it to movie mode, of course the batteries were dead from the numerous picture i had taken on vacation. oh

themselves as a religious group that worshipped aliens. i believe the music group was from switzerland or sweden. the alien species was also called abba. this religious cult, however, was based in germany. they claimed that all you had to do was have your television on and call their name three times (abba, abba, abba) and they would come to you. you would know of their arrival simply by listening to your radio. something wierd did happen.\r\n\r\nin 1977, the cia told the music group that if in fact they were as legitimate as others had claimed, then produce an alien spacecraft. thirty days later, a fully functional, fully equipped spacecraft landed in west virginia. there was no one aboard. the local residents called it in to cia headquarters, langly virginia. my unlce was a command sergeant major in the air force, stationed at hampton's air force base. the time was about 03:30-04:30 hhrs when he recieved the called. i was visiting in virginia with him and my causins when my uncle awakened me and asked if i wanted to see a real spaceship. i asked him if we were going to the sight? he said no; we were going to the hanger where they were going to keep it. the craft came in not at hampton's air force base but hampton's army post. it was brought in peacies on flat bed trucks. i ask one of the drivers where is it and what was he carrying? he said it was the spacecraft brought in parts. later, i was taken to hanger 18 of some area on hampton's army post. there, a crew began assembling the craft. another crew began testing the craft's computor parts, eletronics, et cetera. before i left, it looked like it could be a spaceship.\r\n\r\ni believe later that summer (or perhaps during the christmas holidays), my uncle brought me back to hanger 18, and took me on a few trips with him to langly. the craft looked something like the starship voyager (at least the saucer section). his unit was assign to langly virginia as computor programmers, hackers, et cetera. the cia would call for them whenever they could not figer out how to operate any of the spaceship's computer components. less than a year later, the air force put out a moive called \"hanger 8\" to throw off people. the moive was a fake, all with the exception of one scene. \r\n\r\ni have also learned that if you really would like to get to the bottom of all this ufo crap, all you need to do is ask your friendly local australian aborigine. they calim to decend from aliens and can show you neat things. they have convinced me. \r\n\r\nthere is a lot more to this story (e.G., abba's, oracles, voo doo priestesses, and even communism, as indicated in the moive \"close encounters,\" the first series). apparently, it is all the same thing -- so called gifts given long ago from aliens, most of which i now believe.\r\n\r\nif you really would like to know more, you can call me at home. if not, then stop this fraudulent claim of ufo interest groups and alien hunters... please!\r\n\r\nan

listening.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24026,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4598528,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06292010-0007","longitude":-75.8159264,"occurred":1277441880000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1277835815000,"summary":"Object

concert. this place provides a view of at least 15 miles of surrounding area for approx. 270 degrees. these ufo's were spotted above summer lake. at first: i noticed what looked like a streak of light across a large part of the sky. something had gone by at high speed at the edge of my vision. i kept my attention on that part of the sky. within a minute i saw it again, but this time it was more visible (brighter / slower movement). i ran to the tent and grabbed my camera. i witnessed what looked like balls of light moving in groups. these lights were a golden color and could be seen changing at a high rate between red,green,blue,and white. they faded in and out, as if they were disappearing and reappearing. some of the time they would stay in a semi-transparent state. i took pictures of the area whenever i saw them. much of the time they were moving so fast that i wasn't sure if i caught them. *** later in the evening multiple balls of light appeared above the horizon. they seemed to be a few miles away. after taking a few pictures, they disappeared. moments later they were spotted by my friend. they were within a mile or less and where moving extremely low to the ground. my friend and i then witnessed the lights go into the lake and disappear. the lights then reappeared and were within what seemed to be about 1000 yards of us. the dark pictures are of these lights when they were what seemed to be a few miles away. the lights then disappeared back into the lake. they were seen moving at a high rate of speed and then disappeared. that was the last we witness of them.
