...Anyhow just as i started watching it it seemed to fall from the sky. my vision of the object was interrupted as it went behind some tall cottonwood trees which where about 40 yards in from of me.  i quickly rode to the street...About 35 yards...Turned north for exactly one half block...Turned south again into the alley and rode to about the halfway point of the length of the block. i did not see anything where i thought the white light should be but just then my attention was captured by a red light off to my right.  it was very bright and at first i thought it was a roman candle as it is near the fourth of july.  but quickly i realized it was not a firework ...Maybe a drone,,,those are popular toys these days.....Anyhow  in seconds it rose straight up to a height of about 100 feet. silhouetted against the bitterroot  mountains which were a darker blue....Darker than the sky. it was silent. as it rose i could barely make out a boxy shape as it had two whitish lights on either side of the larger red lighted object. \r\n\r\n as i struggled to get my camera working on my cell phone.....(i am not sure it i captured it on the video....) but i was trying to record it as it rose up further and headed off in a se direction. at this point it was traveling towards the se at about 200 feet.  at an angle of about 75-80 degrees above me. i rode to the end of the block...About 20 yards to get to a viewpoint that would allow me to watch it more....  just as i focused on it heading out ...It disappeared!  sky was still bright enough to see  this very plainly.

fireworks display with our child. we had left early because our child was frightened of the booming sounds. we had just gotten out of the car and i was unbuckling the back seat belt when i noticed what looked like a 1/2 circle of bright red lights in the sky. since we were just at a fireworks display, i was thinking this might be a neighbor who had purchased some kind of new firework, but they just stayed motionless in one spot. we, ( my husband and i) then noticed that the lights were slowly moving in unison in a circle to the left very slowly. after a few minutes, each one seemed to diminish or pull back. at that point i was thinking this must be some type of flare. finally, only one light remained visible and my husband tried to take a phone video, but said it was too far away and it just looked like a tiny dot on the screen. after this the remaining light moved slowly to the left- in a straight line and then seemed to fade like the others. my husband sent the video to our email and i was surprised and very upset to see that three lights are still visible on it, even though we both only observed one light at the time he was filming and the lights also appear white on the video and were very bright red when we observed them. they did not blink at all, just a constant red color. i also noticed some tiny flashes of light near the larger lights in the video and i did not see or notice those at the time of the video. i am trying to find out what this may have been. i am more skeptical than anything else, i just can't figure out what we were looking at tonight.

around 1700 hrs i saw the following from my bedroom window in veitsch, styria.\r\ni have my pc there and was looking again like countless times towards stanglalm (n.B. that is a local mountain south of my home).\r\n\r\ni saw 3 silent dark grey objects approx. 20-30meters in length or diameter coming from the area of sommerberg flying/gliding towards stanz in mürztal.\r\nmy window was open and at first i thought i saw birds, it was absolutly quit outside, aeroplanes and helicopters make quite a sound.\r\n\r\nthe three flew in a straight line after one other, the first two a few hundered meters apart and the 3. about 10 second behind the second object at the apearently same height and direction.\r\n\r\ni knew they were objects rather than bird when the flew through some sort of electrical cloud, i could see numerous flashes of light on the \"skin\"/outer grey layer on each object.\r\n\r\na bird would die instantly if caught in a lightning bolt and crash.\r\n\r\ni saw each object approx. 3-5 seconds, that was to short to get my olympus 800uz, as it takes 30-45 seconds to fire it up..\r\n\r\ncheers and kind regards jacques aus veitsch, highstyria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

hora local de mi ciuadad armenia,quindio,colombia,me encontraba en la sala de mi casa experimentando con una lente infrarrojo en la camara de mi tablet la cual fije con vista al firmamento,inice a grabar apartir de las 2:30 pm 0 14:30 pm hora local hasta aproximadamente pasadas las 5:20 pm o 17:20 pm.,en un comienzo a simple vista no note nada anormal ni fuera de lo comun o que me paresiera extraño,grabe unos 10 videos de prueba solo por la curiosidad de ver mas tarde los videos a ver que habia captado la camara de la tablet adaptada con lente infrarrojo.En horas de la noche revise uno a uno cada video  pausandolos y viendolos en camara lenta y en dos de los 10 videos pude notar esferas traslucidas luminosas pero en uno de esos dos videos pude notar con asombro como en los primeros 3:08,3:09 al 3:10 minutos un extraño objecto de aspecto grisaseo plateado crusa el cuadro de enfoque a gran velocidad ,y en ese mismo minuto 3:52 al minuto 3:53 casi llegando al minuto 3:54 una segunda esfera luminosa aparese en la toma en lo alto de la nube arriba del cielo donde el cuadro de enfoque de la tablet limita la copa de un arbol por la ventana y un poste de energia,alcomienzo cuando vi el video lentamente y pausando las tomas penese que podria tratarse de alguna ave o insecto o desenfoque o reflejo producido por el infrarrojo,pero al verlo mas detalladamente mi curiosidad cresio y mi asombro fue mayor al definitivamente poder distinguir forma y aspecto del objecto asi mismo como deducir su posible velocidad al descender y cambiar su trayectoria conservando tan asombrosa velocidad,el objecto aparese en lo alto de la pequeña nube en el cielo entre la toma que hace la lente entre la copa del arbol y el poste de energia,desciende con rapidez,depronto emite un destello de luz el cual capta con gran clarida la lente y queda en la grabacion del video,luego sobre ese mismo descenso y a conservando esa gran velocidad el objecto hace un giro brusco hacia la derecha en direccion alta en el cielo por detras de la toma del poste de energia,en el momento de hacer el giro a la ves emite un segunto destello de luz el cual parese ser alguna especie de pulsacion producidad por la energia que lo propulsa o impulsa la cual se torna de un color blancusco con tono azulado.Una ves el extraño objecto gira hacia la derecha en su descenso este pasa por el cuadro de toma de grabacion a un lado del poste de energia en lo alto por la parte trasera de dicho poste de energia y se pierde en la toma de grabacion debido a que la camara ya no lo alcanza a captar dentro del rango de enfoque de toma.Y como dato aun mas extraño entre los tiempos previos a la toma en que aperese el extraño objecto y despues de que este pasa en lo alto y es captado por la camara modificada a infrarrojo de la tablet ,el dispositivo alpareser presento variaciones e inestabilidad de grabacion que aun no logro explicar,una especie de fuerza electromagnetica o pulsacion paresio afectarla al momento de captar y lograr grabar al objecto.Hice algunas capturas de pantalla de los tiempos de pausa dentro del video donde se puede claramente distinguir su aspecto y su forma,asi mismo como del momento en que aparese en lo alto,empieza su descenso y gira hacia la derecha emitiendo esa luz rara.Asi mismo hice una copia del archivo original al cual le disminui la velocidad de grabado o lo ralentise para hacer mas facil la visualizacion del fenomeno en los tiempos dados del video.","distance":"101-500

smoking a cigarette when i noticed one of my neighbors was flying his small drone/rc aircraft around the neighborhood. i was watching the drone fly over another neighbors house when i noticed a second object appeared from behind the house.\r\n\r\nmy initial impression was this object was oddly shaped, being much taller (vertical plane) and much shorter (horizontal plane) in it's silouette than any aircraft i am familiar with. from it's silouette, i concluded it was likely a large bird flying at a very steep bank over the woods near the neighborhood. i then returned my attention to the drone now flying near my house.\r\n\r\nafter a few seconds, the drone disappeared from my view and i glanced back at the other object. i noticed despite it appearing to be in a steep bank, it seemed to be flying straight and level. at this point i determined this was not a bird as i previously assumed, and noticed the object appeared to be two similarly shaped objects tethered or connected together, one on top of the other. \r\n\r\nthe object looked rounded or egg shaped, with a second rounded/egg shaped object immediately below it. between the two egg sections was a solid structure appearing to connect the two together. i could not determine whether this was a single object or two objects, but i distinctly remember the solid structure linking the two rounded sections together. the object was dark in appearance, perhaps dull black or another very dark color.\r\n\r\nat this point i became very interested in the object and i wanted to get a closer look. i started filming the object with my cell phone at maximum zoom (x8). i also (accidentally) took a still photo with my phone prior to taking the video. i will attached both of these files to this report \r\n\r\ni filmed the object for almost two minutes as it traveled at a moderate rate of speed from west to east. the sun was very low on the horizon at this time, and i noted that there was no visible glint or reflection of the sunlight from the object. \r\n\r\na few moments after i stopped filming, a small single engine airplane flew over the house traveling south. this aircraft had all of it's navigation and anti-collision lights on and i immediately realized i did not see any sign of such lighting on the object i filmed. there was no noise heard from the object nor any other emissions observed. i could not see any normal aircraft parts on the object (no rotor blades, propellers, wings, stabilizers, etc).\r\n\r\nthe two most likely explanations i can come up with are: 1) a helicopter with a large load slung underneath or 2) two aircraft in an air-to-air refueling operation. there are some merits to each explaination, but there are several problems with each as well. the apparent \"structure\" connecting the two sections was much more solid and thicker than any sling load or refueling probe i've ever seen. this structure was very distinct. plus the apparent lack of lighting and/or wings, rotors, etc. \r\n\r\nin short, i have no idea what i saw. but it was unusual enough in appearance that i decided to take a video of it.\r\n\r\nhappy to answer any follow up questions that may arise.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

disappeared in few seconds, my girlfriend and little niece were afraid. i took the phone and got the photo of second object. this object was hovered over crane for few minutes. the shot was not very good in night and i have tried to get a video, but the video quality it turned out even worse. then in few minutes - the object was disappeared.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":84760,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":56.87497433194462,"location":null,"logNumber":"RU-07022017-0012","longitude":53.195223441535795,"occurred":1498953600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Udmurtskaja

when i saw a teardrop shaped bright light, (similar color of a led light), stationary it ejected a smaller orb of same color. the large teardrop shaped ufo was moving right then left, then right again, atlast shifting upward and then it shut off or disappeared. the smaller orb was moving faster than any jet. if i had to guess it was higher then a jet liner. i tried to get a witness but every time he looked it strained his back, (he is elderly). i walked around the house and looked in the west direction when i saw another orbed light (led) moving at a very fast speed it was moving toward the north, it was approximately 10 miles i would have to guess. on another date, about 7 months ago i was heading south on i-29 south of the airport, when i looked to my left and with cloud coverage of the ufo i could see a portion of a ship, (it was hidden for the most) it was very large and had lights on the bottom, each light was almost connecting to each other. the ship was hovering and emmitting light to the edge of the cloud, it had some type of electricity enveloping the area of the ship that i could see. this ship was white in color and was disk shaped. i have experienced many different types of phenomenon for a while and i have been feeling strange so i used my cell phone to video my head when i was feeling a burning sensation, this is when i captured a \"orb\" of light stream to my scalp, i then pointed to where the orb had gone to, the screen of my phone was facing away from me so that i could use the light of the camera. i was sitting in the dark at the time. i also knew where orbs would appear in the room and i was capturing this on camera as well.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

the east and west.  they looked like \"bright\" stars that were moving around.  everytime i tried to take pictures they would make my cellphone camera go out of focus.  then started hearing low sounding helicopters which seemed to even make the house shake.  i would go out to see if i could see them but they would be leaving by the time i got outside, but would start again when i got inside.  i contacted the city and county police but when they came out to check it out, there would be nothing, but as soon as they left they would be back.  i didn't know if it was the bright objects or not because they were always there.\r\nsince then it has started doing something that hits the back of my neck that causes extreme pain.  if i leave my home it follows me and has caused vehicle engine idle & run rough causing it to slow down.  also times when if seems like my rear tire is out of balance while the vehicle is shaking.  it has happened in both my vehicles as well as my motorcycle.  all the time that these things are going on i am being shocked.\r\ni had also started noticing that there were high electromagnetic field reading that were coming & going.  had a specialist check our

heart due to increasing & decreasing heartrate, feel burning in my toes and inner leg.  it's making my eyes get really dry and go out of focus.\r\ni'm having to deal with this now 24/7.  also my wife

and 9:00 p.M.  as seat belts were a new thing, we did not use them.  i would frequently lie down in the back seat and look up into the sky out the side window.  there were no lights in the area, and so it was easy to observe a multitude of stars and occasionally a shooting star.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, i saw an extremely bright yellowish light, almost like a beam coming straight toward me.  i rolled over while keeping my eyes on the light, so i could get closer to the window to see it.  i had no idea what the light was, but it was so outside the normal experience that i was fascinated.\r\n\r\nthere seemed to be a solid core to the light, with a slightly less intense aura surrounding it.  the most intriguing part was three seemingly incompatible facts.  first, the light source was intensely bright and apparently very close.  the second unusual thing was that there was absolutely no sound.  the third was that the light orb, at about 40 degrees of elevation to the left of the car, was exactly keeping pace with our 55-60 miles per hour.  and as i have thought back about the experience, there was a fourth significant oddity:  my parents in the front seat seemed to be completely oblivious to what was happening.  they were keeping their eyes on the road ahead and were either quiet or were having trivial conversation.  i kept on paying attention to the light for at least a minute, perhaps as long as four minutes.  then suddenly, the light orb was gone without a trace.\r\n\r\ni never did discuss this with my parents.  if they witnessed the event, they were trying to be calm for my sake.  but there were no glances to the left side and into the sky, to evidence that they were even aware of what was happening.  so because i was apparently the only witness, i never brought up the subject.\r\n\r\nmy basic feeling was that the experience was very cool.  i did not try to analyze it or to figure out what it was.  i was content to have witnessed something unusual which was just for me.  i was not considering the possibilities of ufos or anything like that.  it was only as time passed, and as i had more scientific education, that i began to realize the possible significance of what i saw.  i cannot say that i definitely saw a ufo.  what i can say is that i saw something airborne which defies conventional aeronautics – extremely bright and close, extremely slow (until it vanished), and entirely silent.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
