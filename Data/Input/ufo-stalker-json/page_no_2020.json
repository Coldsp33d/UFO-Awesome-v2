Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Two friends and myself were night fishing in the center of manasquan inlet, nj which separates point pleasant beach from manasquan, about 200 yards from the inlet opening to the atlantic ocean. this is a familiar location i have known for over 50 years. friend #1 first noticed an unusual star-like intermittent (not steadily blinking) white light making unusually fast and erratic movements and seemingly impossible instantaneous stops and changes of direction, and pointed it out to me and friend #2. \r\n\r\nit was a clear, cloudless night with a full moon, and the light, relative to our position inside manasquan inlet, appeared to be directly above a lighted red flashing buoy one mile approximately southeast of the mouth of the inlet, at an approximate apparent altitude of 5,000 feet or about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, an area of high volume air traffic in and out of new york city area airports newark, kennedy and laguardia, as well as east-west flight paths of military flights in and out of nearby mcguire air force base and lakehurst naval air station. with no reference points, the distance from us to the object is estimated to be at least 5 miles away, but could well have been much farther. i have copied a link from earthnc to show our exact position:\r\nhttp://earthnc.Com/chartviewer/?Ll=40.10052853354975,-74.0227460861206&z=15&chart=onechart\r\n\r\nwhen the three of us took note of the object, we at first thought it might be coast guard or navy helicopters which regularly frequent the area, but those are easily distinguishable by their navigation and steadily flashing strobe lights. the object appeared to display a single steady white light for about 10 to 20 seconds at a time, during which period it made numerous almost instantaneous position changes vertically, horizontally and diagonally within a defined area, then would extinguish, only to reappear and perform a similar but random series of movements. i am aware of no aircraft with this capability. \r\n\r\nthe three of us watched these maneuvers intently and with great curiosity and amazement for several minutes. the intermittently lighted objects would appear smaller than a pea held at arms length, and we observed no other air traffic during this sighting.\r\n\r\nit was difficult to determine initially if the movements were that of a single object or more, but after about a minute of us all watching the movements of the object with great interest, a second object appeared simultaneously nearby, and displayed similar behavior to the first object. after that the objects appeared both singly and together in individual random maneuvers which made them appear to move thousands of feet at a time in just a second or fraction of a second, and in many directions with abrupt stops and zig-zag direction changes, almost as if playing a combined game of tag and hide-and-seek. \r\n\r\nwe observed these objects for about 15 minutes until they were no longer visible as we headed northwest up the manasquan river back to bay head. also, the movements of the objects were all straight line movements as opposed to curving as a typical aircraft might do.\r\n\r\nbeing a life-long boater and professional yacht delivery captain, and being familiar with air traffic in this area and having lived here for over 50 years, i feel i have good observation abilities but remain at a loss as to what these objects might have been, and my two friends agree they could not determine what these objects were.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path

6-23-10, i was skywatching and i had a pretty significant sighting and i shared it with [cms/tg/pid] and [cms/tg/pid]. at first i thought i was watching the iss fly over, but several things convinced me that what i was seeing was not the iss........\r\n\r\nthere were many times in years past that i took my youngest son out to watch the iss/shuttle connected and flying overhead. i know very well from these past times how bright they were, how fast they flew over, etc........ \r\n\r\nthe iss did fly over my area this night and its track was sw to ene........The degree coming and going were both 17 degrees above the horizon with a max elevation of 61 degrees. the duration was for 4 minutes for the iss. the sighting duration time began at 9:45 pm........\r\n\r\nthe object i saw flew sw to ne........About 35 degrees coming and about 60 degrees going.......The max elevation was 80 degrees......Damn near straight over my head........From my vantage point on my drive way there would be no way for me to see the iss at 17 degrees either coming or going.......And remember my home is located on a hill overlooking a valley and the max elevation of my object was 19 degrees higher than what the iss was flying.........\r\n\r\ni first spotted the object at a long distance in the sw at about 35 degrees, between the moon and the top of trees from my vantage point. it brightness was brighter than the moon, no clouds in the sky......Its size was about two times brighter than jupiter at it biggest in the winter sky..........\r\n\r\nthe object stayed the exact same brightness and size during the entire sighting time.......Between 1 to 1 1/2 minutes...........Unlike sat\\'s. or iss/shuttle, there was no gradual buildup to full brightness and then a gradual ease to disappearance........My 1 to 1/2 minute sighting time was in direct contradiction to the 4 minute fly by duration time of the iss.....9:45 pm to 9:49 pm.....My sighting time was 9:48/49 pm to 9:51 pm........The shorter time span of my sighting meant that what i saw was traveling much faster than the iss, and began near the end of the iss sighting time duration, which would have meant that when i first saw my object far in the sw sky, the iss would have already been nearly out of view in the ene sky........\r\n\r\ni had my binoculars with me and watched the object the entire time through them except for about 5 seconds as i raised the binoculars up to my eyes. i had already earlier in the night set my focus/vision.......\r\n\r\nthese binoculars have a button to press and hold down for image stabilization (cannon 10 x 30) similar to a video camera. the is on this set of binoculars stills the image so there is no blurring or shaking effect when looking at an object at distance, and maintains the still effect as an object moves in real time as long as the is button is pressed down.....\r\n\r\nwhen i pressed the is button and held it down i could very clearly see that the object was not just a bright, white light in the sky, but was a structured object different than the iss. the bottom part of the object was elongated like a hot dog or hot dog bun, and had a rounded, dome structure on top, dead center. i could see the outline of this object during the entire sighting time. from my perspective the object had a typical saucer shape to it.\r\n\r\nnote: every single time in the past while taking my so to watch iss/shuttle fly overs, nasa tracking times over areas were perfect.......If nasa said say 7:22 pm, then my cell phone which uses sat. time said 7:22 pm when we first spotted the fly overs.\r\n\r\nlast year i reported that the ufo\\'s were mimicking stars, planets, iss, shuttle on fly overs in my area. linda moulton howe reported this same thing on coast to coast am in 2009. these objects/crafts have been flying over this area on a regular basis for nearly two years now. i believe that the object i witnessed was doing the same, and trailing/following the iss along its same flight path as to not raise any suspicions.\r\n\r\n[cms/tg/pid]\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24011,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.9152784,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06282010-0014","longitude":-86.8805588,"occurred":1277354880000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

tennessee, i was asked by my mother to take out the garbage. i went out back and i noticed a bright white full moon above. i looked closer and i noticed it had uniform whiteness with well define circular outline but i was not able to see the shades of white or grey that made the man in the moon face. it was equally as bright as the real full moon, bright enough to create a moon shadow. i looked around and i noticed another moon that was bright orange. this other moon was rising over our neighbor's house to the east, as i looked through the side yard from the back yard to the front. it had the features that created the man in the moon, so i believed that it was the real moon. i looked above and stared again at the white moon for a few minutes, then it made a rapid ascent in the sky. as it rose, it became smaller and smaller until it appeared to looked like a bright star, then a dim star, then disappeared into space. it reminded me of the star of bethleham when it was at high altitude.\r\n\r\ni was only seven when i witnessed this ufo that i now call the moon of memphis. i had a good memory of the event so that when i was trained in the air force as a navigator, i was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience. i estimate that the moon of memphis was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size. i developed this information from watching the ascent of the moon of memphis through some high cirrus clouds that i estimate was at sixty thousand feet. at twenty thousand feet it would have taken four 747 aircraft parked in a circle to cover the area of the moon of memphis ufo, thus creating a ten acre size estimate. when i saw it above me, it was exactly the size of the real moon when seen high in the sky.\r\n\r\ni believe the moon of memphis ufo was a fatima from god. when you take a through z and match it with 1 through 26, you can add up the letters of a word and get a sum number. for example israel adds up to 64, which made me think that the 1664 moon of memphis ufo had religious significance. where the moon of memphis came from or how it was created, was certainly a unique phenomenon of divine origin and purpose. it's appearance in 1964 hints that it had a  religious intellectual mind.\r\n\r\nfrom voices, visions, and dreams that i experienced thirty three years later, i believe it had a message from god to humanity. god wanted humanity to be more reverent to all living beings and animals. the consciousness of each being or animal is precious and must be respected more. before animals are killed, they should receive anesthesia and be put into an unwakeable sleep. anything less is cruel, heartless, and unreverent to that being and god. humanity should find a way to eat without killing animals, but until then, we must not kill an animal while it is awake. treat innocent animals as you would like to be treated if you were in their place. the moon of memphis is proof that god does exist and we should obey his wish for us to be more kind to each living being and animals.\r\n\r\n[cms/tg/pid]","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":24004,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.210187,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06282010-0007","longitude":-90.0420059,"occurred":-161719200000,"potentialRelations":[23904,23721],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

slowed down to 40 mph and stuck my head out the window.\r\n \r\nthe object appeared to be hovering still at commercial jet heighth. i took 3 looks, each time squinting my eyes and taking double checks.\r\n \r\nit was roughly the size of a 10 cent dime if you eld it over your head arms stretched out.\r\n \r\n3 lights on each corner.\r\n \r\nit was dark grey.\r\n \r\nvery small. but distinct triangle shape.\r\n \r\n2 of the lights at base remained lit, bright white circles. the rear ??? light, or top light, blinked as an  airplanes would.\r\n \r\nwhat struck me odd about this was the brightness of object. i am hoping more poeple witnessed this event in austin above camp mabry.\r\n \r\nuntil then i wish to remain anonymous. \r\n \r\ndue to the fact that this is my second sighting and i dont think posting about it online without pictures will do any good in the long run.\r\n \r\nmy first sighting was almost 1 yr ago to date. while riding in a neighbor hood street behind camp mabry on the other side of route 1 mopac. about 35th street and exposition blvd.\r\n \r\ni  immdeiatly dismissed this sighting because it happened so quick.  the first sighting was so low to the ground i didnt believe my eyes. a solid grey triangle that almost blended into the clouds passed over the base at a quick rate of speed ( 100mph?) silently. i saw it for 3 seconds. then it disapeared into the overcast sky's. i did not want to believe what i saw. and nobody else was reporting these sightings, so naturally i thought my imagination got the best of me.\r\n \r\nlast night, saturday morning 33o am the 26th of june, was not overcast, it was a full moon, the skys did have some clouds from the weather south of austin. but the sky was clear when i saw this nights sighting.\r\n \r\ni do not know what this email will achieve unless you receive simular reports from this night. it was at 330am. i do not drink. i work at a bar. i am sober. 5 yrs plus. most poeple at that hour are drunk. austin night life.\r\n \r\nsomeone in aviation had to see that thing. there is spicewood airfeild to the north west. bergstrom airport to the south east. \r\n \r\nthe thing that struck me the most was the distinct triangle shape. \r\n \r\nthere was no light in the center.\r\n \r\njust 3 white lights. 2 lit. 1 blinking.\r\n \r\nctarider\r\ni wish to remain\r\nanonymous \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

around 8:30 and i was enjoying the evening air and watching the stars come out. i was also enjoying a good cigar and a scotch. i'm in the sierra foothills at about 3500'.\r\n\r\nfrom the west came a bright light moving briskly. not super fast, but probably faster than a typical piston engine aircraft. it was twilight and a few stars were starting to become visible. this object was a bright light and i could see no other \"parts\".  it was moving eastward and made no sound. there were no blinking lights and i could see nothing that would indicate an airplane of any sort. it disappeared behind the trees after about 8 seconds so i moved to the front of the house (east). it reappeared from behind the trees and continued on eastward. the light were definitely not a landing light. it remained the same brightness as it approached and as it left. there are no airports in this area. i would guess the altitude to be somewhere between 2000 and 4000 feet.  the neighborhood was pretty quiet and i heard not sound whatsoever. that is why i decided to file this report. \r\n\r\nthe included picture was taken earlier this month during the day. i tried to make it look like twilight, while showing the size of the light. the bottom of the picture is west-southwest. the top left is east-northeast.\r\n\r\ni did not see a \"disk\" shape. just a very bright white light.

the sky. it immediately caught my eye because it was very bright, but appeared--at first--stationary in the sky. it also had no blinking lights like a plane. at first i thought it might be satellite, but i've seen the space station pass by before, and this was not moving across the sky. it was a round ball shape, bright, mostly white but with a reddish/orange hue. it moved slightly, but not in one direction. i went inside to get my wife, and we both saw it, smaller now, but in the same area. we both quickly recognized that it was not a plane, or a fireball, or a satellite. couldn't explain it's movement.\r\nwe looked on the star chart, and it appeared in the area of the constellation bootes.  it was to the south of the lesser star on the right side of arcturus, moving to the south.  it then moved north, passing that star and drawing near coma berenices.  it then turned west, then north again, getting smaller all the time, before finally hooking around to the west (but keeping in the general area of bootes) and disappearing at about 10:35.  \r\nwe heard no sound at all the entire time.  \r\nwhen it first appeared, it looked about the same size as a bb held at arm's length, was about the size of a pinhead at arms length when my wife came out, stayed that approximate size for a minute or two,  and then got progressively smaller until it disappeared. it had a definite round shape, bright but self-contained.  the light was mostly continuous, but just before it disappeared, it seemed to pulsate a little, although we didn't notice a particular pattern.  it was rather like an ember going out, and we had the impression that it was getting further away.  there were no clouds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
