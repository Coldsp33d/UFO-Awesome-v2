very bright light that moved fluidly along at what seemed a low altitude.  it was brighter than the brightest star, and moving too fast to be a satellite or space station, and as fast as is was going had to be lower to the ground than cruising altitude, yet i did not hear a sound.  i see planes coming and going from pdx airport, and though i thought it strange to hear nothing, on a quiet sunday morning, with little traffic or other noise, i wasn't scared as much as facinated.  i called to my partner to come see it, but he was fast asleep.  i didn't want to stop watching it, so i stayed outside and watched it move past, over the course of several minutes.  there were no unusual flight characteristics, such as rapid course corrections or such, just a steady smooth movement across the sky, and i got really confused when i realized that what i thought must be landing lights on a conventional craft, where just as bright after it has passed my position and likewise as it receded in the distance (rear landing lights??) to the east over gresham towards the mountain (hood).  i was not able to capture an image, and only hope that others saw it and will report it.  if the light was jet afterburners, i would have heard something.  the air base at hanford fly over portland occasionally, and you know it - even in the daytime.\r\n\r\ni'm not an aviation expert, but i'm very techno-savvy and grew up across from an airport, and was \"fooled\" by a plane with ad lighting set-up under it when i was a kid.  i know one can be fooled under the right circumstances into thinking you saw a ufo.  this was nothing like that.  solid light, not wavering or shimmering that i could see, just a steady light moving slowly and soundlessly overhead and off to the east.  i called the atc for portland to see if there was anything unusual on their radar, but of course they were unavailable.  i would like to know if it was a known flight or if i am hallucinating!!  it was not a small plane.  it was too low and quiet to be a jet.  no standard aviation lights.  i really don't know what it was, and i'm more than scared that it moved so easily and uncontested almost directly over our home. *(info deleted--sgonzalez/cms. doesn't anyone in government care anymore about our air security?  are these things just accepted as a matter of course?\r\n\r\nplease, please let me know if there

clouds,but just as i was looking a sphere grey in color appears from nowhere under the clouds, i watch it for a few seconds, (the size of a pea at 5 ft away distance wise it was apx 10 miles away, south of me going west.,) as it moved past the clouds into open blue sky, it changed white in color as the sun hit,i also saw like a gold color rim as it changed white. i watch it travel maybe 3 miles past the cloud going west, and as it changed colors it blink and i thought to myself it see's me. just then it disappeared into the blue sky.Well i told my friends they said yeah right. about 1 minute later, still looking at the sky, out of nowhere and father west 12 oclock high, in pure blue sky i see what now looks like a meteorite falling from the sky apx 100,000 ft, it left a short white comtrail, it was falling several thousands of miles per hour,i saw a redish point size of a pixtel, i showed my friend he yelled that aint no jet going that fast, as it was falling it like turned the comtrail on and off then it stayed on, it then seemed to level off and head out towards iowa, we could see it's pure white short comtrail. as we were watching i noticed a brown comtrail so high i couldnt make out what kind of jet it was, chasing after, ufo, but the speed of ufo was several times faster, this lasted about 3 mins until i couldnt see comtrail from ufo i saw it till it faded out

disappeared, when i saw metorite i new it was the orb,and it was getting out of here, then about a minute later jet appears. i think jet was after this thing and was the first comtrail i saw going east, and orb appears, and goes west. under the clouds, while comtrail was well above clouds. orb was apx 5-10 thousand feet high when i saw it. afterwards i tried to evaluate what i saw, and i know

convertible when i got home from work (i work second shift).  the night was fairly warm and we drove with the top down.  there was a large moon a few days from being full and it lit up the sky pretty well and the stars were not very prominent.  i saw a jet airplane at a distance and i mentioned it to my wife.  she said she saw it but she saw another that did not have flashing lights.  she pointed directly over our heads and she said it was a triangle.  i looked up and it was very clearly a large isosolese triangle with glowing  yellow/orange (or rich egg yolk colored)lights at each corner.  the lights were not lights in the usual sense in that they did not seem to project light but radiated it like a hot eye on a stove.  the edges of the light were very distinct and not fuzzy.  the triangle was black and it was seen clearly against the background of the sky.\r\n\r\nthe triangle appeared to be at high altitude (i would guess 20000 feet) and traveling at a speed a little faster than the jet.  there was a fairly large separation between the two but they did seem to be converging.  the jet was making the normal sound but the black triangle did not emit any sound and it seemed to move very smoothly.  we watched the triangle move away from us and i observed the apparent altitude to gauge if it was close to the ground or high as it appeared.  it was at a high altitude and did

continued to watch the triangle and i would glance as i could.  it remained visible for some time and she noticed that it turned to the right (away from the airplane) in a very smooth manner.  she said she saw the orientation of the three lights changed when it turned.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the triangle because of the hills and trees and i checked my watch to get an approximate time of our sighting.\r\n\r\nwe have no doubt about what we saw and we do not care if anyone believes us.  we would be interested to know if anyone else saw it.\r\n\r\nwe had no apprehension when we saw it.  it was not an airplane.  we hope this information is helpful.

have to admit i hesitated because i didn't want to lose sight of it, i went inside the house to get my mother.  i wanted her to confirm what i was seeing.  she came outside, and sure enough, it was still traveling in the same area i had left it.  my mom could see it too.  neither of us could think of what it might be.  often we've looked toward the sky and noticed planes overhead.  but at the distance they fly above, they look like little bleeping lights.  \r\n\r\nwhat we saw, was not a commercial airliner.\r\n\r\neventually, after we watched for a minute longer, the object continued to travel in line of the river toward lucasville until it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy discription in depth:\r\nimagine an apple core. the top and the bottom flared out... the middle area, i imagine must have been spinning quickly around the apple core axis, because it was slightly lighter in color.\r\nas it began to fade off into the distance, it would blink blues and reds...Or more

of our sighting. also numerous jets flying into the nj and ny airports were going about their business. being a friday night, air traffic was heavy. however, all this activity didn't seem to deter this orb. this may sound strange.....It seems to want to be seen. we have noticed that our six year old australian cattle dog has been extremely anxious for the past few nights. she pants alot even though we have air conditioning on. her anxiety begins before we even go outside. if i bring her out with me she keeps running into the woods as if on chase. she comes back after a couple mins. even

characteristic of a typical sighting.  we were experiencing a typical florida downpour with some occasional thunder and lightning, but nothing out of the ordinary.  i'm not really sure whether we had lost power at this point as things got a little out of the ordinary.  i was sitting in our living room with my family and we all heard a loud humming noise that carried with it a certain vibration indicative of a powerful energy source.  it sounded like a transformer humming, but much, much louder.  the sound lasted about 10 seconds and happened 3 or 4 times and was coming from what seemed to be directly outside the south side of our house.  our house is nowhere near a transformer.  from where we sat during this, we were two rooms away from the exterior of the south side of our house, about 30 feet away.  as the humming noise began again, i finally decided to walk to a room closer to the sound.  keep in mind it's summer around 6:45pm, so there was plenty of light outside, even though the storm had darkened it a bit.  this room has blinds on the windows and as i approached the window the humming was still happening, but what was so odd, and the main reason for me posting this is, even with it being daylight, a bright bluish, neon looking light was being generated somewhere very close to the exterior of our house with such an intensity that it overpowered the natural light and created a bluish glow that shined through the cracks in the window blinds.  it's almost as if it was dark outside and a car pulled up outside the window, shining it's headlights into the window.  i pulled the blinds to the side and saw a powerful blue glow coming from the side of my house.  the window i viewed it from did not have a direct view of the light source, but i did see it emanating around the corner.  my house is a couple hundred feet from power lines, but they are in the opposite direction from where the light was coming from.  looking out the south facing window, the power lines are approximately 200 feet to the west and this light was definitely coming from the south east side of my house.  the light source appeared to be generated within feet of the exterior of my house and couldn't have been more than 5 feet off the ground.  there were no lightning strikes taking place while the humming noise and lights occurred, so i know it wasn't lightning.  we don't have a transformer next to our house.  the only thing over there is my ac unit.  after the storm passed, i walked out there and there was no evidence anything had happened, and my ac was undamaged.  i've lived in florida most of my life and have seen some serious storms, but never, never have i seen a sustained blue glowing light shine through my window.  with the amount of energy it must have taken to generate that light, i expected to either have major electrical damage or at least have black marks on my house, but there was nothing.  by far one of the oddest experiences i've ever had.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23958,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6592844,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06262010-0006","longitude":-82.3206062,"occurred":1277449200000,"potentialRelations":[23928],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1277541986000,"summary":"Blue

food going on the stove and my boyfriend decided that he was going to go outside and have a cigarette. he asked if i would come outside with him and i told him i was going to clean some of the dishes instead. about after a minute of him being outside he cracked the front door open and told me i needed to come out and look at something. a second after that he repeated himself and said that i needed to come out right at that moment and to come look at what he was seeing. i said \"okay, okay i'm coming!\" and ran out the door. as i stepped outside my boyfriend was looking straight to the sky and was pointing upward and told me to look. \r\n at first i thought it was a really bright star but then saw that it was moving and just immediately thought it was a jet. right after that i saw the object in the sky did not have a stream line behind it, no blinking lights, and that it was moving at a very very fast speed-much faster than any jet could ever be. it looked like a star except it looked much larger and brighter than anything else in the sky and after another moment of examining it you could see that the object had three separate lights on it. i then ran back to the house and opened the door and yelled for my sister to come outside immediately.\r\n she ran out to see what the commotion was. as we watched the object flying through the sky we saw that it started to change course and started to curve to our left towards the north east coming from the west. while it was doing this the bright sphere's light pulsated to the point where it was so dim you almost lost sight of it but then became bright again right away. we could also tell that while the object was shifting course it was ascending upwards. the lights pulsated again and i decided to run into the house  to grab my cell phone to see if i could capture any documentation. i came back out and my sister told me that the lights on the craft completely had went out and came back on when i got back outside. after another moment the lights pulsated again until it eventually disappeared into the sky. mind you it was not that we lost sight of it through the tree line or anything it just disappeared into the sky at approximately 10:16 p.M. \r\n this is the first real sighting i have ever had. when i realized that this object was not a star or a plane my adrenaline was pulsing and it felt as if my heart was going to pound through my chest. a part of me was amazed and another part of me was frightened that it was going to turn back around. i was quit in shock to be honest. my boyfriend was shocked, amazed, and kind of excited about the sighting. my sister rather was very scared and somewhat emotional about the whole experience. i am not the type of person to just jump to conclusions but i know is that this was not a human object nor was it a star so what else could it have been???","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

the headlights of an oncoming plane. it was slowing coming towards my position, getting bigger and bigger. i heard no noise. i was waiting for it to go past me to hear the engine noise and to see what exactly it was. i got my camera and was able to take several pictures. once it flew over me, i heard nothing and also all i was able to see was still a bright orange ball fly past silently. there was no apparent plane, helicopter, or any aircraft shape. i felt scared. i never have seen anything like this. the orange ball continued to fly in the same path when it made an angular direction change. it looked like an 40 degree angle up. it wasn't a slow change, it was an instant change of direction. it was the kind of direction change you see in video games. after that it just disappeared as it ascended up. since then, i have seen the same thing on 4/29/09 @ 10:13pm and on 6/10/10 @ 10:07pm. the first two pictures are from the 4/22/09 incident. the last picture is from the 4/29/09 incident. i zoomed in a lot on the 4/22/09 pictures. i didn't zoom in on the 4/29/09 picture. notice the angular shape of the 4/22/09 pictures! i was amazed when i looked at them, after the

went dim and bright and then by the time i really realized it was a ufo and told my cousin to look it vanished. we stayed there for awhile and i saw a \"plane\" move nw. it stopped in flight and disappeared. my cousin barely missed it again. then after it got dark and a lengthy deep conversation, we got up and got ready to leave. while i was telling a story, my cousin said he saw what appeared to be an object fly through the trees just beyond the field we were at. he said it looked like it found a clearing, flew through it and took off. there were red and white lights that seemed to be spinning. we got out of there pretty quick. this was the 2nd time i have seen one in this area and it was with the same person.

the valley.  it looks out in an e/ne direction.  i was smoking, looking at the moon.  there was a litle haze, and some partial/light clouds.  i could see most of the brighter stars, the dipper, etc., and planes were visible on their normal flight routes.  \r\n\r\nwhen i turned back towards the hills, i saw a light orange object, planet-like, next to the hill, about 20 degrees above the horizon.  i was surprised, because i hadn't noticed it before.  it wasn't in the right place to be a planet, but that's what it appeared to be.  there was a jet flying along its normal approximate s/n route, which passes a little more than thumbs width above the hill.  \r\n\r\ni watched it for a bit, because it seemed out of place, and my wife has seen orange balls doing erratic things in the sky on several occasions at night over the last few years.  i watched it for a minute or so, and it didn't seem to move at all. i thought that maybe i was wrong, as it had a slightly wavering quality, like a twinkling star, and i began to think it really was a planet, and i was off my bearings.  \r\n\r\ni bent over to pet the cat, and when i looked back up, i could swear it had moved a bit to the right.  i thought maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me, so i stood perfectly still and took a bearing off of the hill, my van and the tree next to it.  after a bit, i was sure it was slowly moving to the right. \r\n\r\nat this point, it stopped, and over maybe 2-3 seconds, it dramatically increased in size and brilliance.  it had a flux quality as it increased in brightness. not like a strobe, but wavering, as it rapidly increased in brilliance.  it grew to about the size of a matchhead held at arms length, maybe slightly smaller, and it was roughly the brightness of the moon, maybe a bit brighter.  i started to wonder if it was some sort of flare, but it didn't hold the peak intensity but maybe a second or two, then declined at the same rate as it had increased, returning to its original appearance and luminosity.\r\n\r\nafter returning to its original state, it changed direction, going back to the left, and it sped up.  it appeared to be moving at a similar rate to the jets that routinely pass over.  as it moved away, i started to wonder again if it was an aircraft, because i could make out a dim blinking light.  it passed behind the hill, and i didn't see it again.  over the next 45 minutes, i saw several jets pass over on their regular routes, but nothing else strange.\r\n\r\nthe only thing i can even remotely think off that would explain what i saw is some sort of helicopter.  that would explain the stationary positioning and the change in directions.  but for most of the sighting, it appeared to be a single orangish light.  i didn't hear any engine noise or rotors.  it doesn't explain the rapid increase in size and brightness.  it didn't seem to be the right color for a spotlight, and it didn't switch on and switch off.  it scaled up and back down in intensity.  i didn't see any beam or sweeping light, and it seemed to be too high for a spotlight search.  unless it was some sort of lamp that slowly powers up to maximum and back down again, and they only had it on for a few seconds, coincidentally pointed in exactly my direction, i can't explain what it did.\r\n\r\ni see several planes pass over on regular routes, and we have helicopters that sometimes pass over on route to medical facilities, checking utilities (though not at night), and i've seen some choppers searching with spotlights, which i assume are law enforcement.  i even get the occasional low flying double rotor chopper teams flying over late at night, but i've never seen anything similar to what i saw tonight.\r\n\r\nit was strange enough i thought i should report it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

slightly faster than a plane, but had not other lights on it. it drifted slightly to my right, then back to my left. it's non-linear light made me realize it wasn't a plane or a meteor. i watched it go over a tree and continue north. the crazy part of this experience is that i yelled at it to stop - and it did. it held still for about 15 to 20 seconds. it sort of came back towards me, then slowly disappeared. another strange thing was that the while the light was visible, and for several minutes afterwards, there wasn't a single mosquito around me, which is really rare since they are thick right now and i can't be in my backyard without getting several bites every minute. it was truly the most amazing thing i've ever experienced.
