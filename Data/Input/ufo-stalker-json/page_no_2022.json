not help watching all the airline traffic going by as i watched the stars. that night there was an odd white light cutting through the tree line and landed just above the garage roof next door which is next to our yard. i dont know what the source of this light was but i have never seem  white light basically in our yard like this. a vertical white line cutting through the trees and ending. it may be nothing  but i am including it because the other lights that appeared in a very spectacular way were seen right in this lights line.\r\n\r\nas i was sitting - i observed red balls of light coming from the west in a low and straight line. the balls of light (several) every couple minutes maybe 5 to ten minutes came in as a single ball of red light. there was no noise and no faa navigation lights. the balls of light were pinkred and seemed to be glowing internally and not throwing off a light. these lights when they got to certain point started moving upward and then they started descending back down behind the tree line. these lights also got smaller to disappearing for a second or so - to then getting bigger. i watched this for a couple of times and minutes.\r\n\r\nafter a couple of times of watching this and the pattern of these lights coming in and ascending and descending. i saw the lights going behind the tree but after that i could not see what or where they went. about a minute or two later i see this very bright light in the tree very low to the ground by the neighbor across the street to the north in front of me. at first i assumed it must of been the darn kids or a big truck with led headlights. but since this house is across from my yard - again -i have never even seen a car headlight or any other light coming from there. this light just got brighter and slowly moved up inside this tree. as it moved up it got bigger. when it got to the top of the tree all i could see was a huge white glare of light. it just hovered and then it turned itself on to what looked like a giant headlight from a old car with some sort of chrome surrounding it. it got scared and was ready to pee in my pants when this object started coming right towards me while i was sitting on the patio chair. i was in awe when this light came right over my head to the top of the evergreen tree next to me which is just above the roof of line the house. as this light came over it also turned on what looked like someone slapped a 2x4 on each side of this light in a v. on each side of this huge headlight on this v were lights of green maybe 8 in a row. the same on the other side but the lights were red. the lights once they turned on never blinked they were stationary. as it came above me i saw a body to this object it was a pale pearly green. there were no lights on the end or side of this object.\r\n\r\nafter - this event i sat there in shock. as i was about to get up and go check out the area i see in front of me facing north in my yard just above the utility lines a object or light that was shaped in a triangle made up of not a solid object but small triangle objects that formed this. it appeared out of nowhere and it was like it materialized right in front of me. at this time this white light i had mentioned in the trees was still there and this object was lined right up to the tip of this light. when it got to the tip of the light i lit up like a purple silver color. it went into the tree where the light was coming. again - no noise, no other lights . nothing.\r\n\r\nafter a while after this - maybe 1/2 hour or so - the red balls of light started up again. doing the exact same thing. this time someone came home and witnessed these balls of light too. went back in around 11:30pm.\r\n\r\n

traveling west to east directly in front of me. what caught my attention was it had no vapor trail. i watched as it moved behind a high thin cloud (partially cloudy sky with mostly thin wispy clouds) and it stopped moving forward.  this really stirred my curiosity so i continued watching it. the cloud moved from in front of it it stood still for at least 30 sec. and then it began climbing at a right angle to its previous direction (up and to the west). the object moved slower than an airliner and slowly got smaller until i could no longer see it. later that day i observed an airliner in about the same area of the sky and observed that it did leave a vapor trail and was traveling just above the clouds at about the same alttitude as  the object. what really struck me was the difference in size of the airliner and the object i had seen earlier.  i would have to estimate the size of the unknown object as at least 10 times the size of a commercial airliner. while watching the airliner i observed that as it moved away from me it appeared to move in a downward direction due to the curvature of the earth whereas the unidentified object moved up and to the left (west) as it grew smaller confirming that it was gaining altitude as if faded away.\r\nthe object was metallic in appearance and was possible cigar shaped, as it changed direction i didn���t see any wings like you would see on a banking airline.The full impact of what i saw didn���t really register until i observed the jetliner later that day and confirmed that what i saw didn���t resemble it in either size or

like object at a low astitude. i am sure we probably saw the same thing. i live 10 mins. drive from the delaware water gap. i don't know where in nj this was witnessed. at any rate, on the 23rd i saw at least 4 of these. 1 low, the other 3 very highe up. last night, the 24th, i witnessed at least 12 of these strange floating orbs of light. once again, there was  1 that was much lower. this time it was traveling n to s. as far as speed is concerned, i would say they travel at least as fast as jets. yesterday morning a huge helicopter went over my property. it followed the exact path of the lower orb. interesting. last night while observing these objects a small plane came by very low and moving very slowly. got the eerie feeling that this is all connected. i should add that some of these orbs can only be seen with binoculars. others can be seen with the naked eye. if i didn't look up with binoculars, i wouldn't ever know they were there. if not for fatigue and a very sore neck causing me to finally go indoors, i feel i could probably watch these things all night. these orbs are silent, and definitely not anything conventional or familiar. i've been a sky watcher for most of my 49 years and have seen other ufos. none like the ones i've been seeing for the past couple of months. i simply don't know what they are. but, i do know what they aren't. doubtful that i'm seeing 12 satillites in a period of an hour and a half! sorry for the typos, but, i'm trying to get this reported while it is fresh in my mind, and before the business of everyday life distracts me as it should. it's easy to become obsessed with this when youv'e seen some of the things i've seen all my life, but in particular the last 10 years. i am already in contact with one of your investigators about my sightings. felt the need to report the events of the last two nights on line for all who are seeing strange things in our night skies. for those who say, \"why don't the ufos just show themselves to everyone!\". they are. you just have to look. from my mountainside

where in pilot training.No flying that night, gca (ground approch control) called me on hot line to tell me that there was something unusual on his gca scope 10 miles southwest of williams afb , he was picking up some sort of object which was being painted on his scope. so the ops officer and i checked with all agencys such as artc sectors working area around williams afb. they said no traffic flying in my area. then i called flight service station at sky harbor airport, they said nothing flying in our area too. it was very intersting that no agencys where picking up on radar except our gca unit. the ops officer and i went out to the gca unit ourselfs to see in on the gca scope.When we got to gca unit out on the field we could see this sphere round in shape glowing yellow/white color 10 miles to the southwest of williams afb. it was floating just obove the horizon in line of sight. then went into gca unit and observed it on the gca scope. at 10 miles it just glowed on the target being painted by the scope when the scope was on the back side of scope or dark side of scope, there was so much energy coming form object it would light up the bca scoup every time it pulsated its energy. true fact the gca officer on duty that night saw it ops officer saw it and i saw it. went back to base ops and command post called me to ask what was up i explained to them what was happing the commmand post was getting civilian calls wanting to know about see this object. inturn said to the public don't know. i guess the commanding  officer of williams afb told command post to tell us not speak to media or outside sources or we would be court martialed. faa flight service station called me back on the landline and told me that a few of the guys went to the top of faa building roof

road that skits the so. edge of the \"hill\" country, (rocky hummocks & small hills) to the north, & relatively flat farming to the south. the rocky hills to my left were perhaps 150-200' in elevation. \r\n      late for a date in dallas, i was traveling about 75-80 mph when i noticed a glowing orb about the size of a soccer ball, liesurely 'bounceing' down a ravine towards the road.(about 200yds from it). each bounce took it about 15 or twenty feet into the air, landing about 75' from the previous touchdown point. this course put it approx. 2-3 sec. away from collision w/my truck, & i remember thinking 'im going to nail that sucker\". too late to alter course i thought 'there's something wrong here\". at that time, plastic &glass 'gazer' garden balls were popular & those were my first thought in re: to 'nailing' it. it was a steady, glowing orb,white to reddish @the center & red to yellow @ the outer edge. it's last mortal bounce came just towards the center of my underframe, and it seemed to strike the a frame. the collision sound was that of a few breaking wine glasses. i immediately stopped @ backed up to the point of impact, got out & started looking for pieces. and i.Looked for 35 minutes, 2-300' either way, under the hood, all in the a-frames, entire under-structure, & nothing, no piece,shards, slivers, nothing.\r\n     to get to my moment of indesision, it bounced much like a helium balling, low on gas, would. #1. helium wouldn't lift one of those plastic or glass balls, @ the glass variety certainly wouldn't have survived the rocky terrain, but the why the ' tinkle,tinkle' sound on impact? being mid summer i could attribute the glowing as sun reflection from my back, but it glowed much more strongly than what you'd expect from a reflection. if it was man made material,  where did the pieces go?\r\n     i've talked to a few (very few) people since, including a physisist, a none could offer anything other than ball lightning.  (ok, but why the 'tinkle, tinkle??)  i don't expect to ever get a complete answer, but i would like to know of any similar cases. the only one close i know of was in england, famously videoed, but nothing involving collision.\r\nplease get back to me if you have any light to shed. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23921,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.3504838,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06242010-0009","longitude":-97.3805637,"occurred":369964800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1277426762000,"summary":"Glowing, bouncing, orb.
