line rd, i looked to my left towards the mountains/west as i crossed c470 and saw a bright light in the sky over the ken carl area/direction. as i made a left/west on county line rd i got real excited and stopped the car for around 6 seconds and watched the light. it stayed stationary and pulsated from a white-ish blue to nothing to a white then to a light blue to nothing then so on and so forth in that similar pattern. sometimes the blue would show, sometimes it would not and sometimes the blue would flicker. now out here, there is a flight pattern coming from the south west over the rockies heading north east towards dia, and that is the fist thing i check for to see if it is moving like the jets/planes and it stayed still/stationary as i reached santa fe dr.\r\n\r\nthe positioning of the light was above and to the left of spica and porrima in the virgin constellation and saturn was below and to the right of virgin and the moon and mars were below the horizon. \r\n\r\nas i reached santa fe dr i stopped at the yield sign to see if the light was moving. it was in the same place, not moving, and still pulsating. i turned right/north and immediately contacted a friend who lived north east of county line rd and santa fe dr, which i knew would also have a good view from the back of his house. he confirmed the sighting and described to me what i was seeing as i traveled slower than the speed limit down santa fe keeping an eye on the object when i could. by the time i reached bowles ave the light appeared to be slowly getting smaller/heading straight towards and over the mountains directly west.\r\n\r\nit took about three minutes to park the car, run inside, and grab a pair of binoculars. as i ran to a good view point, which took about 2 minutes, i asked my friend who was still on the phone if it was still there and he said it was, so i got off the phone and started to look for the light and it was gone. there were a lot of bright city lights around the intersection, but this light/object was way brighter than the virgin constellation, and i could clearly see the virgin constellation with no problem.\r\n\r\na few days ago the subject came up when i was talking to my friend and he said ethe object was moving west and then what looked like it just dropped out of the sky and disappeared. no explosion, no nothing. the light went out as it dropped and was gone.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

but this time i had my two sons with me. as we reached the top of a hill on fm56, i noticed a very bright, slow moving, circular/round object in the northern sky. due to this road being very dangerous without any safe areas to pullover, i decided to travel to a known location where i could overlook the field of interest where these lights seemed to be orbiting. as i was traveling to this area, each hilltop allowed me to take a quick glance to my right and see this object still illuminating. it took me nearly 5 mins to reach my \"lookout point\" on star hollow rd and w.D. ct in lipan. when i reached this point i noticed it was very dim, but after a few minutes the same bright light reappeared fully. it was moving west from the weatherford area toward the mineral wells area. from my position the craft was operating 25*-30* above the horizon. weatherford is 25nm from this position and the light was near the 20nm mark from me. of course, this is all based on an educated guess, using an aeronautical sectional map and some simple mathematics. my two sons were so intrigued with the experience we all were sharing and even the 10 yr old said to me, \"that's not normal\". i agreed and at that point decided i better grab some pictures with my slr camera before this one gets away. i had time to take one picture before it disappeared. within seconds after it vanished i noticed one, maybe two fighter jets traveling very fast toward the area where the lights where located. they traveled toward the mineral wells area, maybe further then i lost site of them. i thought at one point i noticed the ufo reappear out past mineral wells area, but i am unsure what i saw at that point... it was just a flash. my two sons and i began our journey home, another 3 miles or so, and never saw the lights again. the one picture i did capture is pretty interesting to view since i have never taken a picture of anything similar to this before. i feel 100% positive it was not a commercial airliner on approach to dfw or any other airports nearby. like my other sighting, i had to rule out all other possibilities (ifo's) before deciding to submit this sighting to mufon. i still feel this is a government operation of some kind. i called a friend of mine who lives in the area where i feel this occurred and he did say at 10pm or so he heard a helicopter, very low altitude, and a jet of some kind. he actually lives in between weatherford and azle. his conformation of jets/helicopters go hand in hand with the time frame i witnessed the aircraft show up and the ufo disappearing from eyesight. so... here we go again, eyes to the skies!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

going in for the night.  upon standing there on the curb, i was looking up at the sky watching the numerous planes fly overhead on their way to/from new york in all likelyhood.  i noticed a ball of light appear over the treeline approaching from the west and traveling east.  at first glance i naturally assumed it was a a headlight on an airliner.  however, i could tell as it inched closer that this light was not accompanied by any tell-tale faa blue and red flashing lights.  in addition, this light was not projecting in front of the object as a headlight would, but rather shining like a star.  i could hear planes flying overhead but noticed this particular object had no discernable audible sound of it's own, nor did it seem to have any actual wings, tale, helicopter blades, engines rotors or any other shape or parts for that matter.  it was just a bright shingin light. in fact, as it flew overhead near the end of the minute to two minute event, a plane flew underneath it at much lower altitude (apparantly coming in for a landing at newark, laguardia or jfk) on a perpendicular path traveling in a southerly direction.  it was quite obvious that these two objects were not similar in any way other than they were both passing overhead at the same particular moment. the object was flying at a relatively low altitude (i would assume 1000-3000 feet) and traveling on a seemingly unnatural perfectly straight path as it disappeared in the night sky over the treeline, into the clouds, on the opposite side of street.  it was way too low in the sky (and it was obviously within the inner atmosphere) to lead me to think it was a cosmic event. i would approximate the speed at a few hundred miles per hour, but let's just say it was traveling slowly enough to watch it for a good one to two full minutes.  while i have seen other things in the sky before on multiple occassions in multiple places, i found this object to be different in that it was just simply there.  i have never submitted anything to mufon before. it didn't seem like it was trying to hide or evade being seen.  if it was, it was doing a poor job.  it almost felt as if it wanted me to see it.  i've lived here my entire life.  long enough to know that what i saw was not a plane, helicopter or any other aircraft i have ever seen. as i stated before.  it had a consistent eminating star like quality (with no tail or trail), had no discernable audible sound that could be specifically attributed to it, and it had no tell-tale flashing faa required lights.  definitely an odd sighting.  i just wish it would have stopped so i could get my packed up camera to capture it on hd video.  sorry i don't have any evidence to provide you.  but i can say this...Planes that fly over new jersey, for the most part, are either coming in for a landing or taking off.  you hear them, you see them and you know what they are.  objects flying into the clouds from the west traveling over manhatten on a path east are on a suspicious path over the atlantic without having made a layover transition either in new jersey or in manhatten.  furthermore a plane on a transatlantic non-stop flight coming from the west would not be dropping to such a low altitude then rising again in a high air traffic are such as this unless it was planning on stopping for gas or switching flights or flight crews. definitely strange.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

i witnessed this ufo that i now call the moon of memphis. i had a good memory of the event so that when i was trained in the air force as a navigator, i was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience. i estimate that the moon of memphis was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size. i developed this information from watching the ascent of the moon of memphis through some high cirrus clouds that i estimate was at sixty thousand feet. at twenty thousand feet it would have taken four 747 aircraft parked in a circle to cover the area of the moon of memphis ufo, thus creating a ten acre size estimate. when i saw it above me, it was exactly the size of the real moon when seen high in the sky.\r\n\r\ni believe the moon of memphis ufo was a sign from god. when you take a through z and match it with 1 through 26, you can add up the letters of a word and get a sum number. for example israel adds up to 64, which made me think that the 1664 moon of memphis ufo had religious significance. where the moon of memphis came from or how it was created, was certainly a unique phenomenon of divine origin and purpose. it's appearence in 1964 suggest religious intellect.\r\n\r\nfrom voices, visions, and dreams that i experienced thirty three years later, i believe it had a message for humanity. it wanted humanity to be more reverent to all living beings respected more. before animals are killed, they should recieve anathesia and be put into an unwakeable sleep. anything less is cruel, heartless, and unreverent to that being and god. maybe humanity will find a way to eat without killing animals, but until then, we must not kill an animal while it is awake. treat innocent animals as you would like to be treated if you were in their place. the moon of memphis is proof that god does exist and we should obey his wish for us to be more kind to each living being.\r\n\r\n[cms/tg/pid]\r\ncapt usaf / lt uscg retired \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

observing the moon low over the horizon, describing to a friend how to photograph it during the upcoming full moon.\r\nafter quite a few minutes, we turned to head back to the house, located opposite where we were standing, to the east-northeast.\r\ni scanned across the sky as i often do, pointing out various constellations to my friend.\r\nlooking almost directly overhead, an extremely bright flash appeared suddenly and hovered for a moment.  i looked around to assure myself that it was not a bright star, noted the locations of sirius and saturn, which were two of the brightest objects visible in the sky at the time, and then turned my gaze back upward to directly overhead.\r\nthe bright object did not have any flashing lights, but was a solid circular/spherical light.  i have observed many many satellites, the iss, and other celestial objects and know full well the difference between planets/stars/satellites/iss/meteorites/etc.  this was most definitely not any of those types of objects.\r\nthe object then began to move quite quickly across the sky to the northeast.  it moved faster than any plane or satellite i've ever seen.  from directly overhead, it traversed to approximately a 45-degree angle from my viewing location in about 30-45 seconds.\r\nthe object then slowed, and changed course, moving not along it's original path (which would have tipped me off that perhaps it was the iss or a particularly bright satellite, but no) but suddenly to the direct east - in a horizontal fashion.\r\nit then sped up again, and at this moment, it went from a bright white circular object moving sideways (north to east) to a more elliptical object, which changed in hue and tone form a blue tinge to more of a reddish-orangish and dimmer.  it then started to descend directly down toward the horizon, but then pulsed momentarily in its brightness, and moved directly vertically back up from the horizon.  it paused for a moment, pulsed again, changed hue back to the blue-ish brighter tone/color, and then began descending slowly.\r\nas it descended, it turned again toward a dimmer color.  the last thing i saw prior to it dropping behind the tree-line out of my view was it again getting much brighter.\r\nat its brightest, the object was easily 2-3 times brighter than venus when it's at it's brightest low over the horizon.  i looked around the sky for other stars/objects to compare the brightness to, but could find nothing that was even close - it was many many times brighter and larger in diameter than the brightest object in the sky at the time.  at arm's length, with my hand held out holding my fingers together to try and judge size, it filled a 1cm gap between my fingers.\r\nthe entire time it took to traverse the sky was approximately 3-5 minutes.  the first movements from directly overhead to about 45-degrees took 30-45 seconds. the slow movements following this quick initial movement lasted for a few minutes longer in total.\r\nwe thought of running into the house to grab a camera, but as it was very very dark there was not likely a good way to capture it, and unfortunately it began to move so fast that we would not have had time before it was gone from our view.\r\nduring the entire event, there seemed to be an electrical energy in the air.  no sound in particular, but more of a sensation, not unlike the feeling of static electricity upon one's skin.  both i and my friend had goosebumps over our entire bodies and yet felt a particular warmth despite it being 54f outside at the time.\r\n\r\nthis is but one of many recent sightings that has occurred and that i have witnessed in the past three weeks.  there have been many more but none so clear as this.\r\n","distance":"Over One

told me it had moved and pointed in a nne direction.  i spotted it, but now it was a small light with what appeared to be a strobe, at about 50,000 ft, so i immediately thought it was an airplane, but that does not explain how it crossed the entire sky in a blink, with no vapor trail. but as i watched this light it just disappeared, gone, no trace anywhere, completely clear skies. it did occur to me to be the aurora, however, there were no sonic booms and that would not explain an extremely bright light.  this was extremely puzzling and scared my wife.  oddly enough, on the ride home, traveling sse i spotted a red blinking light to the left of the moon, which was about 3/4 full.  i thought it was odd because airplanes will have a white strobe, not red.  again, this caught my attention and i was in a position to study it, and once again, it just vanished.  out in the water, the sky was huge and completely clear, and this light was just gone.","distance":"Over One

south/souteast of watkins glen when i noticed a large circular hole formation in the clouds.  the background light made the edge of the circle very distinct, and out of the entire area of the hole hung a gauzy, vaporous mass of stringy clouds.  this vapor converged at a point about the distance of its radius below it. \r\n\r\nthe clouds in the sky were fairly low-altitude clouds, and as i was walking along and watching this, i reasoned that it couldn't be a tornado or a whirlwind of some sort, because the strings were not spinning or twisted.  and, it couldn't be rain, because it came to a point like a cone (though not a perfect one) hanging from the clouds.  my first thought was of a report i saw on line recently of probably the same thing where in russia and china people took pictures on their cell phones of a very similar thing (except for these curious stringy vapors reaching down).  \r\n\r\ni watched it for my entire walk, which lasted about 25 minutes, and it held it's shape for just about the entire time. as it drifted from west to east, the vapors remained in a funnel shape under the hole, but the point seemed to be trailing off to the west/nortwest direction towards the southern end of seneca lake.  eventually, it started to lose it's consistency and the vapor trail stretched farther and got thinnner, but the spot where it was in the sky did not convert to the same cloud type as those around it, and seems like it was having a hard time filling back in with similar surrounding clouds.\r\n\r\ni went in the house and told my wife about it and how it looked like the pictures i'd seen on-line of similar circular clouds.  i'd wanted to get my neighbor to come out and see it, while i was walking past his house, but it looked like he wasn't home, and i didn't want to lose sight of it. i never thought it would happen within a half a mile of my house!  \r\n\r\nfinally, it wasn't until this morning when i thought that, perhaps the vapors were not drifting down from the hole in the clouds, but being drawn up into it!  the actually didn't seem to descend or ascend, but were quite stationary.  i don't have a cell phone or a digital camera or i might have caught a picture!!!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23888,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3852587,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06222010-0005","longitude":-76.8699821,"occurred":1277174700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
