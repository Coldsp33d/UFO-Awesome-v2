its entrance into the bedroom, it hovered in front of the foot of the bed going right to left. i could see its glow cast just below the foot before it had emerged into sight. it then proceeded to come back and make a turn around the right front portion of the bed and slowly approached me along the right side of the bed still hovering/spinning approximately 3-4 inches off the floor. as it made its way to just below where i was sitting watching it, it ascended up to my level.\r\n  at this point i was paralyzed with terror, i could not scream or move. i lost all consciousness and never had another experience like it again. i have no memory of what occurred after that, what it was, or why it was there.\r\n  13 years later, when i was 18, the experience came up in conversation between mom and i somehow, and i learned it was not just a dream. she had the exact, identical experience, same description, and same outcome as i did. since then, we have been completely at a loss for an explanation of what it was. we have been trying to find other���s with the same experience/sighting. i have a feeling it may have been some type of alien drone or probe, for it wasn���t much like a ghost or apparition. i have read about hundreds of e.T. and ufo sightings, but nothing is described to like what my mother and i witnessed. \r\n    i have had only one actual, ���typical��� ufo sighting since that thing in the bedroom.  in february, 1994, at  ft.  leonardwood, mo.  between the hours of 10:00 & 11:00, on a clear day, there was a silver, diamond-shaped ufo in the sky moving in all sorts of sharp angular directions, and traveling from one end of the sky to the other in just fractions of a second, which must have been at least 200 miles ground distance. i had no other witnesses, but i was fully coherent and aware of what i was witnessing. it was visible for maybe about a minute, and it took off and disappeared from sight.\r\n  i have no question about the ufo sighting in missouri, for it seems to be like one of thousands of accounts. but nothing compares to the mechanical-cylindrical object that both my mother and i witnessed on different occasions without knowledge of each other���s experience of it. i would love to know if anyone has an idea of what it really was, what its purpose was, and why only my mother and i had the experience with it. to this day, i���m baffled but open to any explanation.\r\n\r\n \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

total there were three of us. we were just west of calgary, alberta camping in a private area along the elbow river. the walk to the river was ten to fifteen minutes from where we set up camp. around 2am we decided to go for a walk to the river so we grabbed head lamps, a lantern and my friend's dog and headed towards the river. the walk from the camp to the river is spent walking through trees and thick brush 95% of the way to the river.  the sky was unbelievable clear that night and we could see so many stars from horizon to horizon. once clear of the brush we had a huge view of the sky. we noticed many satellites overhead and discussed trying to find out when the space station was flying overhead that night. the river had about 2 meters of fog on top of it and it was quite cool outside. the dog was not acting strange in any way, he seemed content to take a step or two into the river and then continue to meander around. all three of us were looking towards the sky but in slightly different directions, enough to cover at least 65% of the visible sky. it was very quiet when a pulse of light, the like of which i have never seen appeared to encompass us. it was quiet bizarre. it was as if there were an epicenter (like when you drop a pebble in a pond) right above us. the light wave moved away from the epicenter in all direction, 360 degrees. it was white and very intense. it was very strange because of the visible physical properties of it. it made it look as though the entire atmosphere was moved like a wave through water and it definitely had a 3d look to it. i currently study the properties of light in physics and radiology which made it clear to me immediately, that because of the 3d wave like nature of this event that it was some kind of strange occurrence or anomaly. the part i want to stress the most is the 3d water wave like nature of this light and the fact that it was directly over our heads. we felt odd after the pulse happened and when we returned to the camp we all felt a little different. from this point on we stayed in and around the camp for the night and around 10am we returned to the river to recover the dogs leash. we sat around for a bit but all three of us felt odd and we returned to the camp and relaxed in the sun for the afternoon. at no point do any of us recall seeing an object that could be distinguished from a satellite, and we only saw one plane fly overhead but it was before the pulse and it was very clearly an international flight heading away from calgary. no noises were heard at any point before, during or immediately after the pulse.  that is about all i can think of at this time. thanks for taking the

air below our neighbours tree line (<40 feet high). it was large - nabout 3 feet in diameter. \r\n\r\nat first i thought it was fireworks debris but there were no ashes trailing from it. i was worried that it was going to crash into one of the houses behind us and start a fire,  i was going to call the fire dept. but after observing it for a while - it was obviously moving on its own  - it didn't move the way you would expect burning debris to move.   \r\n\r\nthen i thought it was a chinese lantern on fire, but this was very close - approx. 50 feet away and was no lantern. it was not open at the bottom.  it was not perfectly round either, it was like a ball of orange gas with an irregular surface - i could see small flames all over the surface. it was totally silent. when my husband and i came out and saw it - it was traveling eastwards very slowly and at a slight downwards motion, but my daughter thinks it came down from the sky as it was descending when she first spotted it.  this would explain why more people didn't report it.\r\n\r\nit \"floated\" for about 7 seconds (traveling about 50 ft) then it turned (about 200 degrees) to clear the large group of trees (i.E. to go around the trees).  when it got to the back of the neighbours yard it took off in a straight line at a greater speed (30 mph?) in between 2 houses.  we knew we couldn't follow it as it was going too fast now.  it was definitely burning some kind of fuel but what gas burns this tangerine orange colour? \r\n\r\nthis was seen in a very densely populated urban neighbourhood.  i think it may be some experiment in alternative energy (fuels).  but i have no idea what it was.  apparently lots of people are seeing these orange orbs but no one knows what they are.\r\n\r\nwe didn't get photos, too bad

tube-shaped object with rounded ends.  studying it for about a minute through binoculars, i was sure it was not a helicopter or aircraft.  it lacked wings, propellers, engines, lights, landing gear, windows, and it had no insignias.  at no time did i hear sound from it.  the object flew under power, but the source of it was not apparent.  the wind had no apparent effect on it.  i estimated the size at around 6 feet in diameter and up to 18 feet long.\r\n\r\nit changed compass directions with smooth on-axis turns.  it rotated flat as if a pin was stuck down through its mid point.  for the first turn it slowed and rotated about 45deg, pointing one of its ends in my direction and then flew straight toward my position.  the second on-axis turn occurred when it was about 1/4 mile away from me.  as part of that maneuver, one end rose upwards to about 60deg.  the tube then flew as if following an upwardly diagonal straight line; it went toward a spot on the 2,200ft base of a thick overcast.  \r\n\r\nwhile watching with binoculars the tube suddenly changed shape and became a black rectangular sheet with slightly ragged edges.  now instead of a tube, there appeared something in the shape of a quite large sheet of plywood, painted black, roughly 8ft x 16ft.   \r\n\r\nas if nothing had happened, the flying sheet kept the tube���s 60-degree tilt and silently continued along the same diagonal path.  as it went the sheet slowly rocked side to side, perhaps 10 degrees each side; it was as if a spindle shaft went through the middle of it on the long dimension.  the timing of the rocking movements did not seem to vary.  at this point, by ground distance the object was roughly 1/2 mile away or a bit more.\r\n\r\na patch of blue sky had appeared a few thousand feet above the flying sheet, actually at the 6,600ft roof of the overcast.  still tilted and rocking, the sheet transitioned from its diagonal path to a 90deg straight-up climb toward the blue.  a last look through the binoculars before the clouds closed over showed a pinpoint quite high in the open sky and moving straight away.  \r\n\r\nthe sighting lasted around 5 minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

my front porch faces due west. the evening was clear and my view of the sky was good, for living in a city. about 3 minutes into my cigarette, chair kicked back up against a wall facing the western sky, i happened to notice a very slow moving, small pinpoint light (it looked like a dim bluish star) coming towards me from the southwest, heading northeast. the object appeared to be at a very high altitude, had no flashing navigation lights and maintained the same, stable luminosity (no flashing or twinkling) for the first 15 seconds of observation.\r\n\r\ni first thought the object was a satellite, (i have observed satellites in the past) and this is why i continued to watch it. after observing the object travel for the first 15 seconds it suddenly grew much brighter, about as bright as venus. (i had observed venus earlier in the evening). the object continued moving at the same speed and direction. \r\n\r\nat this point in time, i knew the object was not a satellite, and thought it might be a jet of some sort, that had just turned on its landing lights. even though dia & buckley afb are nearby to the east, i thought this was unusual due to the extremely high altitude, extremely slow speed, and lack of any other navigation lights.\r\n\r\nthe now very bright object continued traveling in the same direction for another 15 seconds and then stopped moving. \r\n\r\nin the last 5 seconds of observing the object, it did not move and quickly grew much brighter, approximately 3 times brighter than venus. the object then vanished in a flash of bright light. (bright enough to burn the image into my eyes for a few seconds) after a few blinks, my eyes recovered from the flash and i could make out a short, faint, white, hazy, luminescent trail going due north from where the object had stood. \r\n\r\ni do understand the object may have been traveling at a high speed, but due to its high altitude and my perspective, appeared to me, to be moving slowly.\r\n\r\ntwo days later, on the evening of june 18, 2010 at approximately 10:45pm. under the same circumstances as june 16, i'm out on my front porch under clear skies, smoking another cigarette, kicked back in my chair facing the sky, directly due west, when a brilliant white oval object appeared to just \"pop\" into view. the object had a very distinct, solid white oval shape to it. the object stood still for about 1 1/2 seconds and then quickly moved to the north at a high rate of speed. this object appeared to be at a much lower altitude than the object i had observed two days prior on 6/16. the object continued to move north for about 15 seconds and then vanished.  during flight, the object maintained a consistent luminosity, it did not flash or twinkle, there were no navigation lights. \r\n\r\ni have lived at this residence for 10 years. i am familiar with the routine air traffic over my home. (commercial, civilian and military). in both sightings, the objects did not appear to be any type of aircraft that i am familiar with.\r\n\r\ni am 42 years old, and throughout my life, i have observed many individual meteors, spent many evenings watching meteor showers, and have witnessed a few spectacular fireballs. in both sightings, the objects did not appear to be meteors.

noticed a row of bright light hovering over a park. i was shocked at the possibility this could be a ufo. i quickly told my wife and our friend to look up at the lights in the sky. it was a clear sky, we pulled over next to the hovering object about 100-150 ft away from it. we noticed this object was huge in size about 50-100 ft wide disk shaped and it had a ring of lights on the side of the craft with a red light in the middle of the ring of lights. it started moving northwest and the ring of lights started flickering one light after the other. we followed it for about 5 min trying to take pictures of it but our cellphone cameras were not good enough to take pictures. my 6 year old nephew started freaking out because he did not know what it was. all of the sudden the disk shaped object was gone. making no sound just disappeared. looking at the web we found a video filmed about a year ago 50 miles away from where we live. in this video this is the exact same thing we saw. sadly we could not take pictures or video.\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=u4d1osmei9g&feature=player_embedded","distance":"21-100

the series finally of the tudors at 9:05 pm est, when i spotted the first in a series of about 15 orange/red glowing orbs.  during the event several planes had departed miami international airport flying out of the airport from the west to the east.  the first orb quickly passed by us flying in a se to w/nw direction and disappered from site within 5 minutes.  then about 15 minutes later the sky had filled with the same orbs, about 15 in total.  the drifted to the south of us for about 10 minutes, then quickly departed in a w/nw direction until they were no longer in view.  we each took several pictures with our iphones, however little detail can be seen in the photos.  \r\n\r\nthe objects moved slowly and silent passed us and then appeared to increase in speed and quickly disappeared while traveling in a west/north west direction.  the only sounds in the sky were coming from the jetliners departing miami international airport which passed about 2 to 5 miles south and parallel of the ufos.  the ufo's appeared in random groups of one, two's and three's and appeared to be flying at an altitude that matched the jetliners flying out of mia.\r\n\r\nwe both felt calm, yet excited honored to witness something so beautiful and unique.  \r\n\r\nall three images unfortunately show only a bright white ball of light with none of the details that we witnessed in person.
