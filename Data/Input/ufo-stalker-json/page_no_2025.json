started at 10:00 pm and we arrived in the parking lot across from the street the saloon was located on approximately 9:55 or 9:56. after i got out of the car and was shutting the door, i looked across the road towards the bar and happened to look up at the sky. the local bars there had two light beams shining up into the sky and rotating back and forth (they do this for advertising). because these lights light up the sky, i noticed (as well as my husband after he got out of the car) about 12-15 (maybe even 20) of what looked like stars moving slowly across the sky. in fact, if my eyesight hadn't lingered for a moment, i would have just thought they were stars and walked into the bar and thought nothing of it. however, my eyes did linger on these objects and that is when i relised they were moving slowly in no discernible pattern, that is, some were closer to each other and some looked like outliers. however, they all remained equidistant to each other while travelling. i noticed some were blinking and some weren't. they had the brightness and whiteness of a star, not brighter and not whiter. however, my husband told me after the event that some of them had started glowing red. i myself did not notice this. after several \"what the hell is that\" exchanges between us, we both just stood transfixed at the sight. then they were gone from the swath of sky they were in; it looked to me as though they entered cloud coverage and disappeared. however, my husband said that to him it looked almost like when they all crossed a certain line in the sky, they disappeared. he didn't feel like they went into cloud coverage, but rather that they shut their lights off or just disappeared. unfortunately, there were no other witnesses to this, as the parking lot was empty and there was so much noise coming from the bars that we couldn't have yelled for people to look up. i have racked my brain trying to mentally discredit what i saw; but, i know that last night actually constituted my first actual alien craft sighting. strangely enough, both my husband and i didn't feel the need to jump into the car and try to chase it or follow it (as i always imagined i would do in this scenario) but rather we felt calm, elated, almost surreal, and we both have commented that we don't feel like this will be our last sighting.

am a reptile breeder) i knew that this entity was not hunting or showing any fear because of the way it moved, it wasn't trying to be stealthy. i have an outside dog and during the early morning hours she would begin barking, but would not leave the porch. \r\n\r\n\r\nmy son was playing in the backyard when he heard a rustling noise over the embankment at the edge of the yard.  he moved closer to the edge and pulled back the leaves.  he stated that he saw something with white glowing eyes.  he also stated that the object was climbing toward him up the bank.  he says that it was not a deer, elk, bear, or other type of animal, it did have hair.  it did not have a \"nose\", but it sniffed him. it was tall when it stood up. it stared at him and then backed away, it did not make any noises. my son ran to the other side of the yard and preceded to play, he didn't come to my wife and tell her anything. he was not fearful of the entity.\r\n\r\nthat night he was sitting with my wife and me and began to tell his story with great excitement. what is strange about that is he will not volunteer any info on his own. he is not a \"talker\" and will not even tell what happened during the

story. my initial thoughs was it was a bear, since they have been moving through the area. i got online and pulled up pictures of different animals and asked him which one he saw and he could not pick any animals from the pics. i used local wildlife pics and exotic (gorillas, orangutans, etc.) and nothing was anything that he

towards my property on old airport rd. after i crossed spanish valley rd.,there is a private drive that leads to my front door. by the time i was nearly a quarter mile from my front door, i had to sheild my eyes because there was something so bright in my line of vision i could not see what was ahead of me. at one point i stopped the truck, only momentarily, and looked at the what i will refer to as a \"fireball\". my first thought was that perhaps work had begun on johnson\"s on top. i had heard some talk that a new housing complex would someday be available to those who wanted a breath taking view of spanish valley, from above. i was thinking some workers installed a giant flood light, about (and i am guessing), 30 feet off the ground. my mind was changed very quickly on this theory when this fireball started moving, very slowly, maintaining the same distance from the ground, but moving south, all along the surface of johnsons on top. i knew then i was looking at a ufo. i raced to my front door, beeping the horn, trying to alert my husband who was inside the house. i ran through the front door and screamed for him to come outside and see what i was seeing. he grabbed his very high powered binoculars and raced to the front of our house with me. at the first moment he looked, the fireball was no longer hovering over johnsons on top.It was seemingly nesteled among some stars waaaay up there! it was easy to spot. it was so much brighter than the stars it appeared to be close to. *(name deleted--sgonzalez/cms)looked trough his binoculars and said,\"it is not a star. i see what you mean. it is very bright. i dont know what it is. it is not moving, though\"...After 12 minutes, doug was ready to go back inside when the fireball zoomed across the sky and then was very visible over the north end of the moab rim. we watch in sheer amazement as the fireball headed over the city of moab. it was visible hovering and moving over moab, utah, for at least 25 minutes. finally, here is some crazy stuff, before the fireball \"disappeared\" from our view, we noticed the object now had blinking lights like an airplance. it just disappeaed after it was 10 miles or so

the street. and was walking up the steps to my house when the object caught my eye.   \r\n\r\ni saw what appeared to be a particularly bright object brighter than the brightest stars cross the sky. it went from the south east to the north west (not exactly sure of the exact orientation, but this is approximate). it slowed down and stopped. another object which was relatively smaller passed the object after it stopped in the sky. the smaller object continued past and started to turn redder and fainter. \r\n\r\ni went back inside my house and grabbed my telescope and told my brother and step brother what had happened. we stayed outside and waited to see if the object would move, but it didn't. it seemed like after it was done moving, it turned into what looked like an ordinary star. the object that stopped in the sky was still there, but since my tripod for my telescope was very short, i wasn't able to get a good view of what was in the sky. however, i laid on the ground and i was able to get a stable view. when i looked up in the sky, i saw a few things moving and my brother seemed to point out that the object that stopped in the sky was moving as well, but only slightly.\r\n\r\nthe large object moved smoothly, but did not follow a straight path. i watched it curve a bit. although a few of the trees in my yard somewhat blocked it, i was able to view it almost the entire time and it was only blocked by the trees for a few seconds. i watched it stop in clear, non-tree-covered sky. it didn't make any noise at all. \r\n\r\ni was a bit astonished when i saw it. after seeing the object, i watched it for about two hours and then i went inside because i was getting bit by mosquitoes. i believe it might still be in the same spot continuing to hover there. \r\n\r\ni have been watching the skies this evening and i have seen some other things that were a bit out of the ordinary, but that could be because i was hyped up about yesterday.

i first notice it, then called my wifes attention to it.  it seemed lower when i first saw it and i could see that it was a cigar shape silver in color and had a  short fin sticking out ouf the mid section of  the craft. i couldn't hear any noise.  by the time i got my camera out of my truck, it was a lot higher and futher away.\r\nit was hard to keep it in the frame because the camera has no view finder only a small screen to view the image and i was just pointing it in hopes that i was getting something most of the time.  for some reason i looked like a white pill shaped object on the video?  i do not know if this was a plane or something else.  i almost did not submit it because of the dought in my mind.  is this a common image of a plane when videoed with a digital camera?  or is this something else?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23823,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2041465,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06192010-0001","longitude":-96.6325922,"occurred":1274756280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1276935982000,"summary":"Silver

moving... the object was clearly visible and quickly directed my wife's attention to it and asked her what she thought it might be...After a few moments she replied she did not know and became somwhat

programs ...I pulled over to the side of the road and we both watched the object for about a minute. it quickly shot off at great speed to the southeast toward the mcallen airport just before a continental airliner approached for landing.  i quickly called a good friend who works at the airport and asked if there had been any pireps or other reports of a brightly colored object to the northwest of the airport...He later called and said there were none.  i later asked several other aviation friends if they had heard or seen anything strange in the late evening sky, northwest of the airport...They all replied no !!  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line
