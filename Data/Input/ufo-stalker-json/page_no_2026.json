a landscape/ portrait photographer... \r\n\r\ni visited some family in negril back in december 2007, and while i was walking near the light house i noticed an open courtyard of which over looked the caribbean sea. i figured this would be a very nice location to capture a few images for my desktop screen.\r\n\r\nthe sky was perfectly clear and i didn't notice any birds in the sky...\r\n\r\ni sat and waited a few minutes for a cargo ship of which was on the horizon to exit my shot and then i fired off three frames in rapid succession. i always bracket my shots in raw+ high resolution, and this was no exception... on the screen the images appeared perfect, so i packed up and headed on down the road.\r\n\r\nit was when i returned home and was going thru my shots that i noticed that there was an unusual \"spec\" on one of the three images of which i had captured.\r\n\r\nthe image i captured was in the second frame.\r\nit drew my attention because my initial reaction was that this ruined the otherwise perfect shot. i think it is more than just a \"spec\" lol.\r\n\r\ni sat on this image for quite some time however i did show it to a few of my closest friends joking about capturing a ufo on camera.\r\n\r\ninitially i saw the first \"spec\", but several days later after going back to the original image, i realized that there were two of the objects on the shot with the second apparently further away from my post.\r\n\r\ni have gone over this photo many times and tried to find a conclusion as to what could have gotten into my image but i cannot honestly think of anything that would show like what i have.... i inverted the colors and this was when i realized that the objects were both apparently very far away, large and solid in shape, and must have been traveling reasonably fast. \r\n\r\ni have been shooting photos for several years, and have many shots with birds, planes,etc in the background... this is a first for me.\r\n\r\nregards...\r\n \r\n*deleted wit's

when we heard a deep loud roar from a jet above the mountain range to the west. we love airplanes so we started looking for it. well we never spotted it but a few minutes after, we heard a strange huming pulsing noise coming from the northwest and we seen an all white jet like airplane fly across the sky. my family has a big military backgroound and i have a passion for military aircraft and this was nothing i have seen or heard before. then the noise changed to a propeller like sound after it passed. along the same flight path was a airliner following beside several miles away. now the wierd stuff begins. first i seen a star like object directly above where the white plane had flown over. it just stayed stationary like a star. i thought it was a star at first but a similar object sped toward it and soon as they met they started darting around at 90deg turns for a few seconds then one of them sped off to the east and disapeard. the other one gradually sped off to the northeast. then my dad and i seen a bigger object that looked like a round globe. it was heading northwest slowly then a second smaller globe appeard, buzzed by the larger globe, then came back and met up with it. as they both sped off to the northeast a long serpent like tail appeared behind the larger globe. then the tail disappeard a few seconds after. they both disappeard over the ridge of the roof. after that a 747 size all white plane flew very slowly across the top of the mountain range to the east. the first two objects looked like stars and the second two like white globes. there were no chemtrails or airliners in the sky exept the one we seen after the experience wich is an every day accurance. we were baffled because we never seen or heard anything like this before. the four objects didnt make any noise at all even though the first two seem to be going at a high rate of speed when they disappeared. this is the fourth experience we had with ufos in the area.

drank it, i put on my sun glasses and went outside for a cigarette. i decided to look up for some sky gazing, despite the sun being the only thing hanging in the sky. \r\n\r\nthe sun was shining behind a large maple tree in such a way that is was smothering the suns light, making it much easier to see, as it wasn't nearly as bright as it would have been if there had not been a tree in the way.\r\n\r\nsomething caught my eye in the area of the sun, in what must have been a half centimeter from the outline of the sun. it moved steadily forward over my head toward the north east, away from and perpendicular to sun. it was faint, light gray and spherical, and as it moved away from the sun, it's back was illuminated by it's light. it moved only in a straight line. no contrails. no sound, though it was too high for me to be able to hear any. i eventually lost sight of it only to see two more of these things in the vicinity of the sun when i looked back.\r\n\r\na little bit about where i live:\r\n\r\ni live in centreville, va, about a mile and a half away from the nro (national reconnaissance office), which was less than a mile from my old high school, and about 5 miles from dulles airport. being so close to the airport means we constantly have jumbo jets flying over our house to land.\r\n\r\nany time of the day you can look up and see at least 6 aircraft in the sky, and many times even more. i am familiar with the flight patterns over my house having lived there all my life. there will always be airplanes flying at different altitudes and in different directions, but they tend to be the same flight paths, give or take.\r\n\r\nwhen i was a kid i was fascinated with airplanes and until my sophomore year of high school, i had planned to apply to embry riddle aeronautical university, but my interests in aviation dwindled and i started to focus on writing and journalism. needless to say i educated myself on ever sort of aircraft under the sun. if it is in the sky, i can name it for you.\r\n\r\nthat being said, this object flew in flight path that i have never seen, in a direction i have never seen. it no wings, no tail, it was simply a sphere.\r\n\r\ni am shocked at what i saw. it was only 4:15 so it would have been impossible for me to mistake these as satellites. my area is directly under many flight paths, so i can't imagine them being weather balloons, seeing as they would be too much of an obstacle for incoming airplanes.\r\n\r\nif the sun had not been where it was, and i had not been where i was, i would never have seen these. if the tree was not there in front of the sun, it would have been way to bright for me to have seen them, even with sun glasses on. after all, what better place in the sky to hide than the one that would blind you, right? who thinks to look at the sun?\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23811,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8451509,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06182010-0006","longitude":-77.4278369,"occurred":1276902900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1276905796000,"summary":"Sphere

this time i saw a very shiney oval silver object near the plane that kept slowly moving across the sky. i ran inside and grabbed my digital camera.  when i returned, it had passed my house and was going further up in the sky. it still remained very shiney, however, i also now noticed a red blinking light surrounding the object.  the shaped of the object became even more clear. it was oval. i have seen many helicopters and many many planes because my house is in the flight path of bush international airport.  the silver shiney object was definitely not a plane.\r\ni ran in the house and got my husband to come and see this thing and he also saw it. we watched until it disappeared so high in the sky, approximately 3-4 minutes total.I was very excited because i have always wanted to see a ufo, but before,each time i think that i would see one, it turned out to be a plane or helicopter with blades or lights.  they were never this silver or shiney.I think the first thing that really caught my attention was the fact that i didn't see bright lights, but the shiney silver.  afterwards, i went to my computer to try and see what i had taken a picture of on my camera.  only a couple of the pictures actually showed the object without them becoming distorted when making them larger.  i was a bit disappointed because i wanted to see it much clearer in pictures.  i will send what i do

thought they were planes, but when showed to my husband, he said they weren't planes--planes don't fly like this.  now, the more time i am out there, the more of them i see.  the night of the 12th of june was the longest and largest show i witnessed.  there were so many 'shooting stars' that i lost count. but, that night as soon as laid down to look up in the sky, immediately i started seeing the flying 'stars', when i first see them they are about as bright as the stars in the big dipper, then they fade to a faint star.  then after awhile, sometimes seconds, sometimes up to 5 minutes they vanish.  last night i was watching one for about 5 minutes and it stayed bright almost the whole time until about 4 min. in, it stops, and i made sure that i did not take my eyes off of it for even a milisecond.  it stopped in that spot for over a minute, & i thought i was going nuts, and then it finished descending and then disappeared completely.  i saw one, 2 nights ago, split into 2 which flew in opposite directions.  the same night one was flying dead south and in a split second was flying dead north.  they will surge forward, zigzag around stars, sometimes they fly up to a star and 'bump' it and take off.  june 13th, i saw one fly as fast as a meteor does.  one time i was following one and it disappeared and outloud i started talking to 'myself' \"where are you\" over and over while looking in the area where it had disappeared, which was facing south, when all of a sudden i see 2 bright flashes in the west, i quickly turned to watch and it faded back to where it was before.  the nights that i see muliple flying 'stars' like 3 at a time, i get these headaches that i have never in my life experienced.  i have had one migraine in my life and didn't know you could have a headache worse then that, but this was 10x worse.  the pain was so bad that i couldn't sleep, so i took a sleeping pill to knock me out, and when the pill wore off and i opened my eyes in the morning, i thought that i was going to throw up because my head hurt so badly.  the headache lasted for over 24 hours.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

(*name deleted) and the other co-worker pointed into the sky to the n.W. of our location at about a 50deg. angle from the ground. i saw a small circular object which reflected a silver light from the sun, and estimated it to be at between 5 and 10,000 feet in altitude. \r\n\r\ni began taking still digital photographs of the object, which appeared to be round or circular. i saw that it was nto being towed by another aircraft and did not have wings. the camera used was a canon powershot sx20is, with a max zoom of 560mm. \r\n\r\nthe object (still watched by myself and the other 3 witnesses) continued to move slowly to the n.West. it was hard to tell if it gained altitude, bt remained in the shape and still reflective. \r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the object about 7 mnutes later as it went over our building. \r\n\r\n(*name deleted) told me that the object was much closer when he and his co-worker first saw it above the building (and was much lower in altitude), and looked like a \"disk\". they said it was completely silent. \r\n\r\ni reviewed the images at on a low-res screen afterward and the object is positively round or disk-shaped. the detail of the images is not superb, due to the distance when i first saw it. \r\n\r\n(names of wit's friend and co-worker deleted--sgonzalez/cms).","distance":"501 Feet -
