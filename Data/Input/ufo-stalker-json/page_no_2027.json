arrived just after 2pm.  watched them play for a few minutes, looked ssw at the clouds:  mostly billowy storm clouds--heavy rains on and off during the past couple of hours, w/periodic showers starting earlier in the day.  first noticed a hawk's nest in a tree at the same direction, about 100 feet off the ground:  one bird left the nest and circled, the other bird remained to watch the nest; first bird returned a couple of times.  my kids and i watched the birds/nest directly for about five minutes, then they played and i watched them.\r\n\r\nperiodically, i looked at both the hawk's nest and the coming storm clouds while the kids played.  at one point, directly above the nest by several feet (approximate, based on distance from ground), i noticed what i first thought was a balloon.  it rose very slowly in the sky towards the clouds.  several things immediately stood out:  object was black, was at first spherical in shape, but appeared to almost change into an egg/oval shape as it moved, heavy winds were blowing storm clouds from the ssw to w very quickly--but the object continued to move directly up as if moving against the wind.  i watched it move slowly and directly upwards, seeming to 'change' between sphere and oval, for at least four/five minutes, still entirely against the wind.  it then stopped, and stayed stationary for about a minute (definitely not as long as the upwards movement); very dark storm clouds were quickly approaching it, but its own dark color stood in contrast to the clouds.  then the object moved horizontally--positionally wnw--at an incredible speed, and disappeared into the cloud bank.  i watched for at least a couple of minutes to see if it emerged out of the cloud bank--the wind was moving the clouds quickly--but saw nothing further.\r\n\r\nagain, at first thought it was a balloon, like one of the large ones used by car dealerships to draw attention, but there are none in that part of town--or across the river (willamette), for that matter, nor was there a tether seen.  too, from the apparent distance from the ground--perhaps several miles--the likely size of it would've made it unlikely to be a commercial balloon.  but the general fact of it moving in a straight line upwards against fairly heavy winds for several minutes negated that it was a balloon; too was the fact that it stopped/remained stationary for at least a minute against fairly heavy winds.  and finally the fact that it moved against fairly heavy winds at a high rate of speed into an approaching cloud bank made it unlikely that it was a balloon.\r\n\r\ni'm not entirely convinced of what i saw.  just the distances and weather patterns converging concurrently make me feel that a light object like a balloon wouldn't have functioned/moved in the manner that it did.  but similarly, perhaps the weather patterns and distances at the time made an ordinary object appear to act extraordinarily.  there is a national guard airbase in town, and perhaps they do conduct weather experiments...But the base is several miles away in the opposite direction.  it's been many years since i took a science class, so perhaps there's a logical explanation (ie, optical illusion, theory of physics) for why something moved the way it did for the duration it did...But thought i'd post this in case someone else in salem, or might have seen the same thing...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23781,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.9464375,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06162010-0002","longitude":-123.0270763,"occurred":1276636200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg,   Oval,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1276675122000,"summary":"Spherical/oval shape moving upwards against wind & clouds for several minutes;

went out back and i noticed a brite white full moon above.  i look closer and i noticed it had uniform whiteness so i could not see the shaded of white or grey that made the man in the moon face.  it was equally as bright as the normal full moon, bright enough to create a moon shadow.   i looked around and i noticed another moon bright orange rising over my neighbor house to the east across the street as i looked from the backyard through the side yard to the front.  it had the features that created the man on the moon so i felt it was the real moon.  i looked above again and stared at the white moon for a few minutes then it made a rapid ascent in the sky.  as it rose it became smaller and smaller til it appeared to look like a bright star, then dim star then disappeared into space.  it reminded me of the star of bethleham when it was at a high altitude. \r\n\r\ni was only seven when i witness the ufo that i call the moon of memphis.  i had a good memory of the event so when i grew up and joined the air force as a navigator , i was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience.  i estimated that the moon of memphis was at 20,000 feet and was about ten acres in size.  i developed this information from watching the ascent of the moon of memphis and remembering that it also pass through some high cirrus clouds that i estimated was at 60,000 feet,  at 20,000 feet it would have taken four 747s aircraft parked in a circle to cover the area of the moon of memphis ufo thus creating a ten acre size estimate.  when i saw it above me it was exactly the size of the real full moon when seen high in the sky.\r\n\r\ni believe the ufo or moon of memphis was a sign of god.  when you take a thru z and match it with 1 thru 26,  you can add up the letters of words and get a sum number.  for example, israel adds up to sixty four which got me to think that the 1964 moon of memphis ufo had religious significance since israel equals sixty four.  whereever the moon of memphis came from or however it was created was certainly a unique phenomenon of divine origin and purpose.  its appearance in 1964 also suggest religious intellect.\r\n\r\nfrom voices, visions and dreams that i experienced thirty three years later,  i  believe it had a message for humanity.  it wanted humanity to be more reverent to all living beings and animals.  the consciousness of each being or animal is precious and must be respect more.  before animals are killed, they should receive anathesia to be allow to put in a unwakable sleep before being killed.  anything less is cruel, heartless, and unreverent of that being and god.  maybe humanity will find a way to eat without killing animals but until then we must not kill an animal while it is awake.  treat innocent animals the same as you would like to be treated if you were in their place.  the moon of memphis is proof that god does exist and we should obey god���������s wish for us to be more kind to each living being.\r\n\r\n[cms/tg/pid]\r\ncapt usaf/ lt uscg retired\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering

coworker about what i had seen.  she thought it was fun, and i was excited to tell someone.  while i got ready to start working, i kept looking out the windows (facing east)  hoping to see something else.  after that much creepy excitement, it's normal to \"want it again.\"  i didn't expect to see anything.\r\n\r\ni thought it was a plastic grocery bag at first - there have been two that the wind has brought up to our floor.  this wasn't collapsed, and moving with the wind, it was full and floating straight up.  i called my coworker over to have a look.  i estimate the object was 2-3 blocks away.  it looked like an opaque white jellyfish without tentacles -  think of an upside down \"u\" that's closed at the bottom and more plump.  it rose into the air, then slowed down, not hovering, but not rising as fast.  other opaque, white, smaller globes appeared and circled around it.  i saw 4 of these \"pursuers\" during this event.  they raced around the larger orb and were noticeably faster than it.  the orb began to move south.  the smaller globes chased it.  it reminded me of small birds chasing a larger bird away from their nest.  i looked for bird wings, but the shape of the globes didn't change during their movement.  if they were birds, i would have seen some kind of change in shape as they beat their wings and turned.   my coworker turned away and started back for her desk, telling me, \"i'm not looking anymore, i'm too creeped out.\"  but she did see them.\r\n\r\nthe large orb moved south half a block, then, with one orb still chasing it, veered east towards msu's campus and was gone in a second . . . faded out of sight.  the small orb chasing it broke off it's chase and disappeared the same way.  i looked back at the original location, and one last orb was rising into the sky where the original larger one initially was, and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni didn't have a camera with me, and my cellphone is old and doesn't have one that would've taken a usable

tell it was moving but just not fast enough for us to see the movement. we were out in the front of our home and it was in the west sky up above the c shaped moon right above a neighbors house top however i could walk out back of our house and see it very clear because it took the next door house out of the way so it was a clear view. my daughter was outside trying to take a picture with her digital camera and she also looked through my binoculars and saw that it looked very bright but had a red glow around it. we also saw several flashing objects come from the same direction but not sure if they came out of the star like object. while i was out back of the house viewing it all of a sudden i saw like a spot light kind of transparent but yet bright round circle like light streak across the back yard above my yard yet almost in front of me as it streaked across it was almost like it was going to land somewhere in back of the house or in a neighbors yard but as it streaked across it disappeared. i did get a picture but the one here came from my phone camera and its very small right above the moon and looks like star. \r\n\r\nmaybe someone can take the pic and zoom in on it i am not sure but i got the pic anyway. it seems as long as we watch it it hangs around but each time i watch it to see if it will move away from us but it never goes anywhere until i go into the house

unusual in fact that after making my purchase i came back into the store and called attention to it. at which time one of the clerks came out and took a picture of the event. it was magnificent. i then came home with my purchase and began to went into my home. after remaining in the house for approximately 45 minutes to an hour. i decided to go outside and gaze at the stars which has become a regular habit. i first went into my back yard and after several minutes, noticed nothing unusual. i came back into the house and heard the dog down stairs wanting to go outside. so i let him out and i went out with him.  while waiting for him to finish his business, i began to star gaze again. at first i didn't notice anything unusual and then i looked toward where the unusual cloud formation was earlier, and there in the same general direction was an extremely bright star. it was so bright in fact it was a bit unsettling to look at. but i was curious as to what it was. i thought at first that it was perhaps venus or even some other planet. so i went back in the house and got my binoculars and gazed at the star through them. i want to be extremely clear and detail as to what i saw. first while looking at this intense light emiting from the star i noticed that the light from it started to dim and after about 20-30 seconds went completely out. i then tried to refocus my binocs and no longer saw a star like shape that was emiting light, instead the light from another source was now illuminating it. and it was huge! extremely huge and moving across the sky at an incredible rate for something its size. through the binocs at first glance it looked like a crescent moon in form and shape. but in the next few seconds changed from crescent to full moon in appearence. i could make out a lot of detail while observing it. but what i found interesting was that it was like this thing knew that i was watching it and began to turn off it light and assume the roll of a star of planet in the sky. let me just state for the record that i no longer believe that aliens are here on this planet. i know that they are! although i know that it will be difficult for me to prove unless or until they are ready to deal with such a savage and uncivilized culture such as ours then no matter how much they allow us to view them. it won't matter. they will continue to allow us to further corrupt ourselfs. tonight gave me the feeling that they have always been around and we just don't take the time to notice them. this message is not just for mufon, but for them also because i also belive that somehow they monitor all major communications on this planet. thanks for coming in peace.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

5) were standing in the door when my wife looked startled at something. i went to the door and observed a triangular craft approaching croswell rd. it was heading straight for us. it was completely silent. i ran out to the center of the road at the same time\r\nas it reached the road. it was about 150 ft above me when in succession 3 balls of light left the nose of the craft on the left side circling under the nose. the first one headed for me. i ducked down to the right but it was very fast and must have touched my left shoulder. i woke up in my own bed shaking and afraid. my wife was sleeping soundly next to me. i noticed the clock read 2:00. i lay there and tried to tell myself that it was a dream. i went over the events of the previous day but could not remember what happened after about 4:00. watching t.V. going to bed and could\r\nremember nothing. i did not get back to sleep that night. the next day i asked my wife what we had done or watched or talked about the night before but she flat out would not speak on the subject continuing to change the subject. i can't let it go and the feeling that it was not a dream persists to this day. i have believed in u.F.O's for most of my life. i've read too many books on the subject to count. could i have manufactured this subconsciously from all i've read? i hope so because it is okay to\r\nbelieve in this stuff when it involves someone else. i would rather not find out this was real because this would open a whole other can of worms. if the experience was real then what happened during the missing time? if i found out, how would that affect me? how would it affect my relationships? would i then experience a form of p.T.S.D. would i find out about more events? would i become paranoid that it might happen again?\r\non another note, my sister has sworn that she has been taken many times.\r\nshe has memories of having a hybrid baby placed in her arms and told that she needed to nurture it. she has many memories of telepathic conversations with grays. i don't know why, after all these years, i've decided to talk about this. maybe because i'm hoping talking about it will somehow let me release it. holding it in hasn't helped. i've always felt that i needed to tell somebody. well,thanks for giving me a forum.\r\n                                                                           yours

medical center for about a month now nearly daily. on sunday june sixth i was walking around the hospital looking at the clouds while my wife and her brother spoke about there mother's health condition.\r\ni spotted very high in the sky a white \"round\" object acting as if it were caught in a dustdevil as it's movement was in a swirling pattern.It then flew down and then back to where i first spotted it.It looked to be a paper plate actually,but i knew it was very high and would have to be large,much larger than a piece of trash floating in the wind.It then started flying due north and i watched it disappear onto the horizon.It moved pretty quickly,but not much faster than a jet would move.\r\nyesterday june 13 we were again at the hospital sitting outside smoking.My wife and father in law were talking for quite some time and i grew impatient and walked around the building to where i had seen the object the previous week.I looked up and at the same spot i saw what i thought was a military jet flying above my head,headed east,and right where i had seen it previously a white object was \"hovering in place.This time smaller and lower than the previous object.I watched this object head north just as the previous one had and walked quickly around the building.My wife noticed me looking up and i asked her if she saw it...At this time the object came close to entering a low hanging cloud and i saw an object appear to drop out of it and enter an entirely different flight path,followed by another.These two objects were much quicker than the first.All three flew into the cloud and did not reappear after 7 or 8 minutes.My wife claimed to have seen a total of 4 objects leave the first with one flying off in a blink of an eye.I had been looking down as i was walking down a step and perhaps missed this one...\r\n i would think the first object to be smaller than a sedan,but it's hard to tell.The clouds that day were low and the objects flew into the cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

calabasas area, i saw a white object in the sky and pointed it to my husband. he was driving and asked me, \"where? i can't see.\" i said, \"it's right there in front of us.\" the object was not so far from us, and it was recognizable. he kept saying, \"i can't see it.\" i said, \"can't you see that?\" i kept pointing it and stared at it. within 10 seconds, the object went transparent like a magic. i said, \"it disappeared!!!\" our car has a window on the ceiling, and my husband opened the plastic slide. i looked up and tried to find the object, but it was gone. after that, we saw 3 or 4 airplanes going by. then i saw a couple of birds. i could tell wether they were airplanes or birds, but the object i saw had no wings and went transparent. there were no clouds at all. at first, i was looking at an airplane, but there were no wings. i thought the object was moving towards 9 oclock. my husband said, \"maybe you can see different dimentions now because i could not see it.\" \r\nthis was the second time i saw ufo. the first time was just 2 weeks ago. may 30th.Around 1:30 p.M, i was driving towards my house and i almost got home. there was a bright silver light in the clear blue sky. i looked up and within a second, it disppeared. i parked,got out of my car and looked around, but i could not see anything. i was very excited and told my husband.
