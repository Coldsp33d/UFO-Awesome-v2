(we often see and hear conventional aircraft on our balcony) approximately 15-20 minutes after the event, we contacted lee county sheriff's department non-emergency and reported incident and wanted to know if anyone else either saw or reported the objects. non-emergency personnel indicated that there were no other reports at that time. we also contacted our local fox new station for information and to also see if anyone else reported these objects but had to leave a message.\r\n\r\nwe attempted to get photographic evidence of the event; however, due to our balcony being screened-in, we were unable to get clear pictures of the objects. we are very curious as to what the lights were and if anyone else noticed and reported the event. in short, we would like information on the event if there are other reports.

not a single light fixture - and then the whole disc faded to the metalic look and the other one then lit up- they did not get too bright to look at - it was like they were on a reostat and it was slowly being turned on to about halfway.  they were never really bright as if the sun was hitting them as when i first spotted them but more faded than that. i could not see that they were fading and lighting up until the shadow of the hills covered them. i awakened my son and asked if he saw them - which he did - and told him to look closely as we drove by and see if they were in any way teathered.  he had good eyesight and unequivically said no, they were not teathered.  he immediately went back to sleep and as soon as we had passed the spot i also completely forgot about them, until much later.  the only reason i remembered is because i heard someone elses story about a similar happening to her the next day after i got to my destination.  all of a sudden i realized that we had also seen that type of sighting only with 2 discs, one above the other and the lower one was slightly ahead of the other towards the road (but not directly over the road.  the two were pretty much strattling each other)  my son has never remembered the event. \r\ni don 't know if you want suppositions but i believe the fading in and out was sending out magnetic waves of forgetfulness so people kept right on driving instead of actually stopping along the freeway to gawk. \r\n  the early shadow of the foothills just highlighted the brightening and fading of the discs. not one other car on the freeway even slowed down to look at them.

my mouthed dropped as the massive glow shrunk down to the size (like a dimming light) of the two previous \"crafts.\" it streaked across the sky at the same speed as the others on the same flight path. this time before disappearing out of eye sight it deviated from its original northern path, started flying up into the sky and literally disappeared; not out of eye-sight, it just vanished up into the sky. i felt overwhelmed with what i had witnessed but also extremely lucky. i felt very fortunate to have just witnessed the strangest, most exciting thing ever. again, there were absolutely no lights flickering or blinking. it was not a shooting star or a comet. i know what those look like. no cigar or v-shape, etc. i am not a person that thinks any strange object in the sky is a ufo. i have never thought to having seen a ufo before nor have i reported anything like this before. my eyes will be glued to the sky in the nights ahead!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":23746,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5256215,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06142010-0006","longitude":-122.6690671,"occurred":1276493400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1276547020000,"summary":"Hovering, large bright light in sky shrinks down to star size, flies briefly, shoots upward, disappears.","tags":["lights","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Portland, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:121255"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"New York","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My friends and i were walking on new dorp beach, in staten island, new york (one of the five boroughs), and we looked up to stargaze, and instead see strange lights in a clear night sky. the pattern of lights was consistent with a tail light (color purple-ish), two wing lights (a strange white color), and a center light (red to green). what was most frightening to us was the sound- or rather lack of any. the bottom was black and sleek, almost as if it were an sr-71 blackbird, although current technology does not allow for flight ascending directly upwards and downwards, and does not allow for sudden almost sonic speeds. it seemed to slow as it was above us, the lights in the front became three white headlights, and it was followed by an obviously american military jet. this craft has been spotted in many different areas on staten island. it's one thing to run a military test run, but it's completely another to see a military jet actually chasing an unknown craft. i haven't the slightest clue whether it was of a terrestrial or extraterrestrial nature, but quite frankly it's been seen quite often. it was both wonderous and frightening, we were all mesmerized. we lost sight of the craft after it sped away in a curious diagonal pattern. i apologize for lack of any photographs, we figured that if it were military, the last thing college students want is to be investigated due to photos of military craft.

information i was told from my brother and his gf. they are  just normal everyday people and this event really frightened and was truly amazing. i really wish i could have been in there place for this.\r\n\r\nthis event takes place two years ago. i never ask my brother if i could post this  and i haven't talked to him about it in a while so i am a bite fuzzy on some details.\r\n my brother, his gf and there roommate were sitting watching television in there apartment. this is at night not too sure at what time but it was dark. they noticed strange lights out side in the sky through their glass door onto there balcony. my brother being a amateur astronomer owns a telescope that sits in front of their glass door of the balcony. he is always star gazing or using it to view the sights of the town. being interested in such astronomical events he went to investigate the strage lights. too his amazement he describes seeing two small crafts flying around the city. he told me they weren't too high in the sky(300m-800m) and were flying around the city scanning the town and area.   his gf and roommate were also watching this as it was happening. \r\n\r\nnow my brother told me that they were doing this for quite some time a few hours , this gave him plenty of time to view the small crafts through his telescope. he drew the crafts out on paper the last time i visited him just to describe it better visually.  the small crafts  diamond shaped with lights orbiting around them. he described  the lights as appearing to work like some kind of shield/aura. there movements were that of a fast  helicopter/ stunt rc copter but over the  town. moved fast and would stop scan the move on. not physically possible to do with his knowledge of aviation's is what he told me. he was viewing them through a telescope  so he got one of the best sighting a person could wish for. during this long event he noticed a large crafted in the upper atmosphere.This was disk shaped with many lights and was blocking out stars as it slowly moved across the sky. he never drew the mother ship for me but i had a long talk with him about this event a few years ago. \r\n\r\nmy brothers emotional state  through this was fear and amazement. his gf and roommate both were horribly frightened to the point of tears and crying. the most fearful of the event was when they were viewing the smaller crafts through his telescope and the scanning beam washed over them on his balcony. he told me that he  ducked and nearly **** his pants , pardon my expression. his gf and roommate wanted him to stop watching in fear of retaliation from the crafts but he  continued anyways. he called a few of his friends that came over and also viewed this crafts through his telescope. no video footage or photos were taken from him. he just enjoyed his view from his telescope and said it was a lifetime experience. i was told the event ended when the two smaller ships flew up to the mother ship then took off  and he couldn;t find it anymore. his gf was scared during the telling of this story and didn't like talking about it. was told that everyone that watched it had a hard time sleeping and they ended up watching a few movies that night till sun came up. \r\n\r\nthe scanning he described as a thin line that wash over and area, ships would move on then do it again from different angles.

11 at night around 8 pm it was on the north side of i 30 and at that time i thought it may be a huge star but i watch the skies all of the time and had never remembered seeing a star on that side that large. my friend (*name deleted,sgonzalez/cms) was riding with me and she saw it too. i brought it to her attention and she said maybe its a plane but we both noticed that it was not flashing any lights it was just a bright star like light just floating there not moving. i had never seen this before in that area and i have been in this area for a long time. i could see it between the houses once we reached my house, i had to go out about an hour later to get a blanket out of the trunk of my car and got this very eerie feeling like the hair stood up on the back of my neck and my arms and i walked all around to see if i could see the light or start and it had gone no where to be seen.\r\n\r\nanyway the next weekend she came down and we went to the hunt county fair on saturday night and we were with my sister and her husband and dad and i noticed it hoovering over the fair there were stars out but not really bright because it had been cloudy. i pointed it out to my dad and he said well it may be a really bright light on a tall pole but it was not that because, when we left it seem to be following us or going ahead of us sort of like a star seems to move to different sides of the highway  as you drive so still did not think to much but as we traveled on back to royse city where i live it was over on the north side of 30 again and this time it did not seem to be as bright but more dim and when we got to my house i could not find it anywhere it had vanished. the next time  i saw it was on sunday night june 13 around 8 pm my daughter (**name deleted, sgonzalez/cms) had come to visit and was leaving and i walked her out to her car and looked up which i always do and it was right above the house roof next door and i pointed it out to her and told her about how it had been over the fair the night before. she left and i went in to get my binoculars and i watched it for a very long time there were air planes flying near by and i was watching to see if any acted the same way but they were normal planes with flashing green and red lights and this light is just there no flashing and yet it seemed to move from side to side very slowly. at one point it would be further to the left of the housetop roof and then move in closer to the roof although it was very far above the roof. i watched with my binoculars trying to see if i could see it clearer but i am very near sighted and far sighted too and astigmatism so with my glasses it did not appear very close but it did appear to be very bright looking through them but it has a red aurora at the bottom yet it did not flash just red light covering the lower portion of the light or start like orb. it seemed to be round in shape when looking through the binoculars... i had three of my grand children looking at it and my grand son said it looked like a star but he did see the red underneath it. one of my grand children acted like she was a bit scared so after about 20 min i took them inside the house where i told them to stay inside and went out the back of the house and the light appeared further to the back of the house next door and i thought well maybe just a star that appears to be moving but not maybe i am just viewing it from different angles. so i went inside the house where the kids were.\r\n\r\nafter bout 15 min i went back out the front and the light was gone, i then went out the back of the house and i could not see it at first and i was talking to (****name deleted, sgonzalez/cms) my friend about this on my cell and thought it had gone but then i saw it way in the distance to the south west just hanging there for about 10 min and it was  more yellow in color like the atmosphere had possibly altered the color. i went back in for about 5 or 10 min and then back out the back and it was no where to be found. it may be a satellite it could be a spy aircraft but it is not a normal craft that i have seen in this area before. just wanted to report so maybe if someone else has seen this that we may find out what it is or to see if anyone feels the same way i do about it if it has been spotted by anyone else in the area.\r\n\r\nit seemed to go away once i was not looking

years what this could be. the object appears as a star or bright planet. the configuration seems as if it is an hour glass shape. at times it appears to have red or green light on the top or bottom. as we just witnessed the object moved in all directions with no pattern in the movement. in mentioning the red and/or green lights, for a lack of a better description, which are on the top and/or bottom of the hour glass shaped object, it makes one suspect some sort of airplane or helicopter. maybe not. we have seen this object in all seasons, not in the same position in the sky, but there none the less. being located in middle of the east coast and surrounded by numerous military bases could be part of the answer. \r\n\r\n**tonight we were sitting outside on the patio when i noticed the object(again). we remarked that \"there goes the \"bouncing star\". we watched it for 15 or 20 minutes and then went inside since it is nothing new to us.We first noticed it some years ago late one night on our way home. the road is positioned exactly east west. it was in december, say 2003 or so and the object was directly west. subsequently it has been seen in warm months in the east or east southeast. being courious i decided to research it online and got only one return on a search for moving star and only one reference which lead me here. since it is summer i'll try to find the

to north. what got my attention, was the brightness, the tremendous speed it was going, no noise, in a straight line, no trail. it was under the cloud cover, as i observed it the entire time which was only approx 3 seconds to cover the distance from south to north across the entire sky. i knew it definately was not a jet, as the speed was tremendous, it was, i'd estimate at a height and size of a jet passing by, but way too fast. my thought was perhaps a satellite. any response to what you may think this was, will be appreciated. thank you. i also when i first noticed it, thought it was a falling star, or meteorite coming down, but there was no change of color, no trail, no deviation in its path.  at that speed, could only think ufo. after it passed north to my right, it just disappeared into the sky. i sat for another half hour, and observed the sky, wondering if i should contact you, and if anyone else reported such a sighting.  thank you for your time.

i was driving north on florissant road through downtown ferguson, mo. i noticed an object hovering fairly high in the sky off to my north east approx 1/4 mile or so away. i pulled off the road into the parking lot where the city of ferguson holds their \"farmers market\" on saturdays. i stopped the car as soon as i turned into the lot. i stuck my head out the window stunned and watched this object for about a minute and then i grabbed my iphone to get a picture. i activated* the camera and went to take a picture and the camera mal-functioned. \r\n\r\nthe object then about as fast as you can snap your fingers was gone, off  to the northeast.  i briefly turned my head and then looked back and the object was there again and even closer now. it was close enough now that i could clearly see the shape, probably about an 1/8 a mile or less away. it was dark gray in color, no lights or sounds at all. it appeared to be a stretched star with 2 points prevalent on each end looking like an introverted ���v��� and 1 small extroverted  ���v��� on each long side (6 points total ). when i got the camera going again quickly, it was in my clear view. when i snapped the picture, it was just about gone completely from my site. i am positive of what i saw, and would be more than willing to take a lie detector or be hypnotized or try any new technology that���s out there, i���m ready.  i know what i saw, i am positive of what it was. \r\n\r\nafter  it was gone ( about 3 minutes later)  i pulled out of the parking lot and was driving north again down florissant road and went right pass the bank and then continued on until i finally came to the corner of florissant road and hereford  rd (about a 1/4 mile pass the bank). it then hit me that i was actually driving my car. i didn���t know i was driving or why i even in my car at all. i didn���t know where i was supposed to be. after about 30-45 seconds i remembered that i was going to the atm to get some money for my daughter. i turned around and continued to the bank. everything was a complete blank in my mind for a short time. i was very scared and thought that there was no way that i was the only one that could have seen this. i was totally shaken. i drove home real quick and tried to draw what i saw. my hand was shaken so bad i had to wait awhile. i couldn���t draw a straight line at all. good thing for ���paint��� programs.\r\n\r\nagain, there is no doubt what so ever of what i saw. it was an experience that i will never forget in my life time. i wasn���t to sure before if i really truly believed in this kind of thing, but i was convinced on that night. i���m not afraid any more, i want to see it again so bad.\r\n \r\n\r\n* the \"camera\" after you select the camera icon, opens and then you must select another option before the camera will fully activate. once you do that the camera is ready to stay on forever. i had the camera fully activated and the object was clearly on the screen and as i pushed the \"take picture\" icon, the \"option icon\" that activates the camera popped up and would not let me take a picture until i pressed it again. the thing is, i already had the camera activated and that should not have come up again. it has never did that before and hasn't done it since. i have tried to make it happen and it just won't happen.\r\n\r\nanyway, that���s my encounter experience.

sky.  looked up, assuming it was a plane.  the sun was glinting off of it very strongly when i first saw it - only the \"nose\" wasn't shining.  it moved deliberately across the sky.  it was lower than all other planes and did not have contrails.  it made no sound.  when i got to kalamazoo i realized it didn't have wings or a fin.  the metal and shape reminded me of old 50's trailers that were all steel/aluminum/whatever.  i thought, \"ufo?\", but didn't really believe it.  i looked both ways, crossed to the turn lane, looked back up, and i couldn't find it.  i searched in the same area of the sky and found it - but it was barely there!  it was a clear blue sky - clouds would not show up for 2 hours - and even though this was very low, it was disappearing.  i could see the outline the clearest, the inside was now the same color as the sky.  i looked at traffic and then crossed (less than 15 feet) and when i got to the sidewalk, i couldn't find it.  it should have been directly ahead of me in the sky (looking northward) i looked in that clear sky for 5 minutes and could find it.  \r\n\r\nno one else saw it.  downtown lansing is full of people at this time of day (state workers) and it was a warm day, so there were many people walking.  i looked around and realized that no one was looking up and that most people don't.  watch people next time you are  out - they are either looking at the ground or at eye-level.  anything could be flying overhead and, if it doesn't make noise, no one's going to see it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

were sitting in my mother's back yard around 2am, catching up on life after high school. there was a short moment where we were silent and just starred away in the direction of the distant airport, and then we saw it. there is no good way of describing this object... imagine a shooting star that is about the size of a marble at arms length from your face..Only this over-sized star is leaving an almost fire-like trail, all the while this high speed object is changing into the most brilliant colors of what you would see in a rainbow. you could even see the changing of colors in its closely dissolving fire trail. this phenomenon was from one side of the horizon to another within seconds before it obstructed by a tree. we both stand to our feet, cursing and yelling the same question at each other. i have always considered myself a very logical person and anyone, had they seen this, would instantly know that it was otherworldly in some way and not to be explained by science as we know it. since then, i spent much more time at the same location, and it has proven such a \"hot-spot\". my interest with each experience grows, as does the amount of unanswered questions. in some instances, we included another friend to partake in star-gazing and have seen many with him as well.\r\n\r\ni would challenge any skeptic at any stake with this location. if no one has seen anything

daughter were just enjoying the nice night. my wife said \" what is that light? \" there was a red/amber fuzzy looking light that had come into view over the roof of the house that appeared to be over the city of murfreesboro about 8 miles away.The light was coming from the northeast heading southwest fairly slow. when it got over murfreesboro, it stopped and moved kinda up and down then right and left and started moving back northeast from which it came only started slowly then got smaller and zipped out of sight very fast . there is no way a plane could move out of sight that fast. there is an airport about 20 mi. up the interstate and we see planes all the time at night. at first i being a skeptic about things told my wife it was just a plane but the more i looked at it , i knew it wasn't a plane and my neighbor said it before i could. he is x military and said rob thats not a plane and we all watched it for the entire time until it zoomed out of sight. we all sat around in amazement trying to figure it out. i tried to get on line to see if anyone else had seen this light over murfreesboro but don't really know where to look. if you find out or have anymore questions

noticed a bright white full moon above.  i look closer and i noticed it had uniform whiteness so i could not see the shade of white or grey that made the \"man in the moon\" face.  it was equally as bright as the normal full moon, bright enough to create a moon shadow.  i looked around and i noticed another moon bright orange rising over my neighbor's house to the east across the street as i looked from the backyard thru the side yard to the front. it had the features that created the man on the moon so i felt it was the real moon.  i looked above again and stared at the white full moon for a few minutes the it made a rapid ascent in the sky.  as it rose it became smaller until it appeared to look like a bright star, then dim star, then disappeared into space.  it reminded me of the star of bethleham when it was at high altitude.\r\n\r\ni was only seven when i witness the ufo i call the moon of memphis.  i had a good memory of the event so when i grew up and joined the air force as a navigator, i was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience.  i estimated that the moon of memphis was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size.  i developed this information from watching the ascent of the moon of memphis and remembering that it also passed through some high cirrus clouds that i estimated was at sixty thousand feet.  at twenty thousand feet it would have taken four 747 aircrafts parked in a circle to cover the area of the moon of memphis ufo thus creating a ten acre size estimate.  when i saw it above me it was exactly the size of the real full moon when seen high in the sky.\r\n\r\n[cms/tg/pid]\r\ncapt usaf / lt uscg retired","distance":"Over One
