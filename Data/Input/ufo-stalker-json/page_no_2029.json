large object but moving rather slowly. there were no contrails from a jet and it was too large to have been a prop type plane. \r\nat times it seem to get very light in color till you almost couldnt make it out then it would become darker and more visible.We continued watching it until it was out of view from where we were. i called the clermont county airport and sheriffs dept to see if anyone else had spotted this. niether of them had recieved other reports.I asked the person with whom i spoke at the airport if it could have been a possible hot air balloon..He said it would be unlikely for the wind conditions..I didnt notice a gondola on the sphere anyway. he said it could have been a large plane. i didnt see any wings, fuselage etc. i didnt have a camera with me just my cell phone so

experience at the house we had just shifted from.I went out alone at night and walked into the woods past a football ground on many nights as a child.I know i was going to the lights but to this day can not remember those nights.Only coming back home would i relise id been somewhere.When it happenned to my sis i knew they were real.About yr later we shifted to an old farm house in an area i now know called'the haunted hills.Where many ufos have been seen over the yrs.I was 9 yrs old when the most memorble ufo was hovering in a paddock out the back of the house we rented,half a mile away.It had just gone dark half hour before.Me n older brother were out the back yard when we noticed it.I said to him'whats that machine over there?A new harvesting machine?That was my first thought.My brother said'its way rtoo big.Then we noticed it was what appeared to be gliding from one end of the paddock to the other end .Like it was scanning the field.Little colored lights were shining on the tall grass .It sort of zig zagged as it moved towards us.Thats when i noticed it had no wheels and it was hovering.It stopped a few times spinning around slowly.It seemed to just come over to us in no time,it hovered about 50-60 metres away from us,but only just hovering above the tall grass..Say 6 to 10 foot from ground.We were at the paddock fence,holding onto ithe wire.My brother totolly freaked out and ran away screaming into the house for mom n dad.I was confused at his reation as i was ammazed by what i was seeing.I just stayd there mesmorised.It hoved near me and spun slowly around,blueish green lights on top but a reddish light underneath.At the corners of the disc shape where big giant windows.They had spokes that instantly reminded me of the peace sign or mercedes benze tail lights had a simalar spoke pattern.I could see wat seemed to be a person moving at one red,orange window.I felt i recognised it before and i guess thats why i had no fear of it.As my whole family ran out to see what was goin on the ufo flew off over the fence tops of the paddock and straight over tree tops.My parents got to see it zipping over the trees leaving a orange glow ass it faded over horizon of trees.Hated my chick brother for givin them up that night.They might have takin me away if not for him freaking out.My sister started drawing eyes in the centre of ppls foreheads.She was only 8 yrs old.Anyway ive seen many sightings since but that was a very close up encounter that still bothers me today.I know they r pychicly connected to some of us.Thats why in the past i never had a problem finding them.I think ive met the bad ones but know there r good aliens too.Demons n angels maybe.After the event i described b4,my parents told us not to talk to anyone at school about it.As it had happenned to mom n dad too.And back in the 60s theyd call ya nuts.But knew others it happenned to to as a kid.Ill talk about my last sightings one day.Thought ill start at

various directions and more circles which felt to me to be almost as if it were dancing in a way. it broke all the basic laws our aircraft are based upon, and looked as if it were just outside the

towards antares in scorpius to judge the seeing conditions i saw what at first appeared to be an airplane. i am within a mile or two of the local airport so i see planes all the time.\r\n\r\nwhat caught my attention was the red flash you usually see on the planes tail. once i glanced over to it i saw a blue glow all around it with a red light in the middle. it really looked like a gas burner you see on stoves flipped over and flying through the air. the blue glow part of it however seemed more like it was contained somehow in a very uniformed pattern and the middle was more an orange color that flashed red on occasion.\r\n\r\nthe blue was really attractive and reminded me of the blue sparks you see from high voltage power line's when they bump each other and cause a spark.\r\nthe red light in the middle flashed once more and the whole object was gone. \r\n\r\nit appeared to be very close to the flight path from the airport and was heading in a northerly direction. it was over a nice bunch of trees before it vanished and did not seem to be more than 500 - 1000 feet off the ground. \r\n\r\n\r\nit made no noise whatsoever and i stood still for a few minutes afterwords trying to rationalize what i just saw. before coming in a real plane happened to fly over so i was able to rule it out as being plane but it also assisted me in estimating its size. i would say it was about 4 times the size of the single engine small planes that fly from the airport, both in length and width.  most of the planes are cessna's but there are a couple of gulf-streams jets that fly from there too and it would have been about twice the size of the gulf stream. i drew a picture as soon as i came in and attached it in hopes someone has seen something similar. \r\n\r\n    ","distance":"101-500

 being that i���m an aviation buff, i pretty sure it wasn���t an aircraft or not an aircraft that i know of.  i sure it wasn���t a type of flare (hand, motor, artillery launched or aircraft dropped).  i���m not sure if the orbs were part of one object or three individual orbs. to me they looked to be part of one object but there was no visible silhouette or superstructure, so i can���t really say that it was. but if the orbs were part of one object, then that thing would have been huge. if they were individual objects, then each looked to have been larger than a larger passenger jet. so do i think i saw a ufo? my answer, in one word would be, ���yes���. would i like to see another one? same answer.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":23687,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2977768,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06102010-0004","longitude":-112.4209564,"occurred":1274760000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1276171731000,"summary":"Three  circlar objects / orbs, amber in color","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":16,"locationName":"Maricopa, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:121338"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Kinnelon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was just after 12 midnight and i was laying in bed with my girlfriend, who was already asleep, as i was just about to go to sleep, i was incredibly startled by a defining vibration/rumbeling in the sky directly over the house. by the time i was able to get out of bed and to the open window, it had professed to making the sound of some sort of winding and whirling, sounded like as if i was standing on the runway when a double decker jet was taking off, it got faster sounding by the second, when i got to the window, all i could see was the area in front of my house slightly lit up, and was only able to hear the object ascending directly up into the sky as if it was moving at 1000s of miles per hour. my brother and his girlfriend were able to hear the object as well, but were both in 2 seprate rooms with no access to windows facing the direction of object. when we went outside to investigate, we had noticed that the tree branches closest to the ground were literaly pushed down anywhere from 3 to 10 feet each, some of them touching the roof of my brothers car. we called the local police and no had reported anything. i would have liked to believe this was an airplane or helicopter at least, but the way it didn't make a sound coming in, and sounded stationary and no more than 75 ft away as it \"turned on\" and ascended made me realize it couldn't have been, that as well as the bent branches. i was extremley disturbed at how incredibly close to the house it was, and was frustrated i couldn't get up sooner to cacth a better look.
