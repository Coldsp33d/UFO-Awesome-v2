States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i was hanging with two close and dear friends on my rooftop at 429 am thursday morning. i live in the hip williamsburg area of  brooklyn. my friends and i had decided to hang out on my rooftop as to not disturb my roommates who were asleep at the time. i have always been a stargazer and avid fan of the ufo phenomena. i'd never seen anything in the sky that surprised or alarmed me in the past. my two companions have been dating for a long time and we had all lived together and worked together at various points in our lives. i had been listening to my female companion talk about an idea she had for an upcoming photography and art collaboration, i was quite sober at the time, i had driven them to my place from a bar down the street where we had decided to meet to discuss some of our ideas for the project. we had been discussing the idea of working together for some time and being night owls, a '3 am to 3:45 am last call' impromptu meeting was not out of the question. we are all self employed night owls and it is completely normal for any of us to be up at that time. so it's now about 429 am thursday morning and i was listening to my female companion talk about some of her interests and current pursuits in photography. we were awaiting another couple to arrive who would be the models for our proposed shoot. suddenly i felt the urge to turn around and look up at the sky. i saw four seemingly massive  lights hovering quite a distance away from where we were sitting. i live directly across from an enormous corporate verizon building headquarters. i was facing that direction, and the city of manhattan from that perspective would be directly behind me. i was watching the four lights, which appeared at  that moment to be above the bushwick, bedstuy area of brooklyn. i quickly exclaimed my surprise at the four odd luminous bright white lights that were being obscured by a thin cloud covering. i am not a good estimator of distance and size ratio while looking at the sky. it could have been a football field in diameter for all i know. being a ufo enthusiast i immediately hoped for the best, and was practically beaming with delight. perhaps the lights were anywhere from a mile to two miles away. we all began to exclaim how exciting this was, and being photographers and iphone enthusiasts we quickly utilized the video app on our devices. i was so calm and quick to take the film, i felt a bit of adrenaline surge as i hit the red record button, to my delight i began capturing the event on video. what luck, as the four lights began to fade rapidly. then, suddenly,  the same four lights reappeared like magic a bit below and to the left of the original formation. it was an extremely dark night, stars were not visible, and neither were any planes or helicopters. we could not find or think of an explanation for this event. although bewildered and perplexed, we were quite happy to see it, we did not feel danger, we felt that we had seen a classic unidentified flying object. was it aliens from space? maybe, though whatever it was  it sure did put a smile on my face and on the faces of my two companions. i'd wanted to see and capture something like this since i was a small kid. i got my wish. i am very happy to have seen this ariel phenomena, but as all good thing things come to an end, just as soon as i'd noticed that object in the sky, we watched in amazement as it fizzled and faded out into the clouds as if it had never been there. \r\nhappy fourth of july\r\nd.R. july 2nd 2017","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

a plane as it just hovered in the air for few minutes and then would go up on a 45 degree angle, hover again. it was not behaving as any aircraft would, there was no noise. i saw it as a light. it landed across other side of a lake on the grass for short time. i felt as if i was awoken and drawn to go and see it. it seemed strange to me in the morning that i had not thought to wake anyone to see it, itor to get a camera and photograph it, it w as if i was under its spell somehow. in the end it took off at a great speed. in the morning i saw a large round depression in the grass on the

approx. 3 foot above a two-storey house, which was hidden from my view because of the shape of the roof. i guess i watched\r\nit for approx. 15 seconds, worried how close it was to the house and street. i would have expected an airplane to fly pass and not remain in the same area but i wasn't thinking about that. i was worried about it being so close.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, the aircraft flew to the right and it became clear within a few seconds that i was seeing no airplane. it was a triangular ufo. it tilted up as it flew to the right and then it stopped in mid-air. it was approx. 6 foot above the 3-storey flat on the right. it covered a large area of the street. i must have watched it in mid-air and motionless for approx. 5 minutes. the only time the ufo made any sound was when i believed it to be an airplane. the ufo had a white light in each corner and they were very much like spotlights, and in the middle there was a large red circle. despite what i was seeing i wasn't scared. during my close encounter i didn't see or hear any traffic, which is surprising considering there are busy roads close to the street. suddenly, the ufo hovered up, again no sound was made and it flew into the sky at a speed, which didn't seem possible and there was no shock wave as far as i could tell. a few seconds afterwards a van drove past, they missed the ufo by just a few seconds. i don't believe i lost any track of time and i haven't had any dreams or nightmares about being abducted by aliens.\r\n\r\ni didn't come public with my close encounter until recently and for reasons i can't explain i never researched the ufo until last year. i was watching a documentary on television about the triangular ufo's and since then i have been doing research about them ever since. the x files' finale episode concluded with the ufo above mulder and scully, leading me to think about my experience even more.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

it came dangerously close to the ground and seemed to be very large when all of a sudden it exploded in the air with the most beautiful and colorful explosion that threw pieces of it in all directions with every piece that was a different color than the other! but what i thought was crazy was that it made no sound that i heard at all! my immediate thought or feeling was is that this is going to be bad or even a global killer type of asteroid! i was literally in fear for my life and my family's as well, including every body in the immediate area too! i never reported it or recorded the time and date and i don't remember when that happened exactly, but i wish i would've so somebody to go out there and possibly find and recover some of the pieces that exploded off of it i am about 99% sure that if you looked hard enough in that direction, you would be able to recover some of the pieces off of it that hit the ground! i seen some of the colorful pieces fall straight all the way to the ground! and now i feel stupid for not ever doing anything about it! but now that i am a member of mufon, which i am very excited about! i will not let something like that happen again and not just record the date and times but get out there maybe with some kind of radiation detector or something and recover some of the pieces that survived the explosion and made it's way to the ground! it was a very profound moment, but i guess it could've just been a regular 'ol  meteor, but it was the most amazing one i have ever seen! if that's what it was. but it had a very powerful look to it although it made not one sound that i heard, and it happened extremely close to where we were!

perimeter patrol officer. i don't remember the actual dates. and other than the incident i didn't think much of it until watching the history channel which i do alot. i seen a drawing of what i thought to be the same thing i seen,so here it is. i was working a unit on i would say on the back side of the prison when a mobil unit called into central control and reported an aircraft hovering over the tree's. the outside supervisor was not able to come at that time. so my shift supervisor called me to go out the back of my unit and report. this is a maximum security prison so all aircraft reports are very serious to us.I stepped out of my unit i would say 2 to 250 yards to my right was an aircraft hovering a tree top height. no lights no sound. the top of the tree's was not being disturbed. i reported to my shift oic that there was an aircraft and it was making no sound just hovering. looks like a airplane and no noticeable markings no lights. it hovered maybe 3 mins then backed away from the institution turning to its left as it did. a report was written and turned into shift oic.  however it was boomerang shape,like the stealth fighter had two white circles oddly larger than what airplane engine's look like where the engine's would be. it made no sound did not disturb not of it's surrounding. no lights at all. 75 miles we have airport. 45 miles we have airbase. really didn't think ufo. however i still don't know what kind of aircraft it was. me an that other officer still talk about that some times even tho i no longer work there. i was there 15 years. and feed back on how many of these type sightings?","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

was at a restaurant  in the south end of town (southdale & wonderland) meeting up with some old teammates of mine that i hadn't seen in quite awhile so i was very excited to catch up with them. i had ordered food and went outside to make a phone call when i saw the darkest storm clouds i had ever seen in my life. i take notice of almost any type of storm cloud as i have a \"theory\" that ufos or government aircraft use large storms as cover to practice maneuvers or do battle with one another, who's going to think twice if they see a bright flash and a huge explosion like sound when a storm is above them. i usually take photos of the clouds if i can and this being the darkest i had ever seen i was definitely taking a picture of it. i watched the clouds move for approxamitley 6 minutes before i went back in the the restaurant and told my friends of the crazy storm that was coming in, almost right after i told them i started getting a very anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach and an impending doom psychological feeling. the feeling got so bad that i asked the waitress if i could get my food to go and told my friends that i had to leave despite not having seen them in a while, the whole ride home it \"felt\" like i was being watched. it wasn't until last week when i was looking through old photos on my computer did i notice the 4 strange lights in the clouds. the lights only appear in the one photo but i have included a second for comparisons.","distance":"Over One
