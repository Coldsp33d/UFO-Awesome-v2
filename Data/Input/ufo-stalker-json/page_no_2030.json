out here at the time..So i went down the stairs..I thought i was going to see red or white lights streaking across the sky like a shhoting star again  ( i always get those every year for my birthday) but it wasnt this time..It was a big black triangle..It came from the west going east..It had red lights on the bottom..If i had 3 latters and stacked them on my roof..I could have touched the bottom of that very annoying thing..It took about 20 mintues for itt to fly over my porch i was standing on..I just watched it fly off even though it was a stupid gift because i learned as a child that if i didnt accept a present,,,white people and lasrge animals and people made of light will come in my home..They scasred all my half sisters and half brother our entire childhood lives..Any way\r\nabout 20 mintues give or take a few..It took that  to fly over me  then it came back about 10 mintues later..This time it came from the north and went west..I never told anyone..But im sure my neighbors have seen things..They follw me all my life..When i lived in macon cort apts  my neigbor had called morehead city police department about a couple of years ago..I found out when people taling outside woke me..I looked out the window and there was 2 police cars and my neirbor mrs obra standing in front of the apt building across from me..I opened the window cause the police was pointing flash lights up on her roof..I heard mrs obra say while pointing to my apt..\"it jumped from that roof to mine\"  anyway i open my window and asked the police what was going on..The woman said \"nothing..She just heard a baby crying\"  i said..On the roof..Then closed my window becase she insulted my intelligence..Im going now..Im hungry..It is now 7:50am..Sometimes on my birthday i get a circle made of red and white lights that will come down and let me touch it..It wont hurt you..And sometimes energy streams that look like a long spiders webwill follw me places..Even at home and at school at the college..At first i thought the enenrgy stream was spiders web..But when i stand in the middle of a street or feild that stream is still coming straight down  from the sky next to me..Very beautiful  but also annoying..But i get stuff almost every week now  not just on my birthday..My stepgad saw the large animals only  when he yell or hit me  they showed up..He stop sleeping or coming in the house i was raised in..My ex husband saw them too my ex boyfriends saw black shadows and one of them couldnt sleep in my apt unless he had the lights on and tv on..But dont worry..As long as you dont try to harm me..They will just let you see them but dont touch you..Not scary ok..Just

leonid meteor shower. not looking for any sort of unusual flying objects, i had seen earlier meteors with the usual leonid characteristics (bright fireballs, ion trails). soon high clouds began to cover the northern sky where i saw the earlier fireballs. i was in a track and field complex observing the shower, so i lied down on the paved running track to get a better plane of view for later meteors. \r\n\r\ni lied down there for a while, and around 1am the meteors began to pick up in amount. some of the meteors were like regular shooting stars and were faint, but others had bright white colored fireballs. during this peak in meteor activity is when i caught movement out of the corner of my eye at the zenith of the night sky.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was a few meteors, but the \"objects\" never faded, didn't have ion trails, and were moving too slow. curious at this point, i looked directly at the faint objects and discovered that they were flying in an equilateral triangle formation. my next conclusion were that the \"objects\" were either landing lights on an aircraft or birds, but there were no blinking lights, distant jet engine noise, or flapping wings. at this point i realized i was looking at genuine ufos.\r\n\r\nwith my curiosity turned from the leonids, i focused my complete attention to the 3 ufos. as i did i realized that these ufos weren't just points of light, but actual flying objects with depth! i could see that they were bronze colored and appeared to be glowing against the night sky with a light similar to the dying orange sparkle of an incendiary. the objects were circular from my point of view as i was looking at their underside, and had grooves in them similar to a plate or phonograph record. i saw no windows in the objects. i assumed that they were lenticular shaped in profile since i saw no antennae or spikes protruding from them, and how they resembled a plate. \r\n\r\ni continued to track them across the night sky, being sure to remember what groups of stars they moved across and what heading the ufo's were taking. the ufos passed through the zenith of the night sky and flew in between the constellations perseus and auriga. i also noted how the objects were moving almost directly north to south. this movement is very similar to something called a polar orbit, which i found very unusual.\r\n\r\nthe entire event lasted approximately 2 minutes as the 3 lens-objects flew through the night sky. the objects neither took off at high speed, nor hovered. they maintained a constant velocity throughout the time i saw them. as the objects moved toward the southern horizon, they began to be drowned out by brown light pollution, but before they disappeared the ufos performed one last maneuver.\r\n\r\nin the southern sky, while maintaining the same velocity as the others, one of the objects broke from the equilateral triangle formation and flew in a more southeasterly direction. the other two ufo's simultaneously maintained their previous positions in the \"triangle\" and continued in their southerly trajectory. i also noted that when the object pulled away, it neither pitched nor rolled like a conventional aircraft. shortly after these maneuvers were completed, the light pollution became too much and i lost site of the objects near the horizon.\r\n\r\ni felt no \"presence\" when i saw the ufos, didn't see any beings, or had the perception of lost time. i saw three unusual craft under some form of intelligence, perform maneuvers that are impossible for conventional aircraft at such a low altitude. in my logical opinion, i saw something truly unusual that needs to scientifically explored further.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

using a camera that had an infra red attachment.  he has a better camera then i do that is 10megapixel. we spent about 45 minutes at this place then moved on to the next cemtery down a series of dirt roads.  while there all three of us noticed a constant humming noise at this cemetery. it was not the interstate as when you live by a road there are occasional breaks in the noise.  we finished up the investigation at the second investigation and headed back to the group leader's house. we uploaded our pictures to our respective computers and procedded to go through the evidence right then and there.  about approximately ten minutes into the review of evidence.  i hear \"what the hell is that?!?\"  coming from the group leader.  i got up and, his wife got up from the computer desk and headed over to his desk and looked at an unusual object hanging in the sky among the trees.  this was unlike anything i had ever seen before. we realized that this photo was taken in the first cemetery.  the picture that was taken in the same spot and in the general same direction before had no such object in it.  it was invisible to us.  while we were in that spot we had to be no more then 25 feet from the object and the group leader speculates that the object was hovering about in the tree tops. observing us.  also noticed in other photographs are humanoid looking faces with two black stripes painted upon their cheeks. it is also worth noting that the group leader and his wife did a previsit to the graveyard about two weeks ago.  when we arrived he commented that their looked to be several dirt patches that were not there previously.  were the aliens investigating us investigating the cemetary? did they follow us to the other cemetary and was that the contant humming we heard?  we may never know the true answer.
