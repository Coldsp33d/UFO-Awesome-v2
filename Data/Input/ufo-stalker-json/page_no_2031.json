at first i thought was the moon. the object lowered to almost ground level then illuminated the area in the woods all around it. we live in a home that is built on the side of a hill and the light was right on top of the hill where we live. after a few minutes i noticed that a beam of light was shining towards the north west and it stayed in that area for approx 3 min. the object then suddently shined a beam of light to the southeast area. the other area that had been illuminated in the opposite direction was then dark. the \"moon\" doesn't shine light in different directions. i woke up my husband and by the time i got back to the laundry room door window to show him what i was witnessing the light had dimmed. it was almost like they were watching me and knew i had gone to get another witness or something. he went back to bed half asleep.... and then is when it started shining a bright light in the two different direcitons (at different times). i woke him up again and he came and looked at it but was so sleepy he just said oh..It's the moon. i pointed out to him that we could only see one side of the tree's that was all lit up and he just said he was going to bed. i watched the light until it disappeared. it appeared to fade then just disappear. the woods are heavy behind our house up on top of the hill and when this object was illuminating the area all the tree's you could see very good. it was scary..I kept going from one window to another window to get a better look at it and trying to get my camera to work.\r\n\r\nhopefully you have had someone else in oklahoma that saw this object. whatever it was it was huge. there was no noise at all. it was a bright white light but big and you couldn't see any outline. i was looking at it through a lot of tree's so it was just a large large light.\r\nthe funny thing about it and the timing i thought might have something to do with the fact that i had started burning some brush piles next to our driveway that is right on the south of where this object was seen the day before. the fire had caught an old oilfield rubber hose that was very long on fire and it had burned very slowly all night. i wondered if this from the air could have sparked the objects attention. the next morning when i went up to look at the area where i'd seen the object i could tell that the rubber hose had continued to burn all night very slowly. the spot where the object was seen is a large open area where we had bulldozier work done the day before to clean up an old oil well site. there was fresh dirt and bulldozier tracks and trac hoe tracks and i only saw one little area that looked funny. it was a half circle with ridges prescisly spaced. i don't know but the track hoe could have made this impression in the dirt. i did take a few pictures of the dirt. during the sighting that early morning when i tried to take pictures my camera's battery was dead. by the time i got it half way charged i only got a few pictures and none showed the bright light, only one picture showed anything unusual and it shows 2 red lights in the upper right hand corner.\r\n\r\nthis was my experience and what i saw.","distance":"101-500

experience with high energies.... myself and my sister and cousin all 3 went outside to cool off and take a breath when i mentioned we should look to the sky for any \"signs\" in just a moment an odd looking light to the south caught my eye... after looking at it for just a few seconds i could tell it was not stable.... it was moving left then right so subtly.. i pointed it out to the two with me and they began to track its odd movements.... it would get brighter... move left and right up and down and a few occasions appeared to move circularly... we noticed it together and all verbally recognized it and so my sister inquired if it recognized us.... at that time the object appeared to move closer enough to see there was not just one light but what appeared to be 3 lights possible 4 that were white and one in the corner that was red....We could almost make out a shape of the arrangements of lights to be almost pod-like sections containing a light per section.... \r\n\r\nonce we had tracked it and gazed in amazement what we were seeing i ran into get my video camera (which of course had no tape in it) and my sister grabbed her small camera and started taping.... it almost seemed that once we got the camera other lights began to appear around the sky with similar movements and right at this time the clouds were increasing very rapidly... the object we originally tracked appears to dissipate into a cloud .... reappearing under the clouds and then behind them... i ran inside again to get my daughter and wife to see if they wanted to see a real life ufo and they came out.... my wife viewed it for about 2 minutes but i dont think my daughter saw much she's 5. they hung out for a few minutes and had to go back inside so i walked them back.....As i  returned back outside i could not see my cousin and sister, they seemed to be in darkness, then out of darkness they ran toward me freaking out saying that a beam of light came toward them , my cousin claims he had an image or message delivered to his brain... i know far out im not sure i can believe that one myself but thats what he claims and after what i saw i wasnt about to argue.They also said they had seen a flash of lightning with no thunder.... i myself had heard strange thunder sounds throughout the clouding event....\r\n\r\nwe three stayed outside while it was clouding to see either the one object appearing in multiple places in the sky in and out of clouds or multiple objects doing the same... at one time i know i saw at least 3 different lights with the same characteristics of the first object we tracked...\r\n\r\nmy two witnesses were getting fairly excited about the whole ordeal so i constantly reminded them to stay spiritually focused on christ and not get overly excited... mainly because i have had one very close encounter (a few hundred feet) from an unidentified light dance followed by 5 miles of following me in the late 90's.... just a few weeks ago i saw a ufo and reported it to you guys in the same area.....\r\ni dont know what else to say except for almost 50 minutes to an hour we watched lights all around our sky moving in and out of visibility.... disappearing in

appeared behind him and i alerted him. the light itself had a strange fiery glow to it that haloed the sky around it. the whole time the light was steady but pulsed slowly brighter, then dimmer. the object hovered for a moment, then proceeded to rise. it made very erratic maneuvers, and at one point stopped in mid air for a few seconds made a sharp right then a tight left at a speed i have never seen a plane make before (i don't live too far from avoca airport and have seen planes my whole life). after a few more zig zag motions, it took a curved path left, giving up on the sky bound path it was on. at this point i was able to get a fairly good look at it. it was defiantly circular (but the light halo gave it a slightly elongated shape), with 1 row of lights (4 or 5)that stayed a steady orange and 1 light that kept flaring up. it then flew behind a cloud and never came back out. this lasted approximately 2 and a half, 3 minutes. \r\n\r\n     less then 5 minutes later another appeared rising very slowly off the horizon off the left, moved towards the direction of the first one (my right), stopping several times along the route. it the took the same course as the first but started to (dim?) out. the section of sky it was in was clear and you could easily see the stars in the sky. by the time it got to the same clouded area it looked like a star, but also had a slight lazy zig zag pattern like the first. it dimmed out completely before it reached the cloud.\r\n\r\n     i have never seen anything like that before in my life. besides myself and my friend, his girlfriend, his niece, and his mom all saw it.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

to a commercial jet airplane heading northeast.  this immediately drew my attention.  i am a private pilot and never have seen anything fly so close to a commercial plane.   i thought it might be a military aircraft, but it was disc shaped and left no contrail like the commercial jet.  the sky was mostly sunny with a few high clouds and the commercial jet contrail was very visible.  \r\n\r\ni stood up to get a closer view and called over two of my relatives also on the porch to look.  they both saw the object.   we watched the object hover above the airplane, then ascend at about a 70 degree angle out of view. \r\n\r\nafter we all drew pictures of what we saw and talked about it to the relatives that weren't on the porch (each taking a turn to describe it).  the consensus was that the object was a disc and very shiny either white or metallic (the white plane looked dull in comparison); the disc flew tipped slightly on one end; the disc maintained a consistent speed and altitude above the airliner for at least 20 seconds; the disc then ascended at about a 70 degree incline and appeared to rise faster than the speed it traveled over the airliner; the disc didn't leave a contrail either over the airliner or when it accelerated as it was rising. \r\n\r\nwe tried to think of all explanations for what the object could have been:  a weather balloon, a military jet, etc. and could find nothing that fits.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

development off of i25.  the sky was very cloudy and i was looking in my rear view mirror at the clouds above the mountains behind me.  some of the clouds were dark and some were bright white.  when i turned left into neighborhood, i had a view of the western sky.  that is when i noticed 3 white objects in the sky.  they were closer than an airplane and well below the clouds.  then they seemed to flip end over end in formation and turn black with a bright white edge or outline.  they were distinctly separate but in near perfect formation.  my daughter said they were birds because of flight formation.  my son thought it was a military air show.  i was thinking what the heck is that.  maybe hang gliders?  but they were moving from south to north across the western sky at the same altitude and not getting lower.  they seemed to be flipping end over end changing from bright reflective white against the dark clouds to the outlined black.  the shape of each individual object was kind of boomerang but they were all 3 together in the shape of a triangle.  they moved rather slowly and we watched them until i pulled into my driveway.  the neighbor was walking out of his house, so i stopped him and asked \"what the heck is that in the sky\"  it took him about 10 seconds to locate what we were seeing.  he had no idea what it could be either.  we laughed about it being ufos.  we watched this for about 5 minutes until they disappeared behind the houses into the north western sky.  they never got closer or higher.  they just seemed to vanish.\r\nimmediately i went inside and posted this on my facebook page.  i wanted to document what i saw.  then i started to look on the internet for sightings in fort collins.  a couple of them matched my description, but on different dates.  i am left wondering \"what the heck was that?\"  maybe if i was another day, someone else will have reported it and i wont feel crazy anymore.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
