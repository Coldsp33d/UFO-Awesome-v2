moving in from the northwest and i saw a single plane like bluish light moving through the very bad lightning and watched it wondering what the heck a plane was doing flying directly through the storm. \r\n\r\nthe storm had to be at least 10 miles away and the light i first saw moving through it was behind it coming towards my direction, but it came on very fast. fast enough that before i realized it had gotten closer i could see something that at first appeared to be a triangular shape or diamond shaped outline against the approaching storm clouds. it looked like it stopped and i guess made a complete 90 degree turn and then flew right over my head. \r\n\r\nas it flew over i could distinctly see it was a rectangular shaped craft and see the lines of it's construction as well as markings underneath (couldn't quite make the markings out but they looked like something an aircraft would be marked with). in the center of it i could still make out the bluish light and could lightly see what looked like red squares in each corner and still faintly make out the square outline of the craft but if i hadn't been so curious about seeing a 'plane' flying through a bad lightning storm it pretty much completely blended in with the sky. doubt anyone else would be able to make it out unless they spotted it by chance and were watching.\r\n\r\nit was fast and silent. couldn't estimate how high up it was since i am not sure what type of aircraft you could compare it to but judging by how high it was coming through the storm i'd have to say pretty big for me to see that much detail as it went overhead. bigger than any kind of aircraft i have ever seen.\r\n\r\nwhen i realized i was looking at something strange i went to get my cell phone to take a picture or something but it was way gone. last heading towards the direction of galveston bay.\r\n\r\ni'm sure it was military. confident of it. just had a familiar kind of 'feel' to it as it went overhead.\r\n\r\nwould love to know what it was though, and would like them to explain how they got that kind of technology in the first place.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia,  Wings,  Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

the flickering or the flame. there were no other strobe/marker lights that would normally be on a plane. i pointed it out to a few others in the parking lot and no one had a viable explanation. i remember hearing about an incident similar to this where people called into a local police station and it turned out to be parachutists trailing something on fire. this object did not apear to be descending. it was making slight course changes though as if someone was piloting. i watched this object for about 5-7 minutes as it slowly got farther and farther away. just when i was about turn away a second object came over the trees at about the same altitute/position as the first. it seemed to follow the first object but with a mile or two separation. this second object was exactly like

lots of open sky.  \r\n  upon seeing the movement,  i focused my view toward the object and tracked it as it moved through the sky.  it seemed to be moving at cloud level as it appeared to flash in and out of the clouds.  i assumed it was a plane but the speed of the object peaked my interest, i was just hoping to see what sort of jet this was.  as it moved toward the bright moon, it broke through into the luminescence and was illuminated.  \r\n  i can only describe it as a bullet shape.  it left no contrail or other type of trail, it simply was moving through the sky.  i recall a sharpish point and a flat backside.  as it broke into the light of the moon, i recall being impressed by the size and look.  it just seemed sleek and shiny.   \r\n  the object continued along heading

gazing in the backyard. i noticed this star that seemed to be shinning awfully bright.  we watched it through the telescope.  it did not move.  then more lights appeared around it.  they flash real bright, then dim out, then reappear, sometimes in a different spot, and sometimes appearing to move. it seemed odd to us, so we started watching for them.  my wife takes pictures each time we see them, to show what we are seeing and record the dates. we saw them again on april 12 and april 27.  then on may 5, 2010 we decided to drive in the direction we are seeing them.  i took the video camera and zoomed in as much as possible on one of the lights.  my wife took pictures of the surrounding lights.  we watched the video of the lights frame by frame and noticed that within the ball of light there seemed to be some sort of cylinder structure.  we were amazed at what we saw.  while searching the internet for other similar sightings, we came across mufon, and clifford clift.  i met with him and gave him a copy of my video. we saw the lights again about 2 more different times after we talked to cliff, no pictures or video these times. then on may 21 we had some friends over and they appeared again.  our friends are as amazed as we are.  our friend videoed some with my video camera.  then on may 31, 2010 we saw them again.  this night i caught some of the best video.  i zoomed in as much as possible and focused on one light.  next thing i know another light appears right next to it.  after reviewing the video, i noticed that the second light that appears actually flew in (very dim) from the left and stopped at the top right of the first light, then lights up as bright as the first.  both of these lights seem to have the same cylinder structure. i called clifford again to let him know of the video.  he had refered me to speak with cheryl gantz.  she asked me to report to mufon what we have been seeing.  then on june 2, 2010 we saw them again.  \r\n\r\neach time that we see the lights, it seemes to be after 8:00p.  usually we notice 2-5 lights, lasting from about 15-45 minutes, then they just disappear.  they flash very colorful lights, starting off yellow/orange then red, blue, green, purple. they do not appear in the same area each time. and their actions are different each time, sometimes sitting still, blinking out, reappearing, sitting together, or moving apart.  at times they move very slow and other times possibly as fast as a plane, maybe faster.  i also notice that at times they seem to try to appear as a plane using the blue and red lights.  we truely all very excited for what we keep seeing!\r\n

did the same but took off north. i'm not a pilot so i can't state distance but to me the objects were not that far away.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

street around 300 south.(downtown) i don't really know the exact date.\r\ni was outside on the front lawn talking to two friends. it was a beautiful clear night and we were looking at the stars and i noticed this shape. i tried to point it out to my friends but they could never find the shape. i looked away several times and was able to find it again fairly easily. both my friends had complained about their poor eyesight but i had been tested previously and found to have extremely good sight.  my first thought was that it was some type of aircraft. i don't know what it was so i will try to be factual from here on.\r\n\r\na triangular shape crossed the clear night sky to the east, toward and possibly over, mount timpanogos. it had no marking lights and no noise. it blocked out the stars behind it and was only visible because it was slightly lighter than the night sky. it moved at a constant and steady rate of speed and moved in a straight line from south to north until it finally faded from view.  now it is difficult to tell the distance of things at night and when they are dark also. my impression was that it was at a cruising altitude similar to that of an airliner. mount timpanogos reaches about 12,000 feet (over a mile high off the valley floor) and i would say this had to be quite a bit higher. now if this assumption is close to accurate i would say the size of this shape was maybe four times the size of an airliner at that same distance and was moving about three times faster, based on a casual comparison to the planes seen during the daytime.\r\n\r\nafter the object faded from view i made a few suggestions about what it could have been and noted that it had no marking lights. i mentioned that it was traveling in what i thought to be a commercial flight path and i wouldn't think the military would be doing exercises there. it was a curious and interesting side note to the evening. \r\n","distance":"Over One

my kids were kind of freaked out by it.  at the corner of my street is a factory with a 4-5 story high chimney, this object went around the chimney and kinda started hovering by the tree line.  i had my camera with us for the school event and so i started snapping pictures.  it started to move away from where we were parked, so we got in the car and started chasing it.  we followed it down a street of industrial factories, and i pulled into a lot with a clear view of where this thing was \"hovering\" i got out the car and snapped a few more pics and tried to take video of it.  i called  a few of the workers over who were looking at me like i was crazy and wondering what i was doing there, until i showed them the object in the sky.  they were all looking at the object and wondering exactly what it was we were looking at fly slowly across the sky.  it stopped and seemed to be hovering over a shopping plaza, and i got my kids back in the car and tried to chase it down by time i got to the shopping plaza, (which is only a five minute drive from where we were at)  it was long gone.  very weird, my daughter and i both though we saw it slightly change shape and it was very odd. never ever saw anything like this before ever!!!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":23579,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.5061754,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06012010-0010","longitude":-81.6941188,"occurred":1275085800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1275451921000,"summary":"Black solid small 3 d shaped triangle looked as if it changed from triangle to pyramid","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23579_submitter_file1__100_2729.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23579_submitter_file2__100_2728zoom.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23579_submitter_file3__100_2727.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4,"locationName":"Cleveland, Ohio","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:123423"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Glendale","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First silver object was straight up but slightly west, 30-40k ft altitude and stationary, then moed behind clouds.  further nw another object stationary then took off to nw, looked like it was tumbling and flashing; refleting light, not illuminating.  went behind clouds.  third object seen slightly to the north, eventually went into clouds.  then 5 objects appeard slightly to the northeast. much higher, perhaps 60-70k ft altitude.  they appeared to be dots of flashing light.  moved off to the north in a formation.  then a ninth object, which looked elongated, seemed to be falling straight down out of the sky, no tumbling motion.  went below the cloud cover and was south of the others.  all this over metro, downtown phoenix: 75th avenue and thomas road.  more than myself witnessed this.  i called dr. lynne kitei, the employer of my fiance.  she then called stacey wright and jim mann of phoenix mufon.  stacey called me back and i reported all the above to her, verbally.  i do not have a computer to report this to mufon, so i gave permission to stacey to document and report this sighting.
