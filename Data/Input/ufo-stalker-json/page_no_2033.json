my attention.  i went to the window & saw what i thought to be a satellite that looked like a star.  i watched it for a while to discern what it was & if it was moving.  the object was bright & was far above the tree line.  i saw light beam down from the object just below it & a ring of circles of light & then it was back to just the object again.  it did this several times.  i also saw light radiate from it & lighting up the sky in one direction from the object as if it put on its headlights.  approx 15 minutes went by & the object was just at tree line & then disappeared behind the trees.  it moved irradically with quick movements & then just hover.  it moved from side to side & up & down.  it seemed to move so that it would not be noticeable unless you were watching it.  i went & got my binnoculars.  i noticed another bright star in the west but higher up.  i looked through my binnoculars & saw a yellow sphere & it was spinning in one direction from down to up.  as it turned i saw it was covered in brighter yellow circles of light.  it was like a burning radiating tiny planet only it was not a natural made object.  i could only see this detail with the binnoculars.  this moved in the same way but remained in the same general area for the duration of time i watched it.  for about a half hour then i went to bed.  i've been seeing these objects that i describe as mimicking stars for 20 plus years but i have never seen a spinning yellow light sphere or the detail i saw through binnoculars.  it must have been closer then the ones i viewed in the past.  i would imagine it is very large up close.  i feel disturbed by seeing this up in the night sky as people sleep & wonder what it is & what it is doing.  it alarms me that this is taken place covertly.  it is obvious to me that our government & the technology we have would detect this & that alarms me that our own world governments remain covert as well.  but i was able to just go right to sleep after all this.  i thought i wish it wasn't right above my home.  i woke up this morning & it was heavy on my mind so i did an internet search & for the first time i am reporting it.  it was just incredibly bizarre to see what i saw through binnoculars.  sorry i don't have a camcorder.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

scheduled for about 10 pm, so we decided to get together for a practice beforehand. we met, practiced, and as we were leaving i looked at my watch, which said 10:08 (we were late). there were a total of 5 of us, but we traveled in two cars to carry the equipment. three in one car, two in another. i was in the car of three, and as were were driving south down north market st. in chattanooga, i looked out the left passenger window to see if it might look like rain and noticed something unusual. \r\n\r\nthere were three lights in a perfectly triangular arrangement. the rear two were bright white with hints of yellow, and the front light was red. it seemed to be at about the altitude of a normal plane, but seemed to be altering its course somewhat, making unusual turns. as it passed over our car, i called attention to it and told my friends to look at out the other window (right side) it as it passed over. we all then looked out the other side, and saw another strange object, this one diamond shaped. it consisted of 4 very bright lights in a diamond formation and was flying quite low--about the level of a search helicopter. \r\n\r\nmy friend immediately pulled over, and we all got out of the car to watch these two objects. upon first reaction, i thought the object resembled some sort of lantern on fire or an unusual type of fireworks display, but it became clear in seconds that is was neither. the diamond kept gliding and the triangle passed over it, though much higher in th sky. both objects were completely silent, which was the most chilling aspect, as the diamond was so low to the ground, perhaps just over the treetops. it is difficult to say how large it was, or how to compare it, but i'd say it may have been about like a car turned vertically, floating in the air. as they kept moving, their orientation must have changed or certain lights must have gone out, because the diamond at one point suddenly became two very bright lights side-by-side and began rising in altitude. though it was dark, i knew the general direction it was heading and it appeared to be going toward signal mountain, about 10-15 miles away. \r\n\r\nthe triangle continued to travel as well, and as it continued, the two whitish back lights disappeared and only the front red light remained visible as it traveled away from us. i suppose it is possible that it could have been a red tail light of some sort? both objects eventually disappeared, the diamond rising constantly in elevation until they were out of sight. the three of us stood there in disbelief, and for the remainder of the evening, none of us could shake the images. we told numerous people once we reached the club and their reactions have prompted me to make this report (the first i have ever made). this was certainly the most unusual thing i have ever seen and never seen anything that even resembled either object.

of 3-4 ford explorers.  it had four distinct lights: 3 red in a row along a leading edge and 1 green.  i first observed this object moving in different directions in the night sky.  changing directions and altitudes.  then a larger object appeared that was lit underneath with white lights but i could not determine the size of this object other than to say it was large.  these two objects at time flew separately and at times in formation.  at one time both disappeared from sight going east.  after about 15 minutes the larger object appeared in the west going east.  as i followed it going toward the lake i witnessed the smaller object detaching from the larger object and going to the northwest.  \r\nthe next night, saturday, these two objects appeared again.  the smaller of the two was the most visible over time.  at one time in the observation the smaller object appeared to be hovering over schaumberg (a guess) and from where i was it was a small dot and appeared to be oscillating from red to green.  near the end of the viewing on saturday i got my best look at the smaller vehicle as it passed from the west to the east in front of me.  the smaller one was behind the bigger object seeming to be flying in formation.  as they headed east the smaller one got closer and closer to the larger object and at one point either docked or was taken aboard or something of that nature as there no longer was two objects but just the larger one.  it continued east until it was out of site. \r\nit appeared to me that what i saw was a base ship that launched a smaller vehicle to move about a region and then dock to move unto some other location.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with

usually look at the stars to see if i can spot a planet when a deep red star caught my eye. it was the only thing visible in the sky and i thought to myself \"that is way too red to be a planet\". i'd never seen anything so red in the sky, it almost made me afraid. all of a sudden, it started moving slowly, taking the path the airplanes do around my house. i watch them when i'm out at night, but this one was different. it's blinking seemed to try and mimic the airplanes, but it was round and moved differently. i always see planes blinking from the bottom, but all of it was flashing. it's like it was trying really hard to move slowly and blink at the right times, it's hard to explain. i followed it until it was out of my sight. i know it wasn't an airplane because it stood still in the air for ten to fifteen seconds not \"signaling\", just a deep red. it was hypnotizing. i lost sight of it because my neighbor's trees got in the way. i now am on mufon writing down my \"sighting\". it was just about two minutes, i didn't have a camera on me, and i was confused. society makes you feel wrong for seeing one so maybe i'm trying to convince myself i didn't see what i saw. i've had a legitimate sighting before when i was around 12 in the early 2000's so i'm not as choked up as one would be. it's a little upsetting that it happened again, i just feel uncomfortable and nervous and wish i hadn't seen anything. anyway, thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nps,\r\nmy brother was riding home from a friend's house and told me after i told him what i saw tonight that he noticed a bright light in the sky that didn't seem to belong there. don't know if this helps, it could have been the same thing i saw, we're both good at spotting planets and airplanes and he said it didn't look like either. just thought i'd add that in.

for my 3 year old grandson at the stephenville city park in stephenville, texas.  i would occasionally look up at the sky because there was an approaching thunderstorm headed our way from the north west.  as i was scanning the sky, i noticed, off to the east, what appeared to be a floating object, possibly an advertisment banner, but there was no airplane pulling the banner.  it was headed in our direction and the closer it got, i was able to get a better view.  at this time, i asked my son to record the object on his camcorder.  he zoomed in on the object and we were able to record at least 45-47 seconds, and then my son quit recording because his battery was low and he wanted to save the battery to record the birthday party.  i pointed the object out to others around me and no one knew what it was, nor had anyone ever seen anything like it before.  the object was in the shape of a long blimp, but it was not a blimp-it was moving as if it was floating ever so slowly towards the west.  as it floated, it changed shapes with jerking movements, it swayed back and forth, sideways, and up and down.  it was clearly mechanical movements that our government could only wish they had.  the object and its movements were totally out of this world. this continued with jerking movements which seemed to follow the swaying, s-shape, back and forth, sideways, then up and down again until it was out of sight.  once the object was out of sight, i took my grandson over to the playground.  all of a sudden, out of nowhere, there was a man sitting on a bench next to the playground.  the man appeared to be staring through me.  i strongly felt like he was either reading me or implanting me, or both, so much so that the hair on my neck stood straight up.  i turned for a split second to grab my grandson and turned back to look at the man, but he was gone.  i could see for at least 100 yards around me and the man was nowhere to be found.  by the time i walked back to the picnic table, i had severe flu-like symptoms.  i told my wife we needed to get home.  we drove 30 minutes to comanche.  as soon as i got home, i laid down on my bed.  i was very dizzy, i had stomach cramps, diarhea, chills, and sweating.  i fell asleep for only 5 minutes, but it seemed like 8 hours.  i then woke up feeling great as if nothing was wrong with me.  i have, since then, had many dreams of ufos, aliens attacking earth.  i have also had many ufo sightings since then.  i have attempted to attach the video which contains the 45 seconds of the object-please view.

sky we go outside before bed time and look at the stars and smoke to see if we see something else and like clock work about every three days or so and sometimes night to night we see a strange wight or some times yellow colored sphere shaped object darts across the sky this time they are not as close to the ground as our first sighting. most of the time we will see the light as it flies toward the house like it is descending and then all of a sudden it will drift back upwards and out of the atmosphere. it even sometimes just darts upwards and dissapears. the one we saw two nights ago we were tracking a satalite and then my wife spotted a bright white light that she thought was a star moving around the ursa minor stars near kocab. it then vanished and about 1 minute later we spotted it again and then it bursted a bright white light as if it was a meteor burning up in the atmosphere for like 2 seconds and then faded into a dim ball and instead of descending like a meteor it started to drift upward until the light got so small it dissappeard into the ursa major stars near dubhe. we were realy excited as we have been seeing strange lights for a while but not with the capabilities of this one. we are going to continue to look when the weather clears up and try to video tape it.","distance":"Over One

and astrophysics i always point out the constilations and planets and satellites to her. on this paticular night it was very cold and the skies were clear and is i was showing here venus and polaris she asked me \"what that star was\" as i lookes i was astonished to not know it seemed stationary at first but we noticed it was getting brighter. it had a spherical shape and was an amber color and was a constant brightness.I thought it may have been a helicopter at first since we live next to fort stewart georgia and hunter army air field is not that far away. i myself am in the military and now how to identify each at night time. besides there were air planes that flew behind it as if it wasnt even there and thats how we new it was a point of origin fro space but actually flying towards us. it mad now sounds and then occasionally flew up and down fast. i tried to video tape the object it wouldnt show up on the screen the closer i zoomed in the more distorted it got. from what we could tell with the airplanes and helicopters flying by it it looked about triple the size of any conventinal air craft.We went back inside to see if it was just us or an annomaly. we came back outside at 2200 and 2300 and it was still outside but closer and doing the same irratic movements. we never lost sight of the object but after 3 hours of watching we decided to go to bed since it didnt appear to be threatening. i got up to use the restroom around 0315 the next morning and looked outside and the object was gone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(i dont know how to attach the file) and video taped them for about 5 minutes.  \r\n\r\nthe objects appeared to be over camp williams (reserve base).  what was so strange was the way that they were
