i usually look at the sky since i have seen several unidentified objects in the past. sometimes i will take my night vision monocular outside with me. using the night vision scope i am able to see stars and satellites that are not normally seen with the naked eye. this night i ran back inside to get the scope since the sky was so clear.\r\n\r\nmy husband had taken the dog inside and i stayed outdoors to search the skies for anything of interest. it didn't take long before an object caught my eye.\r\ni was looking almost straight up toward the northeast with the scope when i saw an object that appeared to be extremely high up moving slowly to the northeast. i was unable to see this object without the use of the night vision scope and it was about the size and shape of the dimmer stars that are also only visible through the scope.\r\n\r\ni noticed this object would be dim for approx. 4-5 seconds and then would brighten somewhat slowly (it did not flash quickly on and off) staying bright for only a second or so and would then slowly dim again appearing like the background stars for another 4-5 seconds. this process would repeat over and over for the duration of the sighting, never wavering. \r\ni tried to see if the object was visible without the scope but was never able to see it even when it brightened unless i used the scope. \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object i assumed right away it was just another satellite until i noticed that it was moving much, much slower than the other satellites that i have seen. then when the brightening and dimming was noticed i knew for sure it could not be a satellite. i became very anxious and excited when i realized i could not identify this object.\r\n\r\neventually, i lost sight of it. because i had been watching the object almost directly above me, my neck had been hurting pretty bad. i had been taking small breaks to rest my aching neck, keeping the scope in the direction of the object all the while. after about 4 minutes of watching the object, when i went back to look at it, it was gone. i searched the vicinity in which it had been traveling and i was no longer able to see it. if it had kept moving at the same pace, i should have been able to see it being there was nothing to block my view. after looking for the object for another 3 minutes i gave up.\r\n\r\nthere was no way for me to gauge the size or altitude of this object given that it was only visible through the scope although, i believe it was in space and not within the earth's atmosphere.\r\nthere were both small, private aircraft and commercial airliners in the sky at the same time as this object and the differences were obvious. this was definitely not an airplane. \r\n\r\ni reported this sighting to nuforc the next day but when i saw the mufon report from lehigh acres that resembled what i had seen, i felt it necessary to report it here as well. it always helps to know that you may not have been the lone witness to an event like this.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

saw in the sky a small and round unknown object that appeared to be light orange in color that quickly changed to a dull white color which instantly disappeared.  the sighting was very brief of about 1 or 2 seconds, and it also seemed as if it moved very fast a short distant possibly a meter or less.  i took 1 blind picture through the tinted, screened window where the object was once located.  i then went outside to located the object but with no success.  i then auto-focus on a distant palm tree then switched to manual focus.  i then proceeded to take several random pictures of the general area of the sky where the unknown object was once seen.  2 pictures taken outside shows an unknown object that match identically in size (but not in color) to the 1 unknown object picture taken inside the house.  i also caught other unknown objects in the random pictures which i am presuming those black unknown objects to be birds flying in the sky.\r\n\r\n  then at 1:15 pm, i saw a balloon drifting in the wind when i looked out the window, and i decided to take some pictures of the white balloon. while taking some pictures of a white balloon that was drifting with the wind, i saw several pea size white objects that zip through the picture frame viewing area traveling what seems to be across the wind.   i followed 1 object with my camera taking pictures of it which i quickly begin to realize that unknown object was actually traveling with the wind.  seeing earlier a huge dandelion seed mass floating in the wind and getting pictures of it, i suspected that small white unknown objects seen with the balloon may possibly be the dandelion seed mass floating in the wind.  however, some of the pictures of the unknown object has some similarities to the globe ufo thereby makes this sighting undecided in identification of the unknown object .\r\n  from what i seen in the past when viewing a dandelion's fluffy seed mass floating in the wind, it can appear  bright white at a far distant which therefore may also be possibly mistaken for an ufo when seen moving in the air at a far distant.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":23542,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4524071,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05312010-0002","longitude":-112.0685673,"occurred":1275161520000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1275303658000,"summary":"Appearing

looking at the object for some time noticing it's odd blue color that was about the size of a planet. it was in the ene sky and i hadn't been noticing any planets in that direction for the past few nights. upon closer inspection my husband and i noticed that there were several blinking lights shooting around it. the colors of the lights ranged from blue to green to red. when we looked around the rest of the sky we could see it was happening in our entire viewing area, it also looked like there were faint lines connecting dots in the sky. i had a third party view the sky to make sure that we were really seeing something and that person noticed said phenomena too. the orb seemed to float in the area. it didn't stay fixed, but it had a very fluid movement about it. when we went inside the phenomena was still happening. we were a little unnerved and decided to stay inside and report it. it had an oddly appealing feeling and made us want to watch, but like i said we ended up feeling a

nothing but desert. when i turned to look at it almost comepletly disappered, so i turned away but i caught this light again at the corner of my eye so i looked for the second time, but once again it almost disappered so as i started to look away i could see it again. that is when i realized that i could only see it from the corner of my eye only. when i started to watch this light it was doing crazy things in the sky figure 8's and very sharpe turns at first, then it would stop and almost float in the sky. then it would up in to one of the scrattered clouds in the sky and light the cloud up in a dark blue color ( by the way all i saw was a light during this whole sighting was a light no object and it was a none twinkling blue light.)then it would shoot a cross the sky very fast in a matter of 3 seconds if even that. then it would shoot up to a high alittiude then shoot down to a low one. then it got very weird it would start to shoot across the sky then disappear and reappear in a compeletly diffrenet spot and that when on for a good 20 mins everything this object was doing i have never see do by a man made craft before. during the last 5 mins of the craft flying around i realized that the airplane pattern change from the normal which almost flys over my house to head to phoenix sky harbour airport. i could not find a plane in the sky normally there would be one every 2 mins. as the sighting came to a close do to cloud cover coming in at that time it looked like there was one to made two fighter jets in the area of light. they more then likely came from luke air force base. the very last thing i saw , was the light stopped and was just floating almost like kinda watching the fighter jets or at least i think there were fighter jets the cloud cover took over the sky and lost the sighting at 1910.I would like to note that i have only seen one other signing in my life which i reported on this web site it took place on 9/10/93 at 2030 hrs. there was one thing in common with both sightings that very weird color of blue light, it gave a chill down my back when i saw it again. i have never seen a that type of blue light on any aircraft

looked to the north west sky and i noticed a strange and very out of place light just sitting there not too far above the tree line. it was very bright, brighter than all the objects in the sky at that time. our drive home is approx. 10 mintues, and at that time, we decided to park in the church parking lot around the block from our home and look at the light some more. it was about 10:10pm when we arrived at the church. i took 3 pictures there, all of them blurry & unfocused, so we decided to head home & grab my tripod. at 10:27pm i had set up my tripod in the middle of my street & snapped the following image. at 10:28pm i snapped an additional image. at 10:29pm the object disappeared. my fiancee was watching as the light vanished. what he described was the light shrunk in size to a very small, almost to a pin-tip size light then it was gone. i was in the process of setting up my camera to take another video when it disappeared. i have the one shot of the light which is very clear & the other shot is the same image, just zoomed in 10x's.\r\nthe light itself as it sat in the sky was flashing or strobing red and white. it seemed to grow in size, then shrink again, only to get large then small again. colors never changed to anything other than white and red, and the red was not very prominent, but visable. seeing it made us feel very anxious, a little nervous, and excited because it was my second sighting in two weeks and my first time with my camera and my fiancees first time seeing anything like this, ever.\r\n\r\ni am looking for someone who could possibly take the image & clean it up a bit, maybe remove some of the pixelation & let me know what it is i really saw.\r\n\r\nas of right now, i am convinced that what we saw was a ufo... until other wise

\r\n\ti didn't see any distinct blinking lights like those from an airplane or any other common aircraft.  the individual lights would somewhat pulsate in intensity but not a true blink. one light would get brighter though the light didn't radiate outward to appear any larger, just brighter, as another would dim in unison. they seemed to ���take turns��� dimming/brightening. i don't recall seeing any odd colors just white/yellowy lights.\r\n\tas i turned onto the freeway ramp i lost sight of it for a moment then regained sight of it to my right as i was heading north. at this point it seemed as if the formation had slightly shifted but gone up a bit higher in altitude, though still too low to the ground for this to be a military type plane formation maneuver.  now the northernmost light was slightly lower than the southern pointing light and it appeared closer to the center light, like how the perspective would warp if you had a solid triangular object and pivoted it slightly clockwise. \r\n\tat this point a fourth light appeared just barely above the tree line and even further back in the south direction than the back corner of the triangle and much lower. this light seemed brighter and larger than the other three and seemed almost to be a tail???  upon a quick glance at this point it would almost appear as if the little dipper had lost part of it's tail, it's bottom star, gotten very close to the earth and hovered there above oregon city. \r\n\tunfortunately i was not in a position to stop and shoot footage as i was running late for work. i called home quick to see if my husband could see it but he could not even though we are on a slight hill. the object was just hovering too low for it to be seen from many locations.  i say object, yet strange thing is i didn't see any solid object holding these lights in this formation. it was by far the oddest thing i have ever seen! i have looked all over the internet, called news channels and even the local dispatch and no one else seems to have reported this. this is why i'm posting this here. i am not crazy or anything but some verification that anyone else saw this would ease my mind!

bright, i had to brake as i was afraid i would run into it.  i looked in my rearview mirror and remember thinking - if i stop in the middle of the highway, i will get hit by cars coming behind me.  i glanced at the radio clock (don't remember the exact time), but it was around 11pm.  at this point, the car is completely stopped in the middle lane southbound on route 93.  i could not look at the

at the clock - it was now 1120.\r\n20 minutes had passed and i could not account for the time lost.  i drove the car off the highway at the next exit, and i was so shaken by the experience, my legs

moved closer to us.  finally it dimmed and we lost sight of it. so, let hubby into apt. we were both in awe cause we couldn't believe what we saw. then i went back to the railing. looked for about 20 seconds and saw it again. this time, it was moving away from me (south) and again moving erratically (almost like a really tight fast jerky movement right left still moving forward).  i watched it for about 3 minutes and then suddenly i saw a flash move what i believe to be in front of it moving east to west. it just kept going and i couldn't follow the flash. i thought i saw another craft next to the one i had been tracking originally, but right after that flash i lost sight of everything. i went back out later but i've seen nothing in that general area. i even tried binoculars. as far as feelings, i just thought this is so cool and was just amazed and wanted to see more. i called a friend to tell her what happen.","distance":"Over One

south.  it was still light out, but later in the day.  the sky was quite cloudy.  i was in the passenger seat and was talking to my friend while he was driving.  i just so happened to look up in the sky and noticed something coming down through the clouds.  at first i didn't think much about it and just kept talking while still fixated on the object. the object kept lowering itself becoming more and more visible.  i couldn't place in my mind what the object was exactly...So, i asked my friend what he thought it was.  he leaned over the steering wheel to look up to see it.  both of us had no idea what it was.  by the time we both looked up at it and tried to gauge it's size, it moved straight back up into the sky and because of the clouds we didn't see anything else.  we both agreed that it was about the size of a football field.  we rushed home to tell my parents, but they thought we were ridiculous and we never talked about it again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

saw a shooting star but it came closer then i thought it was a bird then it flew right over us and both of us were tripping out trying to figure out what it was. it didnt make a sound, it was like a white v flying backwards. you know how you see birds flying, it was oposite of that. there was no engine sound or anything and it looked like a white boomerang but alot bigger, the size of mabey a sesna plane. as far as i know, nobody has a plane that doesnt make a sound and flies backwards and if the government is building these wierd things they should tell the citizens so we dont freak out thinking its not from this world..We didnt see it again we ran in and told my mom whom we were visiting, she lives in cali, we live in texas, that we saw a ufo but she seemed extremely uninterested of
