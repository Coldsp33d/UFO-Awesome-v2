and were moving all around the sky. the objects would move up and down, side to side,two of them moved in sequence till one blinked out and the other headed closer to the mountain,and made snake like patterns in the sky. they were moving at a high rate of speed and would also disappear as if a light made been turned off then they would appear again. at one point we saw one of the ufo's appear just over the mountain top, it begin to fly closer towards us and it looked as if it was aware of us looking at it and it approached us. as we felt uncertain of how closer it was going to get to us we started to get frightened and started walking to near by homes. the object went over our heads and blinked out! we also saw one of the other objects appear over the mountain ridge, we could see the object in between 2 houses, it looked like a big star and it seemed out of place. i told my girlfriend to remember the two houses so we would be able to tell if the object moved. we moved further down the street and my girlfriend saw a star that looked like the other one directly across from the other one and as we stood looking at it, it slowly moved up higher in the sky well we watched it move up we suddenly remembered the other object between the 2 houses and went back when we got there it wasn't there anymore. and earlier that day  about 10:20 about 10 huge all black un-marked coppers flew over the town, they appeared military and flew low over the town.Dunsmuir is a small town that has never had that much air traffic and even when there is an air craft in the sky its usually only one and if its flying low it 99% of the time looking for some kind of drug bust in the mountains. we were unable to take a picture or video.","distance":"Over One

the sky but could not tell what it was.  when i finally downloaded the photos to my laptop, two particular photos stood out.  to the extreme left of the first photo, are some white dots.  this is the location in the sky where the flashes of light caught my attention.  in the center of the photo is an unknown object and 3 quarters of the way up from the bottom of the photo and just left of center, there appears to be an obtuse triangle formation of lights.  there are a couple of light streaks but i am assuming they are minute scratches on the windshield, along with an amount of bug splats.  \r\n\r\nafter i downloaded the photos and looked at them, i went out to the pickup and checked to see if any of these anomalies might match up with the bug splatters but they didn't, so i decided it might be worth reporting.\r\n\r\nthe photo was taken with a sony cyber-shot, f/7, 1/640 sec., 100 iso, apt-3, fl-10mm, no flash.\r\n\r\ni also have another photo taken on the way back (again through

quite low and the headlight looked like an orange fireball. it was moving quite fast and i told the person i was with \"see, that is why people always think they see ufo's. wait till it gets closer and you can see the blinking lights and you'll see that a plane can look like a ufo from a distance.\" well... the \"plane\" came very fast up the beach and when it got just in front of the pier (half mile south of our position) it stopped and hovered. this threw us off guard and i thought, damn, is this a ufo? then the aircraft shot a jet stream out the back as it hovered... only the jet stream looked like sparks flying out of the back. the craft got very bright, again resembling a fireball in the sky. it began moving again and just a few seconds after the movement the lights went out completely. we watched for another 20 minutes but saw nothing. there were a few airplanes in the background that really showed how different this craft was from a traditional plane. there were no other crafts in the immediate vicinity, it made no noise, and was approx the size of what you would expect a plane to be. it is possible that is was some sort of military craft.

inside i noticed a very bright star like object. i looked at it and thought i saw it move side to side quickly. i could not tell if it was me shaking or if it was actually moving or not. i watched it for 10 minutes and it continued to move side to side and up and down at different times, but it stayed still for most of the time. i sat down on my bumper of my truck to try to make sure it was not just me shaking but i continued to see it move. i noticed my mother was still awake in the second story of our house. i called her and had her look out the window. i gave her the general direction and she noticed it pretty quickly. she noticed it moving a bit too, but like me she could not tell if it was her or the light moving. we did noticed it move at the same time, but it was still hard to tell. she went to bed because she works early. i watched it for about 15-20 minutes longer and noticed it position had changed slightly from when i first noticed it. i had made a mark on the ground before i sat down so i could tell where i had been originally standing when i noticed it. i do live near an airport that sees a lot of traffic, but i do not believe it could have been a plane staying in pretty much the same area for 30 minutes. sometimes planes look like they are not moving when they are at a distance if they are moving directly towards you or away from you, but within a few minutes of watching you can eventually see it move one way or another. another thing i have noticed about planes is that if they are anywhere near as bright as this object was, they are moving towards you. when the object finally moved out of sight it dimmed from a bright white light to a dull rust colored red and moved down under the tree line. the only thing i can think that this might have been was a helicopter, but i really just did not get the feeling that it was. if it was a search light it was shining, i never saw a beam from it and i never saw it turn at all. i see a few helicopters in the sky around bangor, but i have never seen one sit and hover for 30-40 minutes. when the light dimmed from bright white to dull red i never got the impression that it was turning so i don't believe i was seeing any tail lights. it also did not flash at all. it was always a solid color. the glow the from the white light did seem to twist in place at times.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

oracle rd/hwy 77, on our way home from unloading a moving truck. maybe half a mile from mile marker 109 exit, at approximately 7:40pm. my son's friend was the first to notice these strange lights. there were two lights near each other like stars. he described them as brighter than the north star. what really made them stand out, was the fact it was still day light. they appeared to the west between the highway and the mountains to the west of town. we all three agreed as to what was seen next. the lights simply hovered for a few seconds, then one of the lights flew very quickly to the other. then it vanish as though the light was just turned off. then the other vanished as well.\r\n\r\nlater that night the lights were witnessed again to the west of town, over the mountains. this was approximately 9:45pm, by my son and a different friend than the one that was with him for the first sighting (although there is some debate as to the time, we often have strange time issues with our cellular phones that cause them to show the time as being an hour ahead. i was texting with a friend at approximately 8:45pm which would have made the time the boys came in to tell us about it approximately 8:50pm not 9:50pm) my son was about to walk his friend home, they had been gone only 5 minutes or so, when they came frantically running into the house to tell us of this second sighting.\r\n\r\nafter walking his friend home, my son walked down to the local minit market, to see if any of his other friends were down there. he wanted to tell them about what he had seen. while standing outside talking to the store clerk, the lights were witnessed for a third time. this time to the east of town, directly after the lights disappeared, two \"military\" or what my son described as military, jets were seen moving toward the area the lights were seen. the store clerk was so startled by the event, that he stated he wanted to \"clock out early and go home\", he told my son. this was approximately 10:10pm. my son arrived home at 10:25pm to tell his father and i what he had seen the third time.  the friend he was with for the first sighting at approximately 7:40pm, came over at approximately 10:45pm to tell all of us what he saw at 10:10pm corroborating my sons account of what happened down to the 2 jets, seen from 2 separate locations in town that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

eyes and noticed a bright object to my left, out of the corner of my eye, moving outside in the sky.  for a split second i thought it was just the bright star/planet that can be seen each night in that direction.  i jumped up to the window and was blown away by what i saw.  i observed, beside the star, another bright, luminous orange (same colour as fire) object, as clear day, moving down diagonally out of the sky slowly (from right to left)and then straighten out to move horizontally across the sky behind the neighbour's house facing ours.  i shouted for my my wife who came into the room at that time and she also observed the object.  she was stunned as she observed this thing outside. the object was very bright and moved silently.  very very clear, its motion was constant and perfectly horizontal as it moved across the sky above/behind the neighbours house across the road.  it did not flicker or wobble in any way or leave any smoke trail against the bright night sky.  it seemed to go out of sight or fade when it reached the bottom of the street. the whole thing lasted maybe 20 seconds from start to finish. afterwards i just couldn't believe what i saw, how close it was (.2 of a kilometer out, maybe a quarter of a kilometer up) and how clear it was against the sky.  my wife said she thought it looked like a rod but i would say it orb like with a slight oval shape.  definately not a plane, star, meteor or even chinese lantern.  it was the strangest thing i've ever seen.\r\n\r\nthis is the second time i've reported something to mufon in this area.  i think i'm in the flight path lol.\r\n      \r\nnote: if it was one of those chinese lanterns it must have had 'light bulbs' instead of candles in it as this thing was as bright as a street light and it must

moon, few stars. i was sitting on my porch facing south. at 10 pm, 2200 hours, the spotlights turned off, but stars were still not very visable. i noticed what i thought was a star suddenly appear in the sky, near what i was told by my neighbor is casiopea. it was white and stationary, but suddenly it pulsated red and white. it then began to move in an odd manner. the best way i can describe it is that it fluttered. the way a butterfly flys in an unpredictable pattern. it was very distant and small, the size of a star. it moved east to west, darting about. my companion saw it as well, he also thought it was very odd, but wasn't interested. i got my neighbor, but within 3 minutes time it had disappeared. it then reappeared farther south. i went to get my neighbor again, but he missed it again, as it was gone in 5 minutes or less. i saw the odd craft again, back in it's original position, but this time there was also a blue light. a second craft appeared that flashed only red and white, and they flew parallel east to west for a bit. just a few minutes really and they were gone. again, i saw them in their original location, but this time there was what appeared to be traditional aircraft flying near the odd aircraft. these two plans flew in a straight line, and looked the way i am accustomed to planes. i believe the two new planes to be our own military aircraft, as their flight pattern was predictable, and their lighting did not pulsate or change. in addition, these new aircraft were constantly visible, while the two original aircraft disappeared and reappeared. all four planes flew parallel to each other, until the normal aircraft reached a point in the western sky. at this time the odd \"planes\" continued to disappear in the west, reappear in the east, and then travel west again. for some time only the \"normal\" crafts were visible cirlcing in the west. again a single ufo, for lack of a better term, was back, but this time it was northeast. the craft took off very quickly, in a blur, with great speed, and vanished. i was actually very afraid, but very curious at the same time. this activity began at 10, just after the spot lights went out. i went in at 2227, so i don't know how long it actually lasted. my neighbor, an avid ufo person told me he had no doubt i was seeing alien activity. he did not actually see the craft however. just curious if anyone else saw these lights. omaha is very near offut airforce base. actually, i am about 20 miles from the base, as i live on the douglas county/sarpy county

there was a series of very mysterious white lights (olbong and oval shaped) that appeared across the canyon at the skyline (at cloud level) atop of the opposite canyon ridge.  i was looking out the window at the sky around midnight, getting ready for bed.  i noticed that it was unusually very bright outside because it was nearly a full moon last night.  it was otherwise very quiet and still.  at first a single white orb appeared and looked like it was \"skipping\" across the sky very rapidly then it would move to the center of a roughly circular pattern it was traveling and then other white \"orbs\" would appear.  the white orbs (roughly 6-8 total) would almost touch in the center and then spread out in a wheel like/spoke pattern almost like a ballet. it reminded me of an air show with fighter jets where the jets travel in formation and then they form a pattern in the center and then shoot off from a center formation.  \r\n\r\nthis light show continued for the better part of an hour until well past 1 a.M. the \"firing\"/appearance of the white orbs would be random. first one would appear, then travel in roughly a circular pattern skipping through the clouds - it moved rapidly towards the center of the circular path and then other orbs would appear and then shoot out from the center.  there was no noise/sound associated with these lights.  i was not frightened by these lights - they appeared to be \"playing\" tag or skipping around very playfully. they were moving very rapidly.   i was trying to think of how these lights could possibly be explained - were they lasers? if so, where would the lasers come from? were they lightening balls? (it was not storming, although it was partly cloudy). it was not possible that these were lasers because the canyon itself below is not very heavily populated and all of the neighbors' lights were out - as if everyone was in bed as it was after midnight.  overall, it was a very strange and mysterious occurrence. the lights stopped as abruptly as they started.  did anyone else see these lights?!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":23490,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0968792,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05272010-0012","longitude":-118.3213114,"occurred":1274947200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,   Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1275020584000,"summary":"Mysterious white orbs over hollywood hills/caheunga pass canyon","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:125033"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Hempstead","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was shooting the sunset with my camera as i am a nature photographer.\r\n\r\nhttp://brendasue-katescabinatrainbowcreek.Blogspot.Com/2010_05_01_archive.Html\r\n\r\nthe above is my blogspot where i have descriptions and photos.\r\n\r\nit is a rocket spaceship orbiting the earth as i got photos again on the25\r\n\r\ni could see it as it was lit by the sun. it kept flying until it was out of the sunlight of sunset.\r\n\r\ni can find no news saying we have launced a rocket, maybe you know, please advise\r\n\r\nmy feekings were: what is that   what is that what is that?\r\n\r\nthank you brendasue","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":23489,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.0974405,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05272010-0011","longitude":-96.0782918,"occurred":1038643200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1275009325000,"summary":"Http://brendasue-katescabinatrainbowcreek.Blogspot.Com/2010_05_01_archive.Html","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23489_submitter_file1__3.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23489_submitter_file2__8.93.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23489_submitter_file3__381.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2735,"locationName":"Hempstead, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:125034"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Leggett","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the night of april 24th at approximately 9:30 p.M. my aunt paula and i were talking on the side of the road when we observed 5 round starlike objects right above a mountain not far from her house. they were very bright and seemed to be communicating with each other. it seemed as though they were on some kind of mission, like they were working.They were crossing paths and going into one another and when they did they lit up very bright. they were northwest of where we were standing. we started filming them with a night vision camera.After about three hours we were joined by another person who also wittnesed what we were seeing. we were able to observe them for about one more hour.At that point a helicopter flew right over the top of where we were standing and was heading straight towards the starlike objects. they seamed not to mind to much at first,they actually got very bright. then as the helicopter got right up to where they were the starlike objects started to move behind a rock until we could no longer see them. the three of us stood on the road and were sort of angry at what we had just wittnesed.We were debating on what to do next when we saw the lights come back into view.We were so excited, we couldnt believe that they had come back. shortly after that they left for good. right before we got in the car to leave i looked up in the sky one last time and saw a bright green streak of light shoot up in the sky right over where we were standing.

because something caught my attention. as i look far to my left, i could see what looked to be a blimp in the air.I then take get up and move to get a better look at this. this was approximately one mile eastbound above the vineyards. the object was dark, but i could see a blue light towards the left. also the object had a red and blue light on.  \r\n     i then watch the object shoot down a clear beam of light. throughout the time it was on, it was rotating counterclockwise. almost as if it was looking for something. after a few seconds, the light shut off. \r\n     next there were yellow square lights inside. the pattern looked to be a straight line horizontal cut in half. after the object made a v shaped light in yellow lights. this v shaped pattern looked like a pointer \">\" without the point. \r\n     soon the object flew slow and low across the vineyards westbound.It produced a loud vibration noise. which could be heard within the area. no trail was left behind in any way. as it flew closer to me, i got a good view at it. the shape was a disc (black). with a blue light on top middle of air craft. which the blue light looked like an vertical rectangular light attached. it flew straight across. \r\n    when the object began to fly lower, i could see underneath it. underneath it were  dozens of rectangular lights. these lights were black until they lighted up. it started from the left and kept lighting up reverse counter clockwise. then the lights lighted up in rows. there were three rows and nothing in the middle. after, the object made pyramid patterns. almost like as if it was trying to show a sign. i did not see anything inside the yellow lights, even when they lighted up one by one. the lights were huge. so that explains the clear view i had. \r\n     the flying saucer flew as low as street light view. it also flew directly across me. which i estimated 500 feet.  i am not a professional or trained to measure objects in the sky. so i estimate this was not wider than half a mile in diameter. so i was not seeing things with that much of a close encounter. i remained calm throughout the whole situation. \r\n     after the object headed towards the city. i watched the saucer turn a an angle and shut off all the lights. then there were two white bright lights it produced. this saucer flew at northwest, shut off all lights, and last produced a single blinking red light. the red light kept blinking as it headed off towards the city. almost like as if it was hiding its identity. which at the time could be identified as an airplane with just a single red light in blinking mode. \r\n     throughout the time it headed off to the city, the vibration noise it produced could still be heard for miles. until within minutes, it faded off as well as the noise. \r\n     ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then
