when the objects are in the sky by the sounds that you can hear inside my home. it is similar to a stationary jet, but not the same. it is a deeper rumble lasting for a longer period. when i first heard the noise about one year ago, i went outside to see what was making the noise i looked up and saw a oval circle of white orbs surrounding a larger red orb. the lights moved in a uniform pattern east to west at a consistant speed, not breaking the pattern.  i tried hard to explain what i was seeing as i looked at the lights.  at times i could hear a high pitch like a tuning instrument.  i live in a subdivision and all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking.  then soon the lights disperesed from the center red light and went in differnt directions.  they moved so quickly that they streaked across the sky.  the movements went on for a few minutes. the lights at times would blink and i could hear the tones at times. a little later i could hear what i knew was jets.  i saw three jets coming from east or south east across the sky.  when the jets approached, the lights seemed to drop from the sky as the jets flow by.  with in minutes of the jets leaving the area, the lights lifted back up and left up into the sky.\r\n\r\ni still hear the rumbling and know that when i do that it is time to go outside and look into the sky.  the lights return and you can see the white lights and i can not explain what i see any better than i can then.  i have not seen the red orb again, but still see the white ones quite often.  often the jets will still show up and fly the area after the lights are in the sky.  sometimes there are a few of the lights sometimes several. the apperance always seems to set off the dogs in the neighborhood and the sound of the event is always present.  i am not saying this is anything from another world, but i would like to know what it is.  after the last event one of my dogs was so scared, she would not settle down and even stay in her room.  just a little creepy!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

the semi-cooler air from the hot-humid day. whenever i'm outside at night, i'll look up just to star gaze and sometimes track the movements of planes as they're always flying overhead from the many airports in the surrounding area. since i grew up in the area, i learned early on what a plane looked like overhead at almost any height. this was definitely not a plane. at first i noticed one that seemed to be flying from the north towards the southeast, and when i continued looking, i noticed a second that was south and a little further west of it. the two were moving in the exact same direction, even when they changed to due south, at the exact same speed. we watched for several moments as they continued to move south, staying bright orange, as they moved. then they started to blink, or flicker as the continued to go south. the blinking was at various rates, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. after several seconds of that they were just gone. there were no tails or streaking behind them to indicate a falling meteor or satellite, on top of they were moving much too slow to be that. it's a fairly cloudless night, and we could continue to see stars near where the orange lights were flickering. what has perplexed us (my girlfriend was there with me and saw them as well) was the slow, in time movement.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

has a 20 foot maple tree in the middle of it and an adjacent farm field to the horizon. it was after dark and it was a vary cold night in february.  i was working on a stained glass art piece and i had the grinder running which is really loud, i had digital music on the television which was up even louder so i could hear it over the grinder.  all of a sudden i started hearing a loud deep humming sound over all the noise and the house seemed to be vibrating.  i looked out the slider and i saw, coming over the ridge in the farm field and heading right toward the house, something flying really low with two red lights, one in front and one in back and two flashing white lights also in front and back.  i freaked and thought holey s--- its my ufo moment.  i through off the safety glasses and tossed off my gloves and ran for the front door.  as i grabbed the knob i thought, but they're not supposed to have any sound, check and see if its a helicopter.  i opened the door and ran out on the deck and it was coming right over head.  it was about two and a half times as high as my tree, about 50 off the ground. first the front went over really slowly then the back.  it didn't sound like a helicopter there was no fluttering of propeller blades just a deep steady humm.  i didn't feel any wind either and looked around for signs of things moving but it was completely still no breeze at all.  i tried to make out a shape and that was the most frustrating thing about it because it was a new moon and i live out in the country and its pitch black and i just came out from a lighted house and the porch light was on. i couldn't see a shape but it felt cylindrical, don't ask me how i know thats just what i scened.  i looked for lights inside in case there was a cockpit or something but there weren't any just the single red and white lights in the front and back, the reds were on steady and the whites were flashing. i thought it was at least as long as my manufactured home, its a 16 ft wide by 80 ft long.  as the back light passed over the house i ran out to the end of the driveway and got a good estimate of the length about 80 to 100 feet long.  our lotts are 60 feet wide and it almost covered 2 lot withs.  \r\n\r\ni didn't know what to think, still don't.  i've watched for helicopters and none have that light set up and they have a definite propeller sound.  i got a mailer in april saying that they were going to be spraying for gypsy moths and that plains were going to be flying right over the tree tops and that they were loud.  i called them and asked if they were doing any research fly overs in february at night.  they said that they never use helicopters and that they definitely wouldn't be flying at night.   \r\n\r\nit didn't sound like a helicopter, it was a steady low pitched resonating humm, there was no wind movement at all and it was about 50 feet off the ground.  i got no clue what it was but if you know of any other reports of it, or what it might be, i'd love to know.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nlily","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

crossed the sky slowely. a few seconds later it stopped then started slowely traveling east towards the hills of orange/ irvine. suddenly, it stopped and took off like a shooting star, north (towards the cajon mountains) and faded away. a second after that, it came back bright blue, like really bright blue. as it reappeared, it seemed to be traveling towards me (south)slowely then started t otravel east. as i passed the collins overpass and started to exit onto ketalla, the light had already traveled to my right hand/ passenger side. as it continued to move slowely i lost it over the

onto a residential street, but lost the light. luckily i just so happend to have my camera next to me becasue i had taken it with me to the angels/ athletics game. i managed to snap two pictures but only one came out. i dont consider myself a skeptic, but seeing this object, which i strongly felt was a ufo,i stongly feel that ufos exist. seeing is believing. i have attached a photo of the object

with my dads bionoculars. there had been reports in the tacoma news tribune of alien ships being chased by usaf jets that were scrambled out of mccord afb. i was in hopes of seeing these and how unlucky i became.  if i had only known what would happen. i would have ran for my life and never look at the skies again.  \r\n  while earnestly searching the skies, i noticed some lites like a small planet moving form east to west.  then another from west to east. and yet another from south to north.  all come close to each other.  infront of our house they were about 150 feet off the ground. they made no noise and they were shaped like a boomjerang with wings that sloped like the wings of a c-141 plane however these were no airplanes.  i became overjoyed and then began to use my lantern flashlite shuinning it at the ships while turniong it on and off a bunch of times.  then two ships began to leave one to the right and one to the left. then one just floated to above our house and stopped.  under the ship there were walkways with rails andthey were in a circle under but made to the craft then i noticed this small dome and i just starred at it and it was if a small window had opend and there was this being starring at me.  i waved to him and he waved back to me. thats when it hit me i became very scarred and ran inside the house.  where my mom was sewing at her sewing machine.  we had a big bay window where i yelled mom look help. run.... immediatly my mom looked at the craft and became wwhere she couldnt move but did lock the door. so i turned around and ran to the front door but before i could reach the door it began to open with a very intense light siloughting against the door while it was opening.  so i stopped and ran to the living room .  at this time my mom was already stiff as a board and floating towards the front door at about 3 feet off the ground.  at seeing this i ran as fast as i could to my bedroom. and hid in my closet. i pulled the clothes that were on hangers on top of me.  in hopes that they wouldnt see me.  but i was realloy trembling and then my closet door opend up i was so scarred that i felt like i was on fire.  but then rhis alien dressed in a black gown with this little guy with very big eyes touched my hand and pulled me to my feet\r\ni couldnt resist them i tried but i couldnt.  i went with them out the front door into this lite. i vagley remember being escorted into the ship.  when we went into the ship we were in this room a metallic room with a surgical bed with 4 aliens surrouinding my mom.  she was being examined by these people and then i noticed that this little guy was with me next to me. he was showing me this thing but i couldnt understand what it was used for.  i think i was to take a leak in it but i said noway thats nasty.  i began to notice these aliens would come through this door so when i could i made my way to thuis passageway and went through i then saw stars abouve and below me i kept walking then i came to this room a bigger room where these aliens flew the ship. there were about 9 aliens with big asian like eyes and this one alien dressed in a black robe. i started to walk around this room i saw different kinds of symbolls on different things in this room .  then the little guy came  for me and then this alien dressed in the black robe became very irate angry with me beacuse i wasnt to be there  he asked if i was a soldier i said no way im just a kid.  we then went to other parts of the ship down this long corridor there was a round table then the little guy began to explain to me how their movement was possible with no sound done with some kind of electro magnatism.  then we went to a room where ther were 2boys and 2 girls. but these kids had no expressions they were for the most part normal lookingn for kids.  the little guy told me that he wanted me to show these chioldren how to play.  i told him where some of my toys were located one a army jeep another was a horse trailer and the last was a tonka truck.  he left me with these kids and returned a short time later with my toys that i had since i was a kid.  i began to make noises like a truck rrrr.... while pushing the truck around.  then these kids began to laugh then i became scarred all these kids had sharp pointed teeth.  we then left and continued walking around the ship. he showed me where they stay in their rooms.  i asked him if i could go with them to learn and explore he then said that they wouldnt be back for 33 years but that if i wanted i could go and that i wouldnt age at all.  i thought about it but then realization set in and that i loved my mom and dad and must stay with  my parents.  after a little while we again went to the examining room but this time my mom wasnt here.  i said wheres my mom he said tha shwe was being prepaered for the returnand her mind would be erased of all memories of what had just happend to her.  i then told him that i wanted to remember all that had happend to me and our friendship.\r\n  \r\ni was then led to this surgical bed.  where there were three aliens checking me out one had this long tube that he began to shove into my abdoman i yelled and screamed but severe pain pursued me. they act like they dont know what pain is. i began to cry still they dont give me any thing for the pain it became so severe that i almost trey to pass out but i couldnt then this other alien came around to the back of my head and i felt as if somepthing was pushed in.  tyhen i was out.  i remember the last thing we talked about i was taken to this erase memory room of all that had happend to me i told this little guy that i wanted to have remember and he said where do you want to be taken to i said under my bed and so it was done. later i woke up underneath my bed. tryiing and recalling all that had happend to us...","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

(i got that on my phone) the rest of the lights were gone except for one to the right of me which was still blinking so i focused on that one also with my phone than more lights around it started to appear and in the blink of an eye it was gone. my family owns a restaurant in downtown. my dad, uncle, and cousin were the first ones to view it from the restaurant. my cousin told me that he saw a huge light and that the lights that i had seen had come from that light he also recorded it on his phone and you can see three bright lights. i don't know maybe they were jets but i don't think so cause this lights were going really fast stopped in the middle of the sky jets don't normally do that i think also we've had some air force jets train around here and they've been thosuands of feet in

was at my cousin's house hanging out with him and his girlfriend. we were all in the kitchen talking and his mom said something about her bird houses, (she loves taking pic's of birds with digital cam) anyways... it was probably around 8 or 9pm and my cousins girlfriend and i were by the kitchen bay window (which faces south) looking outside at the birdhouse's and his mom pointing and explaining something about the birds she took pic's of. his mom no more than walked away from the windows when i said under my breath, \"what the f*** is that.\" i remember my cousins girlfriend grabbing my arm her saying something but no clue on what she said (at this time my cousin is speaking to his mother).  we both ran to the sliding door opened it and stepped outside. now ever since i was a little kid i have always been fascinated with \"ufos, and flying saucers\" and the possibility of their existence, but that night proved it all to me!! we both look up at this thing and it was seriously the most amazing most frightening thing i have ever witnessed... now i would call it a craft but there was nothing about this object to indicate that it was a craft of any sort. there was absolutely no sound coming from this thing and no physical traits or characteristics for me to determine how close or far away it was. now, it seemed and almost felt as it were very close (if there was a way to gauge its distance like when looking at a plane in the sky and determining what type of plane it is and the shadows it casts on its self are also things to help gauge distance including clouds)but no clouds, no shadows, and i'm pretty damn sure no planes look anything like this thing. the object was in the shape of a foot ball but a little more rounded on what appeared to be the edge of this thing, and like i said it had no physical traits other than the color it was emitting. it was a dull greenish blue color and it wasn't shooting across the sky or moving very fast at all. the entire thing happened- from inside the house to watching it disappear in the distant city lit sky in about a minute or two. i have no idea what this object was, where it came from or where it was heading. i do know i shared this experience with someone i know, and i'm damn sure on what we both saw. was is an \"alien space craft\" not sure, but if you use those words in definition then yeah, maybe! but we will never know. i don't have physical evidence to prove what i seen that night, only the words that i write in this message. this was my experience and that's all i need for my proof.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23473,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.0886059,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05262010-0019","longitude":-87.657584,"occurred":1191135600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1274926392000,"summary":"Small

airport is closed after 9 pm every day. i am a pilot and an architect. my friends and i observed these lights on 3 evenings that summer, i think it was sun, tues and wed during the last week of july. clear, slightly hazy sky. linear rows of bright lights appeared in western sky and stayed lit for about one to three minutes each. sometimes more than one row at a time. the rows of lights were usually horizontal, several were ascending or decending on angle of up to 20 deg. lights were stationary and came on suddenly, then off suddenly. the area where they appeared was from 260 degrees to 280 degrees and angle above ground from 10 degrees to 30 degrees. visibility at the time was probably 10 to 15 miles. i know there is an ang base to the west about 80 miles, near tomah, wi, that would be too far away to observe anything, but i don't know where their training moa is. also this is the 1st time we have seen this, so not a normal routine apparently. our thought is that it may have been some form of stationary flares ejected from training aircraft, but they would have to have been fairly close, 10-30 degree angle above horizon is a lot of airspace in a short period of time if further away than 3 to 5 miles is our guess, and we heard nothing. 2009 was cloudy or mostly cloudy every night that same week in july so we saw nothing repeated. we cautiously metioned this to a few others attending airventure - noone else was either looking westerly or view was obscured by trees, we also checked the bulletin boards including the one at faa building for any explanations. we still discuss this event occasionally when we are together, still very curious. we would sure like to know if there is a good explanation of what we observed. we don't know if lines of lights which were regularly spaced as each one a very large cigar type or edge of disks - or if they were multiple vehicles in linear formation.","distance":"Over One

from the general direction of parley's canyon.  it had an estimated altitude of ~9-10,500 feet using mount olympus (9,026 ft.) as a reference point.  it moved at a constant speed of ~80-100 mph and made no sound.  the object traversed at a steady speed from the nne, veering slightly and crossing in front of mount olympus and heading ssw toward sandy.  we lost sight of it as it moved far enough away that it was no longer visible as it was blocked by our garage roof.  \r\n\r\nat first glance i thought it was a commercial aircraft because the way it was reflecting light it was hard to see the object clearly and i didn't have my glasses on.  my wife first thought it might be a paraglider as we see them often circling in front of mount olympus, but it quickly became apparent that this wasn't the case.\r\n\r\nit was moving fairly quickly but we were able to grab binoculars used for birdwatching inside the door and were able to see it quite clearly with the binoculars.  it was a long (~150-200 ft.), fairly thin (~30-35 ft. diameter in the middle) metallic cigar with small fins on the rear and visible orange and yellow flames behind the fins.  it looked like a large rocket lying horizontally.  this was not a winged craft.  there were no wings and no visible means of keeping the craft aloft.  the flames seemed to be some kind of propulsion.\r\n\r\nit looked blimp-like, but didn't appear to be a balloon and the way it reflected it was either solid metal or had a metallic skin.  we were unable to see any other features besides the \"rear\" fins on the craft, just a smooth, shiny metallic sheen.\r\n\r\nit looked almost identical to an object seen on 6-13-2007 in salt lake city.  although that object didn't have visible flames, was flying much lower and had features on the bottom that we didn't (or couldn't) see.  i will attach a photo of that object as it is very similar to what we saw.  videos of that object are readily available on the internet.\r\n\r\nthis isn't our first sighting of a ufo so our reaction was mostly to see as much of the craft as possible and note details.  i remember that we both noted that it was silent and we couldn't understand why it didn't just drop like a rock as it had no apparent lift and the flames in the back seemed to be only to make it move forward, or possibly for directional control.  it was a large metallic object apparently levitating.  \r\n\r\nit always seems to cause cognitive dissonance to see a ufo as it raises so many complex existential questions.  and it also raises the question as to why they are seen constantly yet the government ignores and denies their existence vehemently.

has responded.   i seriously believe that an abduction occurred on the night we witnessed this spectacular landing.  perhaps you know someone in my area that i could speak with about this incident.  dr. friedman was kind enough to send me name of someone in this area in 2009 i did received an email from that person giving me a phone number.  after calling and leaving several messages and not getting a response i stop pursuing the matter.  however, there is not too many days that i don't think about this sighting more than 60 years ago.  \r\n \r\ni realize that you are an extremely busy man.  however,  if you know anyone in the st. louis, mo area that could help me understand why it took more then 30 years to remember a mesmerizing sighting my mother, grandfather and i witnessed when i was around 7 years of age i would appreciate the help. here is what happened. we lived on a plantation in  greenville mississippi.  my father, grandmother and  sister had gone into the city to do the weekly shopping for groceries. my mother and i went outside to gather firewood for the fireplace as we walked off the porch into the front yard we observed a huge red ball of fire coming out of the sky and my mother exclaimed, \"oh my god the world must be coming to and end\".  all of a sudden the fire goes out and we saw huge ship with various lights, red, yellow and i believe green.  my mother yelled for my grandfather who came out onto the porch and was unable to speak just stare.  it lit up the area as if it was daylight.  at the time we did not have electricity and used lamps for light.  we actually saw people standing in the windows that was beneath the dome.  the ship landed and that is all we remember.  we do not recall it leaving, we do not recall ever talking to anyone about it.  i find that very strange and have not been able to get it out of my mind.  if you could refer me to someone in this area that i can speak to.  i am now 68 years of age and am considering being regressed to re-live this experience.  i seek no publicity only some kind of understanding as to what happened along with other strange occurrences on this plantation. \r\n \r\nthanks so

blue, with a steady 8-10 mph wind from the south. i had just set up camp and was getting organized while i waited for my wife and son to join me from glen burnie, md. i noticed some colorful kites aloft in neighboring camp loops and watched them for a while. i glanced out to the dunes facing east listening to the constant crash of the waves, when i noticed the object in the ne sky, out over the shoreline. my first impression was that someone was flying a kite on the beach, but that thought quickly ended when i sensed the object moving slowly southward, against the wind. i grabbed my ww2 7x50 field glasses from the truck and examined the object noting immediately that it was slightly curved with both ends facing the atlantic. it reminded me of a dark gray crayon with a blunt end. at this time i became aware that the thing became straight looking exactly like a crayon, then amazingly reversing it's curve, while still moving southward, always keeping the same end more or less in the same direction. well, after 4-5 minutes of not identifying this anomaly, i strutted across the loop to the nearest campsite and approached a gentleman talking to his wife, and with a fast introduction handed my binoculars to glen, from new jersey, asking him to take a gander at this thing in the sky. after a moment he was also astounded to witness such an unrecognizable whateveritwas. we watched it together for a spell and i returned to my site. now the crayon was directly east, easily viewable by ayone looking to the ocean, and very explicit and vivid with my trusty glasses. sometimes the bright sun glinted off the leading portion and side of this thing. i tried to photograph it but my camera was inadequate, and later saw the object very small in the pictures. estimated altitude at the closest point was 4-5000 feet...Very approximate as there was nothing to compare it to, moving 20-30 mph maybe. it was in site for 30 minutes and finally continued southward, and got higher until i couldn't see any longer. what a great day it was! with all of my worldly experience not being able to identify something i could see so clearly left me bemused. wow...That's all

day...Few clouds. i saw an object ahead of me appearing at first to be a narrow portion of a cloud, but quickly realized it was not a cloud. it was approximately 1-1/2 miles ahead and passing very slowly over the interstate highway, from the east toward the west or wnw. it appeared gray, almost opaque, but had a \"shimmering\" appearance. at first i considered it to be some type of advertisement pulled by an airplane but it was so very long i quickly dismissed that, also. marking it by other structures i slowed down (traffic, though not heavy, was 75 mph at that point)...When i could finally get to a clear spot (each side of 85 are obstructed by high banks and pine trees) i could view the object from behind and beneath it...Now appearing pitch black, surfboard shaped with a tapered tail and small winglike projections from the sides at the middle. it took awhile to get past it and i really could not get a clear view for very long. however, judging the altitude (about 200- 300 feet off the ground) and time it took to pass, i felt as if it was simply moving very slowly or floating. because of the area involved (swamp and wood lands) i was unable to visualize it for very long. i guess it moved across the highway at about 20-25 mph and would have to guess the whole object was about 200-300 yards long and about 75 yards wide.It was certainly something that i have never
