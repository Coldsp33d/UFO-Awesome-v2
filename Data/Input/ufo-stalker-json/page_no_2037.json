was in the passenger seat. we were driving north on mc call ave from selma and as we turned right on north ave towards sanger when i saw what i thought was a plane hovering in one place over a field about 500ft from north ave. it wasn't that high because i saw it out of the windshield. it caught my attention because it wasn't moving, it was just floating there. i told my mom to look at it but she could not turn her head and drive at the same time. i got my phone and i called my brother, jeffrey gonzalez, who is a investigator for mufon. i told him what i just saw and he said it was a plane because jeff said their is one landing at the airport and i told him no, it's not a plane so he told me he was going to get into his truck and drive in the direction so he could video tape the craft. i told him it was a triangle with like whits christmas lights all around it. i hung up the phone and a couple of minutes later he called me back. he was about to ask me in what direction was the craft heading then both our phone's got dissconnected. i thought it was wierd because i have a i-phone and it has never done that before. i noticed that i had all my bars for good reception. my phone rang again and it was jeff, he asked me what happened and i told him i don't know why our phoes went dead. then he asked me once again, which way was the craft going and as i was going to tell him, our phones went dead again. again, i had all my bars. the phone rang again but by that time i could not see the triangle anymore. i know i should have taken a picture but when you see something like that

lay my hand on quickly right now. just watched 'ufo hunters' on tv, and they talked about a 'boomerang-shaped ufo'. i had never heard anyone else describe what i saw before; so i thought i'd write this note.  at the time (next day) called a local director of a local observatory here, but he never called back!\r\n\r\nit was a lunar eclipse, and clear evening.  my honey and i were in the hot tub, watching it.  i got tired of looking at the moon, so turned away to stare off into the night opposite. i was looking at one spot in the sky, when i noticed something was moving up there.  as i watched, an object that was 'boomerang-shaped' was going fast across the sky, and absolutely soundless.  it obscured the stars behind it as it moved from west to east, taking about 7 seconds at the most to cross the heavens.  i knew it was boomerang, not a triangle, because as the stars were revealed again, the space between the lines of the boomerang had stars immerge while the two bars of the object still obscured the stars.  it was incredible!  hard to judge distance or size without a reference.  it seems to be half the altitude a jetliner cruises, and at least three football fields long.  it was a boomerang shadow, cutting across the sky. \r\n\r\nit was a one in a million chance that i would have seen this; if my vision hadn't been perfectly still on one spot in the sky, and in exactly the right location, and if the sky hadn't been remarkably clear and dark, during a total lunar eclipse, i would never have seen it.  i shouted to don and pointed, but by the time he could adjust his eyes, it was gone.\r\n\r\noh, and it was a true 'shadow'.  no lights, no reflective quality (for something so large, particularly).  it was exactly the same dark value as the rest of the sky; it did not have any other quality for it to stand out.  again, it was the pattern of disappearing and reappearing stars that gave it away, showing its sillouette (sp).  \r\n\r\nthe direction was travelling west to east, with a bit of a north-west to south-east aspect; moving in a line across the sky. it vanished out of my line of sight with houses, etc., in the way.\r\n\r\nmy reaction was that i couldn't believe that i had actually seen an ufo!  i know what i saw, and will take a lie-detector on it.  things really are going on that we don't know about!  i was thinking how weird it was that the object i'd seen was not what other people usually talk about seeing; a disc or lights or triangle.  this was trying to be invisible, like it was reflecting exactly the color of the sky behind it.  cool.\r\n\r\ni can't remember what evening that was; have it written down.  i wonder if anyone saw anything unusual during that spring eclipse, 2005?\r\n\r\nthanks, (55 year old

was around 1am when me and my dad and a friend went out to to a field out in the country side. (where there was no lighting) we had  about 7 rockets we had built and attached the green glow sticks to. we launched about 4 of them when something strange appeared. as the 4th one launched it was hard to see the glow stick because of the fast movement but as the rocket came to the peek of its climax you could easy spot it (the rockets would arch due to the uneven weight caused by the glow sticks) as the rocket arched it seemed to land on something you could not see. as soon a the rocket seemed to come to a complet stop and hover in the air the object it had landed on had become visable and moveed very fast like if to shake off the rocket and as the rocket fell the odd metallic flat object seemed as if it was struck by lightning but made no sound and then it was unseen again. we where all struck dumb by seeing this, that non of us had an idea what it could have been. we never could fing the rocket that had landed on the object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23445,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.1403079,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05252010-0016","longitude":-95.5998568,"occurred":1233388800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1274832907000,"summary":"Odd movement.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":479,"locationName":"Sulphur Springs, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:126096"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Little Rock","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I just got off work @ approx 6pm.  i stopped at a convenient store and proceeded home.  as i left the city limits and headed out a country road toward home, i glanced to my left out to an open field and noticed what i originally thought to be a helicopter searching for something with its spotlight.  i didn't pay much attention, but then my subconscious realized that there was no propeller noise, and i was close enough i should have heard it.  so then i looked back at it and noticed it was proceeding in my direction.  not fast paced, but more slow and deliberate.  it was very close to the ground, it only went higher to avoid trees and powerlines.  no higher than to clear the obstacles.  at this point i realized that i was about to run off the road into the ditch, so i hit my breaks and came to a complete stop in the road.  with the car stopped i continued to keep my full attention on the craft, not wanting to take my eyes off of it for one moment.  by the time it had approached my road to my left and at the ditch line on my left, i am parked at the right ditchline.  it was that close! and it was very low, just hovering above the ground.  the craft proceeded very slow and went vertically up just high enough to clear the power line to cross the street i was on.  as it proceeded across the street, it came to a complete stop almost directly over me.  it was just enough in front of me that if i crawled up in the dash i could look directly up at it.  it was very large craft, all one silver metallic color, it made no sound at all and created no wind.  the only light i noticed came from the bottom of the craft in the very center of the disc.  the light that emitted from the bottom was more like a laser light, not a flash light.  the light did not shine outward it came down like a beam.  the craft began to move on in the same direction crossing the street and lowering back down toward the ground after clearing the power lines.  i decided to follow it, so i turned right on a road i was not familiar with and continued it the craft direction.  however, this road came to an end and i had to lock up the brakes and stop my car.  i crawled out of the car through the passenger door as the driver door did not open and proceeded to walk up the hill that the craft lowered behind.  as i approached the half way point between the top of the hill and my car i noticed it was dusk and would be dark pretty quickly.  i must admit i was sort of chicken at this point not having the false sense of security the vehicle provided.  i was afraid to go over the hill an it turn dark on me not knowing what to expect on the other side of the hill.  so i decided to abort and go to my car and continue home. i am not sure of the exact date, but i do know it happened on a friday and i am pretty sure it was 1988.  also, i am not the only one to have sightings on this night, so you should be able to find record.  in fact, there were so many sightings that the government actually issued a response.  the government response was that it was a russian satelite that had fallen out of orbit.  i can assure you that this craft was not a sattelite falling out of orbit.  this craft was changing speeds, dodging trees and powerlines and stopped and proceeded again.  not consisted with something falling out of orbit.  i do not believe that i lost any time, however i do not remember checking times.  it didn't seem like i lost time.  i would love to be hypnotized to see what else could be remembered.  it truly was one of the most exilerating moments of my life.  i chickened out because i didn't want to be abducted and to my knowledge i was not.  i did not see anyone driving the craft or anyone outside the craft. all the same, it was pretty amazing!

front lawn and was so shocked , i told my wife and son..I described the long-sausage shaped vehicle and made mention of the windows and the rate of the vehicle and the fact it was ultra-transparent and less than a hundred feet as it passed over the trees and going into downtown.The sighting was only for 15 seconds , but was very vivid and obvious it wasnt human and strange. the craft appeared to me and then went back to invisible and traveled along. thus, i make this report to your people to document and give some info. to your research. **note: this craft was in comparison to a mobile home flying along at at least 100 mph and then dissolved away as it flew by.It was about 6 pm and i usually watch the news at this time..But i was going to lock my car and looked above the tree line looking at the weather ..When the craft was seen flying along and i wasnt sure if the beings wanted me to see them . but obviously it was a blazen display of \"being seen\" and went un-noticed by everyone except me.I thought this all to impossible and then realized this was not at all normal and told my wife.It simply was slipping along and had huge windows and was quiet and transparent. i did not see any beings but saw the shape.Long,cyndrical,fast,and low(&) feet) and then vaporised away...I have never seen an airship suck as this...I am very observant of the sky because of my up-bringing and notice anything that flys along the sky.I have some starnge thoughts of this sighting because i did not know what the%$#@ it was or have never before seen anything like it before. i made note of the fact that this would be more than others could handle if they would have witnessed the same sighting....I felt transfixed and viewed the ship as if i were a camera or film-camera .As i went over the scene repeadetly in my mind, i realized this was very un-common and what i would say was  \" sneaky,stealthy and impossible to view ,....But did!!I dont mess with fiction or presumtions because i have always sought \"truth\" and theoritically will not be a tale-bearer as this is not truth...But i have to reel from the sight non-the less.I regret i have no photograph to share but this is all i had. thank you, mike d. edwards-crowley,louisiana.70526(337)785-0171   i live in southern louisiana and have been in the bayou many times where others will not go...This area is prime for such starnge

the ship and then tured tail and ran away terrified and upset he did not bite the object.","distance":"101-500

quickly discounted those possibilites because of the fast pace at which they were moving.  one of the craft followed at a consistant interval and they were traveling from due south to due north one behind the other.  when they passed a point that was just past overhead, they seemed to stop and accelerate away from the earth at a high rate of speed that caused their star-like appearance to fade

area flying j truck stop at exit 305, about 11 pm. soon after i returned to the highway, i noticed a bright blue light in the dark open sky. i kept sight of this blue star for about ten minutes, when suddently the blue star turn into a white glowing star, and in turn, started to move from west to east, kind of heading to the jacksonville area, towards the atlantic ocean at about 30 thousand miles to then turn south. it got all my attention when from this light, two huge circled flashes came off from it, as if it had entered into the atmosphere or changed from being a circled star light to a flying craft coming down really fast. after the entry from space, i only could see pulsating and turning lights of blue, red and green colors approaching very fast the area where i was heading. couldn't describe size or shape of object, but it flew along the highway around 5 thousand feet. the shadow above the lights was of about 100 to 200 feet long, no sound was emmited by the craft. i slowed down as much i could but i could not see where it went after i was by pass by it, because obviously i had to keep my sight in the road since i just kept driving. the night sky was clear, open and starry, no clouds, no noticiable air traffic in the area. when i first saw the blue star, never imagine that few minutes after watching it while driving, would turn into a bigger white star and move fast towards east. the most impressive was to see the emission of two huge circled flashes and then the white light dimmed to become a pack of shadow emmiting lights that started to fly right

(treeline: small patch of woods separating the trailer park and a field.)\r\nit traveled the length of the field before i could not see it through the trees anymore. i would estimate the length of the field to be about 200 yards.\r\n\r\nmy cousin and myself sat in awe even after we could not see the ufo anymore. he turned to me and said \"let's go check it out!\" i sternly answered with, \"hell no! are you f**king crazy??\" i was not sure what i had just seen but i had a gut feeling that i did not want to find out. so, we waited...\r\nwaited... two young boys waiting to see something else as amazing as what they had just witnessed.\r\nthen it happened...\r\n\r\na flash, as if someone had taken a picture from a camera, appeared at my friend serena's trailer. it was on the other side of her trailer, preventing me from seeing the source of the flash.\r\napproximately two minutes later, another flash... this time, from the side of her trailer. i still couldn't clearly see the source of the flash.\r\nat this point, my cousin and i were starting to think something strange was happening.\r\na few moments later, another flash. this time, i could clearly see the source of the flash... nothing. it appeared as if the flash was angled towards serena's house, although there was no source of the flash. there was absolutely nothing visible to the naked eye that created this obvious flash. bud and myself both knew that flashes that are that distinct do not come from nothing. \r\n\r\nwe waited about five more minutes still staring out into the trailer court through my glass room. we were now more worried about what was in the court than what we had seen earlier. without speaking to each other for what seemed like five or ten minutes, another flash happened.\r\nthis time it was at my friend \"t\"'s house - directly in front of my house. the flash was on the other side of the trailer and appeared to be aimed at his mothers bedroom. again we waited... wondering what the flashes were.\r\nanother couple minutes had gone by. another flash.\r\nthis time, it was clearly pointed at \"t\"'s window and there was nothing at the source of the flash. in my mind i could pinpoint, to the inch, where the flash had started, yet there was nothing there. bud looked to me and said \"what the hell are those flashes?\" i had no reply. i wanted to remain silent and hidden from whatever had been making the flashes. \r\nagain we waited.\r\nabout another five minutes passed when there was a flash on the other side of mr. wilson's house. (that wasn't his real name, but we knew him as mr. wilson in the trailer park.)\r\nso, we waited what seemed like forever. in reality, it was probably 15 to 20 minutes with no sign of flashes or anything similar to them.\r\nquite suddenly, bud looked at me and said \"well, i'm getting tired. wake me if anything happens.\" he then put his head right down on his hands where he was sitting (propped up on his knees on the backside of the couch bed). \r\ni said, \"okay\" but wondered how anybody in their right mind could just fall asleep that fast after witnessing what we had witnessed. in my mind, i would not go to sleep until the sun was up and people were awake.\r\ni started to get the strange feeling that the happening wasn't over. then... i started piecing things together that were quite simple and obvious.\r\n1. serena lives with her mother and father. there were 3 flashes at her trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms...)\r\n2. \"t\" lives with his mother. there were 2 flashes at his trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms, also...)\r\n3. mr. wilson lives alone. there was one flash.\r\n\r\ni figured that if they had gone through flashing every individual, as they went around from left to right in the court, since wilson was last they had to turn around and come up the other line of trailers...\r\nstarting with mine.\r\ni almost panicked as i came to the realization of what i believed was true.\r\ni turned my head in the direction of where i believed the thing causing the flash to be. as i turned my head i could clearly see out my window (one that did not have glass or screen in it - open - nothing obstructing my view) an alien. i had turned quick enough to spot him before i saw a flash come from, what seemed like, his forehead..........\r\nwhen the flash hit me, he disappeared and i realized i was completely paralyzed. as i tried to move my limbs, i looked around to realize that i was no longer on the same part of my bed that i had been during the flash. i was, in fact, at the foot of my bed on my knees staring at the open window as if nothing had happened. instantly, the numbness was gone.\r\ni grabbed the back of bud's leg (because he was in the same position that he had been in when he laid his head down...) \r\nit appeared that he had not moved at all. but somehow i was at least 4 feet away from where i was when i had seen the flash...? when i grabbed his leg i screamed extremely loud \"bud! wake up!\" his head came off of his hands with his eyes wide as if he knew something wasn't right.\r\nwe didn't have to say anything to each other as we both jumped up and ran into the kitchen. we each armed ourselves with butcher knives, not knowing how much time had gone by or if the threat was still around. he asked me what had happened. the only way i could really describe it to him was \"i was flashed..\" bud knew what i meant by that, which told me that i wasn't just seeing things and that i wasn't alone.\r\nafter about two minutes of silence.. waiting for something else to happen.. we finally laughed at the fact that we were standing armed in the kitchen with knives... waiting for aliens to come.\r\nit seemed ridiculous to us.. although it had clearly just happened, we couldn't really wrap our minds around it. so, we laughed it off and this time we went to bed inside of the house, instead of the room surrounded with glass windows.\r\n\r\n(this event has made me realize that more than one time in my life - for a split second - i have seen aliens and \"the flash\". i have seen them in my bedroom window... i have seen them outside of my tent while sleeping in the woods* the same woods that are between the trailer park and the field i described*... i have had many occasions where, just for a second, i believed that i had been part of an alien abduction. seeing what i have seen and the fact that i have witnessed a ufo, i have seen that ufo land in my field, i have seen something flash friends and neighbors, and i have been flashed by something that came from the sky... this is not your ordinary alien story because to this day i cannot say that i fully remember ever communicating with an alien or being aboard their \"crafts\". but that doesn't mean that i haven't seen, felt, or experienced something extremely out of the ordinary. my cousin was there as a witness to the ufo and to all six flashes... (the seventh, of course, being my own) i have no explanation as to what exactly the flashes are or what they do to people, but i do think that they were meant for individual people... and to somehow make a person \"unaware\" that something is going on... whether by putting them to sleep... paralyzing them... or wiping out their memory... i don't know for certain. what i do know for certain is that i have had many encounters with them and i believe that i truly know how they arrive. to put it bluntly, i've caught them in the act of flashing people. i believe that they were completely unaware that i had spotted them, until it was too late. i feel as though they knew that they had made a mistake. i had witnessed their mistake and i almost felt the reaction of the alien as.. panic. for the instant that i saw him, i knew in my gut that he was as scared of me as i was of him. i knew that their \"routine\" was not supposed to have been witnessed by anyone. we are supposed to be dazed by the flash when they come.)","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

on my patio drinking my coffee and watching planes circle around my area. when i was watching one of the planes in the east i happened to notice two whiteish lights above it. the lights were in a pair, one on top of the other.  the bottom light was slightly lower than the top and to the right.  the lights then separated. one light then moved northwest and the other moved southwest. i lost track of the one moving southwest as it moved over and past my apartment building but i continued to watch the other. it moved for a minute or so then stopped.  i was staring at it trying to figure out what it was then i noticed what appeared to me as a star to the right of it.  i have never seen a star visible in the sky around noon so i called a friend to see if it is possible one would be visible around noon. i watched the light and star while i was on the phone for approximately 4 or 5 minutes, then the light moved off to the northeast.\r\n\r\ni have been seeing these things for the last three months.  im always doing the same thing, having coffee on the patio and watching the planes.  it seems like they materialize in the sky when im watching planes and commercial jets fly over.  that's how i notice them.  they always appear in a pair and then they will separate.  one will move out of my sight while the other will move then stop.  i would estimate that they are above cloud level. i'm not sure if they are metalic or white lights.  as for their speed i would guess they move faster than commercial jets.  they appear to flatten out or change their shape when they move.  i lose track of them when fly over my building.\r\n\r\ni have located a youtube video and sent it to one of your case managers, glen means.  it is an exact replica of my sightings.  the only difference
