could see a very bright orange light in the distance coming from the direction of the local southend airport, my first thought was police helicopter, but they have a white lights so i walked on about 25-- 30 meters as i was walking this orange light just got bigger and bigger and bigger, i stopped walking and hid behind a telegraph pole in the street and just watched in amazement at what was happening to me. this huge orange ball swerved to the left and flew down our road at about 300 ft high, it was bubbling and fiery and pulsing orange, i have never seen fire like this, this was a special kind of fire that i have never seen before, a bit like lather, then flew down in a straight line and did not roll but moved forward like a steady ball, as it went over my head i cupped my hands together to get a better listen but this thing was totally silent as it passed i could see that it was just as round from behind as it was from the front and the underside, this experience has had a profound effect on me for the good, yesterday i told my partner that i was proud to be a human, that is the first time i have ever said that and i have never heard anybody else utter those words. just in my area alone there have been about 30 sightings on all different days and at different times by all different people","distance":"101-500

the sky, when i noticed a light in the sky that i thought was a star until we noticed that it was moving at us, at this point we heard that it was a jet flying low and fast, at this point my friend asked me, \"well, what i want to know is, what is this other light\" as we saw the \"fireball like light\" at this point the fast low flying jet banked and headed at the fireball. turning back to watch the fire ball we watched it (the best way to describe it) was to say it was shaking in the sky in an up and down motion, then with what would have to be really really fast it moved to the west then back at us then the shaking thing again but this time it was back and forth not up and down, at this point it started going in all different directions, 90 degree angles, stop and go (instant stop and go) and quickly dissapeared into the tree line. this is the point where we saw another jet (maybe the same one) flying in the same spot as the one before. it made it seem like they (the jets) were looking for that fireball light.\r\n      i just wanted to say that my dad was a pilot and i love flying and all airplanes, and in my 38 years i've never seen anything move like that, the inertia

for flying so low, made me think that they were military jets, it was creepy.","distance":"Over One

the object passed overhead and it was a large black triangle/delta wing shape. it was flying slow and low (1000ft or so) and was easily the size of a jumbo jet, if not bigger. i could clearly see the underside of the ���vehicle��� from an oblique angle which was entirely black save for a large glowing circular light in the centre with 4 adjacent smaller lights surrounding it. the large central light appeared to be like a ���protruding blister��� but was not entirely glowing but made up of many alternating bright and dark strips or bands. there were also red and green lights on the rear corners of the vehicle with a row of small lights along the rear. i watched the object travel due east until it disappeared over the horizon. there was some associated noise like a jet engine but it was more ���hummy���. i took photos with my phone but they don���t show anything apart from black!  nothing like what i saw, which totally gobsmacked me. i did sketch the object straight after the

member. i am the son of a test pilot. i have had numerous conversations about ufo with friends. i have never, never seen anything in the sky that was not explainable until today. at approx 300 pm. i went to see if my electronic neighborhood pool keys (the pool opened today) worked. they did. i went back home got my climbing shades (julbo, polarized, i use these sahdes for intense light environments) and towel and went back. temp today was about 85 f. after i killed a bee around 335 pm the sun began off and on behind the clouds at about 600-1000 ft alt. i got situated looking slightly to the west to get the max exposure, so the sun was at my 11 o'clock and the sun was about 65 degrees up (thinking like a azmuth or compass) the kids jumping in the pool and clouds shifting caused me to open my eyes every few minutes. at approx 340pm i opened my eyes and saw blue sky, and for a second (just a second!) i opened my eyes to see an usual flash of light in the shape of an arc at almost the same angle as the sun just to the right of the sun. there were jets on approach moving (leaving contrast trails) west to east i assume on aproach or leaving the atl flight area. the flash of light caught my eye and i blinked after seeing this, to notice something very faint in the shape of a fuzzy square. i took this as meaning it was very high in the atmosphere or it was trying to hide. as i followed the object there was no sound over the kids and pool noise, no trail, no wings, nothing ordinary. it looked like a square but may have had a nose. what was interesting about this was that when i removed my shades it was gone completely. there were so many people there and it was quietly moving north with not a notice by anyone probably becuase this was not an easy thing to see. you'd have to have looked right at it to see it. i lost it for a few seconds while i removed my shades, but then found it again moving rapidly north.  i lifted my shades several times in disbelief as i followed it; making it go away and bringing it back. this was scientifically similar to removing the light wave length in the blue spectrum. essentially cutting out some of the refracted blue light background from the sky. i can't say how big this was,looking at my ruler here on the table... it was about 6-8mm long (again from my point of view) and 3 to 4mm wide. it was gray and fuzzy but had distinct edges, thinking back especislly the rear of the object seemed more defined , a clear straight edge. it moved smoothly north with no trails, nothing. i followed it for what seemed like 1 to 2 minutes to the north until about 30 degrees on the horizon. after i lost the object i jumped up and ran home to document all that happened. i am amazed that i saw this object. i will not say that it was something from another planet, or what, but definately not anything i have ever seen. report worthy.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

couple hours according to an inside clock when i went inside briefly.  as a star gazer and photographer i am familiar with the rate/speed that meteors  usually travel. this night i saw two meteors, but the sighting i am describing was different.  as i was looking up nearly overhead (~ 80 degrees up) but slightly to the east a bright \"twinkle\" caught my eye. i can only estimate the time to be around 02:00 am.  in less than a second what appeared to be an extremely fast double streak appeared from the point of the \"twinkle\".  from my perspective it appeared to travel about an inch, moved

enjoying the night.  after most of my friends went to sleep, my friend and i decided to take a hike at about 3am.  we walked approx. 100 yds up to the top of a hill that provides a 360 degree view of the valley to the north  and thomas mountain at south by south west.  upon reaching the top of the hill near our camp site, which was actually just a cut off of the dirt road south of lake hemet off of the 74, we spent a few minutes at the top, enjoying the view and then decided not to continue over the hill since we would lose sight of our camp fire.  once we started heading back, what appeared to be a large, bright, and consistently lit shooting star pierced the sky to the south, somewhere over thomas mountain.  about three quarter of the way through the object's flight, the object sharply changed direction downward from it's 45 degree decent to a straight down dive.  it then disappeared behind the mountain without a flash or sound.  my friend and i immediately took notice of the puzzling turn of the meteor and verified that we both saw a projectile turn 45 degrees in the sky without losing any velocity, or having any curve at all.  this was also clear through the tail that followed the object.  the tail of object followed it perfectly creating a 45 degree angled shape in the sky, before dissipating.  also, the trail was extremely straight and clean.  there was no spreading of light or particles as it entered the atmosphere. we were both so scared by what we saw, that we ran full speed back to our campsite and didn't speak of it till later the next day. \r\n\r\n what i saw was physically impossible.  no physical object can move at that speed, make no noise, and be able to turn so sharply without slowing down or even curving into the turn.  it was similar to watching a neon light ignite from top to bottom, speedily filling a bent tube.  very eerie.  what we saw was real, it came from out of the atmosphere, and it behaved as if under intelligent control.  we considered that the object may have exploded and split off in a downward direction as meteors may do, but decided that the conciseness of the turn and the fact that the object changed in no way other than direction, there's no way it was a meteor.  \r\n\r\ni know what i saw, and now i'm a believer.","distance":"Over One

going to report anyway, but i wanted to read the last 20 reports to mufon first. i was looking for anything that matched what i had seen. witness in england said sighting was at 2:30 a.M. that would be 9:30 p.M. here in the usa. i do alot of star gazing on clear nights, and felt last night would be eventful. i looked out a ne facing window and saw a yellowish white star like object movine horizontally going from s to n. thought it is probably a satelite. also thought maybe it's iss or space shuttle. however, upon going outside with my binoculars in hand, i then witnessed at least 10 other such objects within the next 1/2 hour! the first few went e to n. then one came from the w going n. i then observed one coming from the se which merged with what i thought were just stars! it was that one that convinced me that what i was seeing was not ordinary. after it merged it became stationary. it seemed like there were alot of stars in arc formations as well. like i say i look up alot at night, and i'm familiar with star positions. i did'nt see anything that resembled a missile like you did. but i found your report to be very close to what i saw, and not that much time diffence either. this may have been going on at 9:30 p.M. here, 2:30 a.M. your time, but i began watching the sky 1 hour later. close enough i think. we may have been watching the same display on opposite sides of the atlantic. oh, i should add that these objects were really high up. at the level of stars it seemed. they moved at a somewhat normal speed. like airplanes, but definitely not airplanes. no blinking lights whatsoever. just whiteish star like objects that could be seen with the naked eye. this all took place between 10:30 and 11:00 p.M. normal air traffic was unusually light last night. one other oddity during the event was that the song birds, that are nesting right now, were chirping very softly. this is not usual for them. i live in the woods, and am surrounded by trees and all sorts of wildlife. i'm very familiar with their habits. anyway, there was nothing normal about what i saw last night. my son and i witnessed one of these on 5/9/10, but i dismissed it as a satelite. now i feel we may have seen more that night, but we went in to watch a movie. i really feel like those who are staying indoors at night are missing the greatest show on earth! i always knew it was'nt the circus. so long for now.

at night as we had our first born whom was 2 or 3 yrs old at this time. \r\n  the date and time are not exact but i do remember it was that time of year when it would be getting dark earlier. i am guessing around sept/oct of 1992 or 1993.  \r\n  my son and myself layed on the floor in front of the tv to watch a movie together while mom was at work. it was night time and dark. i am not sure how far into the movie it was but for some reason unknown to me i looked to my right out the front window. my line of sight was minimal and only in an upward angle above the row of conifers and below the eves of the house. i immediately saw 3 red lights either moving slowly down or moving slowly down and at a westward angle. in any event it was traveling where it would appear to go almost directly over my house or land in my front yard perhaps.  this did not look normal. it appeared to be huge but i really couldn't judge how far away it was however it was fairly close and not way up in the sky. \r\n as i looked at it, flares came to mind but i rationalized there was no smoke, no flickering, not falling just steady red lights moving slowly.  i got up put my hands and face to the window as to eliminate any  glare or possible reflection in the window glass and confirming it wasn't flares.   then i asked my son (3 yrs old) if he see's this. he replied \"yes\".  there was what seems to be 30 feet between the tree tops and eves of the house from my angle so i know it was moving slowly. \r\n  i ran to the back window for what reason i don't know maybe to see if there was anything behind the house,then went back to the front window and it was still there.  i was getting a bit worried at this point and felt something wasn't right so i called my wife at work to the east and asked her if she could see anything in the sky towards our house.  she looked and said \"no\". so i hung up. i am still seeing this out the window and being my first born child i was feeling more protective than curious sensing something was not right. today i wish i would have went outside to get a better look (i think). \r\n so at this point i called 911. with them on the phone i was still seeing this and only described it to them as \"3 lights coming out of the sky\"  i am sure some time has passed by now but i was reacting pretty fast so i can't judge the amount of time that had passed. it seemed i needed immediate response.\r\n the 911 operator asked me \"what do you think it is\" my reply was \"ummm i dont know what it is\" reluctant to say anything that may sound stupid.    actually ufo is not what came to mind while i was seeing this. i dont think the term ufo was a rational thought. i was just dumbfounded and in all reality i was preparing for fight or flight. not that it seemed threatening but i was highly protective of my son and this object's presence put some fear into me.\r\n  \r\n to think about it, prior to this, ufo was something i would have laughed at if anyone told me the saw one, and if i had to describe one it would have been the typical disc flying saucer. i never heard anything or seen anything on tv that would have gave me this idea or description of a ufo.\r\n\r\n i was on the phone with 911 for awhile and was pacing the floor as the window wasn't that available with a corded phone. the operator repeatedly ask me what i think it is. i could not get anything out as to what i thought it was, only a \"ummm i dont know what it is\". during this time i was no longer watching out the window but rather pacing waiting for some answer's from 911 assuming they would do something. then the operator transfered me to someone whom i cannot recall. who also asked me what i think it is. all i could say is \"ummm i dont know what it is\". they took my name address and info. \r\n the last thing i remember is sitting on the couch on the phone.  i have no idea what happened to the object where it went or what it was. the subject did not come up again and i cannot recall even remembering it the next day until some time had passed maybe 6-7 years when i was watching a show on tv one day and there was someone elses account described and shown exactly as i saw it. this was also when i realized the lights i saw were also a triangle shape and it did not alter from a triangle shape and it did appear dark within the triangle. it just did not register to me at the time that it was of importance to describe it as such. \r\n there was no doubt in my mind after i saw it described, that is what the same thing i saw, identical. i can still visualize it to this day.\r\n it has been 16 years or so and it still goes through my mind almost everyday.  i only wish someone else would have seen it (my son at 17 said he remembers, but has no real reculection). and it leaves me wondering if it was explainable. on the other hand i cannot dismiss it. (it is a feeling that i know i saw it but noones going to beleive me without proof).\r\n i dont have a problem sharing this with friends or coworkers (if they exhibit open minds) and then only to find that they have stories to share also.  so that tells me this is bigger than i could imagine and that provides some comfort that i am not crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\na year or two prior to this i had another sighting with witnesses. two friends were at my previous home and for some reason unknown to me i walked out my front door looked straight up into the sky and very very high up there was a black triangle spinning in one spot. i pointed at it and asked my friends if they see it. they both saw it. i suppose it could have been a sattelite. it was a definent black triangle spinning fast,  and must have been huge because it was way up there. we dismissed it and didnt pay any more attention.\r\n\r\n just wanted to share this. i know its not possible to get confirmation on what i saw but it is good to know there are people who do listen.
