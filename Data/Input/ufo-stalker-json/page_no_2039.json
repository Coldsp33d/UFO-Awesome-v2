was facing eastward. the sky was overcast and no stars were visible but there was lightning far in the distance.\r\n\r\nas i was watching the sky suddenly there was this blue tinged object that almost looked like a very bright star just appear out of nowhere traveling from left to right in my field of vision. there was no sparks or any kind of trail. there was no curvature to the flight path, i just flew very straight. there was also no sound or solid surface that i could hear or see.\r\n\r\nit came in at a shallow angle towards the ground blinked 3 times and disappeared behind a house, but just as quickly came back up at a sharper angle then it had entered. it then changed angle again to a more level trajectory with the horizon and blinked 3 times again as it did so. it continued on to where i couldn't see it because the side of the house was in the way. the blinking was sequential in that the 6 blinks were as far as i could tell all the same duration.\r\n\r\ni cannot say how far away or how big it was i just don't know. but i do know that it was below the clouds and moving very fast. as for feelings and reactions i was dumbstruck and stood for probably a couple minutes just trying to wrap my head around what i had just seen. i know 100% what it was not...It was not a plane, helicopter, or meteor. i see planes and helicopters all the time and i've actually seen lots of meteors and fireballs, but this was none of them.\r\n\r\nwas it \"ball lightning\"...Maybe but from the pictures i've seen of ball lightning and peoples descriptions of it...This looked nothing like it.\r\n\r\nthe first pic is a drawing i made in ms paint that shows the full path that i saw the object moving. the second pic is an actual photo taken maybe 5 minutes later of the area. i set the exposure to 15 seconds and increased the gamma so you can see the area clearly. in reality it was very dark

cigarette. as always i looked up into the sky to look at the stars. i was looking at one particular group of stars when i noticed that the group seemed to be moving. as i looked closer i could see that it was actually just one star that was moving northbound in a straight line. as i watched it i noticed that it was brightly pulsating at a rate of around every 10 seconds. because it was so far up i couldn't make out any definitive shape to it. it looked just like another star to me. i thought to myself that it could have been a plane, but i've seen hundreds of planes in my time and none of them ever pulsated like this before, and besides, this was moving much faster than any plane i've ever seen. i was watching it pass over the house and not 2 seconds after it passed from view i saw a shooting star follow in almost same trajectory as the ufo. i've also seen quite a few shooting stars in my time as well, but this one seemed to have a really long blueish trail behind it, and it wasn't traveling downwards either. it was moving horizontally following the exact path of the ufo at an incredibly fast speed, but it didn't sort of die out as most shooting stars do. it had a fairly consistent trail behind it. because it also passed over the house, i couldn't see weather it actually made contact with the ufo or not, but it did seem to me that whatever it was, it was fired with some intention of hitting the ufo. i knew that as soon as it had passed over the house that i wasn't going to see anymore as the view was completely blocked by other houses in the street. i continued watching for another couple of minutes to see if anything else would happen to no avail. 10 minutes later i'm writing this report to mufon. hopefully someone else saw something as well. possibly some sort of impact maybe, but it is very early in the morning so i doubt many other people would be even be awake. anyway thanks for your time and who knows, maybe there's more to this story to

tinted window when i just happen to glance towards the window into the sky,  and i saw an orange and round object about the size of a balloon slowly traversing in the sky.  the distinctly orange and round object also seemed to me to be a little fuzzy on its outer surface.  the object appeared to be no further away than 200 to 300 feet from my location, and the orange object seemed to be about 100 to 150 feet up in the air in altitude.\r\n  i stared at the orange object for a few seconds wondering to myself what it could be when i decided to quickly go onto my porch (which that part took about 2-3 seconds) and to take some pictures of the orange object.  however, when i went outside onto my porch and intensely scanned the area with my eyes where the orange object should had been located,  i saw no signs of the orange object still being in the sky.  this left me baffled about its disappearance since the object was very bright orange and once nearby my location.  this occurrence also happened to me before in the recent past. \r\n\r\n therefore,  i quickly decided (with the zoom set at its lowest of 70mm and the  focus set for distant scenery) to take some random pictures in a circular pattern in the general area the orange object was last seen with the hope of the camera capturing something (which the object may still be somewhat visible for the camera to detect  but not with my eyes.)  i took l1 pictures: only 1 picture shows a round object which is not orange; another pictures show a black and flat object which i am suspecting that object in that picture possibly being  a black bird flying.  however, upon enhancing the picture (that i think might be a bird) with  the fade enhancements to bring out more colors, the object also had orange color in it rather than just black colors.\r\n\r\nthis settles my thinking of possibly seeing things when the facts is: there was something that was  flying which was a small and bright orange object that just simply appeared to vanish.  now the real question: what was that object because it surely was not a balloon or plane i saw flying in the air?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

stars with my kids and maybee tease the cat with it on occasion. on the day of the sighting, i left work at 10:30 and noticed three round objects in the sky. i pulled over and studied the objects and after skanning the sky i saw hundreds of what i knew to be balloons. it was the last day of school for the kids and a local school or event must have let the kids release balloons. it got me thinking of aircraft, ufos and related things. that evening a thunder storm came through with many extremely close lightning strikes. we were a bit unnerved but went outside to play around in the puddles after the storm passed. the sun was going down and i decided to show my boys the kool laser and what it could do after dinner. at around 8:00 we went outside and i pointed to the ground with the star/map attachment and my boys were fascinated. we walked out into the yard and pointed to a bright star in the east. i then proceeded to point to the moon towards the west and at that instant my oldest son (7) yelled out \"dad whats that???\" i first looked at my son and then at the direction he was looking and was stunned to see a large bright-white orb less than one mile away to the left of the moon, very close to where i was pointing the laser. i was shocked because i did not even see it untill my son pointed it out, even though it was so bright. immediatly i noticed another bright white light coming from the direction i first trained my laser. it was equaly distanced. it was speeding towards the first object. there were other aircraft at multiple altitudes, (we live near btr airport) but these two objects were different. they were bright like the sun at midday (about the size of my thumb at arms length)and although they were moving away from my location, they did not change in brightness or appearance, nor did they have any strobing or anti-collision avoidence. they slowly dissapeared behind the tree line. my kids and i were frightened and we immediatly went into the house. we love aircraft and know of nearly every shape and size in the books. but i'v never seen these characteristics before.

home back towards my work i saw what appeared to be space junk but then i thought it was street lights until i started to follow these lights. and realised they were a good 20km out of the city i live in. its a dry open treeless area for miles. saw the orbs in darkest and noticed them to be of an orange appearance and the orbs were stationary. they were roughly around 1200ft in the air give or take from my postion at about 5km away from me. they were appearing in random formation at times 3 or 2 then none then 1 to 3. there was no mist, fire, glow, smoke, flame or sparks. just 3 clear circular orange orbs. they didnt move erratically they just phased in and out. this carried on for a good 30minutes. i do have some film of this event. its on my mobile so not the greatest quality. i also informed my grandmother and she witnessed this event. the orbs had completely gone by the time i checked again, which was a good 30minutes later.\r\ni worked out as many theories as possible for this event to be explained rationally. but the pure height of these orbs ruled out the possiblity of a man made light source, the fact that they randomly appeared in the sky and were suspended in mid air neither moving left or right just purly suspended in the air, makes me believe it was not an aircraft or helicopter and there was no sounds, the night was very quiet with only traffic on the rare occassion the temperature was around 18 degrees a rather cool night with no cloud cover with open skys.\r\nim an industrial electrican in my opinion it wasnt a man made light source. also fire ruled out becuase of its colour and the way it appeared and dissapeared. maybe you or your team could come up with a solution or have others got any hard evidence to what it could of been since this is very unusual. finally about two days before this night a place called kadine about 300km away from whyalla also had similar appearing orbs and appariently many towns people saw it. reguards

friends.  when i got out there i saw nothing at first. i did immediately notice multiple helicopters in the sky, at least 3, circling this area.  as i rounded the corner of my house i saw 4 red lights in a horizontal row, quickly rising over the building to my west then abruptly the 4 red lights became one bright blue light.  simultaneously the object made a 180 degree change of direction with no deceleration or acceleration of any kind that i could see.  we immediately went to our friends��� vantage point to see if anyone had captured this event on film.  we found eye witnesses, but no one who had recorded the event.  we went to the beach to see if we could see it further out in the sky or over the water, no such luck.  after about an hour we decided to call every news organization in

the object was.  i was near clark rd. and lockwood ridge road looking directly west, the others were near gulf gate drive and superior avenue looking almost directly north.  from this we could tell

on fm4. about 10 miles out from granbury, heading west, i caught a glimpse of an unusual light flickering in the western night sky. i ignored it for a few seconds... and was thinking to myself it was must be a plane on arrival to kdfw or a plane passing through at a high altitude through the different classes of airspace. all of a sudden the flickering light transitioned into a continuous brilliant amber glow; at this point i had to pull over to analyze what i was witnessing. this ufo i was viewing was within 25-30 miles and about 25*-30* above the horizon line. the craft seemed to be hovering with no movement for a few seconds and then it would slowly move from south to north. there were six total pulsating amber colored lights illuminating this craft rendering a diamond shape, possibly triangular pattern. again, this craft was within a 20-30nm visibility range on this clear night and was not just another *dot*, w/ strange lights you see from time to time that turn out to be a airliner deviating to assigned vor stations issued by the ftw ctr atc - whick this process sometimes will trick the eye into thinking it must be an ufo. after a minute or two on the shoulder of fm 4, two other vehicles were pulled over in front of... and behind me, but not close enough to verbally share the experience. i decided to attempt to catch video of the lights with my rca pocket size dvr, but the zoom is very limited and had zero success. i then decided to use my canon dsr camera with a 70-200mm l lens, but to my disappointment the craft and it's lights were gone once i turned on the camera. i thought, ���isn���t that typical???��� to myself. so... after waiting a few more minutes i decided to move on up the road, wife and kids were waiting on me. as i put my vehicle into drive and began rolling onto the pavement, i noticed the craft and the lights again, but by the time i disembarked the vehicle with my camera it was gone. all gone!\r\ni���ve been in the aviation

exposed to in my life of 31 years. the lighting being transmitted from this ufo was not of any pattern that would resemble military/ airline/ civilian aircraft being used in today's time. pilots are trained to identify the color/patterns of strobes on aircraft and distinguishing between military or civilian a/c. \r\nso is this another military special ops training mission to the brownwood moa??? most residents of this tri-county area are routinely exposed to these exercises and see ch-46s, uh-60s, c-130s, f-16s, f-18s, etc, flying hard and low all over these parts at all times of the day. that���s normal flight traffic to me and expect it without warning night and day. is this ufo a top secret a/c the us military is testing at night in around this airspace? maybe. are alien ufos visiting the wind turbines located in this area where i���ve calculated the lights/craft to be orbiting (32.4229325564, -98.4531027856)? maybe. or is it the military's way of replacing the shuttle program... we wish!\r\ni have been procrastinating posting this sighting for several weeks, but lately have been motivated by one more sighting. this, most recent, sighting happened two nights ago, may 17, 2010, when my wife and i were enjoying the stars from outside our country home around 10pm or so. we were walking across the yard and we both noticed a bright amber colored light very low to the horizon, we both immediately thought it was a satellite or a weather balloon. the lights we were seeing were the same lights that i witnessed back in march. somehow we managed to miss the lights earlier due to our eyes being focused in the skies watching satellites pass over. we witnessed this sighting for about 2 minutes and as we began to get a better view from my hilltop it vanished. they'll be back... =)\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

flying across the sky (east to west) stopped abruptly and turned right and took off just as fast as it came and was gone in a matter of seconds.  my husband (not a believer) turned and looked at me and said did you see that (very wide eyed) i said yes and then asked him what did he see, he confirmed the same thing that i saw but did not say anything and then i asked him what did he think it was and he said he did not know because it did not match anything that he ever saw or knew about.  there were no blinking lights, not an air craft, not a shutting star or meteor because it stopped and then turned right plus we have seen the meteor showers and shooting stars before, plus i am a disabled vet i served in the us army.  we looked to see if there were any satellites in our area at the time and we could not find anything stating that their was.  being born and raised in titusville, florida i am familiar with nasa and space debris.  at present time we have not seen this anomaly again.  we have seen the space station all sorts of flying aircraft, meteor showers but nothing like we saw that night. this siting has really pricked my interest even more to learn and find as much information as i can about our universe.  we still talk about this today between us because we have looked and tried to match anything we could to this and nothing even comes close not even a

thinking how i see repeated patterns in the sky in relation to the locations of stars...(i had been outback a few minutes prior watching the sky and i saw the fastest shooting star i've ever seen).. anyway i'm walking down the driveway and i fixate on two stars in the northeast sky, as i'm looking at them they rotate and switch locations... this feeling overtook me like is this real? did i really see that? i stopped walking as soon as they started to rotate and i stared at them for a moment then the one of them started heading north further away from me.  i dropped my garbage bag i headed down the street after it.  until it faded away in the distance.  i'm pretty sure the other light that stayed behind was gone because this happened near a pretty bright star and their weren't any bright enough objects to match what i saw near by when i looked for it. \r\n\r\nthese lights i saw were standing still when i fixated on them. then after a moment or two they swung around each other like as if they were magnetically retracted or attracted to or from each other.  i'm positive this is what i saw.  i live near mcguire air force base so maybe they were doing some high altitude test flights

noticed a black sphere like object, now i have seen these on 2 other occassions in coventry whilst at friends houses,    this time it was closer than before but soon drifted higher then stayed at a high altitude and moved very slowly across the sky towards the north i knew it was moving slowly as i lined the object up with a hole in the fence, i continued watching it for about 15 mins whilst i ate my sandwich outside on the bench, i then went into the house to take the plate and cup back and get my bag and jacket to go out on my bike, i was about 4-5mins and when i came back outside it was nowhere to be seen, it was fairly clear not many clouds so i would have thought i would be able to see it again easily but even as i went out on my bike i looked for it but still could not see it anywhere.\r\n the other 2 sightings were in the afternoon time on a weekday (not sure of dates and times) but my first sighting was a black orb at high altitude and i said to 2 of my friends, look whats that, and they dismissed it as a balloon, but it was quite a windy day and thought it would move more if it was simply just a balloon, and i watched it go in a perfect straight line away from north towards south then it kind of didnt get any further away ,at that point i looked away an within a minute it had disappeared and i did not see it again until about 2 weeks later when again i walked out into another of my friends back garden and looked up on a fairly clear day and seen the black orb shaped object and called my other friend to have a look it was clearly hovering ,not appearing to move away or get any closer it was about 10-15 mins i watched it then went inside for a drink then when i came back out to look it had totally disappeared, but again my friends are not as

was close to a canal and you could view it from her window.I was asleep on the floor,and i woke up for some reason and looked out the window and saw this white globe that resembled a glow of light from a lantern,which i thought that was what it was at first. but then i saw that the object was floating over the canal,and i got curious to what it could be.After a quick analysis of the matter,i suddenly realized that  there was no way someone could be holding up a lantern over the water unless they were flying in the air.The object would\r\nslowly move from one side of the canal to the other,then it would slowly lower down,as if looking for something.\r\nthat is when fear struck me,and i dived under the bed sheets,and began to shake with fear hoping that whatever it was would go away.I must have fallen asleep because that's all i rememeber.I didnt tell anyone about this for a long time.I was just a kid when it happened, right now i am 65 and i remember everything vividly.After this incident,i had three other \r\nunexplained experiences.One was around 1956 after we had moved to corpus christi.It was around 9 p.M. and i was coming from the corner store,and happened to look up at the sky,which was clear with stars twinkling.Then i noticed what looked like a very tiny meteor,zigzagging from one star to another.I thought to myself thats not possible,but strange.That night i woke up after everyone was asleep,and when i tried to move i couldnt.I tried to move my arms and couldnt,then i tried to move my head to call my mom,and couldnt talk.I could see her room,which was around the corner from\r\nmy room,but i couldnt do anything.I became very frightened about what was\r\nhappening to me but i couldnt do anything.I finaly must have fell asleep.\r\nthe next experience was 3 year later,and we had just moved to another apartment close by.My bedroom was on the second floor,and i remember i was half asleep,to the sensation that i was going out the window.Then i remember waking up,and realizing that i was floating in the air above the trees,and i could see the telephone poles,with the lights.I remember being very frightened and wanting to go back to my room,like trying to forse myself to turn around and go back.Years later i told that to my wife\r\nbecause my parents were not very understanding of my experiences.For a lot of

harbor washington on the water facing sw towards an area we locally refer to as the purdy (wa) spit. the olympic mountain range is in the back ground.\r\n\r\n   last year 09 around march i think it was, i witnessed the comet that came very close to earth on my way home from work one night and i have been looking up ever since because i found it extremely strange that the media made very little mention of this event as that it would have had the same destructive impact as the one in russia around the turn of the century that flattened thousands of acres of forest. i am sure you are aware of both of these events.\r\n\r\n   so i purchased a somewhat powerful telescope and have spent many nights since staying up late scanning the stars.\r\n\r\nthree-four weeks ago while driving down our road at around dusk i saw something. at first i thought it was a very bright star and then realized it was moving. i pulled my truck into the driveway and grabbed my scope, fixed it directly onto the object and viewed something far beyond my knowledge of technology.\r\n\r\n   i could see it very clearly through my orion 90 refractor scope. it was the shape of a diamond. the top half was amber red and the bottom half was as bright as a star. it hovered a while at around my guess 20-25 thousand feet and then dropped to around 8-6? in a matter of a minute or two as it approached then just cruised right over the top of us towards mount rainier. it made no sound though i felt like i could hear something like being close to a power line or similar almost like maybe all sound went away, hard to explain. as it passed over i then grabbed my scope and went to the driveway to view it as it moved away. from behind it was no longer the shape of a diamond, it looked liked an elongated circle eight figure of light, all amber red. and no, i am not an alcoholic nor drug addled so i know what i saw.\r\n\r\n   two nights ago,coming from the same direction, this time it was around midnight, a round orb like thing with a half circular arc just as bright coming out of the orb from top to bottom. it came from the same elevation and traveled the same direction as the first. then one hour later another one. these objects were without a doubt not planes nor helicopters. we have had quite a bit of f-16 type jets and apache/military looking helicopters buzzing over i think as a result these past few nights. we do not normally see these military type craft directly over us.\r\n\r\n   i did some research and found your organization to be the most credible so i thought i would share this with you because, well, i am a rational man who can actually believe what i see with my own eyes and i am now a firm believer that something is going on, and \"they\" whoever \"they\" are in our government are very aware of \"it\".\r\n\r\n   there is something else, something that actually makes me a little uneasy to bring up.\r\n\r\nseveral years ago, an acquaintance told me about a phenom known by many as chem-trails. at first i paid him no mind however now i think i am convinced that our government is carrying out these practices routinely. anymore in the greater seattle tacoma/bremerton area, we are lucky to have 1-2 un-obscured blue sky days per month all year long. i watch them regularly with distinct zig zag like patterns, haze up our sky. the jets are usually always solid white or white with a blue underbelly and no insignia (\r\n\r\n refractor scope gets a pretty good zoom in). i used to be skeptical of this but now am getting to the point that i unfortunately believe it to be true, especially after what i have witnessed this past year. i was out the other night trying to find my dog and with my flashlight you could see microscopic glitter like substance falling all around. gold, green, red and yellow/silver. \r\n\r\n  i have never contacted any organization about this stuff.\r\n\r\n you asked about the location. if you look at a map of gig harbor and purdy washington i am on the east side of henderson bay accross from the purdy spit/bridge area, looking towards the spit with the olympics in the back drop.\r\ni have givin you the

slowly dimmed to a faint point of light slowing moving northeast approx 60 degrees high for about a degree in length and then disappear. i star gazed for about 5 minutes until going back inside my

looking at. being in the city and being affected by light pollution, not too many stars are visible, especially in the weather conditions at the time. so i feel safe in saying it was indeed alphekka.

shooting star, falling quite fast and appearing to burn out after approximately one second. it reappeared after a very brief pause (less than 0.5 seconds) and began to shine much brighter and fall much faster. it also appeared to be getting quite a bit larger, but whether the object was actually expanding or just getting closer to our position is unknown. at this point, i said \"it must be fireworks or something.\" to which one of my companions replied \"there's no way, it was way too high\". the white light then turned to green and it continued to get brighter and fall at a very fast rate of speed, before either burning out or falling past the horizon (the darkness and unknown distance made it difficult to tell). overall, it was a very brief sighting, but for the sake of context, after the driver first saw it, i had time to react, change my position in order to see it, and have a brief exchange with my companions all while still viewing the
