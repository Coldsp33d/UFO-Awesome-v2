we were walking i noticed a brightening in the eastern sky that was fairly high up.  there were no clouds in the sky and the stars were clearly visible. the temperature was about 65 degrees with no wind. venus was low in the sky and there was an airplane also in the area.  this light was much higher up and to the left of venus.  it continued to get brighter and larger and looked like a cloud or fog. it had a general round shape. as it got larger a smaller object in the lower right corner showed through.  the only way to explain is it looked like a flashlight shining through the fog.  it was all very large.  much larger than a full moon. it was stationary and not moving in any direction.  it stayed there for a few minutes and started to slowly fade. suddenly directly below this cloud 4 perfectly round yellowish objects appeared in a diamond pattern.  they appeared all at once like someone put a stamp on a piece of paper.  these stayed stationary for a minute or so and started to fade.  then directly below them another complete set of exactly the same pattern appeared.  this happened a third time as the second set started to fade.  however, the third set seemed much smaller, like they were much further away.  all of the objects in the diamond pattern looked like they had a halo around them.  finally all the lights faded away, but the cloud like substance and halo around the objects took much longer and looked just like fog or smoke waiting to be blown away. it just hung in the air.  i did not have my phone with me to take pictures. i believe it happened in a total of 5-7 minutes. it was a truly bizarre experience. i have no idea what it was that i saw. the airplane in the area must have been able to see the same thing i did and there is an interstate highway

also in formation, flew over. then, more objects flew over, one-by-one. they kept coming until we finally counted a total of 15. they were almost directly overhead -- it's hard to say what angle. they flew straight, did not wobble, ascend or descend, and they were silent. nothing about them suggested they might be airplanes or helicopters. no noise, strobe lights, etc. i checked my watch when we saw the first group of three, and it was 10:12 p.M. the entire episode lasted a few minutes. \r\n\r\nwe were baffled by what we saw. we know that dover air force base is situated in delaware,

down. as the light approached to about 20 yards or so away, the light seemed to multiply or expand into the brightest, most piercing whitish-blue light. the last thing i remember is having my hair raise on the back of my neck and trying to scream and then the light engulfed us. the next thing i knew was that i was standing on the beach near where we had put our boards in the water. everything around me was distorted even though i was on the beach i was the same beach i had always been on. i thought for a second that i was dead. then one after another, my girlfriend and two friend appeared on shore but everything still wasn't quite right. the only way i can describe what i was seeing was distortion. it was like whoever took us was trying to dial our frequencies back into our dimension or something. i call them extra dimensional entities because they were able to warp the physical reality that we are living in. it's really hard to describe what i was seeing without sounding like a lunatic. just when i was sure i was dead, because there was no way what i was seeing was actually happening, the distortion faded. everything around us just settled down like they had found the right frequency setting for our reality. we all got together, group hugged and cried for several minutes. our paddle boards were still floating out in the lake and our swim suits were only slightly damp. almost dry which indicated to us that we had been out of the water long enough to go from soaking wet to almost competely dry. that gap of time from when we were taken to when we were put back is totally blank from all of our memories. we were taken but have no clue what they did to us. all that we could be thankful for was that we were put back without really being physically harmed that we know of. the experience definitely mentally and emotionally harmed us but i was at least thankful i was alive.
