(it's hard for me to remember the exact date. i think it was sometime in april of 1995, but it could have been 1994 or 1996.) i had been running an errand for my boss and was on my way back to my workplace in a nearby city. while waiting at a traffic light in union city, i suddenly noticed an extremely bright light in the sky in the direction that my car was pointed (toward the south). the light was white in color, small, round, and, seemingly, stationary. it was not blinking or twinkling and there was no other light near it. i could not hear any sound from it, but i was in traffic which could have masked a sound (assuming that it made one). i know that it was not the moon or an effect from the sun. it was not directly overhead and not near the sun. it seemed to be very high in altitude. there was not a cloud in the sky, so i had a perfect view of it. i was able to watch it for a few minutes, as the traffic light was taking a long time to turn green.\r\n \r\n     my first thought was that it must be an airplane, but i was puzzled by a few things. if it was a plane, why would the pilot turn on one bright light in the daytime? the object was not low enough in the sky to land, so i wouldn't think that it was a landing light. also, the light was not blinking and not red in color, as is usually seen on most aircraft. and, even though it seemed small in size due to its distance from me, it looked somewhat bigger than the usual lights that you see on aircraft.\r\n \r\n     as i was wondering about all of this, the light suddenly disappeared! it was as if someone had turned off a light switch. another strange thing was that i could not see a shape of a plane (or anything) when the light went away. if it was a light from a plane and it was close enough that i could see the light, wouldn't i be able to see a shape or silhouette when it went off? there was nothing there but clear blue sky! to be clear, the light did not streak across the sky or trail off like a meteor, so i know it wasn't that. it simply disappeared. \r\n \r\n     the traffic light finally turned green and i went on my way back to my job. i never saw that light or any light similar to it again. i had expected to hear something about this on the local news later, but i didn't hear anything about a light in the sky. no witness reports, no mention of meteor showers, no reports of storms in the area...Nothing. i only told my brother about the light and no one else, for fear of ridicule or someone just dismissing it as an airplane. (my brother is more accepting of mysteries like that, whereas most people just look at you strange if you tell them something like this.)\r\n \r\n     i have read many reports of ufos in books and magazines over the years, but that was the first time (and, so far, the only time) that i saw something strange myself. i never found out what that light was and i still wonder about it from time to time. \r\n\r\n

object in the night sky.It appeared to be a cluster of small red lights that seemed to be hovering or traveling west,in the distance to the east.It didn't look normal,so i decided to see if i could get a better look.I proceeded down the road about 1/3 to 1/2 of a mile. i continued to view the object as i traveled east on ann arbor rd.I finally came to where ann arbor rd.Ended and the highway on-ramp to enter (i-94 east) started. there was a fork in the road near the highway on-ramp and where a road,(knight rd.)merged. there was a small turn-out there.I turned right and i parked in the turn out area.I exited and stepped away from my vehicle,continuing to view the object.\r\n\r\nthe object was spherical in shape and black or dark in apperance,nearly blending against the night sky.It had what looked to be multiple, maybe 20 red lights spaced evenly across it's surface.If it hadn't been for the lights i probably wouldnt have noticed it at all.It's elevation was approx.500 ft.And it's distance was approx. 1/4 mile away.It travled slowly from east to west in a straight line.It seemed to almost paralell the highway on it's course.I dont remember the object having any particular noise,but there was a faint humming sound.The sound could easily have been from the vehicles traveling on the highway, as it was much closer than the object.I continued to view the object until it faded in the distance to the west.\r\n\r\nthe object never changed in it's course,speed or apperance during my observation.It just seemed to be out for a cruise.\r\n\r\ni have never before or since

10 and had to move my car because of traffic, i pulled to a side street and continued to see them between buildings. parked and watched the first three that i saw them change direction and appeared to

 by this time it was a very clear, dark evening, no clouds, and about 8o degrees.  the stars were very bright and i even mentioned to mom about the bright sliver of moon and the very bright star venus off to the west/northwest of home.  while talking to her i then looked almost directly north and saw a very bright light about 3-4 miles north just east of a peak called picacho peak heading almost due south in a direction that would take it about a half to full mile just east of my house.   it was a very bright, 5-8 times larger than venus to the west, and and had no other color other than bright white.  i first asumed that it must be a plane or a helicopter, because of the \"pinal airpark\" that is about 5 miles south of us.  i then realized that there were no blinking lights of any kind, just a constant star-like bright white, and it was absolutely silent.  sounds carry for miles in the desert air, but there was none from this object that was approaching at about the same speed that a small private airplane would be traveling.  i told my mom that i was watching something weird and wiuld have to get my wife chris to see it also. the light was then beginning to pass just east of the house (paralelling i-10 freeway).  i rushed into the house, told my wife, and we rushed out the back of the house to the back yard and watched it pass over just east of us--all the time never blinking or making a sound.  it never changed altitude, or veer east or west.  it seemed to head in a direct north to south line though it actually seemed to slightly \"flutter\" as it moved--it wasn't totally smooth in flight which seemed strange because airplanes do travel \"smoothly\".  my wife commented also that there were no blinking lights or any noise.  i told her to rush inside to get our daughter who was in her bedroom, and while she was inside, i watched the light, all of a sudden for the next 2-3 seconds, rapidly grow smaller, though by no means less bright, untill it just blinked out entirely.  it didn't go out because of disappearing in the far distance, because it was still within 1-2 miles of my house.  the light just shrank in size until it was just a very bright pin-point, and then it went out.  no sound was ever heard.  within about 4-5 minutes, an airplane with blinking lights flying nearly the same speed and the same southerly direction flew by, and both my wife and i could clearly hear its engine.  i have no idea what we saw, but the whole time i was also talking to mom on the phone.  she got quite an earful.","distance":"Over One

off to the south.  it appeared to be moving inside the clouds as it was not a sharply defined orb, but fuzzy around the edges much like aircraft lights seen through the clouds.  upon traveling furthur south along the roadway and my view was no longer obstructed by the trees around me, i discovered a second, then a third and finally a fourth, identical, orbs.  the lights all rotated clockwise in a circle around an arbitrary point.  after one and a half rotations, the four lights stopped momentarily and converged to a central point.  at the central point, the four lights again paused for a moment, then returned to their positions and proceeded to rotate, again, counterclockwise.  this pattern continued until i lost sight of the occurance as i travelled west.  my first thought was that the lights were spot lights coming from the downtown area.  the lack of any apparent column of light that would be visible from a spotlight soon dispelled any thought that they were spotlights.

share. i will be holding back some of what i witnessed so i can verify if anyone else has seen what i saw.  it was late november, 2009. it had just turned dark outside. i was sitting in our back screen room. when i saw a small blinking light about 8 feet away in the grass. my first thought was it was a lightning bug, but i live in tampa florida and i have not seen one since i moved here in 1984. i also noticed that this light was bright white not yellow, as is a lightning bug. the flash duration was about one second on , 5 seconds off. and as i watched it was moving toward where i was sitting. i tried to figure out what was causing this, looking around for anything that might be reflecting off of something in the grass. but as i watched, it just kept flashing and moving in what would be slightly to my left. as it came closer, lets say about 6 feet away i still could not make out what it was. i stood up and moved to the corner edge of my screen room (where our dog had tore the screen) and leaned out looking down. i was at this time only about 3 feet from the light when it stop flashing and began to get brighter and brighter. baffeled at what was happening. i stared  at this thing that began to roll around like it had flat sides on it. i still could not make out any shape to the object. i leaned down as close as i could without falling trying to see  something, as i did this, it began to vibrate very fast. so here i am leaning out of our screen room watching as a very bright, very small (maybe 1 quarter of an inch)  light no more than 36 inches from me. i didn���t know what to think, then (heres the good part) i could see some kind of a square outline in the middle of the light, and then all of a sudden it shot up into some type of a portal within maybe 4 inches off the ground, and it was gone. needless to say i could not believe what i had just witnessed.  because the portal (lack of anything else to call it) slowly dissolved. dripping some sort of metal like fluid. which dispersed before hitting the ground (this is where i am going to hold something back.) since this happen, i was consumed by what had happen, so much so i had to try and draw this, and i didn't do that well. i have attached a low res file.          my question to you. craft, entity or device? and where the heck did it go? has anything like this been reported before?\r\nps.  one more thing, scifi shows do not do this justice.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

vision of figures standing around what seemed to be an operating table. when i opened my eyes i ���m still in the bedroom, all lights were off, everything seems normal. but a bright light was showing through the window blinds. this bedroom in on the second floor. i looked around and caught something moving in the air. it was very hard to detect. i noticed this sort of wavy motion in the air. i kept starring into the dark to try to catch what was moving around. i noticed this type of a scanner moving very slowly over me and my boyfriend. i could barely see it. it was like a hologram, but i could see this circuitry, very thin wire with a tiny light moving following the wiring. it moved over my head, over my body down to my feet then it shifted over my boyfriend, same pattern. it did not make any noise. and like i said i kept  loosing sight of it but then would catch it in my visual field. i wish i had something i could have thrown at it to see if it would bounce off of it or go through it. i got really frightened and screamed, when i did that the light went out and the scanner vanished immediately. i did not tell my boyfriend of this as i know he would think i am crazy. he was not aware of anything, he sleeps very soundly and it���s difficult to wake him.. this seemed to be some sort of scanner for a lack of a better word. it was like stealth. are we being scanned by an

before the library opened. i turned my face upward to the sun, i had on dark sunglasses. to the right in my field of vision i noticed a thin white contrail approximately 4 inches long traveling from my right to left above the clouds. it was traveling very fast and what was creating the contrail could not be discerned it was just a thin fast moving white line. i watched it travel across my field of vision for a few seconds before i realized what is wrong with this picture? the contrail was not changing merely moving across the sky from my right to my left above me (my head was angled up)it did not lengthen and disperse change color or intensity that i could see with the naked eye as the contrail moved across the sky. as i continued to watch there was a brief flash of silver i could make

been maybe a new aircraft unknown as yet to the general public. shortly after it disappeared i noticed a jet flying considerably lower and slower flying north over my head. i then rose and continued

moon and slightly north west to it, was the planet venus. \r\n\r\nat around 8:30, 8:45.. i could see what would looked like \"star dust\" seemingly emitting from venus in two trails in a 45 degree downward trajectory, headed by a very small  blinking white light. this \"object,\" from my point of observation, was moving at a very slow pace. the light and trail so faint, barely visible to plain eye. \r\n\r\nfrom the north, a white/blue light was shooting across the sky in a jagged flying pattern. sometimes the light would disappear for a second, reappear above the moon, disappear again and reappear moments later in a position below the moon.. all the while heading south until disappearing behind the landscape. \r\n\r\nby this time i had entered the \"phoenix bypass route\" which is where the i-8 meets up with 85 north heading back up to i-10 w. it was just before 8:55 pm.. i just made the switch onto the 85 north.\r\n\r\nwhat looked like a flare being \"shot out of\" venus, and also at a 45 degree angle, started gaining acceleration towards the ground. as the \"flare\" flew closer to the earth, it appeared to change in color.. ranging from bright white.. to pinks and finally a white-blue. this streak of light.. or this \"fireball,\" also appeared to be growing larger and brighter as approaching the ground.\r\n\r\ni remember feeling like i was about to see a spacecraft crash into a field just to the north of me. i remember preparing myself for the \"impact.\" before the object touched down, i stopped my truck short in the middle of the freeway and did a 180 degree turn, with the intentions of following the object for the rest of its voyage.\r\n\r\njust before it hit the ground.. the object leveled out in a seamless motion, and it shot across the terrain... a white fireball (the light smaller now), and in a \"zipping\" like motion, this object hovered and glided gracefully above the ground before disappearing behind some nearby desert terrain.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":23324,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7000212,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05162010-0018","longitude":-114.6196916,"occurred":1273981500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,

streiber's transformation amongst her belongings, it raised some questions in me, it wasn't until i was old enough to appreciate the potential reality of the phenomenon that i became intrigued enough to ask her about why she had this book. as i can understand it, she had bought the book in an attempt to make peace with an incident that occurred before i was even alive. this is an account of that story that has been relayed to me on multiple occasions with absolutely no discrepancy over the years by my parents who to this day are shaken up about their close encounter of the second kind. on the evening of early june 1984, my mother and father joined some family friends at their summer place in cape cod for dinner. everyone has finished their meal and by now are sitting outside within a terrace facing a lake. the couple my parents had come to visit has a young son about seven years old who because it was around 11 o'clock was being put to bed by the wife upstairs. it was then that my mother, father and the husband of the couple were outside conversing when out of nowhere an all encompassing sound of bass that seemed to surround them as if they were placed within a bubble began to sound. my father recalls it reminded him of \"someone smashing metal objects clanking up against a garbage dumpster with a sledgehammer\". my mother was four months pregnant with me at the time and recalls saying out loud \"just go away, please don't hurt my baby\". she recalls an immediate onset of life ending fear followed by a wave of calm, which in her own words she suggests was her \"acceptance of going to the other-side\", referring to the afterlife i assume. after about 30 seconds of this unbelievable sound, it stopped whereupon my father noticed what he described as a \"silver flying saucer with six or so windows\" hovering in the sky\". i asked him for a frame of reference how far he estimated it was and how big it might have been and he states that it was just over the lake and with the moon visible in the sky, perhaps 100 yards away, making it in his own estimate between 40 o 50 feet in diameter, but couldn't say for sure. he recalls the husband counting out loud on his fingers from 1 to 9, before the craft moved from a completely stationary position to shooting off into space, and within in an additional few seconds had completely disappeared. the strangest part is yet to come; when the wife of he couple came back downstairs to rejoin the group, she found a room of stunned people. she asked what was going on and thinking she was joking my mother replied \"yeah right, very funny\", or something to that decree. she hadn't heard a thing. this made no sense. she was upstairs putting her son to bed and had absolutely no experience to any affect whatsoever. i continued to probe my parents with questions about this incident for years to come. first of all they were miles from any town or civilization, a private dirt road through the forrest being the only means to which once could reach the house., so the possibility of some earth terrain vehicle is easily dismissible, especially since the sound came from directly overhead and seemed to surround them. there was however a military base somewhere in the town in which they tried to contact the following morning to ask if there had been any test flights to which they said there hadn't been. whether this craft was man made, or of extraterrestrial origin and even charted on radar is another mystery. the aftermath of the incident was unfortunate. the husband of the couple my parents went to visit was a man of intelligence and concrete thinking as he taught philosophy at a prestigious university. after this incident, he refused to speak one word about it to my parents dismay who at the time were trying to make some sort of sense out of it. he refused to accept the reality of what had happened as i can imagine it shook the foundation of he world around him tat he had come to know and accept. the couple and m parents stopped being friends after that night and haven't spoken since. to this day i am fascinated as to what might have happened with the craft considering i was in developmental stages of being formed, and what they might have wanted to do.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,
