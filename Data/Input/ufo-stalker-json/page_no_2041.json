City","country":"Philippines","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It started approximately a month ago at around 10pm with an inexplicable event.  what i saw was a grey, transparent form which approached me as i lay on the couch at home.  i work in a coal mine as a driller and i live in a share house, but i am often home alone.  this \"form\" only stood about 4 1/2 feet tall with no discernible features.  i was terrified at the time and leapt up on the couch shrieking at whatever this was.  it vanished up the hallway where i watched it linger for about 5 minutes.  after i composed myself, i became extremely curious.  through my fear i attempted to call it over, but it wouldn't come toward me again.  my supervisor arrived at our house at around 11pm and i explained to him what i saw before falling asleep on the couch.  at first, i thought it was a spirit entity of a deceased person, but events after this have caused me to believe this was workings of extra terrestrials.  my supervisor informed me yesterday of strange behavior during my sleep which he observed from another chair.  he told me that i leapt from the couch, eyes wide open in panic while gasping for air.  he said it appeared that i was having great trouble breathing and was about to call the ambulance, but then i lay back down and was peacefully fast asleep.  i have no recollection of this event, and i have had several episodes of disorientation recently, some of which have had about 10 minutes that i cannot account for.  this sleep disruption prompted me to voice record my sleep activity.  i had the sudden notion that doing so may reveal me communicating with something? while i slept.  the playback was as disturbing as it was intriguing.  after about 3 hours of sleep, i can hear myself communicating with something else.  i was home alone while this recording took place, and you can physically hear the voice of a being having a short conversation with me.  the voice is very deep and monotone and needs professional media analysis to hear exactly what it is saying to me (i'm dying to know!).  i hear it talk first, then i say \"who?\" it speaks again and i say \"okay\" again it speaks and i say \"i don't care\", at this point it's volume and pitch raises and it appears to say \"don't say that!\".  the next event happened a week later in the same spot on the couch while i was half asleep with dim light in the room.  i saw a number of the same grey forms which were placing their hands on my legs and working their way up my body, one after the other.  this time i felt an overwhelming sense of calm and euphoria as this took place and i could physically feel where they were applying pressure.  whatever happened, my senses have heightened greatly.  sometimes when i sense presence, my physiological reaction is so strong that i feel like i might pass out.  this happened a short while ago while i was working in my drill rig so i got the voice recorder out after calling out aloud \"who is here\".  the playback is the same sounding voice only much louder and more distinct which says \"c a a x\".  i work completely alone on my drill on nightshift 5 nights a week.  i was drilling in quite an isolated place at this time with nothing but vacant land as far as you can see and the mine workings are behind me.  i had turned all radios off, idled the engine back, and silently watched the phone as it recorded.  i didn't hear any sounds at the time of recording.  the only other sound present is the hum of the drill.  it was then revealed to me mentally somehow that this entity can manipulate ambient sounds to form words, thus the louder result in this case from the drill as opposed to the fainter sound of the aircon unit while i slept.  in addition, the speech is inaudible whilst being transmuted into a recorder. on the 10th of may, something told me to shut the lights off in my drill and look outside.  it was then that i observed a bright orange light shoot from the ground up to maybe 5000 feet or so.  upon further observation, i made out 3 orange lights which appeared to be rotating clockwise.  it then shot up approximately double the distance again and while i strained to see, it appeared to be repeating the rotation sequence.  it disappeared after 10 minutes and then i emailed my sighting to this website:  http://www.Ufoinfo.Com/phone.Shtml#australia \r\nat this email address:\r\nauforn@hypermax.Net.Au\r\nbut my email was returned \"undelivered\".\r\nthe following night i received a distinct mental message to stand and look out my front, drill rig window.  being ready for anything by this stage, i video recorded this short moment.  i saw nothing until played the video back.  on this clip, an object can be seen to propel down vertically, make an impossible turn that would crush a human, and jet away horizontally.  i slowed the video down on my computer and watched over and over as this thing moved.  i took a still shot of it and zoomed in.  it appears to be cigar or saucer shape and left a grey contrail.  shortly after, i felt a great sense of discomfort and panic.  i shut my rig down and felt like i had to leave immediately.  i ran over to my ute and was paralyzed as i saw a bright orange light approaching me at no more that a few hundred feet high.  i \"knew\" that it was coming to see me.  it got to about a kilometre away and what at first just looked like light, appeared to have mass behind it.  it was completely silent as it moved.  i stood terrified, not sure whether to stay or go.  my flight response kicked in, i jumped in the car and sped away.  after an hour of scanning the sky i returned to my rig.  i heard over a large number of mining equipment calling workshop for electrical problems over the mine two-way for the duration of the shift.  i have since been \"receiving\" information which i cannot explain but after some net research, find validation or synchonicities of this information.  it's now becoming a task of discernment between what is \"received\" and what is imagination.  the most of which that seems to be accurate is naturally when something comes to me while i'm consciously thinking of something else.  i am happy to share the evidence that i have, but i'd like solid reassurance that it won't be reproduced or shared without my permission first.  thank you for reading.  i look forward to speaking with someone about this.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n[cms/tg/pid]","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23321,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":14.469869,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-05162010-0015","longitude":121.031961,"occurred":1273474800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Metro

outside on my back porch,to smoke a cigarette and stargaze. i occasionally see satellites moving across in space and i guess thats's what i was looking for. the sky was absolutely clear as my gaze was fixed due east since my porch faces that direction, towards the galveston bay.\r\n after being outside for about five minutes, i saw a very bright light appear  in the southeast at about 75 degrees above the horizon. just east of the moon. it quickly dimmed to nothing before i could get a fix on the exact location and searched for anything moving. i saw distant stars in the vicinity but not so much as a satellite. \r\ni continued scouring the skies for anything in that area. suddenly it lit up again. brighter than venus and the moon. it did not appear to be moving. it, once again, dimmed to nothing and the sky was just blank again. absolutely nothing. no satellite, no plane. just empty sky where it had shown. \r\n i continued to watch for several minutes but saw nothing. \r\nin my honest opinion, it seemed, to me, to be a beacon or a sign. it was not a flash but rather a quick brightening and dimming. or a pulse perhaps. one bright pulse, one minute later a repeat and then nothing.\r\n the very next morning at about the same time i was in the same position. gazing up. almost due south i saw something get very bright. being prepared this time i actually saw it as it dimmed. i could see what appeared to be a distant star-like object or satellite moving. it was moving in an easterly direction at a high rate of speed. faster than any satellite i have ever observed. it then dimmed to nothing and disappeared completely.\r\n i live by bush intercontinental, hobby and la porte airports and i'm used to planes and their lights. i have seen space shuttles and the iss fly over. i have never seen anything that lit up so bright and, at least, seemed so distant. like a pulsar. \r\n i was awed by this experience and know that what i witnessed was something unique. not just once but twice on two days, consecutively. \r\n i still believe it was a sign or beacon.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

a cigar with windows stop over greenfield park someime around oct 31, 1977 which hovered over a group of ice skaters for approximately ten minutes once and then returned for period of one minute disappearing quickly!  i reported a similar encounter by myself on the road between cedarville, ohio and south chrarleston, ohio approximately in the spring of 2006 on peter davenport's site, nuforc.Com if you want to look it up!  the cigar had lighted portholes.  the object descended rapidly to fly parallel to my car while i was driving home from classes at payne theological seminary.  it first appeared to be a very bright star and then came down so fast, that i was shocked, but couldn't pull over anywhere as that part of the road was narrow and had drainage ditches on both sides.  the craft skimmed the top of the ground without any sound.  it was a clear and warm evening and i had my car windows down!  it rose rapidly and became a star again sitting in the sky over cedarville.  i went down the road to find a place to pull over and after a mile or so found a truck pull-off and kept looking backward to watch the thing as much as possible without running off the road.  there was no other traffic!  it was so amazing that i still think about it today every time i drive through that area.  never saw anything like that before or since.  the object looked alot like the drawing submitted by the person who reported the greenfield park sighting.  incidentally, i worked in new berlin nearly forty years ago and used to go by greenfield park to run and job in the early 80's while

approximately four story apartment building between the hours of 3:00 am and 4:00 am sometime in early july of 2009 when as we were talking, out of the corner of my eye and to the surprise of the other two individuals appeared out of nowhere and formed as if were being hand drawn in the sky the shape of a half rainbow. the color of the light was predominantly green but had essences of other colors within it. it happened over a residential neighborhood in hollywood near the hills. there was no sound so i don't think it was a fire work nor any man made display of any kind, not to mention it was approximately 700 feet away around 60 degrees from directly in front of us. more disturbing than the suddenness of the incident was the duration, lasting only a few seconds; 30 seconds at most. as the greenish rainbow shape like vapor trail in the sky dissipated i could make out an object in my minds eye similar to that of a traditional grey saucer sinking just below tree level within the adjacent neighborhood, and just as it had come it was gone. the three of us looked at each-other in awe, silent for a few moments before i broke the silence in an attempt to quickly recap what just happened so we wouldn't forget it. i feel it is only natural human psychology to try to reason ones way into an explanation, much the way the brain can play tricks on you convincing you that things are there that aren't, on the flip-side it can also try to bend the truth so that the reality we find ourselves forced to process can fit into our definition of understanding and normalcy. i immediately said \"did you see that? don't forget what that was. we saw a light and a craft, did you all see the craft?\" they both nodded. my friend remarked, \"what does it mean?\" having an inherent interest in the ufo phenomenon, i replied \"nothing, they screwed up, maybe their shield came off, and we weren't supposed to see that.\" after all it was quite late, or early should i say,  who are they to know anyone would be up here watching. i haven't talked to one of my friends since that night. i had a third friend who was with us that night, but he was downstairs inside and asleep. i told him what we had witnessed and without thinking twice he dismissed it as nothing more than a misidentified what have you. a week went by before he non-chalantly says to me; \"oh yeah, that green

lunch by the elephant enclosure when i noticed right in the distance an extremely large object in the sky it was right in the distance and an air balloon looks like a spec from a distance but this thing was much larger than an air balloon.\r\ni watched it moving very slowly then decided to use my camera to zoom in to the max so i could get a better view. the picture i got looks like a very large flag with some symbols on it, but the weird thing is the size is out of proportion to the trees. there doesn't appear to be any kind of flag pole attached to it either. there were para gliders about this day but i dismiss it as that. i only took the one photo and the flag shaped object continued to move slowly and disappeared behind the trees. after i got home i tried to blow the picture up but i still can't make the symbols out, however i made another discovery there are 2 saucer shapes in the sky near by. on seeing i have captured 2 saucer shapes in my photo i actually feel excited i have witnesses some kind of ufo.\r\nplease take a look at the photo the first saucer shape if you look at the flag at the top right corner follow it out diagonally and you will see it and the other is

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Driving northbound on the 55, between katella and lincoln shortly after 10:35pm, my friend and i noticed a very bright blue light that pulsated over the duration of approximately 2 seconds in an on/off pattern. it took about 0.75 seconds to fade from lit to unlit, waited approximately 2 seconds then another 0.75 or so seconds to light back up, then remained lit for another app. 2 seconds. also, there was a much smaller red light that seemed to be not so obvious and almost tucked into it, where it was only visible at certain times but not others.\r\n\r\ni don't believe in aliens visiting us, to be honest, and i would normally dismiss this as a low flying helicopter, specially given that there was a red and blue light, one could assume it was a police helicopter. however, this was not very low and proceeded to \"leap\" during the bright portions of the light cycle and i've also never seen a police helicopter pulsate and this length of oscillation. this light moved in correlation with the brightness in an almost logarithmic way. so as it lit up, it started to move faster until it was at full brightness where it maintained speed, then slowed down as the light dimmed again. it reminded us both of the children's game called leapfrog, except that it was completely lateral.\r\n\r\nthere was a lot of apparently odd characteristics that left us both very confused. we are both very used to seeing police helicopters and even ordinary helicopters, but we were both convinced that this behaved unlike anything we've ever seen before.\r\n\r\nit's a little difficult to explain why this was to abnormal, but i'll try my best. as the light \"dimmed\" off the location seemed to slow. during it's off-cycle the light remained apparently stationary. then, during each \"pulse\" of light, it apparently gained speed until it was completely lit, dashed a few hundred yards, slowed down as the light dimmed, where it appeared to remain stationary again during it's off-cycle.\r\n\r\ni tried as hard as i could to debunk it, thinking maybe it was a stationary light that only appeared to move during the on-cycles, except that when we first saw it, we were 300 yards north from kattella and it's origin was to the left of the freeway (northwest of the 55 at lincoln), within approximately 1-2 minutes, after crossing under the meats overpass it was on the right (which was approximately southeast in the direction of katella to where it was over the hills that are by irvine regional park.)\r\n\r\nthe freeway is very straight at this location and when it bent we lost sight of the light because of the roof of the car on the passengers side. if you look at this area you will see that if the light was at on the left during the straightaway, then it would have to be moving to be obscured by the back part of the roof of our vehicle at this bend.\r\n\r\nhttp://maps.Google.Com/?Ie=utf8&ll=33.819303,-117.828112&spn=0.025564,0.049782&z=15\r\n\r\nhere's an idea of the direction of travel when compared to our location and it's apparent proximity to us.\r\n\r\nhttp://img.Skitch.Com/20100516-gg3b83hnb1mfnmmwefamtbwxmm.Jpg\r\n\r\nthis was a very interesting experience and we are not sure exactly what it was. we are also looking forward to any other witness testimony, i suppose in an attempt to solve this but at a minimum, at least prove that we are not crazy.\r\n\r\neither way, thank you for your time and please contact me directly

the curb in front of the house and we all carried in bags of groceries up the sidewalk leading to the house.  my wife enter the front door first, followed by my two daughters, age 10 years and 12 years, then my son, age 14 years.  as i walked up the two steps to the small porch i looked up in the sky and out of the corner of my eye saw moment.  there were no clouds in the sky. the object was traveling slowly west to east.  it was huge and i called my family to come quickly.  we all stood on the porch and i said, ���don���t talk, observe everything and we���ll talk later���.\r\n\r\nit was about three telephone poles high, (120 feet high), moving very slow.  we lived in the suburbs, no was one was outside and there was no traffic.  we were one house from the corner intersection.  the object was across the intersection to our right.  the object extended over four houses and their yards plus the street making it about 500 feet (approx) from the leading to the trailing edge. it had multi-colored flashing lights around the parameter of the edge.\r\n\r\nno sound whatsoever was heard.  it moved past the houses over a level field for about one mile away from me.  off in the distance i remember how bright the lights were on a very busy street running north and south one mile in the distance, and thought to myself about all the people who would see this object. \r\n\r\nwe watch the object move over the distant street, another one-forth of a mile over business, including a large parking area for fedco.  it then moved over a highway (395) and about another one eighth mile to another field that was near the end of montgomery airport, (where i had flown as a student pilot).  it stopped and a white light (that you could see through) shown down from the perimeter of the object to the field below; it now seemed to be only 50 feet above the field.  then, in the center of the object, small opaque white pieces of irregular shape,(about the size of a football) fell to the ground.  then the lights below the object went off, a moment pause, and the object zipped into the sky at about 30 degrees, becoming a small dot of white as it disappeared in the upper atmosphere.\r\n\r\nmisc info: i was an amateur astronomer (ground my own 6\" lens).  after seeing the object we just sat at the table saying nothing and very calm. my son did not see red lights but he saw green lights among other colors.  i don���t remember seeing the color green, but rather red.  could the flashing lights be a means of tranquilizing human?   nothing was ever seen in the newspapers.\r\nmy wife, a staunch baptist, would never talk about the incident.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" \r\n     this event happened sometime between summer of 1951 and summer of 1955. i had gone to church on a saturday afternnon to go to confession. the church is on whittenton street across bay street. after confession i left the church from a door opposite the one i had entered. there is a palyground at the end of 5th ave and i was heading there to look for my friends. after leaving the church i was immediately surprised at the silence outside. there was no sound of cars on whittenton street, at the time 5th ave. was home to many french speaking families.There were no sounds of children playing and no sound of the old french speaking people on their porches speaking to each other. these people could be very loud as they talked to others next door and even 2 houses away. there was not even birds chirping. the silence was deafening.\r\n     i looked to my left and saw no cars passing in front of the church, then as i turned to my right i noticed this thing hanging in the air above this huge old oak tree at the top of the hill on 5th ave. at first i didn't have any idea what i was looking at. i was maybe 11 to 13 years old at the time. i can still see this thing as clearly in my mind today at 70 yeas of age as at the time it occured. i was looking at a round disc shaped object hovering above the huge old tree at the top of the hill. it was larger in diameter the the tree and was maybe 20 feet above the tree. the top of the object seemed to be rotating in one direction and the bottom was rotating in the opposite driection with a stationary center section. there was a row of big what i can only describe as windows but they were not windows as we think of them. the street is not very long maybe 150 feet at most. so i was very close to the thing. i was simply stunned! i just stood there for a few minutes looking at this thing. even today i can still see this figure in the center section kind of leaning with outspread arms on something and looking directly at me. at the time i was convinced it was looking directly at me. suddenly i felt that someone was telling me to be calm and be quiet and that things would be ok. it felt like waves of calm were radiating out from this object. all of a sudden it was like my body came back to me and i turned around and went back into the church and down the stairs to the center of the church. i stayed there for a time and remember seeing my aunt leaving the main part of the church. i quietly went to the door i came in and all of a sudden i slammed the crash bar and left the church and without looking anywhere except straight ahead i ran just as fast as my legs could move to my home which was maybe 200 yards directly across bay stree and on another section of whittenton street. my home was in the 3rd house on this section on the right of the street.  i stayed in the house the rest of the day and knew that if i went outside that thing would be there looking for me.\r\n       a few days later  my mom took my brother and sisters and me to my aunts house. after we got there and visited a while my aunt asked me why i didn't say hi to her in the church. i told her i was scared and she asked me if it was because of the thing in the sky. she had seen it too and promptly went back into the church to wait inside for my uncle to pick her up. she and i both agreed on just about everything axcept the waves of calmness, she was only outside for a few seconds before returning inside.\r\n       there was an empty hall just catty corner across the street from my home. one of the churches in the area was using this hall as a church while their church was being demolished and a new one built. one sunday morning after attending mass i was leaving this church and for some reason looked up in the sky and to my astonishment there was the same object slowly rising straight up and i lost sight of it as it disappeared into the clouds. again i ran home as fast as i could and never said a word to anyone bout this event.  \r\n         i swear these things happened to me and my aunt. both churches are still there. the playground still exists, all the houses are still there.  the hall still exists. sadly my aunt passed away a few months ago but she did tell my mother what happened and my mother is still living. i am writing this now because i happened to turn on the history chanell and watched the program u f o hunters. i have never comunicated this to anyone outside my family because i didn' t want to be seen as a nut case.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23294,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.909461,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05152010-0017","longitude":-71.0813674,"occurred":-557686800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1273953693000,"summary":"A

aluminum disc (it was rounded and convex on bottom) flying very slowly over the roof of his house (we were in his back yard).  there were some telephone lines behind the houses across the street from his house.  it appeared about as wide a house with two slits or windows in the edge and about 5 feet or more in height.  it made a humming noise like a humming transformer which varied slowly in intensity (up and then down and repeated).  i think i saw motion in the window/slits but am not sure of this.  it went slowly then sped up, then went so fast it seemed to dissapear.  it was about a block away when it dissapeared.  about a minute or less after that two jet planes (scopions) flew over the same telephone lines.  i never seen jets fly that close to our homes before.  we ran into to
