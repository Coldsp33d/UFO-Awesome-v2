northwest of sharon, pa. from where i saw it this would put it over trumbull county, oh.  at first thought, i was wondering if it might be venus but it seemed larger than that and i know venus does not appear in the northwest sky.  in addition, the light had an occasional flicker as if it were a star. i thought, though, that the flicker might be coming from twigs at the tops of trees that may not have been readily apparent in the night sky from whewe i was seeing the light. i became curious and decided to try to get a better view so i headed west from where i was and headed to downtown sharon, pa.  once in the downtown area, the object appeared as what can be described in terms of size and brightness as an outside incandescent porch light of a house that would be about 4/10 of a mile away from where i was. the lighted object appeared just above the tree line at the top of the west hill area of sharon, pa.  at this point i knew what i was seeing was something unusual because it was low in the sky and there were no blinking red, white, or blue lights surrounding it that would indicate some type of commercial or private human aircraft.  i decided i wanted to get a better look, so i proceeded through the downtown area and out the northwest side of town in the direction of the light. i had lost sight of the object for a little while until i got to an area of high ground on route 846 where the light would occasionally disappear behind trees on the west side of the highway. by now the light seemed that it was more above me rather than so much in the distance and appeared to have a more yellowish cast. i continued to search for more open space so turned left and the next main intersection and headed west into trumbull county, oh. there are alot of wooded areas in the area i was in so i was searching for more open farm fields well into trumbull county to get a better view.  there were large gaps between visuals of the light because of the trees but managed to get my best view while on route 305 about 2 to 3 miles west of hartford center.  however, by this time the object had moved quite a distance to the northwest heading in a northwestterly direction.  at this point, although still quite large and yet at a greater distance away the object appeared more yellowish-orange and more pulsating.  i continued to pursue while on route 305 until lost sight of object behind the distant trees to the northwest of route 11. this is where i ended my chase believing that i was not going to catch up to it and it was already about 11

near chu lai, which is about 25 miles southwest of danang. i was assigned a machine gun emplacement (we had to provide our own defense). it was about 5 or 6 in the evening. there were a series of long and quite tall sand dunes at our back and our machine gun emplacement was at the end and on top of one of these dunes.I had my rifle over my shoulder,just waiting for my men to show up and man the bunker. was standing looking across this field toward where the woods began (in between two dunes).  all at once i noticed a black speck at about a 23 degree (approximate) angle from the ground. it grew larger and larger and never wavered from that angle until it seemed to be a black sphere, about a mile or two away. it was about the size (at that distance) of a dime but of course,from that distance it could have really been quite large...I estimate about 20 feet or so in actual diameter.\r\n     it just set there for about 2-3 minutes, then it seemed (slowly to move away, at that same 23 degree angle. when it stopped and hovered i thought about shooting at it with my m-14 rifle, but i thought, well, what if it shoots back or whatever.  i was not scared but fascinated.\r\n        i thought about reporting it to my c.O., but i did not want him to think i had lost my mind or that i was trying to get out of my wartime service.\r\n         i don't know of any devices or aircraft that could make the moves this object made...Not even a helicopter could move in such a way, in my opinion.\r\n       i have done some research, and the only similar incident reportedly happened in germany in the 1600's, at which time, folks reported seeing multiple black spheres, but i do not remember what the article said about how such spheres behaved.\r\n  unfortunately, i had no cameras at that

landing of my second story stairs. we were both outside. it was night time and there were a few clouds scattered. it was dark in our location. you could see the silhouette of the barn/ garage outside and the tree line adjescent to the local main strip, which was located just beyond the trees and out of view. you could see some stars in the sky while looking out over the yard from our height. we were outside having a cigarette, to keep the smoke away from the kids inside the house. my friend was facing me with their back not facing the barn/ garage. not facing the tree line. i was taking a drag of my cigarette and because of the distance my friend was from me, i exhaled the smoke up toward the sky. while doing so, i sighted a cluster/ group of ufo's (approximately 6-8) gather above the garage/ barn. in my bewilderment i asked my friend \"what are those?\" \"what isss that?\" she turned around and \"i don't know, what is it?\" we both excitedly looked on as the cluster hovered above the barn for a few seconds. they were obviously not that far overhead. they were doing a \"dance\" of sort. very controlled. they moved on ahead in the sky, which took them to above the tree line. (silhouetted) at this point the cluster of ufo's again paused their traveling and did that funky dance again. the dance looked as if they were exchanging spots. each individual craft was approximately the size of one of the small box cars people drive around. there was no noise at all. they were internally illuminated at the bottom of each craft, not bright at all, no light coming down or outward from the craft. just a slight illumination, a self illumination of a melted silver/ off white color. i myself, personally noticed a shadowing of the tops of each craft, to me it looked as if it were colored a dark bronze black mix. barely noticable. anyhow, as they paused the second time, i called for my kid inside and rushed them to come out to experience this before the crafts may disappear. my kid did witness the last few seconds of the sighting. we all seen the same thing. the experience amazed the lot of us. we all drew pictures of the sighting and all came out with the same dipiction of the sighting. we had no other explaination for the sighting. we thought, balloons, but balloons dont act controlled or stop in mid air. we all thought maybe aircraft, but no noise at all. the motions that the ufo's made a conventional plane could not do. ball lightning, but they did not flash or boom. whatever it was, it was definately an odd experience, exciting, exhilerating (to me) and i wish i could see them again. i have had other sightings before. as well as the witness's. thank you for listening and look up, you would be suprized at what you might see from time to time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23272,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.4166607,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05142010-0006","longitude":-71.3746774,"occurred":1273380300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

earlier in the evening, at approx. 20:00 hrs.  but this single aircraft was going much faster than the usual flyovers.\r\n  about 1-2 seconds ahead of the c-130 was a very small, very bright object traveling in a perfect straight line.  the speed varied, very fast, then slower, it repeated this pattern across the entire skyline: fast/slower, fast/slower.  even at the slower speed the 2 were flying very fast!  the c-130 was traveling at a constant speed.  in my opinion the c-130 was close to being maxed out in speed and manueverability.  after all it is a cargo plane.\r\n  the small bright object veered toward the right (south) as it neared the eastern horizon.  as did the aircraft in pursuit.  they both disappeared into clouds.  i could not see any details on the bright object, it was too small, and too bright.  the 2 were north of new providence, maybe over willow street, and strasburg.  maybe over route 30.  then probably chester county, pa.\r\n  the object was under intelligent control.  the brightness varied i think with the speed.  there was no exhaust or vapor trail.  the bright light was constant, no variation.  first i thought it was a meteorite but it had no trail, no sparks or smoke, and didn't head toward the ground, it traveled parallel to the ground.  the object was very small compared to the c-130.  if it wasn't so bright the object may have been impossible to see.  the plane was at least 75-maybe as much as 100- times bigger.  the whole thing happened in just a minute or so.\r\n  the weather was partly cloudy, with a 5-10 mph southeast wind.

to the highway but the distance back to the object seemed much much shorter. we finally got back to it and parked in front of it. we all saw a bright white light casting a glow on the ground directly to the right of a dramatically smaller seemingly reddish light.\r\n to the left there appears to mabye be an even smaller light close to the ground moving around. throughout this experience the lights brightned dimmed turned off turned on and even multiplied and we have this all on film. when the lights multiplied we got the he'll out if there and i managed to film it as we were leaving and the object seemed to actually pace us because it neither grew smaller or more dim as we high tailed it out if there. i can't exactly remember what happened next but i remember when we finally got away the object was completely elsewhere. i have some freeze frame stills from the original footage that i will email you but to get the full scenario i will try to convert in the next day or so. the original footage was shot with a sony mini tape recorder type camera. basically a mini-vhs. we recorded a copy to vhs and took frame samples from them. the pictures i'm about to send only cover a minor detail of the whole event so as soon as i  make a digital copy i'll email that to you as well. i don't own or possess the original but if my friend consents to being contacted then you will have access to the original. \r\n\r\non another note,\r\n\r\ntoday my massouse noticed a scar on the small of my back that i can't account for. i haven't had any kind of cuts or anything there and the only time i can honestly remember having that kind of pain is when i went to st louis to my ex girlfriends and woke up with the pain in my back and conciously observed the \"entity\" in the door way. i'm still not sure what to make of all of this. i can't sleep, i'm terrified of being alone, especially at night and i never feel alone. i always feel like i'm being watched or there is someone near me. i stay at work after hours to get caught up and ive heard un accountable shuffling noises, grunts and coughs and moving objects. i have no clue what they are or what's causing them but i am honestly in constant fear nowadays. i thought about going to a psychiatrist to get it off my chest but they probably wouldn't take me seriously and wind up doping me up on prozac or something. please see what you can make if this mess,  it's driving me nuts! thank you and i really appreciate your efforts!\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23266,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4513015,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05132010-0014","longitude":-94.0283481,"occurred":1273464000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

then boyfriend worked in golden, b.C. as a security guard for a construction site. he only worked nights so i would visit him and we'd lay\r\non the roof of this building and star gaze. \r\n\r\none night around 3am, we both heard an abrupt clapping sound and a few feet from where i was originally staring at brick red triangle appeared out of nowhere. it wasn't shining like a light but it was glowing and was a definite burgundy/brick red color. this thing looked exactly like a stealth bomber and was flying around the same level as a common bird would fly. it wasn't too high (or at least didn't look like it was), it seemed pretty close (or it was rather large but quite a distance away). anyways, this thing was flying with the peak of the triangle in the direction it was flying, and the left and right points were almost parallel with the ground and sky. i would say it was leaning at a 70 degree angle if that makes any sense! as soon as it appeared it slowly moved across the nights sky at such an abnormal pace.. too slow for a plane, too fast for a bird.. after 5 seconds of this it there were two of them.. and it looked as if there was another one right behind it so perfectly aligned that we couldn't tell that there were two, but this thing up and infront of the original pretty quickly and instantaneously they started doing rapid coordinated flight patterns. the best way to describe it would be the light from a flash light, if someone were to wave their arms around frantically, the light would be jumping around in a violent, jerky way yet both of them remained flying together, the perfect distance apart. this lasted for 3 seconds and they stopped abruptly, flew parallel next to each other and continued the original pace for 5 seconds or so and then disappeared into the sky, not behind a tree or anything.. but disappeared from our eyes from the nights sky.. and without a sound unlike when it first appeared! this ufo flight didn't take utilize too much space either, if you were to outstretch your arms it would be a 2 foot span from your perspective in the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":23265,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.296233,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-05132010-0013","longitude":-116.962996,"occurred":1154340000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British

sidewalk very excited and urging us to come over quickly to her and verify that she wasn't seeing things.  she immediately had us look up to the sky to west and we witnessed two very bright orange glowing objects that were traveling in a southernly direction.  the objects traveled for a few seconds and then stopped still.  i ran into the apartment to get my binoculars and came out to scope these objects out.  they were hard to make out much detail other than they were very bright and glowed orange.  i was not real steady with the binoculars and could not really see any defined body shape. after a few minutes one of the objects just disappeared from where it was stopped.  the other object stayed in place and then it disappeared.  my neighbor said she counted nine of the objects when she first noticed them and after a few minutes one or two of the objects would disappear and this went on until we arrived on the scene with only two of the objects remaining. my neighbor indicated that they traveled to the east and then back to the west and then went in the southern direction after we arrived.  we tried to determine what they might have been.  they were not aircraft, fireworks, weather balloons, meteors, and they made no sound whatsoever.  they were nothing that we had ever seen before. upon first viewing these things the hair on the back of my neck was standing straight out and my heart rate was high as i had never experienced anything like this before.  we kept looking for them to reappear but never saw them again. an interesting note was that i told my father about them and he said he was driving home from a friends house at about the exact same time and he said that he spotted two of these objects as well and could not figure out what they were either.  it was twilight with some daylight remaining but with venus showing clearly as the brightest star in the sky.  these objects were much larger than any possible star, plus moving and glowing

(8:30-9:00pm) she called me to the bedroom saying there was a light in the sky.  i went upstairs (we live in a tri-level home, facing west on high ground with open space behind us affording us an excellent view of the front range) and saw a bright star like object.  the object was west of my home at approximately the one o'clock position, high in the sky. i looked at it through my telescope. (meade ng 60ar with a 9mm eyepiece) the object was white and larger and brighter than objects normally viewed from my bedroom.  viewed through the telescope the object pulsed, changing colors blue and orange/red.  there was no discernable shape.  the object was stationary.  i viewed it for several minutes.  i told my wife i thought it may be a celestial object and atmospheric conditions may be causing the color changes. (ever being the skeptic) she continued to watch the object while i returned to the living room.  thirty minutes (approx) later, she called out that the object \"just disappeared\".  i returned to the bedroom and saw indeed, the object was no longer visible.\r\ni checked the western sky every few minutes after that.  approximately thirty to forty minutes later i saw a similar object low in the western sky, (approx four o'clock) further north than the first sighting, possibly in the general direction of boulder.  my wife called out at the same time that she too was seeing the object.  \r\ni went upstairs and looked at the object through my telescope.  this object was much closer than the first.  it occupied more of the field of view that the first object.  i could not discern a definitive shape but, i saw a row of lights on the bottom.  they pulsed down the length, left to right changing colors as it went. (red, orange, white, blue-not in that particular order) there appeared to be a second, less discernable row of pulsing light above the other row.  this gave the object a slight unfinished \"e\" look.\r\nthe object then began to give off a circular faint white corona that slowly pulsed.  this white light corona pulsed three or four times then the object just \"blinked out\".  i had viewed this second object for about ten minutes before it blinked out.\r\napproximately a half hour later a third object appeared in the western sky.  this object appeared similar to the first object but it was higher in the sky (near twelve o'clock) and because of its size viewed through the telescope it seemed to be further west.  i watched the object continually through the telescope for nearly thirty minutes.  it was moving slowly to the west.  it moved on a flat, straight line trajectory\r\nuntil it had traveled out of my telescopes view.  it did not \"set\" being the mountains like a celestial object.  those objects travel from top to bottom in the field of view of the telescope.  this object did not do that.  based on the high altitude of the object it is possible it was near utah when i lost sight of it.\r\nthis entire episode lasted from approximately 8:30pm until approximately 10:30pm.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":23261,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7385919,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05132010-0009","longitude":-104.8274595,"occurred":1273302000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1273791292000,"summary":"My wife and i saw three seperate objects/events.  viewed at an unknown distance/altitude in the western sky.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"Aurora, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:128353"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Franklin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband called me and told me to go outside and look at the sky,i was inside my house cooking so i went outside and i saw what looked liked a cigar floating in the sky, my husband states that he saw it around 1 pm today and it is now 3 o'clock and is still up in the sky, it seems to change colors, it's black but it also looks like silver. it looks flexible. i could not believe it, some people calculate that it might be the size of a football field.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23260,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.500374,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05132010-0008","longitude":-74.4824868,"occurred":1273734000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,   Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1273788265000,"summary":"It looked like a cigar and it was black and silver.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Franklin, New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:128354"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Tifton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Stopped at exit 59 off i-75 ga.(love's truckstop) while walking nw to the\r\nbuilding a flash of light to the west attracted my attention. the object was approx. 2 to 4 miles west and perhaps at 4000' in altitude. it was traveling due north. the object was silver and was reflecting the morning sun. it also appeared to be tumbling as the flashes were irregular in frequency and duration. the object was visible between the flashes and although i could not determine a definate physical shape it could have been triangular. after about 45 seconds the object turned to the nw and shortly after went out of visual range.
