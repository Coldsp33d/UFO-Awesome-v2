camped in the mouth of the canyon with plans on seeing the petrogyphs the next morning. we set up the tent and when we finished it was dark. my 14 year old was playing with a powerfull green lazer. he was shining it on the canyon walls and up in the air seeing how far it would go. it went milels. he would throw dirt in the air and wave the lazer through it and make cool designs. when we were finished, we started to check out the stars. we were pointing out all the sattlites we could find. \r\n   than i looked up tward the south and saw two lights a bit bigger than the sattlites (i judged them to be closer to the earth than the sattlites) comming tward each other north ward and mostly vertically (if i stuck my hand up they would be about six inces apart and and closing fast.)  and almost collided i yelled to the kids \"look ufo's\" and pointed to them. when they almost collided one on the right was slightly northward of the other one and then they zipped apart horizontally. the one on the right zipped off to the west and behind a cloud and the other one tward the east. they were traveling in a very smooth deliberate mannor, much faster and closer than the sattlelites we were watching. i know what we were watching was out of the norm. nothing i know of behaves this way other than ufo's (this is the second sighting in my life thus far.)  the one that went west we didn't see again. we watched the other one on the east side for a while longer and then it went behind a cloud and we could still see it faintly then it disapeared.  i saw another light that i belived to be the same one that came back out of the cloud tward the south again and flashed a couple of times than disappeared. the whole experience lasted for about a miniute. the kids didn't want to go to sleep. they thought that aileins were going to abduct them. i reassured them that i had the gun with me and they would be safe. they felt better and did go to sleep. in the morning we cheked all around for

you are a narrow minded barbarian that believes everything you've ever heard. ocassionally i will look for ufos as a recent hobby and have seen some compelling evidence. its amazing what you will see when you look up at the stars all night long night after night. since i am a night owl i have recenty been spending anywhere from 2 to 5 hours looking at the stars each night. i use a combination of a led high powered flash light and a 90 mw green laser pointer to signal or attract anything i can. well i'll speak about the latest sighting. i went to my brothers house in cockeysville maryland i told him about the stuff ive been seeing so he wanted to try too. we went out to a spot away from the street lights of his neighbor hood on a hill and started playing around to attract a ufo my brother decided to shine the laser on a low motionless star far in front of us(he said it looked out of place) then he screams its moving i look and it is true a star that has been sitting there for god knows how long starts moving towards us but to the right of us the object was some what low in the sky and still looks like a star but its moving right after we shined it with the green laser! after about 55 seconds it starts to go transparent but i could still see the light but it went from solid light to see through light to completely invisible and disapearred. he always told me that he has been seeing weird things there at his new apartment but i never really believed him till now i always thought he overacted but this was freaking realllllllllllllll@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we were excited at the time it was happening but then stopped caring like it wasnt a big deal i mean what else can we do the event was over there is nothing left to talk about or be excited about plus we have seen much cooler stuff recently and in the past. i would recommend getting a green 90milliwatt laser or better yet more powerful and use morse code and shine stars and make your own signals basicaly draw attention to your self and you will see some stuff if you keep at it. dont shine them at airplanes though that is illegal im pretty sure mufon should bring some equipment out here because the stuff we are seeing is pretty weird and cant be from humans there are tons of different species of aliens out in our or their airspace all the time you just have to get there attention or annoy them enough please call me and send someone out you might just be able to catch something on camera its a hot spot i think maybe it has to do with the mile deep mine which is just one big hole but a mile deep timonium,cockeysville, hunt valley, and monkton, maryland has a lot of activity going on!!!!!!!111 oh the craft moved slowly and steady then gradually faded out into nothing you could tell it was

into the sky and admired the stars at night. i saw several different stars, and one that i thought was mars. i told myself, wow mars is bright tonight. i ate my lunch, and then lied on the ground because of being tired while looking up at the sky. the star that i thought was mars looked as if it was moving. my eyes gazed upon it, and it was moving in a very unpredictable zig zag motion. i thought that it may be a airplane, but airplanes don't stop nor zig zag as they would crash. i thought maybe a helicopter, but choppers do not look like mars nor be that high up into the sky. the star would zig zag, stop in mid flight, and then turn in the complete opposite direction. the star was fixed in the sky while i was eating, but the minute i laid on the ground, it started moving. it seemed to know that i noticed it. it would sometimes circle, go back and forth, and then stop in midflight. no sound, nor any sign of any fuel propultion system.\r\n\r\nas i was watching it more closely, i thought well maybe a satelite. but an orbiting satalite does not zig zag. i admired it for a little while, but then i had to return to work.  on my second break, the sky was more hazy and all of the stars could not be seen. i laid back down again, and saw another star. this star was fixed, but did show up through the haze. i be darned, that star the started doing the same motion. i laughed at myself, and thought why do i make stars move. i shined my cell phone light up at it, but did not seem to get any response. the star did not look like mars on the second break. it looked like a normal star light years away. but as this star started dancing, it got the mars orange tint to it again.\r\n\r\nin my opinion, it was was either in space or at the edge of earth's atmosphere. i think it was a technology that we do not have that i am aware of. looking up into the sky, nobody would have noticed it at all. it fit into the whole sky. i would not have noticed either, until it started moving.\r\n\r\nwhen i came to my belief that it was something from space, i thought that they were using it to see what us earthlings are doing. it wanted to be under cover. i think people who look for ufo's expect to see lights, triangles, or saucers, but does not think a star would be a ufo.\r\n\r\nit was like a secret camera fixed to watch us in our normal day to day lives. the spies new that if the came in their ship, then there cover would be broken. it reminded me of like a probe driod from star wars.\r\ni am a believer in alien life way before this event. \r\n\r\ni admire bill birnes and the ufo hunters. i have a bachelor's degree in psychology, and i am aware of all of the hullicinations and sometimes mind tricks. but this was as clear as a bell.\r\n\r\nso it was no suprise to me to see a real extrordinary event. this was my first ufo sighting, so it confirms in my mind that we are not

attention.  this was at approximately 20:50 est.  the object appeared to be just a very bright star at first-- which was what caught our attention.  it was later determined to be moving, however, after a closer study.\r\n~a few points to supplement this assertion are: \r\n1) object was eclipsed momentarily by tree limbs at several points and but would always return to open sky, as perceived from our position in front of my house. \r\n2) it flickered as it moved back and forth along the horizon and in circular or arc-shaped, sweeping motions to and fro.  \r\n3) the object's light would dim after it reached the peak of its arc-maneuver and hence begin to move in the opposite direction, and would brighten considerably when facing us. the path of the light's beam could be seen when facing from side to side. \r\n4) once in awhile, the light would juke every which way and at odd combinations of sharp angles, in short bursts of incredible speed. \r\n~it at first seemed to be hovering over one point but we found the object to be maneuvering away from our position, as it eventually disappeared over the horizon. we were both compelled by strange, anxious feelings for the duration of the sighting.\r\n~ we repeatedly had to back up to keep the object in our view and actually had to move to my second-story balcony for the last ten minutes of the event, as if hypnotized to stare at this weird light until it could no longer be viewed. this was at approximately 21:19.\r\n~ i attempted to signal the object with a mag-light-- in numeric combinations of numbers counting down from three-- but to no avail.  at one point, i attempted to use the 75-watt bulbs in the balcony lights as well. but still, the object retreated.\r\n~i judged the object to be three miles away at first and was gone forty minutes later, still moving  in the direction of the delaware water gap. this thing was very bright and very noticeable; i would find it hard to believe that nobody else saw it besides the two of us.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

occurrence.  it was a warm, cloudless, still night and my son and i were sitting in our backyard, as my son was reclined on a bench looking up at the night sky.  all of a sudden my son exclaimed that he  saw what looked like a soft white single color ribbon, flying silently across the sky, it was perhaps 45 degrees off the eastern horizon, flying south to north and within a few seconds quickly faded as it moved across the sky. the distinct shape never changed, and there were no distinguishable individual lights that he could see.  shortly after that we caught sight of another formation exactly like the first sighting flying south to north directly overhead, silently, and at approximately 80 degrees off the horizon.  it was a somewhat translucent, solid light, with the curved leading edge the primary visible structure.  it was a distinctly curved object, (perhaps boomerang shaped)-  that was only visible for a few brief seconds before fading away.\r\nwe caught a third shape of the same formation shortly after the second.   it was in the same location the first sighting was and faded quickly.  the object seemed very large, quiet with a faint white,  luminescent light emanating from it.  each sighting the object looked like it was at a different elevation in the nighttime sky, perfectly formed. and although we saw 3 distinct things fly through the sky that night above us, they were separate and exactly the same shape, although different sizes.  it had a definate edge all around the curved shape.  it was as if we were seeing something that was almost completely invisible, except for the curved leading edge of the crescent.  i don't know how large the objects were, but they must have been very large and high in altitude, because we lost sight of them in a matter of seconds.  we are located in the middle of a medium-sized city, lots of lights all around us.  two military bases are located in the vicinity. (mcas and army testing ground).\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":23229,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.6948212,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05102010-0013","longitude":-114.6265216,"occurred":1270872000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1273553530000,"summary":"3 large, silent, curved objects moving south to north","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":31,"locationName":"Yuma, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:128901"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"New York","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting at my computer with a friend (who was working on his laptop) in my bedroom at home.  my apartment is located on the 19th floor of my building and my window has a pretty good view of downtown n.Y.C., so i'm usally looking out the window.  i also have a great view over the hudson river into new jersey, and i costantly looking into the sky.  on this day it was very nice out with the sky clear with no clouds so i had my windows open for fresh air.  while working on the computer, i took a minute away from the screen to glance out the window. while looking out, i noticed two parallel lines of smoke in the sky above some buildings about 2-3 miles from where i am.  at first, i shrugged it off as clouds in the sky or chimney smoke.  then as i thought about it for a second, i realized that it was a hot day, there shouldn't be any buildings running their heating systems, and at the same time i looked again there were no other clouds in the sky.  that's when i looked more clearly and noticed that the objects weren't clouds or smoke.  one of the objects started moving away from the parallel formation it was originally in and started drifting away to the left of the other object and at a greater speed.  the objects were very far away, but i could still see their outline in the backgrond of the sky.  i then told my friend to take a look to see if he could figure out what it was as i began to grab for my digital video recorder.  i figured i could see the objects better with the zoom on the camera.  at first my friend couldn't see the objects, so i turned on my camera and zoomed in on the object in the sky that was closer in the camera view.  while i was doing this, the object that started to drift away at first was now very far from its original position near the other object, and was very far and high in the sky going in the direction towards space, away from the earth.  i began to record the other object, which was moving in at its original speed and direction, trying to maintain the focus on it while zooming in.  my friend looked at the digital display on my camera and could now see the object as well, but couldn't determine what it was.  for the next few minutes, i tried to keep the focus on the object trying to get a closer view with the zoom, but i kept on losing the focus.  while continueing to record, the object i was filming seemed to now change its direction as well, and was now drifting to the left, following the path as the other object, but not as fast.  i could see that the object was moving at a high speed, but it was far and high in the sky.  it was leaving a small smoke trail behind it that was reflecting the glow of the setting sun.  i zoomed-in with the camera as best as i could, until i captured the object with the best stil hand i could hold.  the objects then disappeared into the sky where i couldn't see them any more.  i've seen jet planes, and other things in the sky that i could distinguish before.  this object had no blinking lights, and was almost transparent in the sky.  i figured it could have been a missle of some sort, but that night, there were no reports of any nasa or military events.  i live in new york city, and since the events of 911, i would've thought if there were any activities in the skies above new york, the people would be very aware of things in our immediate atmosphere.  anyway,  i have the original footage, but no way to upload it online.  i've shown it to a few close friends and they can't figure what it could be.  i welcome your expert opinions, and will allow you to view the the recorded event.  feel free to contact me as soon as possible, my information is provided above.  thank you for your time, and hope to hear from you soon.
