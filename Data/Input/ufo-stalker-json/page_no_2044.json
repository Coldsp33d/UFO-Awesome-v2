(but after looking at my pictures expanded and inverted from the paint program is appears as a round orbed object. however this is not what i see with my eyes.)\r\n\r\nso it was there at the corner of my house on the east side heading towards west in an angle. i ran in front of my driveway looking up to see where it went and i couldn't see through the trees then my dad was next to me and i told him to get the car.\r\n\r\ni looked and it was already down south from where i lived. block down in seconds. that is when i saw my dad and i ran down and we got in the car and we were talking about it and i told him \"it is going down.\", then my mom came out and was confused and my dad gestured with his finger for her to come in the car. \r\n\r\nmy mom asked \"what is going on?\"\r\n\r\ni looked over at her and i said \"mom, i saw a f_____ ufo.\" \r\n\r\nso i told my dad \"hurry\", \"hurry\", \"hurry\" and he said \"i am going\" \"i am going\"\r\n\r\nhe then asked \"where is it?\"\r\n\r\ni said \"it is right there, you see it?\"\r\n\r\nhe said \"yeah i see it.\" \r\n\r\ni asked my mom if she seen it and she said \"it looks like a bird, but it isn't\"\r\n\r\nso we start heading west. i was on the passengers still looking at it making sure it doesn't lose my site. so then we turn and head south.\r\n\r\ni was still searching for it and i seen it off and on and it appeared to all the sudden it was heading east. it appeared to be a little higher than it previously was when it was by my house. but it was far. i was at foothill drive during this event and it was far down between state street and 3rd west and around 33rd south, as i was able to spot it again. it looked like a star shaped figure now. it was strange. it was just there floating and hovering there. \r\n\r\nwe went down 23rd south westbound and took the sugar house exit as it was floating above that area. it eventually went to 15th east and 33rd south. so we head back up towards east millcreek. i was upset because i saw the object change direction. it stopped after heading east and i saw it and i felt like it knew that we were following it somehow and it went down west towards east millcreek. from there i lost it for a bit because it blended well with the mountains. i thought that we were not going to see it again, until i spot it again at east millcreek at the smith's marketplace.\r\n\r\nwe got out and observed it some more. when i spotted it during our journey of following it, at times it appeared to have wings of some kind and the weird part of it was when it ascended straight up it did a loop and it appeared to have wings like the nazca condor. it had that wing span stretched. this object was too big to be a bird, it never flaps its wings and it was shape shifting.\r\n\r\nas it was ascending higher and higher into the sky i saw a lightning bolt that was faded appeared close to it. the weather was windy however the dark clouds were approaching from the southwest. i don't believe that it was a balloon on how fast it went in a matter of seconds, how it was changing shape, how it looked like a spaceship of some kind. it was ascending higher and higher until i couldn't see it with my eyes it went so high that it blurred with the sky.\r\n\r\nwhen it was ascending up a black jet appeared going south east from where the object was. it was bizarre because i never seen that fighter plane before. my dad said it looked like an ov-10 but he wasn't sure and told me to look it up. the plane that flew by it had a two contrails coming out of it, so from that evidence alone it had two engines and he said it might of been on ov-10 because of how slow it was. however, it did seem like a reconnaissance aircraft of some kind.\r\n\r\ni had to concentrate on the ufo, because i seen planes before.\r\n\r\nthe object seemed to be out of reach for that plane anyways as the airplane kept flying down south east. it came out of nowhere and coincidently towards the area of the ufo that i seen.\r\n\r\nit was also doing some weird movements as it ascended up, it was going left and right up and spiraling it's way up. it was bizarre and i am pretty sure that i saw it extend it's wings as it was doing this it looked exactly like that nazca condor from the nazca lines. the best way i can describe it it was extending out like a cross like figure.\r\n\r\ni saw something that i cannot explain. i labeled it as a flying humanoid as well because of the pattern it moved and the shape shifting that it was doing. since i seen videos of these \"flying humanoids\" shape shifting. but this was a little different at the same time, since it appeared to have spiked wings of some kind.\r\n\r\ni am really hoping that what i saw can be explainable. i am actually hoping that i did not see an alien craft of some kind. i am hoping someone out there saw what i saw over salt lake city and i am hoping someone can tell me it was nothing. however, from what i experienced it was too weird to be anything from this earth.\r\n\r\nin respect to the questions this report requires me to point out i will recap below: \r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?\r\nin my backyard with my dad cooking bbq. \r\n\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\n\r\ni always look up, but i had a feeling that something was towards that area so i looked and there it appeared.\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n\r\na hang glider, a parachutist, a bird, a kite and a airplane.\r\n\r\n4. describe the object and its actions and motions.\r\n\r\nit was slow then it was fast. it appeared to be a constant speed kind of like floating and hovering. the object was triangle shaped when it started off and it was flying weird directions, it was shape shifting where it looked like a bird like the nazca bird. it was weird. the spiked wings was changing directions and shapes. the object was also pitched black and changed into a star shaped figure at times.\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n\r\nthe atmosphere did seem different. it is this uplifting feeling when i saw it really. my eyes were watery and i took this seriously. i was shocked and i was amazed and terrified at the same. i never took my eye of it and i was determine to keep staring at it until it disappeared from my eyes.\r\n\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n\r\nit went so high that it blurred from my vision and a storm came in covering over the spot that i seen it at.\r\n\r\n\r\ni have two pictures. i circled the object in black as it appears as an orb. this is not what i seen with my own eyes. the phone on my camera was the only thing that i have. i am upset that i don't have any other camera or video camera of this object. but i thought that i had no evidence. the quality sucks because you can almost barely see the object. if you notice that it appears and stands out against anything around it in the sky. if you invert the color in the paint program it looks more clearly.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

it was a relatively clear day and as i drove slowly down this road (20mph speed limit in our neighborhood) my attention was drawn to the horizon just over the tree-line at the end of the street, probably about 1/8 mile in front of me.  i noticed what i thought was a small plane moving across the sky west-to-east (left-to-right).  what immediately jumped out at me was how low the plane was flying along with the blue-red glow that at this distance seemed to envelope the object.  my first thought was that it was a low-flying plane so i rolled down my window but there was no discernible engine noise.  as i got a little closer i expected that whatever it was would become more obvious but the only thing that changed was that the blue-red color seemed to be emanating (sp) from the bottom of the object. i kept trying to make out wings or tail with no luck.  at this point i was approaching the end of the street and the first of two quick right-turns.  as i took the first right turn the object seemed to be picking up speed and disappeared on the other side of some trees. the second right turn about 6 houses down got me out from under the trees and while the object was still viewable, it had definitely sped up and was almost out of sight, still heading east-northeast and still hugging the top of the trees.  after a couple of seconds it was gone.  i pulled into my driveway about 15 seconds later and rushed inside to tell my wife what i had just seen. as i stood in our dining room trying to explain this, i heard what sounded like a helicopter flying extremely low over my home.  i immediately went out the front door, looked up and there were two black helicopters flying unusually low over our subdivision, heading in the same direction as the object.  the time between

sitting in our car. it is parked on a gravel road next to a farmers field.Car is off, keys in the ignition. it was like i just woke up. i looked at my wife and said we should get going. i wasn t aware of anything wrong. didn t feel paniced or abnormal.I looked in the field and there was a cylinder shaped object laying on its side, not touching the ground, just above the wheat field. it was like a chrome silver, smooth, as in no seems, rivets or anything on the exterior.It had a round pointy end on both sides. it looked like chrome but there was no reflection in it.I commented.What's that.My wife replied a grain bin.I replied ,how is it laying there not touching the ground? my wife says it must have legs.I look at this object. no legs, no noise, i could actually see air space between the bottom of the cylinder and the top of the crop. the object was about 60-70ft long by 20ft in diameter. it was about 100 ft from the road .My wife says go and take a look at it.I get this uneasy feeling and have this desire to get the hell out of here. i drive to yorkton, sask. arrive at the grandmothers house. she meets us at the door and says, you guys stay in a hotel? we don't reply back.. where were you guys last night?..We don t reply back.I heard her questions but my mind went blank for a responce.It did not sink in to me that i was away all night. that i left at 9:00 pm the night before and just arriveing now. the grandma says theres something wrong..We are acting funny.I have no reply, don t feel anything is wrong or abnormal. as i type this my heart is raceing.I'm laying in

doing drugs or something...No reply from me.Diane goes and talks to her niece, my wife. i don t know what happened but diane is upset that we didn t contact anyone and we aren 't saying anything. i

disc shape ufo. i noticed what looked like a top and a bottom ring band around its center section. proceeding around it. then i realised that inbetween these bands looked somewhat to be windows. going all around  and each seemed to be separated. looked as if it was the same type of metal that those rings around the center were constructed from.It also had a top and bottom to the shape of half a ball.\r\n\r\nkeeping my eye on it, i wanted to see if it was moving. if it was, it was moving at an awful slow speed. but more i drove the larger it seemed to become. that is when i came to the

aircraft that buzz this area. i couldn't estimate the size, nor did i see a body shape. what i did see were two deep orange wing-tip lights where the red port and green starboard lights should have been. they were steady, no strobing. there was a center, red light which strobed. there was jet engine noise. the aircraft was moving very rapidly, and disappeared into the trees, and the sound diminished immediately, which was interesting, as everything in this canyon echoes, and military jets, on training flights, can be heard both before they are seen and after, for a long period of time. i thought it was a jet aircraft, due to the sound, but the lights were totally wrong. i tried to follow it visually, but the trees blocked my view. it was visible for probably no more than 20 seconds,

be a sillouette of a dome shaped craft hovering near the clouds in downtown kansas city missouri. next an oval shaped craft flying through cloud cover during a severe storm which looked intentional. a star shaped craft near the clouds that had a perfect star shape with five points.  while riding home from work noticing a object approximately 8 to 10 feet long seemingly float through the air rotating and pointing up in the air lengthwise. moving slowly about 5-15 mph northward. tried to turn around and follow craft, but it dissapeared. searched for several blocks but could not relocate. that brings me to 2 days ago. since the first sighting i have really been watching the skys lately.  and what i've found out is that if your'e not careful, you'll find what you're looking for. two day ago i got the wise idea to go out and stand in the front yard and observe the sky.  well i didn't have to wait long or look very far. it wa about 22:45 hrs.It came from a southeasterly direction. a ball or sphere glowing white. not a bright white but a luminescent glow about two to three hundred feet above my head movin in a straight line at about thirty to forty mph, as it came over the top of me it paused glowed brighter and then continued on its way. less than two minutes later another craft with the same approximate description was moving in the exact opposite direction also glowing. it however did not pause or increase in intensity. it never increased it's speed and flew out of sight. i could not believe my eyes. i couldn't and still can't understand why i was given an opportunity to see these things. and finally when i looked to the north after the second craft had left the area i noticed another craft toward the north with two light one red, and the other white which stayed on only a couple of minutes and appeared to be strobeing or pulsing. it seemed to just sat there in the northern sky until i got up the nerve to raise my hand to give the appearance that i was trying to say hello a few seconds later a extremely bright light came on, flashed and then were off again. i am becomming a bit concerned. after wittnessing this last event i went into my home and woke my wife and told her the details of what had just happened. it felt a bit like close encounters when i told her and she gave me a look as if to say you're crazy, come back to bed! i never realized that by seeing these things one is opening him or herself up to a lot of scrutiny by friends,family, and even strangers alike. so mufon representatives please! please! do your best. don't do it thinking your'e going to help push ur toward a new era of technology. do it to help all of us to understand these beings and why they're here. something i noticed most of these crafts were seen while looking toward the sun.  other during severe storms and now i think that they are becomming bolder and allowing themselves to be seen in full daylight. why because most humans don't really pay close attention to events in the sky unless spectacular. i don't know if these crafts are that far advanced, but they sure look like it. perhaps thousands if not millions of years ahead of us. so good luck and be careful. they don't seem to think that we pose a threat to them. i wish i could say the same.\r\n","distance":"21-100

lived in suburban connecticut, bordered by hundreds of acres of land owned by the bridgeport hydraulic company- there was a large reservoir  which i believe was one of the reservoirs supplying water for the greater brideport area. i was enjoying the night sounds and the cool weather once the sun had set. i noticed something in the sky and looked up to see a very large silent disc (with no lights) moving slowly across the sky not too far above our colonial 2 story home. i watched it for a few seconds and then began to call very loudly for my sister or my grandmother (who was babysitting my 4 younger brothers and sisters) that evening to 'hurry up and come outside to 'see somehing.' i kept looking up at the sky when this huge disc moved slowly and silently over our house. by the time my grandmother came out of the house (annoyed at my yelling) it was too late-the disc had passed and was 'heading' toward the area where the reservoir was located (i would often take a walk through the woods down there a lot and it seemed like the direction it was going) i have never seen anything else like this and i am now 55 years old. i have never forgotten this image and i often remember the event and am so curious about it...I remember it like it was yesterday although it occurred over 40 years ago!","distance":"101-500

sat on the balcony of my apt. at night and viewed ufo's on a regular basis.  i am facing north, my view to the south is blocked.  hwy 83 is on my right and i define my viewing area by hwy 355 to the west.  i call it the funnel or corridor.  i have seen mundane ufo's zipping thru the skies and some amazing sitings.  one such siting last summer was an object moving from the east to the west and passed right in front of me.  the object was relatively low in the sky and was shaped like a cone.  it was brilliant and appeared to have rectangular panels but edges were not decernable.  the light coming from it was like light refracted from a prism or off the surface of a diamond.  amazed that the next day there was nothing in the news.  i have seen objects change directions between 45-90*.  i have seen one huge object that was outlined and milky white.  in the brief time i saw it another smaller ufo crossed underneath it and was backshadowed as it crossed along the diameter of the larger craft.  the real observation is the pattern of objects coming in from the south in the \"funnel\" to north in the distance and actually decending.  the time frame is usually 20:00 hrs to 21:30 hrs.  the number is 2-3 in most observations.  if i take a leap here they are landing and from a map the only place i can see where they can do this with some obscurity is busse woods.  i have tried to follow them down as far as i can and when possible i employ a 10x50 nikon binocular.  \r\nif you want to really document ufo's in the skys over chicago just use a time lapse camera at night.  you can't miss.  there are nights i don't spot anything but over time it is enescapable.  i have other accounts but this will do for now.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then
