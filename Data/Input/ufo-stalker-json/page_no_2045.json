we saw a plane and i was joking and said \"dude look, its an alien!\" and it was just a plane, but then we started joking around some more and watching planes, we kinda spooked ourselves out a bit. right as we were about to leave we saw a much brighter, larger plane, even from far away. right before this happened i remember out of the corner of my eye i saw tworeally pale pinkish white flashes in the speed of a fast camera. it didnt seem like a plane as it did more like a star. it seemed to come towards us and slowly get lower; then we realized it was in our general direction but somewhat more towards the downtown bay area. then it was in an angle where we could see three lights, bunched together closely, seeming like it was one large object (rather than several) with apparently a small red light on the top, (i didnt see it though, but apparently dakota did.) i tried taking a picture with my phone, hoping it might look good, but i knew it wouldnt, and didnt. by then we could tell the object was very large, and it started slowing down, almost humorously as i tried to take a picture. but as i tried again it started speeding up, and towards the direction we couldnt see because the highschools gym building was in the way. so i stopped trying to take a photo and we ran out towards the other side of the field to keep it in view, of course as this happened it slowly sped up more and more. to fast to be a jet, but slow enough to see its general shape. by then even as we ran out to keep seeing it, it went over the forest line (an area between us and the bay unless you take the town route) and then we couldnt see it anymore. as all of it was happening i wasnt at all afraid, only interested, and i had some adrenaline pumping when i realized it was definitely not, a plane. \r\nnow were going to buy a pizza, with nothing else to do, and go back up to the field hoping to see more. :)","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":23193,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.7653729,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05082010-0005","longitude":-122.4855249,"occurred":1273293900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1273308100000,"summary":"Cirular triangle, out in sehome football feild, small light, got bigger, then shape was visible, slowed down spead up, out of sight.","tags":["lights","photo"],"timeZone":"America/Vancouver","timeZoneName":"America/Vancouver","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Bellingham, Washington","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:129484"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Rogers","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A couple of days ago, i filled out a report of two high flying ufo's that nearly collided. i never thought i would be doing this again. i will never ever forget what i saw yesterday. it has haunted me with questions all day today. approx 6 pm yesterday 5/06/2010, i heard a massive airline leave our small airport. i looked up to see a air-bus with a tan front end and a wierd tail on it. this huge plane was coming out of our municiple airport which is only used for small aircraft. i turned toward my front door while looking up. and to the east approx 1500 ft above my home was a cigar shaped ufo floating by between 60 and 70 mph. it obviously was watching and following this air-bus. i thought camera and ran to the door but the door was locked accidently by my 10 year old grandaughter. i yelled and beat on the door and my wife and grandaughter came blasting out to see what was wrong. i pointed at the craft and said look no wings! no sound! ( you could still hear the sound of the air-bus though) i knew i did not have time to take a picture so i grabbed my rifle scope and tried to see it. if you have ever tried to do that, its near to impossible! my wife and grandaughter which did not believe in ufo's now had substantial proof. the ufo was approx 60ft to 70 ft long, 8 to 10 ft high and approx 15ft wide, moving at a speed of which any of our aircraft would fall out of the sky. it was metallic gray, glistened in the setting sun as it drifted upward keeping a level profile. from the side appearance, it looked like a disc because of the abrupt downward slope at each end of the craft. i watched as the air-bus made a slight left turn into the clouds and the ufo angled in that direction then vanished. but right before it vanished, i got a glimpse of the rear of the craft and it appeared to have an almost octagon shape ( a wide octagon with rounded points) this i cannot say for sure as it was a ways away. it seemed either to be half cloaked or the energy from it made it seem a bit hazy. the following is the records from the airport. it does not show a large airplane leaving our airport! we live in rogers arkansas which is a very small town and also the near home of walmart. i am positive that the ufo was with this airbus ( maybe aiding it up out of the small airport or ?. departures: rogers muni-carter field airport (rogers, ar) [krog] \r\nident type destination departure\r\ntime estimated\r\narrival time arrival\r\ntime \r\nn245cm lj45 chester county g o carlson (kmqs) fri 06:45am cdt fri 09:38am edt fri 09:41am edt \r\nn150tj be10 athens/ben epps (kahn) thu 06:49pm cdt thu 09:52pm edt thu 09:41pm edt \r\nn346k c172 lee's summit muni (klxt) thu 05:34pm cdt thu 06:05pm cdt thu 06:05pm cdt \r\nglt824 be9l springfield arpt (ksgf) thu 04:51pm cdt thu 05:17pm cdt thu 05:09pm cdt \r\nn602dc c421 dayton-wright brothers (kmgy) thu 03:13pm cdt thu 06:38pm edt thu 06:30pm edt \r\nn759vp c172 saline county rgnl (ksuz) thu 02:51pm cdt thu 08:18pm gmt thu 08:59pm gmt \r\nn475dh c525 dekalb-peachtree (kpdk) thu 02:14pm cdt thu 04:45pm edt thu 04:41pm edt \r\nn901ts be9l sullivan rgnl (kuuv) thu 01:26pm cdt thu 02:25pm cdt thu 02:08pm cdt \r\nn69670 c310 fort smith rgnl (kfsm) thu 12:58pm cdt thu 01:11pm cdt thu 01:27pm cdt \r\nejm214 cl30 chicago executive (kpwk) thu 12:36pm cdt thu 01:51pm cdt thu 01:45pm cdt \r\nn266ra rm06 hutchinson muni (khut) thu 10:28am cdt thu 11:09am cdt thu 10:50am cdt \r\ni am a very honest person, and all of this is true. my grandaughter even picked up a small pipe i had on the table and said \"this is what it looked like grandpa. i have attached a drawing of what we have seen and i feel this could be investigated because their are leads. the air-bus! please feel free to contact me.

something, as i was driving back i saw a silver disc high in the sky with the sun refelecting on it.  i kept my eyes on it as i slowly weaved down the road the 50 or 60 yards to our driveway and pulled in.  the disc was desending and getting closer and closer to me.  i jumped out of the car yelling repeatedly for my mother and father to get the camera.  mom heard me yelling and came running out of the house with flour dough covering her hands (she was making biscuts).  when she saw it she began shouting for dad to come out.  however, he was watching the news and didn't hear us.  by now the disc was silently hovering about 25 to 35 feet above us.  it had green and blue lights flashing on and off around a white center underneath it.  on the upper part it had circular windows.  after approximately three minutes it silently shot off in a southwesterly direction and disappeared in a matter of seconds.  we were shocked and in awe of what we had just witnessed.  of course we told dad immediately and just about everyone we knew.  then on that friday night dad who normally worked the day shift was filling in for a co-worker on the nightshift so mom and i were home alone.  it was the middle of the night and we were asleep in our beds when i was awakened by a brilliant blue white light that filled my bedroom.  it was as if my window had no curtains.  although i was frightened, i believe i could not move.  then the light began to shift and now it was shining through the front door.  my bedroom had two doors, one opened into the livingroom and the other into the hallway, both doors were open.  as soon as that light was off me i jumped out of bed and ran down the hall to mom and dad's bedroom.  their bedroom also has two doors, one opens to the hall and the other to the kitchen, both doors were open. mom was instantly awakened by me and the brilliant blue white light.  we were very frightened so i got dad's loaded rifle from under their bed.  we huddled together on the bed as we watched the shadows shift as the light now was slowly coming through the side windows.  from the livingroom then through the diningroom windows and then the kitchen.  with the gun cocked and pointed toward the backdoor, i said to mom that if someone comes through that door i was going to shoot them.  then the light went out and we were in the dark.  we were afraid to move for sometime, finally we got our nerves up to peak out the windows and didn't see or hear anything.  we called dad and told him and wondered if we should call the police but he said why bother since nothing had happened.  this episode lasted approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  mom and i know the light definitely had something to do with our ufo sighting.

daughter, my grandaughter. my daughter, husband and grandaughter had gone to bed.  my son-in-law (\"m\") and i were setting on the porch which was on second floor.  the porch faced an empty lot and in front of that was a small street.  on the other side of the street was a house with the back yard being the beach.  all at once a round light appeared.  it looked like about the size and color of a headlight of a car.  it looked like it was out over the beach about maybe about 100 yards.  i ask \"m\", what the heck is that.  we both just stared and kept saying what is that.  i stood up with hand on the railing and the light disappeared.  light stayed on maybe 30 seconds.  i leaned on the railing and about 3 to 5 seconds after the light went out i heard what sounded like a rumble of distant thunder to my left.  sounded like it was maybe a mile away.  of course we kept saying, what could of that been.  about 5 minutes later it appeared again in the same place.  this time we both stood up and kept saying, \"is this a ufo\".  i started getting nervous. it stayed on about the same length of time.  this time when it disappeared i heard the thunder sound to my right. couldn't see any shapes, just the one light.  michale wanted to go up on the beach house roof because it had one of those little places with benches up there but i got half way up and couldn't go farther because i'm afrain of heights. we came  back to our chairs and set down then in the same place. first one light came on then maybe 2 seconds later another light came on right beside the first one.  i think it was about 5 lights that came one at a time all beside each other.  i grabed his arm and he said, what should i do.  i screamed to go get somebody up.  i was really scared now.  he took off in the front door and the lights went off.  he brought my daughter out and of course she was groggy from being in a deep sleep.  the lights were out but she did hear the same thunder sound.   i am a 54 year old

my throat tightened and i couldn���t so i started actually getting scared i shut the door then sat on my bed and watched the light return and counted what i thought was maybe 2 or 3 \"beings\" in my

2010. we just left a main road in town; west jackson ave., to another, lesser road: western hills, as a short cut towards my parents'and my own home just off old sardis road.\r\n  we passed through a police roadblock that was checking drivers' licenses and driver sobriety a few minutes past 9:00pm. just shortly after leaving the checkpoint, on down the road out of sight of the roadblock, my oldest daughter, who was in the middle row seat in the back of the minivan, suddenly said in a breathy type voice:\"oh my god! it'ssssss ... a spaceship! mom! a spaceship!\"\r\n  my teenage son, who was riding shotgun, was looking up on his side of the car and started to squeal: \"it's huge! oh my god it's so big!\"\r\n  naturally, i am trying my best to look and see whatever it is that has got the kids so excited. all i saw was a flash of an orange light near the top of my windshield's passenger's side. i am all over the road trying to see this thing, my daughter in the back seat is starting to cry and getting a little hysterical. my son is twisting around in his seat so much to continue to see this thing, that i fleetingly wonder if he is going to give himself whiplash. he is also jumping up and down as much as the seatbelt will allow and also semi-hysterical. both are talking at the same time and i could not make out whole sentences. \r\n  at the same time i am trying to control the urge to keep looking for whatever it is in the sky, i am still traveling down a curvy road in the dark. so, i have to give up trying to see it and concentrate on where i am going. luckily, there is no traffic coming my direction.\r\n  we enter part of the road where the trees block any sightline the children have, and when we emerge from it, the object was gone.\r\n  when i get to the intersection of western hills and old sardis road, i pause to look back and see if we can catch any sight of the object. there is nothing. i try to rule out things by asking the children questions about the object. we are not far from oxford's airport, and i was almost positive the kids saw a plane banking to land at the airport. i realize that if it was a plane, i would have heard the sound since my window was still all the way down from going through the roadblock. the size of the object described and put in relation to a plane banking would have made it impossible to miss the sound of a plane's engines. \r\n  i ruled out hot air ballon, air plane, street lights, storm clouds, automobiles, ... you name it. also, note that in the amount of time from when my daughter saw the object first, to when i paused to look back where i had a good view of the tree line, was just a couple of minutes. any of those things i described except maybe a plane or automobile, would still be nearby, but there was nothing.\r\n  after a couple more minutes looking around for anything to pop up, i started the van towards my parent's house to pick up my youngest daughter who was not feeling well enough to attend the event with us that evening.\r\n  i have to admit, i was terribly creeped out by this event, but at the same time, incredibly jealous that the kids saw this thing and i didn't. we live in a very rural type neighborhood and the thought of driving home in the dark was a bit uncomfortable. this thought was echoed by my kids and another almost hysterical outburst was displayed by both. i explained to them i was sure that if they wanted us they had an excellent oppertunity to get us back there, and to not to worry about things they had no control over. this did not go over very well.....\r\n  upon reaching my parent's house, my son and daughter ran inside and was telling my folks all about what they saw and trying to describe it. i stopped them and told them to each get a piece of paper, go into different rooms, and draw what they saw. ( i have added pics of the children's drawings) i did not since i really didn't see anything but maybe a flash of orange light. it wasn't very bright, but enough you would notice. the roof of the van blocked my sight.\r\n  my parents were not very impressed, but somewhat supportive of at least the children's account of what was seen.\r\n  on the drive home from my folk's, i advised the children to keep quiet about the sighting to friends at school. i also tried to calm my son down since he seemed to be having a hard time getting over being scared. of course, all of us had our eyes glued to the sky all the way home. \r\n  my husband was already asleep when we got home so we had to wait until the next day to get his opinion and input about the incident. \r\n  my husband ought to have \"skeptic\" as his middle name, and was kinda dismissive until i remembered the drawings. he didn't know what to say after that.\r\n\r\n  i watched the papers and local news for weeks very closely for any mention of \"lights in the sky\". i wanted to call and ask if any police officers at the roadblock saw anything, but my father is a retired oxford police officer of 20+ years and i don't need that kind of grief.\r\n  i wrote to a couple of \"paranormal/ufo investigation groups, but did not get any answer. i came upon this site and now maybe, i can get some answers.","distance":"101-500 Feet,

new york city to bay street in montclair. we were walking up glen ridge ave to where we had parked the car on cloverhill pl.\r\n\r\nas we walked we noticed a very bright light in the sky to the south west. it was brighter, and larger than venus or any of the other bright planets would be, and looked very much like the headlight on a car hanging in the sky, or a landing light on a plane. i was looking at it wondering what it was when my wife commented \"what is that?\"  she never notices things in the sky, so that gives an indication on how odd it was.  i had been an amateur astronomer since i was a kid, so i can tell the various heavenly objects in the night sky quite easily. it was about three or four times the size of venus at its brightest. maybe about the size of a pea at arms length. \r\n\r\nall we could see of this object was a bright glaring light. it was not moving, made no sound, and had no other navigation lights. it was bright white in color, much whiter than the bright stars. i almost thought it was a comet, but it was too bright, and i hadn't heard of any comets that were due. it was at about 45���.\r\n\r\nthere were a few planes going by, as we live not far from ewr in newark. you could easily tell the planes, since they had red and green lights and the white strobe. this object stuck out like a sore thumb. it gave us the feeling that something unusual was happening, that's how out of place it was.  it made my wife uneasy.\r\n\r\nwe wanted to see if this object was truly stationary, so we stopped walking at the corner of glen ridge and cloverhill and stood still for about 30 seconds.  the object was totally motionless in the sky.  we could see a plane passing by farther away.\r\n\r\nwe turned the corner and walked to our car, and then proceeded up cloverhill in a ne direction and made a left turn on clairmont ave heading west.\r\n\r\nwhen we got to the intersection of clairmont and grove, we could see that the object was still there in the same location. i joked that maybe we were seeing a new supernova!\r\n\r\nthe object remained in view the whole way as we drove up clairmont, and as we turned left on upper mountain ave and then right on bloomfield ave.  our driveway is halfway up that block. the ride took approximately 6-8 minutes. we had the object in the view the whole time. it remained stationary in the sky.\r\n\r\ni went upstairs and grabbed my celestron skymaster 15x70 astronomical binoculars and headed back outside to get a better look at the object. i really didn't think it was a planet, but i would know for sure when i took a look. it was brighter than i had ever seen venus.\r\n\r\ni got out to the front of our house and looked up to where the object had been, it should have been in the trees across the street, and didn't see anything. so i walked east on bloomfield ave to upper mountain so i would have an unobstructed view of the sky.  \r\n\r\nat this point the object was nowhere to be seen.  it would have been very hard to miss, as it was the brightest object in the sky. i realized at that point that we were not looking at a planet or other astronomical object, since they don't just disappear, but we figured it wasn't anyway. something just didn't seem right about the object. i also had the feeling we were supposed to see it.\r\n\r\nas a side note, this is not my first encounter with such things, as i have a history of unusual occurrences going back to about age 5.  in my teens myself and six other boys had seen what looked like a landed disk about 25 feet in diameter in orange nj, by the empty american radium corp building, and witnessed several 3-4 foot tall humanoids covered in shaggy black hair with large glowing green eyes.  they left cloven foot prints in the snow.  this was about 1970. i'm in my easily 50's now, and odd things continue to this day.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

it's a strange feeling. granted i realize around the same span of days the unmanned shuttle was just launched into operation, so, who knows!?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":23172,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6687474,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05062010-0018","longitude":-81.5070435,"occurred":1271695500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,   Bullet,   Missile,   Cylinder,   Square,   Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1273213728000,"summary":"From sky to orbit, shining in sunrise rectangle/cylinder shape object","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23172_submitter_file1__Picture11.png","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23172_submitter_file2__Picture10.png","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/23172_submitter_file3__Picture12.png"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":17,"locationName":"Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:129504"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I found a small ufo sphere in \"the 10 best fighter jets\" (discovery channel) documentary film. the ufo flew near a u.S. air force f/a-22 raptor before ascending into the sky.\r\n\r\nthe ufo sphere can be seen at 2:32 minutes into the video (watch above the f/a-22 raptor's canopy):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=jra00qq3oho\r\n\r\nalfred r���sberg\r\n\r\nhttp://realtvufos.Blogspot.Com/\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23171,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0532081,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05062010-0017","longitude":-111.0919311,"occurred":1101801600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1273208138000,"summary":"Small ufo found in \"the 10 best fighter jets\" documentary film","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1983,"locationName":"Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:129505"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Dulce","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Mid 80's dulce, nm my self a law enforcemnt officer w/jicarilla apache police. background police science/forensic western nm univ., silver city. had gone to graveyard shift at midnight w/ another officer and diapatcher. immediately went to a single females home with the other shift and was informed that a small being was in her house at the foot of the bed with a box shining a laser like red light at her, the other officers knowing it was there shift change left without further investigation. making fun mind you. she was obviously shaken up and i did notice some electrical malfunctions within her home and her animals, dogs and horses were uneasy. throughout the night i continued to check on her, once in the early morning i was called to her home, her house was dark and as i entered i could hear her down the hall crying for help. i was informed again of visitors with a light in her home and it seemed strangly quiet. no one to be found in the home or area. in the early morning when the sun comes up when their is light i drove up to the home to make a check i noticed some movement in the brush and trees just west of her home about 15 yards away. i still don't understand what i may have saw, but soon after as i was stepping out of my unit three oval craft in a triangular pattern about the size of a three bedroom home lifted off from behind some juniper trees just 30 yards at the most taking off silently without noise/down drafts, then turn a bright white light and slow went in the direction east towards chama.Nm slowly gain altitude. my other officer and dispatcher was witness to this also. shortly after i heard on the state police frequency from chama about those ufo.S that were being called in to them. i felt completely helpless as a officer to help someone who asked for help and was unable to assist and protect her in her time of need. it still bothers me today. s/gj.

buenos aires province in argentina.\r\nit was approximately 10.15 p.M. when i took my dog for an usuall walk around the block. i noticed that a strong orange light was over the ocean horizon just a few feets to the left of my sight. it was winter time and it was very cold, there aren't too many people in the city on that season, it was on the 16th of may 2009, actually autumn in here, we say winter since there is very little activity after the summer season is over. suddenly i heard that a car was coming very slowly behind me on the street, and i feared i was going to be robbed, by that time i thought that the object was a ship with a strong light in it's cabin, when i turned to have a better view of the car, i saw inside of it a couple that was actually watching directly to the object, then i realized that that wasn't just a ship, and started to pay attention to the light wich started to move in zig zag towards us,and, when it reached the edge of the beach it made a fast fly, now towards my right sight side but very close to me, about half a block straight and another half block up. at that moment it was like blinking, and i could see some other colours like blue and red. i tried to see was was inside of that almost rectangular picture of about 20 by 30 feet, but it wasn't possible, i decided to turn on the corner and get even a better view, because i was right in front of the object, but i backed up a few steps, because i begun to fear, just a little, though i was fascinated with what i was watching. it wasn't until the(now i can call it u.F.O.) leaned towards it's right and down, that the object lighted up very intensibly and i saw the boomerang shape of it, and inmediately after, lots of bright light sparkles came up shinning all through, it was beautiful, it was like the best firework i ever saw and very fastly went up again to the left side of my sight but a little further up, like one and a half block high. i then looked at the couple in the car and wanted to have their opinion about all this, since the object was still up there, but the man, who was the driver, looked at me with a terrified face and very slowly left. since the unundentified object stayed up there right in front of the apartment building were i live, it took me a couple of minutes to decide to go back to it, wich i did, running with my dog to the side door, i stayed watching at the object, once in the lobby, but after 2 or 3 minutes it flew away at a very fast speed towards the sky and dissapeared.\r\never since, i have talked about it with many people who believed me and others who didn't, but about 25 percent of them told me that they saw a very similar object, most of them a little further than i did. i have the feeling that this is going to happen again, i got retired, and have been studying about u.F.O's ever since, it's going to be one year since that happen and am constantly watching for if it happens again, i am prepared now, at that moment i didn't use my cell's camera i guess i couldn't think straight because of the emotion.\r\nlike i said, i live right in front of the ocean were many people saw objects, if i could be of any help, though i don't live in the states, i'd like to become an u.F.O. hunter, i am ready for any hipnosis, lie detector or whatever source or element could be used to prove that i am not lying.\r\nsincerely\r\n*(wit's name and phone numbers deleted--sgonzalez/cms).\r\nthe argentinian code precedes those numbers, i am not sure exactly wich one is, please find out for me wich one would

remained stationary for a long period of time making no noise then they would alternate blinking out and re-positioning themselves this happened for over three hours.We both noticed a jet come into view leaving a  u-turn contrail, the jet was apparently investigating the lights. one year later my wife was outside my home which is a few blocks from the beach and she said.... hey look over there there is a half dozen or so blinking lights just sitting there, they appeared to be in the same vicinity as the lights i previously saw and acted in the same manner. last evening mat fifth 2010 my wife was closing the blinds for the evening and joking said come here look outside there is a ufo.I went to the window and said nah that's just a star she said do stars blink different ant colors i said sure they twinkle if there is some sort of atmospheric disturbance? we went out onto the front deck and there it was over the same part of the beach as we have previously saw, at first i thought it was saturn because of how bright it was but spinning and blinking \"bright blue-red over and over just sitting there stationary.We looked around and noticed there were five more two were side by side and the others in the two o'clock and four o'clock position all were glowing blue red you could see that with your naked eyes buy when you put up my nikon binoculars you could see them especially the one over the sea perfectly spinning glowing blue -red very bright!I drove over to the beach to get a good look at the spinning object to confirm that it was i had saw the previous year and it was the exact same thing just sitting there silently.I drove home which took about two minutes and looked again from my top deck and the one over the beach had moved over the island.Keep in mind now that over an hour had passed and the others were still just hovering in the sky. i am familiar with astronomy so i could watch the movement of the dipper and orian's belt the stars were in procession but these lights remained put. around 11:30 pm the object which had moved over the island rose up then moved left again and headed back to the beach area i could see it in the binoculars and the brilliant blue-red almost firecracker kind of lights, i saw it bank and was able to determine it was now not round and the lights were very bright. the objects remained in the sky until 2am then

thought was a plane at first) moving towards the left. by the time i said \"lisa\" look is that a plane (at this point-i was right in far left lane nearly completely stopped on 75-which is a very busy expressway!). when she looked up the object was about 20-25 feet above the hov lane. she said to me : \" no thats not a plane, omg. we started to scream, cuss everything above!!! this thing stayed in one place, had multiple lights bulbs underneath (at least 15-20) very bright. it looked like it was swaying back and forth.  now we also noticed that an actual plane which had already taken off from the airport (in the sky but miles away from this object), that only had about three lights and looked like a \"bird\".  at that point we quickly compared the two and the object we saw was not a plane. as i proceeded to move the car (because my sister in law said go go, they're are cars coming behing you). \r\n\r\nwe noticed that it tilted a little upwards as if it was about to fly off, this is when we noticed that color of it was gray or steel and that it had a round dome at the top of it. in a blink of an eye the damn thing flew away so quick, we said where in the world did it go?  it actually was going in the same direction the plane that we saw, which was closer to the airport.
