just west of downtown lawrence, when we noticed a really strange object up in the sky.  it was about the altitude that a helicopter would fly, but it wasn't a helicopter.  it was located north and west of where we were.  it was the middle of the day.  i guess we noticed it because it was there, up in front of us, easy to see.  \r\n\r\nit really mystified me because although it wasn't an airplane or a helicopter or a balloon, it also wasn't a disc, which is what i always thought, based on a past experience, a ufo would look like.  this thing was metallic but tall and sort of shapeless.  it was multi-faceted.  it didn't seem to be flying, but hovered where it was.  i don't know what shape to call it.  i guess it was closest to a cylinder, but it wasn't smooth.  it seemed multi faceted.  i didn't know what it was.  i still don't.  it was confusing.  we watched for as long as we could, given the traffic, and wondered out loud what the heck it was!    \r\n\r\nwe would have tried to watch longer and investigate it further, but i had to get home to nurse my baby. \r\n\r\nthe weird thing about the experience is that i somehow forgot about it until my friend mentioned it a couple of years later.  after she brought it up, it all came back to me.  i have always been very interested in ufos, so it was disturbing to me that my memory of this event would be so fleeting.  \r\n\r\nin thinking about where this thing was located, i kind of wonder if it wasn't checking out the coal fired power plant to the north of where we were.

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am a 47-year old computer consultant living in cheltenham, gloucestershire, in the united kingdom. i have been interested in the subject of ufos ever since i picked up a paperback by donald keyhoe which had been shelved in the science fiction section of a bookstore in the 1970���s! i have never reported a ufo sighting before, nor seen one, except for a possible uav sighting in fog over cheshire oaks retail park (a few miles from the british aerospace plant at warton) a few years ago.\r\n\r\nthe sighting i am reporting here is more unusual and seems to conform to the ���black triangle��� type of vehicle which is frequently reported in recent years, and may be of interest to people researching the subject.\r\n\r\nover recent nights (late april, early may 2010) at home i have noticed an orange light in the western sky after dark, corresponding to the common position of venus and visible when other stars are not (due to street lighting). i should explain that my home is in a high-rise residential block in a town which is almost all low-rise buildings, so i have unobstructed views to the west over the severn valley from the malvern hills to the forest of dean, and south over cheltenham town centre to the nearby cotswold escarpment. i assumed this object was either mars, or venus red-shifted due to the icelandic volcanic dust in the atmosphere. we have certainly enjoyed some very red sunsets recently.\r\n\r\nat approximately 1:20am bst (0:20 gmt) on the may bank holiday monday, 3 may 2010, i assumed i was looking at this same object from my kitchen window a few degrees above the horizon to the west when i thought i could perceive it to be a cluster of different coloured lights instead of a single source. i left my kitchen (which faces west) to retrieve a pair of small binoculars (15x21) and returned in time to see the object changing position or aspect. through the binoculars i had difficulty keeping the image still but could distinguish a red strobe light and fixed white lights, with an occasional blue light also visible (possibly strobing or flashing occasionally). the object now appeared to be moving closer and slightly to my left heading for the centre of cheltenham (which is just south of my location).\r\n\r\nas it moved it presented itself at an angle to me and i could see the red strobe light was centred on the underside of the object which now clearly had strong white lights at the front, throwing a beam or twin beams straight ahead, like landing lights or car headlights. conditions were clear for visibility but the white beams illuminated moisture in the air immediately in front of the object as it was quite a cold night. the ���wing��� tips on either side of the object appeared to have small fixed white lights like navigation lights, which occasionally also showed blue and i think red lights at the same locations. these lights appeared unusual to me as i would expect a single fixed green (starboard) and red (port) navigation light to be visible on a light aircraft or the police helicopter, both of which are familiar sights in this area. civil aircraft in the uk have a white strobe, so i thought this might be a military aircraft instead.\r\n\r\ni moved to another room to observe the object as it passed to the south side of my building over the centre of town and could clearly see the object was a large black triangle or delta shape. the height of the object was level with my apartment (sixth floor) and the top of the cotswolds (1000ft elevation), and about the normal operating height of the police helicopter or lower. the lights observable at this time were the two wing tips or rear corners of the triangle which showed small fixed white lights and possibly a red one on the nearside (port) wing. the red strobe was larger and definitely in the centre underside. the trailing edge appeared to be a straight edge and slim, like the old vulcan bomber and not like the b2 or f117.\r\n\r\ni opened the window at this point to see if any sound was being made by the object and could hear a low jet type of sound, receding as the object moved away over the cotswold escarpment to the south-east. the sound level was similar to a wide-body jet going over at high altitude and not what you would expect from a large object at low level and certainly not enough to wake anyone up at this time of night. the object disappeared over the cotswolds heading south east towards oxfordshire and i got the impression it had made a turn over cheltenham at about the time i switched rooms. i checked the time, which was 1:25am bst, so i estimate the duration of the sighting at approximately 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nthe only military traffic we usually get here are the odd fast jet making a run to the bomb ranges in wales and regular ch47 chinook helicopter flights training pilots for afghanistan. these are always in daytime and the chinooks tend to come from the north and turn west over cheltenham to ���box��� around staverton airport and head back north again. so this sighting was definitely an unusual vehicle.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

approximately 12 am onwards.  \r\n\r\nat approximately 4:25 am i heard a strange humming sound that i have not heard before.  i found it strange because i have heard these humming sounds before in different areas throughout the neighborhood for a while now.  \r\n\r\nat first i thought these sounds was from an air conditioning unit but i wondered why all of a sudden at 4:25 am.  at times it seemed to be farther away for several minutes but then return with the same volume as before.  \r\n\r\nat stayed in the room i was in throughout this incident until approximately 5:40 am, which is the time i left the building since the humming sounds seemed farther away again.   \r\n\r\nafter exiting the building and after approximately a three minute walk i happened to look up and i saw a disk shaped object that wobbled towards me and i saw a flash and it disappeared; it was 5:51 am mst when i saw this.  i then saw another object but at a much higher elevation.  i'm only assuming that it may have been the same object.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then

went out there, saw nothing at first after about 5 minutes multiple lights came on. usually they would come on in a row of some sort. this time they came on about 6 of them but staggered, but this time one of the orange lights was actually 3 smaller orange lights grouped into one (if that makes sense). they didn't come back on after that. so if you're in the area please looks the following nights between 9pm-10pm. last time they came back every night for i can't remember now but i think it was 8 or 9 nights in a row.
