a ufo \"non-believer\" and is not much of an internet user, so he hasn't had exposure to what may be posted by others. he called me on the morning of march 6 to talk about another issue, and near the end of the conversation said, \"oh, by the way, i saw the strangest thing last night while driving up my road.\" he came to a stop sign and happened to glance through the top part of his windshield just in time to see what he first thought was a shooting star. he then realized it was not a meteor and told me he still wasn't sure what it was. i asked him to describe it and when he said \"triangle shaped,\" it got my attention quickly. he said it was moving extremely fast, much faster than anything he had ever seen before, and covered the sky in 2 or 3 seconds. it made no sound and traveled in an arching motion like it was following the curve of the earth. he estimated that it was at least 10,000 feet up, maybe more. he also said it had to be quite large due to the altitude and relative size when compared to the stars. it was traveling from north to south towards tarentum/harmarville area. i asked him if he could sketch it and he said he could. he described the huge light on the bottom of the craft, and the outside edges were lit along the entire length, and several large lights in the back. the lights seemed blurry/hazy, and left sort of a streak, but he figured it was due to the extreme speed. i went to his house the following weekend and brought along several print-outs of triangle craft since he had never seen a photo of one before. he was amazed to see how close his drawing was to others. to this day, he said he still doesn't believe in ufos, but he is sure that what he saw was not any type of known airplane or military jet.\r\n\r\ni re-sketched the craft based on his drawing, which was on a torn out line piece of paper, so i figured it would scan clearer if i re-did it. the main difference to note on this craft is the lack of lights at each point. all of the lights were white and had no blinkers. i am hoping someone else out there has witnessed this type of craft, especially the extreme speed. he told me that if he didn't happen to glance up at just the right moment, he would have never seen it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

really make out a distinct shape. just a grayish mass moving about 40 mph. no lights or sound. the first thing that crossed my mind was a small aircraft but i quickly dismissed that idea since there was no sound or lights. even though the first impression was of a single object, i wondered if it might have been a tight flock of light colored birds although i couldn't see any individual birds but i was mostly just trying to think of something that might make more sense. the object appeared to be about a block away and was about three times as long as it was thick. if the estimate on distance

streets including csi, boca police and k-9 units.  the police set up a telescope.  i asked what the commotion was about, and onlookers pointed to the object... the glaringly white (blinking red, green and blue) object, moving erratically upways, and downways and east and west.  it was oval-shaped (length east/west direction).  i knew right away that it was a ufo.  i had always been somewhat of a believer, although i had never encountered a ufo.  my entire body shook and my eyes teared up the moment i saw the object.  i continued to shake and my eyes continued to tear for the next two hours.  it appeared about 20 times larger, if not more, than polaris (north star).  onlookers said it had been directly overhead where they laid on their backs on the grass to watch it until it shot north.  onlookers mentioned that it made triangular turns in its motions, it spun on it's axis.  on onlooker mentioned that his house beamed red from inside at around 11:00pm as if he was in the path of a red beamed light.  several others mentioned that it appeared to be beaming a light downward.  one of the onlookers was on the phone with his sister in orlando (a 3 to 3.5 hour drive away), and she was informing him of a sighting there.  they were describing the object's movements to one another verbatim.  they determined that they were looking at the same object.  two different onlookers at separate locations mentioned a \"red squiggly thing\" shooting out.  the police on the telescope mentioned to an onlooker that the object was dome-shaped on top, flat on the bottom with several circular lights on the underneath side.  we watched the object as it hung overhead very still while flashing different colors.  at the time, all of the stars that we could see were flashing the same colors as the object.  the stars weren't shining normally like they usually so when the light they gives off passes through the layers of the atmosphere.  it was a different type of shine--flashes of red, yellow and green.  there were planes and helicopters chasing it and it continued to move more west.  it finally dropped in the sky below the trees we were near, and we lost track of it.  we drove around for about one hour until 11:30ish and never caught sight of it again.  we drove to a parking lot where we could almost see the horizon, and we still could not see it.  when i returned home, my dog, who  had been in her crate, refused to come out (she's normally very cheerful and greets us with licks and jumps when we arrive home.)  she then started shaking and pawing like crazy at the door.  she appeared as if she couldn't get outside fast enough.  her actions showed us that she needed to go to the bathroom.  but that wasn't the case.  she ran outside and sniffed for several minutes.  the next morning, we saw the story on several different news stations.  they all stated that it was a kite with an led bike light.  there are no pictures of the kite with the bike light.  there is no way that a kite could have been maintained that high in the sky by a person, and the alleged bike light was much too bright to be a real led light.  i am officially a true believer.","distance":"501

for my boss as loud as i possibly can but i could bearly here myself. i watched it for a good 10 minuets or so . it made no noise at all. it had different coulerd lights around it that were very bright. the craft loked very smooth. i wathched it as it slowly moved in a northern direction and then it huverd over a place we call iron hill possibly a 1/4 mile from my house. it zoomed off into space at such a high rate of speed it was unbeilevable. i then screamed for my boss again and this time he came runnin.Of course it was out of sight by then. i then ran home and told my family what i had seen. my uncle was there also selling mason shoes to my father. all i could say was over and over was that i had just seen a ufo. my little sister said she was looking out her bedroom window and
