(back when i believed in god and all the nonsense that is organized religion).  i told them, - \" i want knowledge, i want as much knowledge as possible and the wisdom of how to use it, that's what i should want right? i want to be really, really smart, smarter than everyone else.  i want to know the meaning of life, that's what everyone says is the ultimate answer and question right? that's what my brother said yesterday.  and i want to be really strong too.\"  him - \" yeah, that's good, we can do that, but you've got to let us take you\"  me - \" what do you mean take me? you can't just kidnap me, i can't really trust you, you did just break into my house and may have killed my family\".  him - \"i told you, your family is fine, they're just asleep.\"  me - \"that's exactly what a killer would say\".  him - \" go check after we leave.\" me - \"ok\".  him - \"but here's your wish, gravity.  the answer to the meaning of life is gravity.  you don't understand gravity\".  me - \"what's gravity?\"  him - \" exactly\".  me- \"what the hell are you talking about?\"  him - \"you'll understand when you're older\"  me - \"how much older?\"  him - \"your late teens early twenties\" throughout the conversation i had begun moving closer and closer to him as we talked, at this point my eyes started adjusting to the darkness and i saw that he wasn't moving his mouth when he talked.  and then i got freaked out and yelled \"alright! that's just too much! what are you! tell me right now [cms/tg/pd]!\" and i got in my brother's karate stance. their eyes all began to glow yellow and looked like they were burning like bright yellow flames in their eye sockets.  i threw my hands down and said, \"i'm done with this, get out, take care\".  \r\n\r\nwent back into my room and closed the door.  i came back just as quickly as i had closed the door yelling while i was walking to the door \"next time you stop by ring the damn doorbell you bunch of...\" i had opened the door by this point and they were gone.  i turned on the light switch checked out the room, went downstairs and checked every room in the house (except the basement because it scared the [cms/tg/pd] out of me at the time), went back upstairs, woke up my brother who asked me what i wanted to which i replied \"just making sure you're alive like they promised\" my brother - \"like who promised?\"  \"the aliens\" i said as i left his room to go to my parents room.  i woke up my parents, they asked \"what's wrong?\" i said - \"there was somebody in the house i just wanted to check and see if you guys were o.K.\"  my mom freaked out and woke up my dad and said \"(my dad's name) get up! theirs somebody in the house.\" my dad flipped up really quick and said \"what\" my mom - \" (me) said their is someone in the house, get your gun\"  i said - \"it's cool, they left, i took care of it i think\" my dad was already up loading his gun and said \"where were they?\"  i said \"in the den\" \"downstairs?\" he said, me-\" nope, the one next to my room.  they're not in there anymore\"  dad - \"how many were there?\"  me - \"three, but they aren't people.\" dad- \"what?\"  me - \"i don't know\"  dad - \"did you have a nightmare?\" me...\"nope\".  \r\n\r\nmy dad went to go check it out and i stayed in their bedroom with my mom.  he came back and said nobody was there now.  they were both freaked out and asked if i was sure i didn't just have a dream, and i said i didn't know.  they both looked at each other and my dad said, \"yeah bud, you just had a dream, go back to sleep\".  \r\n\r\nthe next morning at breakfast i asked everyone all these questions like what an alien was, what's gravity, etc.  my parents gave partial answers and then asked why i wanted to know.  i told them my them about the night before.  my dad mocked me as though i was trying to lie to him.  i told him \"then how do i know what an alien is? how do i know the word gravity! i'm 7!! (i was pissed)\" and slammed both fists on the table as hard as i could and said \"if you don't want to believe me because you're scared then that's ok, but don't call me a liar, i know what i saw\".  my brother then asked my parents \"cooool, did (me) see aliens?\"  my dad - \"nooooooo, (in a weird tone that i later learned he only uses when he's lying to people or being an attention [cms/tg/pd].)\"  i told him, \"if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all\".  my dad threatened to hit me and my mom stepped in and said \"why don't we just stop talking about it.\"  i said - \"but isn't that amazing!  i'm gonna tell everyone! what did i see? what was it? do you guys know something i don't?\"  my mom said \" (me)...Don't tell anyone about it, even if you do believe it's true, they'll just think you're white trash, or crazy, you'll get the same reaction from everyone else that you got from us and worse, people will make fun of you and bully you\"  i said - \"mom, i'm the biggest kid in my grade, i do the bullying\".  my dad laughed, and i never talked about it to anyone ever again.  \r\n\r\nbelieve what you want, it happened.  i've checked my room, closets, neighboring rooms, every night since.  for the next 6 months while i would often times go to sleep on one bunk bed and wake up on the other with the bed i went to sleep on completely stripped of it's sheets. or wake up with my body turned around where my feet were the night before and not remember ever getting up.  ever since then i've had problems with sleeping, my memories date back to when i was 6 months old in a shopping cart, my iq was 160 when i applied to west point in my junior year of high school.  i've always been insanely strong for my body size, my veins are bright blue no matter how tan i get, animals of all types love me immediately and i can communicate via body language extremely well, and recently, i've begun working on a quantum physics paper that redefines all science and existence itself, a paper that presents undeniable evidence in both a unified theory of everything and describes in extreme detail what the unified force of nature is....

still dark with no cloud cover, getting ready for the sun to come up so we can start hunting for deer. we were facing north towards rattle snake butte from a low point along the grand river basin. we were chatting for a bit, all three of us were look at the butte while drinking coffee. no air traffic in the air as we could see the stars in the night brightly. \r\nall of a sudden something, we didnt see while we were sitting there, hovering over the buttes lit up very brightly illuminating the the whole area around the butte. i couldnt tell a distinct shape of the object, only that it was circular and starshaped as if the object was a lightbulb itself. it did not have any characteristics of a helicoptor or harrier jump jet as it seem the whole aircraft lit up. it lit up very quickly and sat there for a couple of minutes and then took off upward and away from our position at a speed not known to any aircraft that i know of. it went into space, out of our atmosphere, in a matter of milliseconds. it left a streak behind it as it went up into the sky and was gone as fast as we had seen it! the streak gave us an idea on which way it took off and was close to a 100-110 degree rise from our position. there was no noise from the object as it took off. we were about 1-2 miles away from the butte. any know aircraft made by humans would be loud and have a sound of air moving through the jet engine. this had no sound at all! \r\nthere was three of us...My self a 25 yr old bia/government employee, a older gentleman, a 47 yr old ex-army helicopter pilot and his son a 13 year old middle school student. we were in awe for about ten minutes before we realized what we saw! we gathered our thoughts and tried to think of what the hell that was! our concensus was that we thought it was a ufo and left it at that. we sat there waiting as the sun came up, waiting for something else to appear. nothing else appeared and we went about our business and did what we came there for.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

weird sounds over my house and then last night me and 4 of my friends saw about 7 ufo's flying around the sky at around 10 pm.I was sitting inside when one of my friends who had been outside ran in and told us that he had just seen a ufo and that it had shot some kind of pod off of it.When we came out and he pointed it out we could see one big light and a little light under, so we watched it for a few minutes and then the little pod go back into the bigger one,so then scanned the skys for a minutes and found four others that looked like the first one and they were all lined up.So after about 10 minutes of watching the ufos we could see some fighter jets flying over from the next town that has a military base(in klamath falls oregon) so they circled our town and they kept flying right towards the ufo's but still keeping a good distance but when one of the jets got withing 400 hundred feet of one them it started to blink really fast and when they jet got about 400 hundred feet it had a flash and the jet flew off.So we watched them for another half an hour and then on the other side of the valley we saw a light moving (same as the first one)across the sky and when it got to a darker part of the sky with no stars we started to see something blinking in that dark spot it was about 3 times faster then the jets and by the time it was about to leave we saw the jets take off after it. and then it was pretty quite for about 15 minutes and we were looking in one area of the sky and turned around to look at one of the ufo's and when we turned back to the area sky we were looking at first we saw weird shaped clouds that wernt there 10 seconds before and they stayed they for about 10 minutes not breaking shape or moving and then we had one finale sighting when we saw a longer shaped ufo flying by with 3 lights under it and it would stall and then shoot ahead a few hundred feet and stop until it was out of sight and then by the time we all went back inside the first

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"During my daily exercise walk, i spotted a mysterious cylindrical (cigar-shaped) ufo hovering low over a suburban section of richmond, virginia.  i noticed the craft during beautiful weather and clear skies at approximately 6:30 p.M. while walking east down riverside drive on the south bank of the james river.  i was casually scanning the scenery and wildlife along the river, gazing northeast toward the north bank of the river and greater richmond.\r\n\r\nthe cigar-shaped craft, perhaps the length of a football field, appeared to be a dull metallic fuselage with light and dark sections fore, aft, and amidships.  there was no writing on the craft or standard markings, no advertisements like you would expect on a blimp, and it did not appear to be a conventional blimp, derigible, or zeppelin of which i am familiar.  \r\n\r\ni did not see any fins, stabilizers, rudders, or conventioal propulsion systems.  it was not a balloon, plane, or helicopter. i did not hear any noise coming from the craft.  there were no lights of any kind (at first), no faa port/starboard (red & green) navigation (running) lights, no headlight and no tail light, even though most conventional aircraft would be required to have such lights turned on during dusk hours, especially while operating at extra-low altitude for safety reasons. \r\n\r\nthe cylindrical ufo was hovering low, at perhaps 1,500-2,000 feet, over what i believe was an affluent section of richmond.  i used a tall bell tower(spire) at richmond's dogwood dell carrilon (maymont park) as a point of reference.  from my location during the sighting, the tower is a few miles downriver on the northside of the james river, and the cigar-shaped ufo was hovering perhaps .25-.5 mile inland from the river maybe 1-3 miles west of the carrilon bell tower, perhaps over historic agecroft hall.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw the craft, i stopped in my tracks and scrutinized it for a couple of minutes, trying to determine whether it was an unusual blimp or cylindrical ufo of possible extraterrestrial origin.  having relatives at nasa, nsa, a late uncle who once was president of the vietnam helicopter pilot's association in washington, d.C., and having myself seen apollo 16 (saturn 5b) liftoff from cape canaveral, a u.S. air force atlas centaur rocket launch, and having been on naval ships and attended the largest airshow in the u.S. three times, this large cylindrical object hovering low near the james river caught my eye.\r\n\r\nafter watching the ufo hover silently for about one minute and not seeing any lights, a bright clear-white strobe light of intense magnitude suddenly flashed one time.  the duration was very brief, a couple of seconds.  then no lights for maybe 10-15 seconds.  then another intensely-bright strobe flashed for a couple of seconds except this time the color was red.  these were the only lights seen during my approximate 10-minute viewing.  the two strobe lights flashed from the underside of the ufo at amidships.\r\n\r\nmaybe a minute after the strobe lights flashed, the craft suddenly turned slowly on its axis at maybe a 45-degree angle of rotation and then remained motionless in its new position for the remainder of my viewing.  it was as though the occupants of the craft knew (perhaps telepathically) that people on the ground were observing and thus shifted the position of the ufo in order to say \"hi.\"\r\n\r\nat this point, i pulled out my cell-phone, activated camera mode, and centered the viewing screen on where i knew the ufo was, but i could not see the ufo on the camera screen because of the long distance, and my phone cam does not zoom, and having photojournalism training, i decided to not take a picture believing that the distance was too far for the camera's capabilities.  the ufo was a couple of miles away on the other side of a wide river during evening hours, etc.  too bad the ets didn't zoom in (across the river) and give me a better photo-op.\r\n\r\nat this point, i continued my walk east down riverside drive while keeping the ufo in view when it was not obstructed by foliage on the river bank.  a couple of minutes later, i came to a parking area on the banks of the river near the pony pasture river park.  i saw a solitary man (white or hispanic) in his 20s or 30s sitting indian-style on a large granite boulder in the river a few feet from the bank.  the man seemed to be gazing intently across the river, up into the air, in the directon of the cigar-shaped ufo.\r\n\r\ni figured the man was watching what i had been watching, and he was facing away from me and did not know that i was there, so i kept quiet and did not disturb his moment of mystification.  i watched the man eyeing the ufo and the cylindrical craft itself for perhaps one minute, and neither man nor mysterious machine moved a muscle or flinched an inch.  finally, i continued my walk toward home, leaving the man solid as the giant rock that he used as a stool in a pool.\r\n\r\nin addition, be advised that some dark unmarked black-hawk helicopters were flying around my area the same day and evening (4-30-10) which has happened during and after previous ufo sightings in my area.  there also was at least one military fighter plane that made a noisy pass at low altitude and high speed which is very unusual, so maybe the government was monitoring and/or chasing the ufo which seems to be par for the course in the united states and canada.\r\n\r\nlater that night, friday, april 30, 2010, i was prompted to visit mufon's website and was surprised to see a supporting ufo report from a man named jim in rustburg, virginia which lies 11 miles south of lynchburg and 111 miles southwest of richmond.  jim reported a cylindrical (cigar-shaped) ufo of identical description.\r\n\r\njim was much closer to the craft than me, however, and was able to see detail that was harder for me to discern because of the distance during my sighting.  jim's sighting occurred at 6:47 a.M. and my sighting was farther east at about 6:30 p.M.\r\n\r\nbetter still, jim was a professional witness and said in his mufon report, case # 23052, that he was an ex-army and navy career man with a naval-intelligence background and \"studied all types of conventional and unconventional aircraft.\"\r\n\r\n\"i'm in the army national guard and have seen uav aircraft in iraq, this was different,\" jim said.\r\n\r\n\"this object had no fins or wings visible of any type and no engines visible. it was simply a straight cigar or cylinder shape with some object below it or attached to it. it had no rotors or wings and made no noise. it moved slowly and straight. this was absolutely baffling,\" jim added.\r\n\r\nafter seeing jim's report and telling my friend, josh, who, with his wife, saw a green sphere/tear-drop ufo descend over south richmond (chesterfield county) in november 2009, i decided to file my own mufon report to perhaps lend more credence to the report from jim in rustburg, va.  \r\n\r\nfurthermore, other reputable witnesses, including scientists and government employees, have seen and reported cylindrical and disc-shaped ufos downriver from richmond near the surry nuclear-power plant and also near the north anna nuclear power plant on lake anna in central virginia.  \r\n\r\nmy wife and i, and tens of thousands of others, also saw numerous green-sphere ufos descend along the east coast in march 2009.  richmond's daily newspaper, the richmond times-disptatch, ran a cover story which mentioned the lights and accompanying sonic booms but did not investigate adequately and failed to connect this to simultaneous ufo reports aired on tv stations in tidewater virginia.  \r\n\r\nthere are numerous mufon reports on file about these sightings.  bottom line: more and more ufos and ets are being seen everyday and everywhere, and each individual must draw their own personal conclusions as to why.\r\n\r\nattached are two photos of cylindrical ufos that look similar to the ufo that i saw over richmond, va on friday, 4-30-2010.  the first photo synchronistically features a ufo that was farther east over the ocean off virginia beach, va on august 9, 2009.  the second photo was taken by members of c-seti (center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence) a little farther south off the coast of north carolina's outer banks in april 2009, one year earlier than mine and jim's sightings in central and southwestern virginia.  the c-seti members say they \"contacted\" the extraterrestrials aboard the cylindrical ufo.\r\n\r\nnote:  i cropped and enlarged the image of the cigar-shaped ufo over va beach which made the craft more visible but also resulted in pixel distortion around the object because of the extreme magnification, but this distortion is to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

Petersburg","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was driving home after completing a flight from jacksonville to saint petersburg. when i crossed over a bridge not far from home, i began noticing several lights through the trees to the north. they immediately drew my attention because they were above the street lights and were in places where there weren't buildings - the color of the lights made me think of some sort of light that might mark the edge of a building. i spent a few seconds trying to decide if my perspective of where buildings were located was somehow skewed, but realized that the apartment building i was about to pass was not that tall. switching my thinking to airborne objects, i ran down the possibilities of civil or military aircraft. i also considered somehow flares being dropped, but the location would have had them strung across the pinellas county peninsula - something i'm positive would not happen. i am a pilot and am aware of where traffic going into tampa international, st. petersburg-clearwater, and albert whitted should be, depending upon the winds. additionally, i had just flown through tampa's airspace and knew that commercial traffic was landing to the south at tampa and so nothing would be this far south of the airports. by the time those few seconds had gone by, i needed to make a left turn and so continued to watch the lights now more to my right, though still in visible through the windshield. at this point, i could see there were many lights in a fairly large array or formation but i did not take a conscious count of how many objects i could see. also, instead of stopping to take a good look, i chose to call my girlfriend to get a corroborating witness to this observation. unfortunately, i was unable to raise her and had to complete the remaining drive in order to get her attention and get her outside. by the time she was able to make it outside, only a single object remained visible, which she saw and described without my prompting as the color of flame, two diamond -shaped objects connected and under positive control moving right to left. she is also a pilot and discounted military traffic departing the nearby airbase under full military power since there was no noise to be heard (i had flown over the base 30 minutes previously and knew there was zero activity taking place at macdill). she also noted the objects were low - again, i had not at that point told her anything about what i had already seen.\r\n\r\nmy rough recollection of the configuration is two objects on the right - perhaps 15 degrees apart from my moving vantage point, three in a line at the top center of the array, and another three or four below them, but more spread out, and possibly one more to the left of the three aligned objects. the overall size of the display i would estimate at roughly the size of orion (tipped over on its side), though perhaps slightly larger. i am also an amateur astronomer and so am very familiar with the constellations, visible planets, and the general color and motion of meteors as they burn up in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nas i said, i never stopped to get a proper, stable view of the flight, and by the time i had pulled into my driveway and retrieved my girlfriend from the house, only a single object remained. during the drive home, i was unable to determine the relative motion of the objects.\r\n\r\nmy feelings throughout were excitement for having finally seen something i knew was not readily identifiable. furthermore, afterward, i was very annoyed for worrying more about getting a witness than getting a good look at the objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23079,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.7758256,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05022010-0002","longitude":-82.63439,"occurred":1272781500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1272787790000,"summary":"Formation

sat in my chair i noticed to my left a light that would shine my way. i thought it was my glasses reflecting light so i cleaned them and kept watching the wind and lighting. i got up from my chair and went to the steps and gazing up in the sky i looked to my left above some trees and saw what i thought to be an airplane. it had red lights blinking and a bright light that would shine on and off. then the light which looked like a spotlight aimed toward my way so i thought it must be a helicopter. my concern was the weather was really bad and it was lighting alot so i could not believe that an aircraft would be flying in the weather.It came closer and the craft's spotlight come on and zoomed the light at the back yard of my neighbors house below me. it lit up the whole yard so i called for my 2 boys to come see. my son chris who is 25 came running out but my 13 year was to scared. by the time chris got outside the spotlight turned off and all he could see was the red lights. then out of nowhere it fell straight to the ground. it was a bright red ball and it fell like falling out of the sky which it did. we stood there waiting to hear a crash or see fire but nothing. it never made a sound at any time. then a few minutes later it appeared in the sky again with its red lights flashing. i called my sister which lives close by to see if she could see it but she never did.While i was on the phone with her the spot light once again turned toward the direction of my house and i started telling her its here again. the lights are shining toward my house. this encounter lasted on and off for about 1 hour. then it disappeared.This craft never moved much it stayed in the same spot the whole time which i thought was strange. i know people will think i am crazy but i know what i saw. i was so frozen that i did'nt think to take pictures until my sister said go get your camera and get a video. i did get my camera but never could see it again. i am going back outside as soon as i

stopped above me, stopped rotating and opened a door on the side of it. closed the door, started to rotate and the went over the house. we ran to the front of the house and continued to watch it move off. after a min. or so of it moving away it sped up rapidly, moved higher in the sky and vanished. this all want on for quite a few mins. from start to it vanishing. we told my daughter and her

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"From a child really, it's weird and confuseing, sometimes i think i am a alien hybrid or something. this particular sighting/meeting was spurred from a event that occured in approx: 1995 or 1996, i was driveing from the east coast to california, in the arizona area within a 100 miles of the eastern state-line, on i-10. it was night, with a full-moon. i was not all that tired, as i had slept most of the day at a motel a couple hundred miles back east. of a sudden i had this over-whelming \"influence\" to stop on the side of the interstae in an area of the high-mesa's. i did. there was one particular mesa, that kept drawing my attention, lights began circleing it, somehow i was impressed with the idea that a mother ship was buried/hidden somehow within. although not tired, i feel into a deep, strange sleep, with many odd and strange looking creatures commuteing with me, as if in a deep sleep, yet seeing, yet awake. all these things i saw and heard (mother ship hidden within the mountain, and odd snake-like aliens communeing, yet not speaking sounds, i could understand \"most\" of what they were saying.)in this wide-awake, yet deep-sleep state. (though i never was asleep). now, this stuck in my mind, (whereas dreams fade rather quickly, this never did, but like i said i had prior experiences to this.), so, in about 2006 or so i believe it was (i came back from hawaii in 2003, lived in ocean side ca. a few years, went around the phoenix area looking for cheaper land-house deals, and once there, it all became \"over-whelming\" again.), i purchased tent, sleeping bag, camping supply stuff, and determined to trek out into the desert, and camp out awhile by the \"hidden in the mountain ages old mother-ship\", this turned into a several month camping trip for me. for a long time, nothing unusual. then, at last, one night as i was prepareing to sleep, that \"odd feeling\" overwhelmed me again, i looked out from my tent (it was summer, and both scorpions and snakes roam at night, scorpions are not very friendly, unless a coyote pack befriends you to keep them off as scorpions avoid their fur-oils, and snakes avoid humans if they can, so i mostly stayed in the tent except daylight hours). that odd-drawing feeling, 4 glowing, saucer shaped ufo's appeared, sometimes hovering, sometimes coming closer to me, sometimes farther away, after a bit, these odd snake-like aliens came around and communed, again, they remembered me from before, and before that, though they were'nt the exact same ones as beforetimes, they knew me from the others of their kind, that i had met before somehow, and they knew all that had transpired in past events i had with others of their kind. though they made hiss-like sounds i could not understand, i could understand most of what they said., this time they had what looked like wild-ferral hogs with them (common for the area), yet they also could speak with me, yet not with words, but i understood most of what they said., and the intelligence in the eyes of these was astounding, not like hog eyes, much more-so than human eyes., i followed them into the desert most of the night, they wanted to show me a thing, fiannly we came to several cows that had escaped a fence and were wandering free., of a sudden one of the glowing ufo's (which had remained behind over my camp in the desert area)came up so fast that it seemed to almost just \"appear\" (these ufo's made no sound my ears could detect, and i hear much better than most)and they moved fast. a yellowish orange blue glow came from it, one of the cows shook, mooed once, and fell over on its side. other aliens came up to it, the cow swelled up like it had been dead and bloated for days or weeks, they used strange devices, and light devices on it, somehow it was cut open in areas, i asked if they were going to eat the cow, they said they were recovering something that had been growing in the cow, that they had implanted there some-time back. (again i could'nt understand everything they commuted to me.) either i could'nt understand, or (i think) they would'nt tell me exactly what and why they were growing things in such ways in cows, diseases kept coming to mind though, strange, new diseases to affect most humans in odd new ways, but i suspect they tried (and mostly did) to keep the full matter from me.... like i said, that was one of many times since i was a small child, i have had encounters. i have seen much more horrible things from these aliens than killing and cutting up a cow.(though never directed at me.) i had the distinct impression that they were going to send me a bunch of gold, money, win the california lotto, or something of value, to purchase a large tract of land, so that they could come/go/live in relative peace there on,with me sorta \"owning the land\" and keeping them safe, unseen and secure. that has not occured yet, unless someone stole it when they brought it to me when i was asleep in the tent in the desert, or some other time, someone stole it. which would not be wise at all for human-kind. well, i'm tired of writing for now, theres much more, but i'm tired of writing for now. -jim","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":23072,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4566471,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05012010-0012","longitude":-112.0662773,"occurred":1137392400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1272714610000,"summary":"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1566,"locationName":"Phoenix, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:130671"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Hamilton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving with two other people in my car and we were coming home from the store. \r\nwe saw a enormous red sphere in front of and over our car. the height seemed to be about 500 to 800 feet above us. \r\ni stopped the car and looked out the window. then i got out of the car for a better look. \r\nwe were in awe at what we saw and transfixed on the spot. at first i thought it was the moon, then i thought maybe it was a hot air balloon or a weather balloon. then i just didn't know what i was looking at. it was close. it did not move.\r\nthe red sphere was stationary in the air, deep red and orange, mostly red and it seemed to have a pulse to it. there was no noise. the surface of it looked smooth but there appeared to be a red haze of slightly transparent red fog around it. it did not seem mechanical. we were on a very dark country road about two miles from home. it was a warm summer night. the sky was clear and i could see the stars far away. the date i wrote is approximate.\r\nthe sight caused a really terrifying fear in me and i drove home as fast as i could. i drove about half a mile and turned left and the object was gone. my two companions were terrified. when we got home, my friend at the house complained that we had been gone so long. the entire trip felt like it took 20 minutes total, but we had been gone for two hours. there is no way that trip to the store can take two hours. something happened.\r\ni never believed in ufos, and i am a super skeptic, but i don't know what we saw that night. i can't explain what happened. \r\nthere was nothing in the paper the following day. nothing was reported on the radio. there were no reports of weather balloons or anything strange.\r\nif i had to guess the size of the object, i would say it appeared to be about five times the size of a round city water tower top.","distance":"501 Feet -
