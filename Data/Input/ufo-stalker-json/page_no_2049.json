287-n when my wife remarked on a plane in the sky. i often see commercial airplanes when driving on this route in the evening, and i expected nothing unusual. when i looked in the sky, at about 5 minutes after 11:00pm, i saw (what appeared to me) to be a plane with 2 bright lights, that seemed to be flying relatively low or \"close\" compared to most of the planes i see flying in the sky. i looked for the tell-tale blinking red and blue lights on the wings that would indicate it as a normal commerical jetliner, but i did not see any. after about 20 seconds, the craft shifted it's orientation, and i realized it had 3 lights, not 2, and it had a faint triangular shape against the sky. at this point i still thought it was possibly a commercial airliner briefly, but i felt confused upon seeing the unusual shape, and size (or altitude) of the aircraft. it seemed either unusually close or unusually large for a craft to be flying overhead, and it moved relatively quickly (in about the span of 40 seconds) west towards the horizon, where it again was only visible from a \"side\" view, and only 2 lights were visible. it did not move erratically, but simply crossed over from one horizon to the other. at this point, i was taking the easton pa exit onto route-78, and as i was driving, i lost line-of-sight of the craft. before i lost line of sight with it, i did notice it was producing a 4th, very faint, blinking red light, that seemed to have a pattern of \"blink-blink-stop\" about one a second. this last quality of the craft leads me to believe it was probably man-made, although i have no idea what it was. suggestions by others that it was a \"b-2 stealth bomber\" or similar military craft seem plausible, but on the other hand, a b-2 bomber would have to be flying awfully low for the lights appear that \"large\" from our viewpoint, and i have no idea if such military craft have lights arranged on their bottoms in that manner. i still feel i saw something very unusual and i cannot really say for sure what it was i saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

encounter in malibu, where a strangely lit object flew over his car while he was driving north along the 101 fwy. \r\n\r\na unique element to the story is that the witness states that his sightings always occur either on the hour, or the half hour. nothing in between. he believes the intelligence behind these craft are letting him know that they have their eyes on him, for purposes unknown. he does not know if they mean him good or harm, so he finds himself both excited, and frightened at the same time. as he related the story to me, he became agitated about it. you could tell he was re-living the event. his speech became choppy and he started to stammer a bit as he became excited. he was glad to have me as someone he could trust and relate his story to. \r\n\r\nbeyond these sightings, i know this person to be a very solid individual. he is not prone to telling stories or day dreaming. for the most part, he is a very serious individual.

slightly north of venice, florida, for some skywatching.  ufo's are often reported in this southwest part of the state. the night\r\nwas clear, and for the first hour we saw nothing moving through the sky except planes and helicopters, both flashing lights and making plenty of motor noise.  about 8:31 we noticed a small cluster of lights moving together toward us from over the gulf -- completely silent with no lights flashing. as they they moved closer to the beach, a bright beam of light suddenly shot down from the group of moving lights, scanning a small area of shallow water offshore for only about 10 to 15 seconds. the cluster then passed over the beach about a quarter mile south of where we were, disappearing inland toward the east.\r\n  luckily i captured two photos, thinking that when i processed them in photoshop i'd see the lights connected to some outline of a plane or helicopter. the mysterious five lights are very small in the original raw\r\nimages, so i had to enlarge and crop the images quite a bit, lightening them overall and increasing the contrast to reveal stars against the dark sky.  although the lights are pixilated in these enlargements, it appears that they are not attached to a solid body of any kind (unless it is invisible.) between the five lights, there are stars shining from behind and through the areas where we might expect to see some indication of a fuselage or other structure supporting the lights.  what are your thoughts?  naturally, we are quite curious but not surprised, since all\r\nof have seen ufos before. (enlarge to 200% to see a bit more detail.)\r\n  in the data file of my camera, the attached file #1 was taken at 20:32:27, and file #2 was taken at 20:32:49. you can see in these two images that the lights moved in relation to background stars. for file #3,\r\ni exaggerated the contrast dramatically, still looking for some kind of\r\noutline of a solid body or structure to which the lights were attached --\r\nnothing seen.\r\n  if you would like to look at the original raw images, i can send them so you can see that no object in the photos was added, deleted, moved or altered in any way.  \r\n  my three friends can attest to witnessing this event.\r\n \r\nsincerely,\r\n \r\npete carmichael\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

reactive armor modifications on the armored amphibious landing vehicle.  i was working the second shift starting at midnight and lasting for 12 hours.  after working the first portion of my shift i went on break approximately 2-3 hours after my shift began.  because of the amphibious nature of the landing attack vehicles, the facility where the vehicles were kept was an inlet to the ocean.  i walked outside toward the water and found a quite place to eat a snickers candy bar and drink a mountain dew soda.  the night was clear and there was no light around except for the light from the moon.  as i relaxed and enjoyed my break i noticed what i thought was something moving under the surface of the water in the bay.  as it approached closer i noticed that it was not one object but three triangular shaped objects, i further realized as it approached that what i was seeing was not something in the water, but rather the reflection of something above moving by.  i stood up and looked up to see three completely smooth black triangles flying in a triangular formation.  the objects moved slowly at no more than 500 ft. altitude, making no sound, and emitting no light or any evidence of a propulsion system, and i could not tell the thickness of the objects as they were almost directly above me.  the craft were approximately 50 to 75 feet from tip to tip, shaped as equilateral triangles.  the only reason i was able to see the objects is because they passed under the moon revealing the shape.  as they continued passing by i was unable to keep a visual on the objects after they passed under the moon.  i remember feeling astonished and a bit confused because i had never seen anything like it before.  i told no one about the sighting until years later, as i was afraid of being ridiculed, and assumed no one would believe me anyway.","distance":"101-500

had just got home from my cousins place with my mrs and decided to take my dog for a walk, we got about 20 metre up the street when i heard some weird bird noises from one of the nearby trees (i think they where bats ) we continued on down the path, then i heard a lady yelling some profanities and heard a car schreec off down the road i was thinking to myself \"must be a full moon\" as we walked into the local highschool football oval where i always walk  my dog i instantly noticed wha i thought was a bright orange star in the south east direction ( i was standing at cranbourne high secondary college in cranbourne victoria, 45 min from melbourne) i looked at it for a little while then thought \"huh? is that a chopper or just a bright star? i turned my head to see if i could hear any noises, no obvious sounds, so i thought \"must just be a star\" as my dog was having a sniff i noticed a guy taking out some trash or some bottles or something from the high schools theatre, i think they had a show on. i watched my dog for a little while, then about 3 minutes later after witnessing the object i looked up and noticed it was much closer, it had moved about 25c in the night sky and was headed my way, i was looking sth east and it was headed nth west, i watched it intensely trying to figure out if it was a plane or what, i listened and noticed again there was no obvious noise, i could see flashing lights on it similar to what a plane or chopper has and again i thought \"uh, must be a plan, but as this thing got closer i noticed it didnt have the shape of a common aircraft, it was almost silent but then i notice there was a faint jet noise trailing the object, however the noise was nothing like a commercial jet plane or anywhere near as loud.\r\n\r\nthe thing kept cruising along and must have been about 5 - 8 kilometres away and if i where to describe its size would say it was twice the size of a commercial airplane. so as i stared at it i noticed the lights first off, they where a deep red and orange, first the red would glow in an odd kind of pattern and then the orange would go off around the sides, the red lights seemed to be coming from underneath the craft and the orange from either on top or around the sides, if i where to count the lights i would say there was about a dozen small red lights on the underneath and i have no idea how many orange ones, the craft seemed to be a kind of odd diamond shape, but had 3d qualities to it, speed would have been about 150 - 300 km per hour.\r\n\r\ni felt very exited the whole time. i lost sight of the object because i thought about running home which was only about a hundred metres away to grab my girlfriend but realized that by the time i get there it would be gone, as this went through my head the

traveling west to east soon after dark. unsure exact time. grabbed my 120x90 astro binocs and purple astro laser pointer and proceeded outside. upon focusing of nocs i could discern no detail other than a white sphere. it was about the size venus usually looks maybe a bit bigger. it was high up, traveling quickly, but not faster than regular commercial aircraft. one difference, this craft displayed no blinking lights. at this time i noticed another craft of same type on intercept course from the southwest. no sound. lit second craft up with purple laser for a quick sec. believe craft to be in orbit at this time. both craft disappeared over treeline in the northeast never changing speed or color. about 2 minutes later a 747 appeared traveling east to west above me. saw it up close and personal with my nocs, had to be 30,000 feet or more. this confirmed in my mind these craft were in orbit. possible military space stations/craft carriers? see this type of stuff all the time.

school lunch for his field trip the next day..I went over to the living room window to close the blinds when i looked up into the sky and noticed how clear the night sky was, so i went out the back door to look up at the stars, because as of late me and my boys have been noticing and filming lots of moving stars..We understand some of them might be satalites and space junk, but most of them are zig zagging and tranversing the sky from east to west from north to south and back again, within a 20 minute time span we counted nine unusual star like objects on 4/7/10 at about 8:30pm, and as i was standing there waiting to see more, two balls of light came over the townhome that we live in, and shot across the sky and disappeared over the tree tops...On this night (4/29/10) as i\r\nlooked up i noticed, comming from the s.W, a bright star like object, but this one was different, it was lower in the sky, and moved really slow, i was upset that i did't bring out my camcorder to film what i was seeing, all i could do was call out to my 14yr old son aaron, who came outside and we stood there in awe, not knowing what we were looking at...As it came over us my son said \"dad, it's a triangle\" with a red light in front\" sure enough we both could make out a silhouette of a triangle, but with only one star like light in the middle, and a small red light at the front end of the thing...We both called out for my other boys, christopher 15yrs, derek 10yrs and nicholas 7yrs old, they all came outside and saw what we were looking at, eventually it went out of sight over the tree line heading n.E, we were all pretty excited at what we saw..I myself have seen these low flying star like objects in the past, they silently transverse the night sky over greeley, fort collins, and now here in loveland colorado\r\nhopefully one day i can figure out what they are.....","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23039,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5352827,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04302010-0004","longitude":-105.0960448,"occurred":1272599400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,
