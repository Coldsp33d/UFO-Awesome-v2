was very interesting sighting and it has prompted me to share this sighting with you that i had in april 2002.\r\n \r\nthe sighting i had involved 2 round disc shaped objects in surrey bc. my location was the scott road skytrain station in surrey bc. i was waiting for a bus at the time. at around 10:00 am i observed 2 disc like objects hovering over a field east of my location. i was about 500 feet away separated by a busy roadway. a few seconds later they descended to the ground for about 10-15 seconds. they again appeared in my sight.  then dropped again for 10-15 seconds. this happened about 3 times that i observed in total.\r\n\r\nduring this total 5 minute sighting i observed 3 to 4 black crows go after the objects.  the crows immediately retreated to the nearby tree were they remained. it appeared crows may have been repelled somehow!\r\n \r\nthe objects hovered for a few more seconds. after that, one object headed east and the other object headed south. they traveled at a slow pace. i watched them until they went out of my sight. at that point i believe i saw something that may not be of our earth. \r\n \r\non my return one week later, i attempted to enter the property area were the objects dropped for those 10-15 seconds. unfortunately it was heavily fenced and i was not able to visit the location.\r\n \r\ni am wondering if anyone may have contacted you regarding a sighting in this area ever. i noticed in the area a home depot resides and a number of houses.\r\n \r\ni look forward to hearing from you. best regards,\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

stars were not ‘right’. \r\ni proceeded to turn off the patio light and walk to the backyard grass and began to look at the stars. i told my brother the patterns just did not look right to me. there were too many bright stars. perhaps a few minutes later, one of the ‘stars’ began to move toward the north. before we lost visual sight of this moving ‘star’, and additional brightly lit object began moving in the same direction as other. it was moving as if it could have been the ‘wingman’ to the first object. the two white objects dimmed and vanished into the night. \r\nbefore i was able to finally stop observing the spectacle in the night sky, approximately nine to ten of these objects were observed by me and my brother. the objects were not limited to any area or direction. at one point there were three of these ‘stars’ that all began to move at once in the southwest sky, in the region over our garage. the objects all went in different directions.\r\nnever before in all of my nights of stargazing have i seen this many unknown objects begin moving in so many directions. it was the most unusual. i would dismiss these objects off simply as satellites, however, most if not all of the objects observed started out in appearance as a normal star in the night sky. it was then the movement of the object that was observed. of the objects observed, about half started out as bright as the brightest stars in the sky. they went from sitting stationary to a slow movement in a given direction. there were a few objects that took off at a much quicker rate of speed. in some instances, the sense of moment was perceived which caused my attention to be drawn to the object. i was under the impression that the object would begin to move in one direction, the slowly drift in another direction, and then simply seem to choose a direction, and proceed to go until it faded into the sky.\r\ni am tending to believe the objects which were observed were likely drones. no engine sound was heard. all of them appeared white in the sky. one of the objects observed came almost overhead. as i stated it started out bright and appeared to be of decent size (close to aspirin size at its brightest). the only way i can best describe this object is that it appeared to be illuminated, with such appearance of a star. as it moved across the sky to almost overhead, that illumination ceased, yet the object was still observable. i made the comment to my brother that it appeared that the object began reflecting the light from the ground and that was what was making it visible for a short time. it eventually vanished after a few seconds. i went into the house at approximately 0430 hours. \r\nduring the time spent observing these objects, approximately five airlines flew by in their normal flight paths. in the midst of these observations, a low flying helicopter went from south to the mountains in the north. the helicopter sounded like a military type and was emitting a very bright red flashing light. i would estimate its altitude at roughly two thousand feet. (i have flown in helicopters before) it was traveling at a relatively fast rate of speed.

me to instinctively turn my head. it looked too bright and the color immediately had me concerned that either it was something on fire or something being shot toward us. i go outside to see absolutely no trail or fall out. i could see the usual planes flying in other areas of the sky which had the regular flashing blue red lights, but they were a lot smaller than this bright light. it was coming from out in the ocean area and would disappear behind some trees that obstructed my view but it was pretty high in the sky flying what looked like toward santa barbara. suddenly the lights turned off. no smoke trail or anything falling. i texted my friend to see if they saw anything  in that general direction.  as i'm searching for any sign of the ufo i see another light speeding  from the same area toward the same direction. changed direction suddenly a few times then eventually suddenly turn off its lights. i called my father over to witness this as well and we continued to see them come from the same area and burn out around the same spot before getting too close to santa barbara. my dad called his friend who told me to report it here and my dad decided to try going on the roof to see if we could get a better view since it wasn't showing up well on video. for the first time two were seen bright at the same time, one and then another shortly after in the same flight pattern. while my dad was on the roof i saw  what looked like stars cross over some other stars and my eyes fixated above him to see a boomerang shape with three circular lights (what looked like maybe a drone) greenish yellow lights fly way lower than the ufo and planes. i was able to direct my dad to catch the end of it, but he lost sight of it and couldn't locate it after it went out of my field of view. i went on the roof after him and saw several more from the same area. after\r\nsometime we decide\r\nto go inside since i was being eaten up by mosquiots. i also saw a shooting star after the

crossing over a bridge on the pedestrian sidewalk next to traffic.  i felt compelled to look up into the sky and saw the orb.  at first, i thought the object might have been venus but it was far too large and glowing.  i did not see it move in any direction.  this was not my first ufo sighting, so i did not feel compelled to stand there and observe too closely.  i also saw it following a lot of synchronicities.  i also do not typically carry electronics on my person.  i took my eyes off it because i was walking along a bridge with heavy traffic and was more concerned about my physical safety in my present location.  nearing the bottom of the bridge, i encountered some shrubbery that obscured my line of sight.  when i looked up again, the glowing orb had completely disappeared from the night sky.  i felt that i wasn't alone and was just curious which extraterrestrial visitor it was because i had seen other ufos before.  i wanted to know if this was the same group extraterrestrials or individual.  nearing home along some green space, i saw a great blue heron take flight.  i have seen a lot of great blue herons lately with the synchronicities.  i felt very calm and peaceful.   when i arrived home, i received a phone call from my brother and i told him about the sighting.  he said it may have been a helicopter, but i said that it was far too bright and far too high in the sky to have been one.  this is my first ufo report to mufon after having attended the ace 2017 conference in toronto.  i do not have any digital evidence of what i saw, unfortunately.  if i were to sketch the object, it would just be a ball of fuzzy light above the cityscape at night. it was extremely bright, though, like white fire, not just fuzzy.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":84657,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.336206952696685,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-06272017-0028","longitude":-75.66354834170309,"occurred":1468965600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1498594477000,"summary":"It

soon, above me in the black cloudless sky, and very close, came two lights that had no sound and slowly moved as if they were connected to a structure between them.  no structure was seen between the two lights which were approx. 1 ft. in diameter each.   the two dark turquoise lights were one above the other and approx. 40 ft. apart.  i repeat, the floating/flying craft had no sound and very close, approx. 700 feet away.  the lights were pulsating dark turquoise and also small red ones appeared right next to them as the floating craft moved away.  the pulsating lights were very rapid, uneven and unearthly! the object floated to the south and then descended behind a hill where there is a main street intersection (el toro road and normandale dr.), with homes all around.  what struck me was the silence and the pulsating, unearthly colors of the lights that were one above the other.  the duration of the entire sighting was approx. 5 min.  the next late afternoon, i went on an errand and on normandale dr., i noticed that a large street light pole was being replaced with another new one right next to it, installed by local authorities or cal trans.  the location of it is very close to where i saw the craft/lights descend on that sunday night.  could the flying craft affect the light pole?  i have a picture of the two light poles (installed very close together) shot that afternoon. what is also odd, is that the old one has a long metal tube on the top of it, approx. 6 ft. long.  end  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

way, comets, and meteor showers.  i've gotten great quality pictures of these in the past.  it takes a lot of practice to get the proper exposure, aperture, and iso settings correct to produce a clear and good quality image of the night sky.  after several years of practice, i'm getting proficient.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw two nights ago, and what i inadvertently photographed was not a star, meteor, airplane, helicopter, or a comet. at around 2:15 a.M. eastern time,  i was taking 20 second exposure pics (using a tripod obviously).  while the exposure was being done, i had 20 seconds to scan the sky for anything interesting for my next shot.  well, during one exposure i caught someone out of the corner of my eye.  they were two lights that resembled brighter stars but weren't \"twinkling' like stars do.  these two lights were a few degrees apart, one above the other and were white colored and stationary.  my attention was drawn to them because instinctually i knew they didn't belong there.....After all i had just aimed my camera in that exact direction and they weren't there 30 seconds before.  suddenly both lights became brighter and brighter to the point where they were easily the brightest objects in the night sky.  a few seconds later, they dimmed slowly to the point where after a few seconds....They were invisible.  the whole incident lasted around 10 seconds.  shocked and extremely interested, i zoomed my wide angle lens in as far as it would go.....Which isn't much (24mm) and i attempted to take a couple more pics.  \r\n\r\nmy first thoughts were \"holy sh*t, i just saw my first true ufo\".  i've always had interest in ufo's and my personal opinion is that through simple mathematical reasoning, there must be not only life on other planets, but copious amounts of intelligent life all over the universe.  life that has technology far more advanced than we could even imagine.\r\n\r\nanyway, still reeling from the experience, i proceeded to take many more shots of the sky then went home.  as i was driving home, i was hoping to myself that i got a picture of these two stationary lights.  after all, the wide angle lens was pointed in the general direction of the strange lights.\r\n\r\nnothing could prepare me for what i saw when i uploaded my pictures to my imac......I got you!  not only did i get a great shot of the lights, but my camera picked up what my eyes didn't (because i was looking away during the exposure).  my camera caught movement!  the entire time i saw these two lights, they were stationary, but the camera caught them \"arriving\".  the photo speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nall i have to say is, what the hell is it?  and is it one craft with two lights or two crafts each lit up?\r\n\r\n~ralph
