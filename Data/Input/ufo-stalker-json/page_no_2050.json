the thing i am talking about is where at a childs party or at a carnival there are those inflatable castle looking things, kids take there shoes off and jump around in? that is what i first thought it was. then i realized it was not a what it seemed. i guess i thought that because what else could be flying through the air?  \r\n     i have drawn several sketches. this is interesting also. afterwards, within 10 minutes i witnessed an orb type thing moving through the sky. i watched it for about 40 seconds as it flew ne to sw. about 10 minutes later, another appeared. i took 5 photos, which would look like points of light in the sky, thats all. i saw three round, orb type things in total after the initial sighting of the flying upsidedown \"w\" thing. all looked similar, high up, silent, either whitish gray or silver. the one definitely had a pattern of bright white light at a point then fade to almost nothing and repeat over and over. one was moving very quickly north to south, at what appeared to be cloud height. the camera i used was just a disposable that i bought at the 99 cent store, so they are not digital photos. it will be interesting to at least see if the point of light would show up. i feel very sure this(the orbs of light) was not an airplane because i was comparing it to other objects in the sky, which i could point out as definitely being a bird or a plane. these were not that. anyway...I am baffled but i did see or experience something large red squarish with wings hanging down(?) silently hovering 200ft off the ground. and 3 \"orbs\" within the next 30 minutes. if the photos show anything really cool i will share them. peace!!!!

north-east towards the berkshires in the north-east, all the way to the south-west, inclusive of mohonk mountain preserve, where the lights of the mohonk mountain house are clearly visible most nights, with parts of tivoli, annandale-on-hudson, kingston, rhinecliff, rhinebeck, and saugerties clearly visible by day and night. so in principle much of what i describe could have been observed

stewart int'l airport, 30 miles to the south behind mohonk. i can also observe aircraft ascending from descending towards albany intl. airport, have on occasion observed air traffic associated with regional airports in kingston, rhinebeck and red hook. at higher altitude there are regular flights (but especially between 5-8:00am, and 4-9:00pm) headed north and south, presumably to and from saratoga, plattsburg, montreal, and the ny metropolitan airports. those lanes follow the hudson river closely. still higher-altitude lanes from points further south are superimposed on the same lanes that serve stewart int'l. there are high-altitude lanes, and regular flights to be observed around dusk, headed west from massachussetts, and east towards massachussetts. smaller craft bound for the regional airports here and beyond tend to fly on the intermediate points of the compass. and then there are the anomalous craft -- those also fly from every which direction, usually at intermediate altitude and between dusk and dawn. my point is, i observe aircraft frequently, and have done so (with increasing interest) for 12 years from this location. on 9/11 i stood outside and listened perplexedly to a full-throttle jetliner race south over the hudson river, 10 miles to the east, invisible behind morning fog. i can hear amtrack on the dutchess county side of the river, and freight trains daily through saugerties and kingston, etc. in other words know what \"loud\", \"moderate\" and \"silent\" aircraft and automotive engines sound like. anything out of the ordinary is sure to capture my attention here where distant sounds and sights are easily perceived, weather permitting.\r\n\r\nin brief, tonight was a full moon so in addition to what seemed an exceptionally busy time for air traffic around 9:00 pm to 10:30 pm, it wasthe first time i could actually see the outlines of some of the craft i observed with 7x,50 field glasses. i am accustomed to two sorts of (slightly anomalous) craft, visible almost daily: hovering lights around rush hour (presumably helicopters monitoring the ny state thruway traffic), and large silent craft (sometimes visible by day, often with bright headlights which obscure their shape until they approach close by)--which large craft often turn out to be helicopters, of the sleek turbine-propelled variety. these make almost no sound, if any, except for occcasional slight jet engine noise. i observed at least one of these this evening. additionally, due to the moonlight conditions, i can confirm sighting of two triangular-shaped craft. the first of these, visible around 9:30 pm, shone bright headlights in front, two white flashing lights from behind, one or more flashing red lights at wingtip, and no less than four large (and i mean large, maybe 4' in diameter), round, non-flashing lights visible underneath, two white, one red and one green. this lighting arrangement i have seen perhaps a dozen times before, but due to the darkness could not verify the shape of the craft until this evening. the craft in question flew out of the northwest above overlook mountain and headed southeast towards kingston. no less than seven other aircraft were visible in the air at the time, at various  distances and altitudes, and at least two of them -- bright yellowish spots of light, similar in appearance to the \"helicopters\" i regularly observe above the thruway, except this time one was approximately above woodstock town, the other approximately above the intersection of 212 and county rte. 30 -- turned and headed in the  same direction as the triangular craft when it appeared. the triangular craft was flying at approximately 2500-3000 feet, or 1500-2000 feet above my location, at 200mph+. (in other words, noticeably faster than a cessna 172, with which i am familiar as a passenger as well as ground observer). \r\n\r\nat about this time (9:30) i observed flying west to east towards kingston what loooked to be a triangular craft, flying at 250mph+, marked only by flashing red lights as well as non-flashing red underlighting. i could not be sure of the details as it was several miles to the south.\r\n\r\nlater, around midnight, i saw a brilliang yellow light approaching slowly northward from the direction of stewart int'l. i observed the light until its proximity caused it to fade, at which point i could see only a dim outline, two red flashing lights (similar to the craft just mentioned), with dim red lighting visible underneath the craft. as it continued northward, it passed slightly to the east of my location, perhaps 2000-3000 feet above (eg 5000' total, or less), and approximately 1/2 - 1 mile to the east. so it was clearly visible through binoculars, and in the moonlight, as a flat, dark gray or black triangular craft. it appeared to pick up speed as it passed by, accelerating to 250mph approximately, making no sound whatsoever. with the exception of the first triangular craft, which made a slight jet-turbine sound as it passed overhead, none of the craft thus far mentioned made any audible sound -- all the more notable for the fact that while i was observing first-mentioned craft at 9:30pm there was other, more easily identifiable traffic in the air including one or two single-engine prop planes, which were audible at a similar or greater distance, even while the first-mentioned triangular craft flew directly overhead at a higher rate of speed, yet silently.\r\n\r\nfinally, two separate sightings associated with visible aircraft (i.E., in the distance, as bright yellow headlights and/or flashing beacons), but not identifiable as aircraft:\r\n\r\n around 9:30pm, observing a bright yellow light hovering and gradually approaching from the direction of mohonk, i suddenly noticed a very bright, greenish-white light headed towards me from  the same direction (due south) just a bit above eye level, and seeming to move very quickly to my vicinity. within two minutes the light was passing by my observation point, moving slightly irregularly, the east and just a little above (i.E. at about 30 degrees of incline). when i jumped up from my chair to get a better look with binoculars, it seemed to slow down and change course. it drifted by slowly moving with slight irregularlities of speed and direction, and appeared to be very close, perhaps even as close as 50 feet (which would have made it a very small object, the size of a baseball), but it was difficult to judge size and distance because the object was brilliant though (seemingly, even through binoculars) small, and almost featureless. after i observed it for another minute or so (and rapped on the window to alert my wife, as a witness, from the kitchen), the object turned towards the northeast. as soon as it did so, appeared to gain altitude quickly and dimmed from view altogether within thirty seconds. \r\n\r\na nearly identical object appeared directly overhead, same shape and color, around 12:00 midnight, within two minutes of the appearance of the second triangular craft described above. perhaps because the object was directly overhead (not to the east, in front of the moon, as was the first greenish-white sphere), it was possible to observe atmospheric effects around the object as it passed over my house (in an arc, from the south east towards the north north-east) which made the object appear to be relatively distant, perhaps 1000 feet above, perhaps as high as 5000 feet -- but like the other sphere, this sphere appeared to slow down when i jumped up from my chair, in order to keep it in view of my binoculars. this (apparent) reaction to my movement made both spheres very hard to judge as far as distance, speed and size were concerned -- by the same token, they gave every impression of being intelligently controlled, whatever they were. \r\n\r\nwhile i have viewed numerous unidentifiable or strange-looking aircraft from my location in the last six months, at this point none of this is particularly alarming to me personally, much less so to my wife (who could care less what these lights are). however i note that my three cats and dog were noticeably anxious this evening, even though i cannot say whether they actually observed the celestial phenomena themselves. also i have a young child at home who has commented recently on \"flashing lights outside\" at night -- though i don't know how he could have observed the same craft as i, since he is invariably asleep when i skygaze. evidently there is something strange, and perhaps not altogether \"material\" in the usual sense going on with all this... \r\n\r\nit may sound odd but one way i am able to anticipate an approaching (anomalous) craft when i am outside, is that the wind almost always picks up before one appears, and sometimes, the wind blows warmer than the ambient temperature on such occasions. if we're dealing advanced propusion technology, perhaps that would be a side effect, or an indication of focused radar ground scanning (i.E., night vision infrared beams?) it may sound strange but i have observed this effect so many times in the last several months that i am quite certain it is no mere coincidence, and not just imagination.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23021,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.9304667,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04292010-0004","longitude":-73.9955608,"occurred":1272601800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

north-east towards the berkshires in the north-east, all the way to the south-west, inclusive of mohonk mountain preserve, where the lights of the mohonk mountain house are clearly visible most nights, with parts of tivoli, annandale-on-hudson, kingston, rhinecliff, rhinebeck, and saugerties clearly visible by day and night. so in principle much of what i describe could have been observed from those locations. \r\n\r\nfor skygazing this  is an exceptionally busy place, on the side of the catskill escarpment, directly beneath the main approaches for military and commercial aircraft to stewart int'l airport, 30 miles to the south behind mohonk. i can also observe aircraft ascending from descending towards albany intl. airport, have on occasion observed air traffic associated with regional airports in kingston, rhinebeck and red hook. at higher altitude there are regular flights (but especially between 5-8:00am, and 4-9:00pm) headed north and south, presumably to and from saratoga, plattsburg, montreal, and the ny metropolitan airports. those lanes follow the hudson river closely. still higher-altitude lanes from points further south are superimposed on the same lanes that serve stewart int'l. there are high-altitude lanes, and regular flights to be observed around dusk, headed west from massachussetts, and east towards massachussetts. smaller craft bound for the regional airports here and beyond tend to fly on the intermediate points of the compass. and then there are the anomalous craft -- those also fly from every which direction, usually at intermediate altitude and between dusk and dawn. my point is, i observe aircraft frequently, and have done so (with increasing interest) for 12 years from this location. on 9/11 i stood outside and listened perplexedly to a full-throttle jetliner race south over the hudson river, 10 miles to the east, invisible behind morning fog. i can hear amtrack on the dutchess county side of the river, and freight trains daily through saugerties and kingston, etc. in other words know what \"loud\", \"moderate\" and \"silent\" aircraft and automotive engines sound like. anything out of the ordinary is sure to

highway i saw a strange object making a turn very close to the ground, a crashing plane i thought first.  it went behind some trees about 600 yards ahead of me and i was waiting for fire or smoke or anything that a crashing plane would have but saw nothing.  i'm not used to seeing large aircraft fly this low to the ground so it was confusing me.  it was very clear that there were 5 bright white lights on the underbelly of the plane and one or two flashing lights as well (possible of the 5).  all lights were colored white with no exceptions.  this aircraft goes out of my view.\r\n\r\nabout 3 miles of driving later an incredibly slow moving plane comes directly over my vehicle on an open stetch of highway before a strip of businesses.  this time i see a direct view under the aircraft.  it has an apparent wing structure across that appears to have the 5 lights i remembered in bright white and perhaps 4 black looking engines that light is emitting around that must shield the lights' source because i can see their sillouhettes very clearly.  time seems to almost slow down as i'm driving about 30mph looking directly up through my drivers window and trying to make sense of what i'm seeing.  a few more miles up the road, about 2 miles from my home, i see a third object in the sky.\r\n\r\nthis is the object that has brought me to writing on this database tonight.  since this is my 3rd sighting in a short while i slow down to about 10mph with a few cars behind me right on my bumper.  the speed limit is 25mph so i'm afraid to slow any more as it is a very slick night on the roads.  the aircraft i'm watching not only appears to be moving at a crawl, but not moving at all.  i am about 1-200 feet underneath this aircraft and not more then 40 feet away from it's horizontal distance in comparison to my location.  at this point i open my window and gaze in complete awe at what appears to be hovering at 0 speed or movement completely still as i slowly drive under and passed it.  there are not many lights around me so i am getting an extremely clear view of the object.  i start to look for some sort of helicopter like propulsion but it is too rectangular from what i can see to be one of the local black military choppers or any rescue chopper, those would be far too small.  the same 5 lights spread out over the underbelly of the object are bright white and show the same 4 outlines of some sort of engine.  at this point i am trying to see what type of propulsion it is using because it looks like some sort of a hovercraft in the sky.  i can describe the sound quite accurately because it reminds me of a scene from the movie sneakers where the blind man is trying to figure out where the boss had been kidnapped to by playing audio tracks.  the sound the hovercraft was making was identical to tires on a bridge that has that metal grove where pavement has not been laid down upon yet.  it was a lower pitch, like a rather slow moving tire on metal grill.  i wanted to stop at the next clearing but began to get extremely anxious and scared.  if it was a military plane then why were so many of them running exercises in close proximity on a low visibility night so close to the ground?  if it were an alien craft then i know i have no business with it, no question about that.  i drove the last 2 miles home and got out of my car fairly bewildered.  i could hear the droning of the planes on the horizon in a fashion i have never heard at my home before.\r\n\r\nwalking towards my front door i looked back in the direction of the last sighting and heard a noise growing louder.  i saw through the trees ahead the same 5 lights making a slow turn at the end of my neighborhood and back around towards the direction it came from.  the neighbors lights across the street prevented my cheap cell phone camera from getting a good picture of the 5 lights in the trees.  since then there has been a constant droning and several more passes just outside of my neighborhood by one or more of these planes.  if i decide to drive back out and videotape these aircraft i will post again.  just wanted to document this in case someone else can provide some information on what i just saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":23011,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.4843125,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04282010-0013","longitude":-73.202372,"occurred":1272438000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1272516523000,"summary":"Several

sliding glass door on the south side of our home when i saw a large, white/blue light, approximately 20 degrees above the horizon in the south was moving very slowly towards the east. it spanned a distance of almost 45+ degrees from south to east. its size was about double that of venus, which has been in the westnorthwestern part of the sky lately. sirus is in the western sky and was also less than half of the size of the bright light. i went outside with a pair of binoculars and immediately brought it into focus. i had no other lights whatsoever and the only thing that could be seen was the bright light itself. being ex-usaf and living near airports all of my life, i'm used to most lights, including landing lights and spotlights on aircraft. this was much brighter and tinged with blue and most importantly, after the light had gone past my direct view of its front, i could still see it as if it was nothing but a bright light from any angle. landing lights on planes usually disappear once the craft has past and spotlights also begin to shade as they've gone past optimum viewing. this was neither of those. it took a good solid 5 mintues to make its way across the sky. there were absolutely no sounds associated with this light, but there was one of the usual commerical jets flying their normal track over the house at their normal altitude. this light seemed to only be between 3000-5000 feet from a guestimate. whether or not this light was an extraterrestrial craft or not, couldn't tell you, but whose ever it was...I'd like to have one :-)this is just my story off the cuff, i have not gone back and made exact measurements of the event. the only thing i didn't think to do was to take a picture, but such are practically useless at night with our digital camera. i was impressed with whatever it was. the direction should have taken it near hendersonville proper as well or somewhat south of it at worse.","distance":"Over One

downwards in an arcuate path.  i'm not a trained observer but it seemed to be losing elevation. then the object changed direction, perhaps around 90 degrees, and moved away at a high rate of speed

up a hill north on route 109 in acton, maine.  once you get to the top of the hill you're on what is called \"hubbard ridge.\"  to the left you can see vast open area. and to the right there are a couple houses a small restaurant/ale room, and large fields separated by some fairly tall trees and behind all the houses are thick woods.  i was driving along when i looked to my right and up slightly and noticed a small airplane flying by and it was low flying.  low enough i could see the white plane in significant detail.  it was a small plane, not a commercial airline.  it started to turn and head south and i passed another house and some trees and i lost sight of the plane.  then as i begin to pass another open field i could regain vision of the almost the same spot i saw the plane.  only to find there was a large silver cigar shaped object just sitting in the sky.  now the sky was relatively clear, with barely any obstruction of cloud cover.  the object was sitting at a higher altitude than the plane but not by a large difference. it was able to be seen clear as day.  there were no other cars around me at the time and it was around noon time.  and this was not the plane i saw before because this craft did not have any wings, was not the same color, or even had a front propeller and was much too long.  then i started to pass more trees and lost sight of the craft for a slight moment.  seconds later when i regained visibility the craft disappeared.  i took a right down a nearby road to see if it moved but it was no where to be found. i scanned the nearby sky carefully to spot it again, unsuccessful.  i came home and was baffled by what i saw and i still am.  i almost didn't even bother to record my sighting. until i decided to google \"silver cigar shaped object,\" yesterday.  the first thing that came up was a similar story told by someone in tuscon, arizona on april 25th 2010.  in similar fashion they saw it moments around the same time they
