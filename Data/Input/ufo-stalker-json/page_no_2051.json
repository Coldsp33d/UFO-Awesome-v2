believe the year was 1961,and my grand father was on his way home from work in plainfield ct,and as he was driving home he noticed a very bright light coming from a quarry pit.He is now on green hollow road in danielson ct,he pulled his car over,and walked up to the quarry.He said he was on a grassy hill looking down at this grayish roundish shaped aircraft,and the lights were almost blinding,and the ufo was basically hovering about 10 to 15 feet off of the ground.His distance from the ufo was about 90 feet.It was making a very loud humming noise.He stated that the ufo made him feel very week like it was some how draining  his energy from him.At this time he wanted someone to witness what he was seeing so he left the area and got back in his car he only leaved a min. away from where this was taken place.He got his wife,in the car and told her that you will not believe what i just saw in the quarrys.She told me that she was a little frightened because she never saw him act this way before,so she got in the car and went for the ride with him.Though when they got back to where he saw the ufo it was gone.My grand mother told me that what ever he saw  was real.My grand father was in the army and he served in world war 2 he was also the owner of a small plastic manufacturing with over 20 employees..That night that he saw the ufo he got a call from one of his cousins not too long after he actually saw the ufo,and he was telling him that he saw a object in the sky that was no aircraft that he ever seen and he described the object as being a grayish colored roundish with very bright lights and he also pulled his car off the road to get a better look of it,and he also stated that he could not explain what he has seen.They both wondered how many other people witnessed the same event as they did but just never went to the newspaper or the police.\r\n   i wanted to share this story with you,my grandfather was dead before i was born but this story was told to me from my grand mother and her name was claire magrey,and my grand father name was rudolf magrey..The other relative would rather not give his name.My name is john goyette.\r\ni know for sure that my grand father witnessed a ufo,my grandmother told me that after he saw the ufo he was not himself for at least a week,he was almost afraid of what he seen because he could not explain what he saw though he told this story to a lot of people,and everyone that knew him knew that he was a  very smart man and a man who never lied,and they both knew that he was a milerty man and he knew his war planes and what he saw was not from this world.\r\n thanks for letting me share this story with you... john

seemed very low and small for a plane, but really big and high for a kite. the object was heading east. we turned a corner as the object also turned heading north and it passed over the car.\r\nthis was where i got a good look at it: it was black, but appeared to have a dark blue sheen to it. it was mostly triangular shaped, except for the back which looked like torn or ripped metal. it was not evenly cut like the back end of a b2 bomber. the bottom appeared to be slightly beveled. the frayed parts did not ripple/furl/flutter in the air. it appeared to be a fairly solid object. i stuck my head out of the car (travelling at 30 mph) and noticed it was completely silent, there was no contrail and it was moving very slow, but deliberate. there, it curved even further and headed northwest, where i lost sight of it.\r\nwind: from the south at 17 mph\r\nvisibility: clear, 10 miles\r\nweather: few clouds, light. \r\n\r\nattached is a drawing based on the ones i did immediately after the

helicopter would be, but, these things were playing leap frog, in the blink of an eye, in a nano second, they would bounce up and over each other and change places, whilst all  still moving in the same direction forward from left to right in the sky from my viewpoint. no known earthly manmade flying machine could have moved from one place to another in the sky like these things did.  how big would they be you might ask ?? judging from the distance they appeared to be up in the sky and all, could possibly been as big as a jumbojet.  and they were literally changing places in the sky as

too wide to be a plane and too perpendicular to the earth for it to be a plane landing. then the lights moved in such a way that we realized there were 3 flying objects, not one plane. then they all 3 lights shifted in each others positions, like musical chairs or something. just like they all bounced to the others position very fastly. that shocked me. we continued to watch. then i kept watching (as i was driving). they were flying so fast, away from us (flying east bound as we were driving east bound) and then one light disappeared. i have no idea where that object went. then the second one disappeared as well, about 30-45 seconds later. not sure where that one went. then the last light/object flew very fast in a south/east direction and then that one too disappeared. the light was just gone. now i was never close enough to see the outlines. just the lights. my friend was in the passenger seat and probably saw way more than i did. but we both saw the shifting of the lights and the

villa to take our dog for a walk to the vacant lot at the end of our street, i was accompanied by my wife, youngest son (aged 9 yrs) and the dog. it was a warm dubai spring evening, temp about 25c, with clear skies and stars visible, visibility was greater than 10 km.  \r\nwe reached the vacant lot and released the dog. as we were looking over al wasl road towards the arabian gulf and the burj al arab hotel, we noticed a bright orange light out over the gulf which was traveling towards the coast / dubai at a medium speed. the light was small and spherical / star like, orange coloured and had the look, luminosity and intensity of the sodium vapour street lamps they have along the main roads here. the object���s speed was difficult to estimate, somewhere between that of the fast corporate helicopters that regularly fly up and down the coast and the approach speed of a jet airliner on descent into dubai international airport. in elevation it appeared to be approximately level with the top of the burj al arab.\r\nthe light increased in size, colour and intensity as it flew towards the coast until it resembled airliner approach lights seen at a distance, appearing to maintain its altitude / elevation. we observed it for a couple of minutes and l remarked to the others that an orange light was not usual for an aircraft, but that it was probably a helicopter or airliner and would resolve itself into white landing, red and green navigation lights of an aircraft as it got closer.  my wife turned and walked home. \r\nmy son and i continued watching the light for another minute or so as it flew obliquely towards us. the light maintained its altitude and colour, crossing the coast slightly to our north and passing abeam us as it flew towards the dubai cbd at a medium altitude (estimate 2-3000 feet) in the direction of the burj khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 818 metres high. the orange light was clearly visible over the glow from the lights of the city and i said to my son that it was unusual that we still couldn���t see any navigation lights, which we should have done if it was an airliner or a helicopter. \r\nas we continued watching, the object approached the vicinity of the burj khalifa (approximately 5km way from our location) and climbed vertically, accelerating out of sight at great speed and disappearing amongst the stars in seconds. the rate of climb was phenomenal. the light grew fainter as it climbed indicating that it was of constant size / intensity. there was no noise. \r\nwe both saw the object climb of sight and discussed what we had seen, i told my son that we may have seen a ufo and explained my rationale. he was excited and just as amazed as i was. we called our dog, put him back onto his leash and walked home to tell my wife who had seen the orange light when it was over the sea.\r\nas a former military pilot, aircraft and weapons enthusiast, i can state that the object / phenomenon we observed was no ordinary aircraft (civil or military), or routine atmospheric condition. the light remained a constant orange colour and intensity when observed from all aspects front, side and beneath as it climbed. the object���s motion and flight appeared controlled and it���s climb rate exceeded that of a supersonic fighter, yet there was no noise. no known conventional aircraft could have accelerated and climbed vertically at that speed without breaking the sound barrier in the climb, the sonic boom would have been heard from the ground. \r\na few days later i ran into a neighbour who is a senior meteorologist at dubai international airport and asked him whether anything unusual aerial phenomenon had been reported or tracked on radar, that night. he told me that he was not aware of anything unusual being reported. \r\nwe experienced no ill effects from the sighting and noticed no unusual behaviour or reaction from the dog. \r\n","distance":"Over One

the questions i asked and some answers told to me that i did not ask so lets begin well i was laying on my couch back in january and i heard a noise at my back sliding glass door and i heard what sounded like metal tapping at my glass door tink tink tink so i started to listen more carefully there it was again so i got my pistol and before i got off the couch something told me i wont need the weapon and something was telling me to not be frightened at what i see out there so i go to the curtain that is over the door and peeked out a little what i saw was so scary to me and im a big dude and dont scare easily it looked like a small human like being with eyes that shined like the eyes of an alligator when u shine a light at them but could not see completely beceause its dark out back no light at all so something said open the door so i did and i got back and here comes in this almost humanlike being i was in complete frozen shock to what im seeing it was like a hairless human with no ears but little holes on the side of head and a very small nose like a newborn baby nose a slit for a mouth no lips no teeth no tounge all i keep hearing in my head was dont be afraid and dont try to hurt me and it held out its hand and it had what i would call a high tech personel organizer so i took it out of its hand which looked like long thin muscleless arms wich were as long as mine but on a being half as tall as me the second i took the device it was talking to me in english and said this is how were going to communicate cause the mind talk will kill all my brain cells very fast so i said what do u want with me it said scientific reasearch i said what kind of reasearch and why me go to some 3rd world country and do it there it said they have been monitoring me since i was born i said bullshit and images popped in my mind of when i had sleep peralisis when i was like 5 or 6 and i swore it was a dream it wasnt and the time i thought i fell out of a tree but it was them putting me back on the ground a little rough i said why u monitoring me it said i had the blood of the kings in me i said what does that mean it said humans are there creation we are there hybreeds there dna and the dna from the symians from long ago and the dna of other beings also and my blood sends off a signal to them due to the purity of my dna from there elders at this point im thinking im loseing my mind this has to be a brain problem like scitzophrenia or something it said im fine so i went with it and said well i have many questions for u it said it will answer all that it can i said ok where u from it said not your solar system or galaxy but a galaxy 1 million light years away from a planet that resembled earth with less gravity and more sun how do you get here from that  far away it said there vehicles bend spacetime but could not say how beceause it said im not intelligent enough to grasp the technology it said dont be ashamed of that his people were 1 billion years ahead of us technalogicly i said ok then asked why cant u talk it said it could but its voicebox cant make words like ours it made some sounds that resembled very  squeaky brakes on a car and it said his people communicate through the mind which is accomplished through a chemical and electrical reaction in the brain that we dont produce then it said it had questions for me we will go back and forth asking it asked me if it could touch me i said where you want to touch me at it said all over i was hesitant but agreed only if i could touch it also it agreed so it started to rub my leg feeling the hair almost like massageing the muscles it felt weird its hands and fingers resembled that of a lizard kinda it felt my body all over and then i got my turn to touch it its skin was like rubber almost shiny and smooth and smooshy then we went back to q and a i said how old are you it said 500 earth years and his people live as long as 5000 sometimes i asked are you a boy or a girl it said it was a male of its species and i said where are your private parts he said they were not like ours but in a similar area as mine and his come out only when its gonna mate with a female of his species i said why do u resemble a human he said all life evolves to an upright creature so there is less exposure to the sun an have more than one limb and sensory argans in case of a loss or failure to one of your parts well thats all of my encounter im going to tell for now i was thinking about writing a book and getting paid for it or

over my head. it paused there over me for about 2 seconds. as i looked right up at it, it wasn't white or red anymore but a ball of glittering lights. it was about the sizes of a beach ball. then as it went away again it turn red continued down the alley a little farther this time. here is where i got goose bumps and chills. instead of coming back it went down and to the right so fast it left a

talking to a friend on my cell phone something in the sky caught my attention. i asked my son if he was seeing what i was seeing and of course he was. it was at 350 degrees north at approxiamately a 45 degree angle. the time was 8:55 give or take a minute. it was a clear cloudless night. i couldn't not notice the craft. at first i thought it might be a blimp of some sorts, the shape resembling of that; elongated rather than spherical. on the top of the craft there were to very small lights, one red and one white. along the bottom was a row of white lights that were rotating around it's body. the reason i know it wasn't a blinking sequence of lights is because there was a break in the lights like one was out and you could see it as it progressed around. i only got a look at it from it's side so i geuss i can't be one hundred percent about it but i feel pretty confident of my assesment. for the duration of the sighting the craft was stationary to the eye; i suppose it could've been moving ever so slightly but highly unlikely. after a minute of watching i decided to keep driving in the direction of it rather than go home. i wanted to get closer to be able to \"know\" what i was seeing. as i got closer the white lights on the bottom shut off, but the small red and white on top were still visible although hard to see. i made a right turn and passed a large tree that hid it from sight. after passing the tree there wasn't anything where it should be; no lights no structure nothing. as if it had totally disappeared. the stars were shining through where if there was a blimp or aircraft or structure they wouldn't be. also the craft was so low in the sky i can't reason it to being an aircraft. i stopped the car and my son and i looked all over in the sky to try and find it but we were unable to locate it again. we sat by the road in total astonishment for 2 or 3 minutes. i couldn't explain to him what it was that we had seen, but even he knew it wasn't anything that is normally in our night sky. i still can't believe what we saw, i know in my heart it was a ufo and i feel lucky to have spotted it. i wish i knew someone else that also saw it that night so we could talk about it together. so i could tell them hey i saw it too! wow!","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

held it up in the air in front of the sphere. there was no sound, no flashing lights, no blinking of any kind. just one solid, bright golden/orange color, almost the color of flame. we stood there and just watched it slowly and silently move across the sky until it moved downward and behind my house where we couldnt see it anymore. we saw it in the western sky, and it moved north, and then

white discs along the edges of each leading edge. after watching this for no more than seven seconds they just dissapeared. there were no low level clouds and the sky was perfectly clear. there were high level clouds, but few and far between. at first i thought these were f-117s, but after seeing them just dissapear and seeing the white discs i believe these were ufos. i stared up for several more minutes but did not see anything. if these were normal aircraft i would expect to see them to emerge from the limited high level clouds and been able to see them again within several seconds or

jacksonville florida for a little piece and quiet down in alachua county florida.\r\nalong the sides of the paved road were big beautiful oak trees, which were covered in swaying spanish moss, which dangled down upon each individual branch. a variety of livestock could be seen grazing the small hills of green pastures, landscaped by a stretch of wild flowers along side the road as we traveled to our destination. we did make a few occasional stops to take a few photos, being that both of us enjoyed the hobby of photography.\r\nwe stayed at at the secret river lodge at the yearling restaurant,14531 east county road 325,in hawthorne,fl which is just down the road where marjorie kinan rawlings home which is in cross creek.Marjorie kinnan rawlings wrote a book called \"the yearling\" which was a american classic and winner of the pulitzer prize in 1939.\r\non saturday morning we planned out our day, which consisted of traveling to a few small towns, which were only, minutes away. we traveled to ft.Mccoy, eureka, mcintosh and salt springs.Along the way we stopped for a few yard sells, art shows and exhibits which seemed to be numerous for that weekend. saturday night we walked across from our cabin and ate dinner at the yearling restaurant, which consisted of two sides, catfish, frog legs, soft-shelled crab and hush puppies. then we settled back to our cabin for a good night���s rest. \r\nsunday morning we awoke around 8:00 am, we made ourselves some coffee and then we took our cups of caffeine down to the creek, which were only a few yards away from our cabin. we sat down upon a bench, sipping our coffee as we listened to a variety of birds sing their own melody and watching the dragon flies dance across the tops of the water. it was a nice morning, it was breezy and overall an overcast day. i sat my coffee down upon the bench and started snapping photos of my surroundings. i then began to walk under the cross creek bridge, which was to the right of where the bench was and snapped a picture of a mirrored reflection of some cypress trees in the water. then went back to our cabin, packed up our things, went into micanopy shops and then headed back to jacksonville, fl.\r\nwe arrived back to jacksonville, fl around 4 pm and i was anxious to view the photos of which we had taken during our trip. i had taken a total of 298 photos and my boyfriend had taken a total of 136 photos. after uploading the photos, we began watching a slideshow of our trip on my computer. i remember making comment to him about how pretty the reflection was in the water and then he questioned me \" what���s that���? and then he pointed to an object on my monitor screen towards the tops of the trees. to be honest at first i thought maybe it might have been a bird but the closer we looked, it convinced us both differently. when i took this photo i was drawn by the reflection in the water of the trees, so i really didn���t notice anything else that was captured in the picture until i uploaded it to my computer. this photo was the only shot out of all the 298 photos i took that shows anything abnormal.

to the west of where i live. at first i thought it might have been a plane making an approach to hill, as the af jets that come in to land, will sometimes pass over head, and make a loop before landing! but, this turned out not to be the case, as, when this light blinked out, there was no noise of any kind to be heard! nor did whatever this was reflect any light from the ground below! i aslo doubt that it might have been a parachutist, because the chute would have reflected light also! a possible meteorite could be ruled out, as, while i watched this light for it's duration, it appeared to bank just a little before going out! also, there was no tail associated with it, either, had it been one! there have also been no reports in the local news of anything hitting the ground, either! i tried to follow it's possible path from my point of view, but i could not distinguish anything of interest, nor could i see where any stars may have been blocked out by whatever it was!

van.Looking at the sky from the san bernardino mountains at 7,000 feet was simply breath taking.Im from the east coast and never seen the stars so close.I dont drink or do any drugs iwas 100 % sober and awake.At about 10:00 pm i saw a strange star like object in the sky..Im not familliar with the geogrsphical locations of the area....So at my best guess id have to say it was over the high desert maybe victorville,ca. while watching the object i noticed it changing shape from a star like shape to a bigger ring like shape.(kind of like an eclipse),then it would change into like a dragonfly shape with four wings and a cigar shaped body,there was light blue,light pink,and bright white pulsating lights moving around the object in a counter clockwise direction.....It would move across the sky faster than anthing ive ever seen.Faster than a shooting star.So fast it almost seemed to disapear and reapear again.Before it would zip accross the sky. it changed from a dragonfly shape into a ring like shape and then into a star like shape before zipping into a new location.When i looked directly at it it seemed like it was blurry..Couldnt quite see it perfectly.It almost seemed like it was dancing in the sky...Id say like a misquito dancing over a body of water.Just barely touching the water just to bounce up again....Without any definate pattern..I watched it zip across te sky and change its shape for an hour...At least.....From where i was i had a great view of the skies of southern california,i could see as far as catalina island...The lights of l.A..The high desert.Most of san bernardino.Watching in the sky for as long as i was i noticed a pattern of planes flying the exact same route before landing at l.A.X. airportor maybe ontario or maybe even both.Every time a plane came into proximaty to the object it would quickly change from a dragonfly shape,to a ring shape and finally into a star shape and stayed still untill the airplane was out of visual range of the object.Then it would go back to the dragonfly shape again.About every 10 or 15 minuites it would repeat the same thing..At any rate,i had a verry strong led flashlight with me in my van.I pointed it at the object and turned it on and of repeatedly for about 2 minuites.It definately noticed..It came closer to me. it seemed ike it was loking at me ..It then spread from a dragonfly shape into a ring like shape..As it gat closer it got much bigger.It was like it was almost screaming at me ..The pulsating lights moved faster .And the objects ring shape got bigger then smaller several times.And almost disapeared instantly....Im not scared of any man .But ill tell ya at that moment i was verry un easy.It was almost like it was going to strike out at me....But..It just disapeared.Im not the only one who saw it.I know of at least 3 more people who

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A few days ago i spoke to mr. \"c. l.\" who suggested i report this incident with you, and then speak with a mr. sam moranto.\r\n\r\naround december i was working away from home on a 24 jobsite operation in indiana.  i resided in an apartment 20 miles from the jobsite in a adjacent small town. one night i went home at an odd hour for my shift, and instead of a 7 pm to 7 am shift, i worked till 3 am.  i went back to my place, and was in bed an hour or so later.  \r\n\r\nthe next thing i know, i woke up sometime just before the sun started rising after having an extremely intense dream. a dream that i was somehow abducted from my rented second floor apartment, and taken aboard a alien craft.  everything in my memory is very foggy but there are specifics that are quite vivid. \r\n\r\nunlike the usual abduction scenarios that i have head of, i was brought aboard a ship (i have no idea how i got there) but felt at peace and calm. i wasnt forced into some examination, nothing was forced upon me. \r\n\r\ntheir faces are distorted in how i saw them at the time, and in my memory.  of the 4-5 aliens that might have been there in the room with me, i can only remember the face of one of them.  a reptilian type, or a race trying to disguise their appearance to me by looking reptilian. but the one that i remember was looking intensely at me. it was big, probably 6 and a half feet tall, muscular, with a body suit over his chest that looked like metal, and like some superhero's costume, it outlined the strong pectorals and muscles of its abdomen. it looked very strong, as if it could pick me up and throw me a hundred yards. it was a light shade of green on the front, and the color darkened as it went to his backside.  its outfit was of a yellowish color. it was intense, no emotions on its face. but i could feel it being slightly hesitant towards the desicion by the others to give me this mission.(obviously by now i have done enough research to look at photos/drawings and read up a little bit on different alien beings that are supposedly out there).  \r\n\r\nthey spoke at length to me about some very important things, much of which i cannot recall. i am a pretty fervent meditator, and they asked me to do a 'standing meditaion' for them, which a few seconds into it, they seemed pleased by what i could do. in the process of our discussion, i was asked to help them, fully given a choice.  apparently, i agreed to their mission and then they showed me to a stainless steel type of tub, and showed me this small yellow and blue submarine looking device. it was about an inch tall and 3 inches long, and with a push of a button a thin long spiraling wire came whirling a foot or more out of the tip of it. on the tip of the long wire was a scary looking triangular shaped barb.  i was more amazed than shocked, but as i was told to get into the tub that was full of some gelatenous mixture. \r\n\r\nthough up to that point i had been calm, i was bgining to get rather nervous, but i reluctantly got into the tub, and they put the little machine into the ky jelly type substance and it slowly, but relentlessly, came at me. once it was close enough to me, i tried to push it away with my hands but it just kept coming.  i had a undeniable feeling that it was trying to get to my 'johnson'. once the thing was immenently close, i have a blackout in my memory.  \r\n\r\nthe next thing that i remember is that i am out of the tub, away from it and back to being calm. they are telling me to ready myself to go back and that they will erase my memory of the incident. i was confused as to why they wouldnt want me to remember everything that i was supposed to do.  they told me, look for a sign in the sky, then they gave me the idea that memories of this event should eventually come back, and even more info would possibly come back with time and effort on my part.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i know i am back in my apartment.  i woke up slowly, i wasn���������t startled or even thinking about the dream though i knew i had dreamt.  i then had a cigarette, and went to the bathroom to pee.  while standing there in the bathroom light, as i was peeing, i notice something peculiar on my johnson, but thought it to be a regular old vein or something...But when i touched it, it felt hard like a thin steel cable, about a 1 mm thick.  it seemed to be about 2 inches long( i was to investigate further in the coming days and find out that it is much longer, even going under my pelvis bone) i was perplexed by it, but thought that i was not going to do anything about it at the moment, so i might as well try to sleep and deal with it later. i'd keep an eye on it as i wasnt at home and didnt want to go to any doctors round that area, and then i went back to bed, as i felt exhausted. \r\n\r\nupon falling asleep again, i had a dream, a very vivid in color dream.  in the past i have had a good handful of profetic dreams (dreams of my wife before we met, the death of a cousin, etc)...And this dream was of that caliber in detail to me.  i wont bore you with the details, but let���������s just say that the gov and the feds were after me, and it might have been tied to me having this mechanism looked at by a doctor or untrustworthy person.  i have a wife and a family and i cannot put them in jeopardy over this. that is why i wish to keep any information i tell you a secret.\r\n\r\nbut it doesnt end there...When i woke in a cold sweat from the dream of being tracked and chased down, i kept hearing this noise outside my apartment door. i actually heard the noise earlier when i had been up before, but was so tired then, that nothing could have stopped me from sleeping,  but now, as i tried to go back to sleep, the noise was irritating.  so i opened the door to my apartment to see the two large windows at the top of the stairs were totally pulled open, and this is on what must have been the coldest, windiest night since the last winter they had down there.  i found it very odd, but made no particular connection to anything.  by now the alien dream i had prior was not even something i was thinking about, like any old dream one might have.\r\n\r\nso here is where the last string from this life changing night gets tied...That next night at work, when i plugged my computer in and went to my yahoo home page, there was a headline that immediately stood out to me.  i clicked on it.  it happened to be the norway spiral clip, that had just happened on dec 10. while i watched this clip, i was suddenly frozen with shock, flushed with fear, and remembered that i was to see a 'sign in the sky'.  seeing the, at that time unexplained incident, suddenly had me remembering the odd implant in my 'johnson' and the upstairs windows that were oddly flung open in the middle of the night, and the crazy dream/abduction i had experienced.\r\n\r\nso there is the short story of that night. there is actually much more to the story, but i'd like to at least make contact with you, before i go more into more detail. \r\n\r\nthings have happened since as far as what this 'thing' in my johnson does. all sorts of unexplainible things have been happening, one of which, is that i no longer get sick. infact many ailments that i had previously, persitent heartburn, gastritus, even 2 bad teeth that needed crowns have disappeared.  my wife has been sick twice, and even while being with her all day, i have not caught her sicknesses  the one constant, is that this implant is still there, ever present.  though in a way, i am doing my own studies of how this affects me, i would entertain the idea of having some trustworthy people do some examining of it. nothing too crazy like trying to remove it, i fear it would be impossible to do without endangering my life.\r\n\r\nwhat i can tell you, is that it wraps round the tip of my johnson, and must go all the way back to my spine, because a week after first getting the implant, i suffered from horrible almost debilitating lower back pains for a month.  the back pains then simply vanished, and i have yet to have any since.  i recently went to a urologist to have the implant examined, but oddly enough, the implant has slowly been sinking deeper into the flesh of my johnson, and is now almost undetectible unless my johnson happens to be in an 'excitied' state. most particularly, the day i went to the doctor, the implant was seemingly gone. the urologist couldnt feel anything, and to his knowledge what i explained to him didnt make medical sense. yet, later that night while having intercourse with my wife, sure enough, there it was again.

it was silent, and there were no blades or wings. the object had a very large white light that was self-contained (meaning it did not radiate light), and then an odd or kind of random configuration of red lights. the red lights were not \"in order\" e.G. not in a line, circular or discernible pattern and the white light was very vivid, about the size of the full moon when seen in a clear night sky (except this was very close). none of the lights were blinking -they were all steady. i said to the passengers (son in front passenger seat and friend in back seat of f-150 truck) \"do you guys see that?\" my son said yes, he had already been looking at it, and the friend in the back then moved over to the south side of the seat to look out the window and said yes, he saw it, too. we were kind of gobsmacked and i said \"what the hell is that?\" and came to a dead stop in the street. we all looked up and over at it as it continued to remain stationary. thankfully no one rear ended me when i stopped, but i don't believe there were any other cars or people on the street, although we really don't remember. we watched it for about 10 or 15 seconds and then i immediately pulled into a gravel parking lot on the north side of the street that was directly opposite of where we were stopped. the night was pretty balmy so the two front windows were down. my son leaned far out of the passenger window, kind of sitting on the ledge facing south, so he could see. the friend could see it from the driver's side backseat window on the south side of the truck, and i could clearly see it from the driver's side. i heard no sound whatsoever, although my son and his friend (in their teens) said they heard an almost imperceptible hum. my hearing has lost some of the highs and lows, so i am not surprised that it seemed silent to me and i trust their hearing more than mine. we continued to watch it hover for another minute or so and then it began to move east (the direction we had just come from) in a straight line at an incredibly slow speed. it was just creeping along at such a slow pace that were able to watch it for another 20 seconds or so. none of us are sure whether it moved out of our line of vision below a tree line or something or if it just disappeared. regardless, we watched it until it was no longer there. we don't really know how it went away. when were stopped in the street and before we moved to the parking lot, while we were watching it my son blurted out \"who are they looking for?!\" in an alarmed voice. i was struck by this because that thought never occured to me, that \"they\" or \"it\" were looking for someone, and when we discussed it later, my son did not remember saying this. the three of us were just stunned - \"what was it? what was it?\" we discussed the fact that it could be some a military thing, but if so it was unlike anything in our experience and was not conventional. we all thought it was a definite ufo, in that we know we saw it and it remained unidentifiable to us. it was very difficult to get any sense of the shape of the craft because the ambient light and the white light made it difficult to see beyond the white light to what it was attached to or what was behind it. to me it can best be described as lights with a kind of dark mass behind them. my son has the sense that it looked more like an odd kind of plane than anything else, because he thinks there was a long front edge similar to a plane when viewed from the front, wing-tip to wing-tip. he does not believe it was a plane, though, and neither do his friend or i. we all agree it was an unidentified object, either an unknown military craft using reverse techonology or an alien craft. it was not triangular, spherical, oblong, and it was also not a helicopter, plane or blimp. the three of us have no idea what it was or whether anyone else saw it. when we drove home we all talked about it but could not id it. the only other odd thing that happened was after we dropped of the first friend and before the sighting, my son, his other friend and i were driving in the truck and there was a very uneasy vibe in the truck. then my son said \"tonight is a weird night - let's just get the hell home.\" i knew immediately what he meant - we were all quiet and no one was talking and things just felt off, just before he made that statement. i said, \"yes, that's what we're doing,\" and then on the way , about 2 minutes later, we had this experience. i do believe my son has had previous encounters, and the fact that he was alarmed about the craft looking for someone makes me think that if it was an alien craft, it has something to do specifically with him and that his friend and i were along for the ride.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22972,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.9656755,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04262010-0002","longitude":-82.9973542,"occurred":1271658600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1272268801000,"summary":"Craft hovered at 1000 ft then moved off incredibly slowly","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Columbus, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:132340"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Richmond","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approx. 8:30p.M. nightly, a very bright starlike object appears in the sky. it moves rapidly into position, then it hovers for 60-90 minutes with a back and forth horizontal motion. it pulsates and is soundless. the motion isn't great but its constant and discerenable; maybe half of my pinky finger's width at arms length.  this bright light appears at the same time as the multicolored star sphere that i had reported before. toniht both appeared at the same time and as i am typing this report the bright light has moved away and the multicolored sphere lingers. i showed my wife tonight. she usually dismisses it as a bright star, but even she agreed it was too close and too bright and moved. she refused to speculate; only to witness. i took 4 pictures, but due to the poor quality of my olympus camera, i was unable to capture anything more than a light trail, which i deleted.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22971,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.9439976,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04262010-0001","longitude":-122.3433086,"occurred":1272252600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1272267063000,"summary":"A very bright light in the sky. it is too close, it moves, and is gone in 90 min.","tags":["disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Richmond, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:132341"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2051}
