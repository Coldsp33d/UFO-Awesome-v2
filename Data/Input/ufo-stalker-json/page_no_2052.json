(they do this on occasion for drills but the timing of this seemed too perfect). \r\n\r\nduring the course of all this i noticed 2, possibly 3 commercial jets fly in the general area and one private plane. (the commercial jets do not usually take this flight path to my knowledge and i have lived where i live for 10 years).\r\n\r\ni am not sure what it was, not saying it was a ufo. first thought it was a

were grazing. it had a big red light blinking every 2 seconds. i knew right away it was a ufo and asked my partner to hurry and get closer. he gets off the main road and manages to find a dirt dead end street right below the hills where the craft is still cruising. i run out of the car getting as close as i can. my partner is watching this as well, along with our 4 year old daughter. the 2 year old one is sleeping in the car. i could clearly see that this craft was round in shape, silver metallic in color, and a part of it spun counter clockwise at the same time something brownish or darkish spun the opposite way. once it has spun a full circle, a big red light would blink approximately every 2 seconds. the craft is going at a very slow pace and starts moving further away, at the same time elevating higher....We keep watching it the entire time until we barely could make it out, except for the red blinking light. a huge airplane is coming going north, then two others are coming right after...And the this craft elevates even higher and goes right underneath the planes. we can no longer see it and decide to continue our trip.\r\n\r\ni want to add that a couple of minutes into observing the craft, i started to see some glittery interesting little \"things\" in the air. millions of them, they convered the air, the atmosphere...As i was watching it wondering what in the world...? my partner speaks up saying; i am also seeing these little white glowing wormlike things all over the air. we both described them the same way. he also said he got a shockingly powerful headache just like that, along with a icy feeling in his forehead. i felt fine, except being high with excitement and adrenaline rush. later on a headache crept in, along with an extreme back

blue sky.  temperature was about 70 deg f.\r\n\r\ni was sitting in my car looking in an easterly direction with sunroof open, due to the heating from the bright sun.  i was waiting for my wife while she was shopping at the maxx.  to pass the time while eating my apple snack i started to watch jet planes high overhead (approx 15,000) as they were making a beeline to and from boston's logan airport.  i watched several of the northbound jets and at one time i noticed what i first thought was a white jet at a higher altitude traveling southeasterly (diagonally) across the apparent path of a boston bound jet.  i then noticed 3-4 of these small white winged objects and concluded they must be seagulls soaring high above warwick, which is not uncommon for this city of 100,000 +/- on narragansett bay.  anyway, i watched another jet continuing along the same \"to boston\" trajectory and then noticed a intensely bright, white, circular object in a northeasterly direction and approximately 70 degrees above the horizon.  i thought it funny that it just hung in that position for many minutes, but it was lazily moving extremely slowly generally in a figure-eight pattern, which i verified by lining the object up with the edge of my car door jamb. as far as i could tell, the object did not vary in brightness, color or shape during my total observation.  it was brighter than a daytime observation of the planet venus and it definitely exhibited a diameter (disclike).  i did have the distinct impression that it was spherical but without the aide of optics i was unsure.\r\n\r\nafter several minutes of watching the object at the initial altitude, it started to drift slowly in a nearly straight path to the northeast --- my tall vertical light stanchion was my reference to determine this, for sure.  i continued watching until the object met a cirrus cloud and then i lost it at about 40 degrees above the horizon.  at last sight, the diameter of the object did appear to shrink a little bit, but the brightness did not.  my sighting lasted apporximately 25 minutes and, unfortunately, ended about 10 minutes before my wife returned from shopping...I was hoping i could show this to her to get her impressions.\r\n\r\nafter i spotted the object i wondered what it could be.  venus?  no, wrong position.  another plane with lights coming toward me?  no, too slow and not a pinpooint light source and planes don't wobble in an almost stationary position.  a helicopter?  no, uniformly lit and probably too high.  a weather balloon?  maybe, but strange behavior for a weather balloon.  i also initially thought it might be a daylight supernova until i examined it more intently and noticed the slight wobbling motion.\r\n\r\ni did not think of ufo at first but i came to that conclusion as my observation went on.  it brought back a memory of the same kind of sighting i had when i was about 13 years old when one summer day i was playing in a park with the neighborhood kids, also in warwick, ri.  i have had several other sightings over the years but never reported them to anyone.  my last sighting was a few years ago when i was in florida on vacation.\r\n\r\ni have been an amateur astronomer since a teenager and own a couple of telescopes.  i am also a ham radio operator.  i am a professional engineer (civil) licensed to practice in several states.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

was. then i realized it kept beeping and it was not the smoke detector beeping. i sat up quickly facing my bedroom door opening. it was pitch black and could not see past my bead room door, it sounded exactly like my treadmill when it is turned on and buttons are pushed to change the settings. i could not figure out why someone would be messing with my treadmill in the middle of the night. i could feel that someone was in my house.  then i thought it was little grey aliens, for some reason it really scared me. i wanted to get up to investigate, but was frozen from fear. i had a baseball bat that i wanted to grab in the corner of my room. i was also thinking of calling the cops. my treadmill was just around the corner of my room in the living room. i can���t remember if i am envisioning this or i saw them but i keep seeing these small bluish grey aliens, 2 or 3. not clearly lit up like i was shining a light on them and they were standing at my bedroom door way. i remember looking outside my window at one point at the sky and it was a lot darker than normal as if there was a craft blocking the city lights. i do not recall seeing a space ship. i do recall that there was no other noise and it was eerily quite outside except for the noises coming from inside from my treadmill, about 3-4 minutes passed with my treadmill beeping. i had a bad feeling and my adrenaline was pumping hard. the next thing i see is a bright white type of light like lightning with a bluish color, it looked like electrical light. much brighter than a light bulb and the light had a glow to it almost as bright as observing someone welding. it was shining on my wall at a strange angle it did not completely light up the entire wall, the light was coming from my formal living room where my treadmill was. when i saw this i knew that i had to investigate the light. then a very strange sound stated, i could hear an electrical sound building up and a surge of power, then a loud sound like something left and shot off and something electrical blew up all close the same time. the light lasted about 3-4 seconds before the loud bang from the electrical sound, then the light vanished. out of the corner of my eye my blinds were open to my window facing north, i never saw any light coming from outside. when the light went out i immediately looked outside and up to the sky. it still appeared eerie dark and could not see any stars or the glow from the city lights. my first feeling was that something teleported out of my living room and then a ship shot off. second thought sounded like something electrical blew up. not sure if something flashed by or left, i grabbed my cell phone and baseball bat. i used the phones light to see me way to turn on the first light. not sure if it was the bathroom or hallway light that i turned on first. i remember banging my baseball bat on the tile floor to make some noise as i went through the house.  before i go the light turned on i had a strong feeling that i was going to see the small grey aliens. i grabbed my flashlight out of the laundry room and then immediately looked in the formal room and saw nothing. another note i smelled nothing out of the ordinary, electrical burnt or from lightning. i inspected the whole house turned on all the lights. was thinking about looking outside had a bad feeling not to go outside. i kept hearing something up in my attic or on the roof almost like footsteps. it was really freaking me out. i was hoping to find a window or door open, everything was locked and closed. i would have herd if a person had left my house. when i was going around the house i kept hearing scurrying noises inside and on the roof or attic. the whole time i was searching the house the aliens kept coming into my mind. i could sense something was still there, wanted to look on the roof and in the attic, decided that it was not a good idea.  i could sense or feel a presence and that i was being watched. i did also notice that my refrigerator was showing that the power was off for 4 minutes from 3:06 am to 3:10 (corrected). so while i was asleep my power went off just before this event. around 4:20 am when i finally got back in bed with all the lights off, the city glow was back, so it appears that a ship was hovering over my backyard blocking out the cities glow from the lights.\r\nmy thoughts for some reason when i started searching my house i was looking for grey aliens about 3.5 feet tall. they keep coming into my mind. i have always wanted to meet aliens, but for some reason i was extremely scarred, not sure why. the light and sounds from the electrical noise cannot be explained. the source of the light and the angle that it casted on my wall emanated about 2.5 ��� 3 feet off the ground in the middle of my formal living room. i have no sources of electrical items plugged in that could have emanated the light and sound. if my treadmill had started glowing it was in the wrong location.  my treadmill works fine and i have not found anything that has signs of the electrical activity going on in my living room.\r\ni do not feel that they abducted me but, i keep having strange thoughts of seeing them and that i knew what i was looking for. i felt that they just came in my home and left. does not make any sense, i am starting to think that i am being abducted and have been the first night i saw the light, because of how out of nowhere i have a strong sense of fear for no apparent reason, like my subconscious is reacting to what has been going on to me.\r\nat various times at night about the time i go to bed i have a sudden sense of fear the hairs stand up on my neck and my back starts to tense up, like i am being watched and i have a strong feeling that i do not want them to take me. the entire night that i am trying to sleep i am almost paralized from fear. i am now scarred when i go to bed, like they are waiting for me to fall asleep, to come and get me this has been going on the following nights from 4-16- 2010 to 4-21-2010. the fear is so bad at night, i do not even want to get up at night to go the bathroom 10 feet away.  i would love to meet aliens, but not in this manner.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

object hovering in our yard. it all started when she was swinging back and forth on the swing and she noticed something in the sky off to the west. it was quite a distance away and as it began to get closer she thought possibly it was a helicopter getting ready to land in our yard but as it continued to get even closer she knew it was too small to be a helicopter. it started fom the west in an eastward direction then shifted slightly to the north and back eastward until it was over our roof and into the east side of our yard. it  suddenly remained stationary for a few seconds. she describes it as being dark, triangular shaped and thick like a rock with a metallic look to it. she said it remained for a few seconds then basically disappeared to the north. what was even more astonishing was the speed at which it departed. it was so incredibly fast that it seemed to disappear right before her eyes. immediately after her experience she came into the house and stood there with this dumbfounded look. i won't ever forget the look on her face as she was trying to tell us what she just saw, but we were oblivious as we were all laughing and arguing about something that i really don't remember at this time. she had this nervous laugh that almost seemed to be mixed with heavy breathing and panting as she was having difficulty getting any words out. and then the words came out, \" i think i saw a ufo\" that was when we all began to lower our voices and focus solely on her. i must admit sarcasm wanted to get the best of me initially following her comment but her laugh turned immediately into sobbing and she was so visibly shaken that i thought she was going to collapse. all i could do was go over to her and pull her into me to calm her. after she told us what happened we all went outside to see if we could see anything and by this time darkness was falling. we all witnessed approximately 4-5 aircraft in the night skies over st. clair county. i personally believe the aircrafts were from selfridge and maybe they tracked this strange object on radar. needless to say i probed my daughter with questions. i asked her if it had windows- no. i asked her if it was large enough to hold people- she didn't think so. i asked her exactly where the orange lights were located on the craft- she claimed that the corners were glowing dim and that she didn't see any direct bright lights. i wanted to know just how close this thing was and so i asked her if she thought a rock could possibly hit it if she threw one and she replied yes (omg). i also asked her if there was any type of noise coming from the object and unfortunately she had earphones on listening to music from her mp3 but she did turn off the music at some point during the encounter and with her earplugs still in, she still didn't hear any noise. i also want to mention that the entire object was rotating in an unusual manner- not just in an up & down fashion but sideways as well (at the same time). the bottom was flat, metallic and smooth and the top was thick and maybe domed shaped? it had some sort of pattern to it that she isn't very clear about but claims that it sort of resembles a rock cut in half. i am just amazed by the fact that it was that close!!! anyway, i still continue to question her.","distance":"20 Feet or

april 21st i was outside for a couple of minutes while at work. it was 3:30 pm. there was a clear blue sky, with some white clouds around the horizon, but it was very bright and sunny. i was looking up at the sky when i suddenly saw a white, round, short cigar shaped object moving slowly across the sky. it was in the northern direction, just above the top of a small mountain with some apartment blocks and houses on it, and slowly moving towards the top and disappeared behind it after about 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nlocation was about 59���26'n 10���37'e.\r\n\r\nfirst i thought 'hey a plane!' because there hadn't been any air traffic for days because of the volcano in iceland.\r\n\r\nfrom what i would guess is that it flew much lower then an airplane. a little bit slower too. it was a bright white tube with rounded edges. no wings, or marks or anything on it. it flew in a perfect straight line and held a very steady speed. somehow there was something really calm about it. i don't know. i really concentrated on what i saw, and heard, but it didn't make a sound. there was no sound at all! earlier today i had heard the first plane in days, and remembered that to listen for it when i saw the object, but it was completely silent. it's a very quiet neighborhood, so there wasn't much noise at all.\r\n\r\ni compared it to some birds as well, but it was too calm, the steady speed, and the straight line, no shaking or swinging.\r\n\r\ni thought of a balloon too, but a balloon would've been affected by the wind and it's direction and speed would vary.\r\n\r\ni've never seen a blimp here, and it was too small and had no propulsion of any kind as far as you could see.\r\n\r\ni would think that it's extremely unusual for me to see a ufo in the couple of minutes that

of my house on my stoop smoking a cigarette. all of a sudden i saw this thing. it was really bright, like it drew my attention to it when i wasn't even looking in that direction. it kind of appeared out of nowhere or i didn't see it come and it had a straight steady trail until it got to a certain point in the sky and then it looked as if it were just falling towards the ground. my first thought was it's a bomb (that was a dumb first impression because bombs don't light up really really bright and they don't just change their course out of no where. it was just the most possible to happen ,in my mind, at that very second), so i had an extremely panicked look on my face to the point that my friend got scared just because of the look on my face. i was telling him all about it afterward because i knew he would be one of the only people that would believe something like that. i kept saying i wish you could've seen it so i had someone else that really saw it too. then all of a sudden it came back. it was in a different location in the sky. it almost did a loop in the sky and then started to steady off on a straight path and then in the middle of the sky in my direct line of view, the u.F.O vanished into thin air. at first, i was terrified because i thought that i was about to die at any second, then after i realized that it was definitly a u.F.O, i was still kind of scared but also excited because, well, i just saw a u.F.O. i was also happy that i personally now had proof that there really are u.F.Os. i know it wasn't a satellite because it was larger, closer to earth and
