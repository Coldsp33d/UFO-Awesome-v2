when we left. we were traveling on shantz rd. near the police station when i just turned my head to look out the window and i saw this large light over the industrial park. what really caught my interest was the color and size.It was this reddish orange light that just pulsated. i was driving so i put my eyes back on the road and i asked my 10 year old daughter if she saw it. she looked over and said yes what is that. she kept and eye on it and realized it was not moving. we then went over the hill towards the winery and we looked back to try to see it again and we couldn't. it was to low to see over the hill. so we just dismissed and went on our way to kutztown. the best way i could describe this was if you could imagine a low flying air plane that was just a ball of puslating light and didn't move. thats how big it was. so i drop my daughter of in kutztown a little after 8 pm and start heading home. i get to where i turn of on 222 to shantz rd. there is a gas station right there. i pass the gas station and just look toward the terri hill water park area of 222. my heart dropped three extremly large lights reddish orange like the size of a full moon all in a perfect triangle shape. the lights spanned maybe the half the size of a football field. i couldn't believe how low and large it was. i thought to myself i need to get a picture of this my husband will never believe me. where i was on shantz rd i couldn't pull over so as soon as i got to the lucent building drive way i pulled over but the building was blocking the lights. i still can't believe what i saw. i called my husband and told him. while i was on the phone with my husband i decided to see if i could see it if i kept going further. i drove up and over the hill turned onto the road to go into the industrial park knowing this is where i saw the other light earlier. i turned onto the road and i saw nothing as if nothing ever happened. there is now way that i was the only one that saw this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

a corner apple tree i felt the presence of something. second time around in the same spot i feel a presence again so i am looking around but see nothing.  third time i am coming up to this corner looking at everything in front of me and see nothing but going under and around the tree i feel a presence again, continuing on and looking back, still i see nothing.  ok now i am disturbed, i know i am being watched but i don���t see anything.  it is my fourth pass i am determined to see what is looking at me.  i come up on the corner i feel the presence i pass under the tree and as i look back, up in the apple tree is a small creature being with dark almond shaped eyes, opaque color thin limbs.  it was kind of scrunched up in the tree just watching me, in clear view and just watching me.  when i first seen the being it was invisible, i mean i was looking thru it, i wasn���t grasping what i was seeing. i was scared.  i did not finish mowing the lawn.  i did not tell anyone as i thought certain they think me crazy.   \r\nabout a week later around 1:00 am i witnessed a mother ship hovering in the field just outside the bathroom window.  5 acres separated us and our neighbor, i could not see the neighbor���s house it was so big.  it appeared to be hovering just a few feet off the ground, round and disk like in shape with many windows.  it was close enough you could see activity in the port holes of the craft.  i turned away for just a second and the craft was gone, i didn���t see it leave. \r\nmy sense was that the being in the tree was lost or perhaps like a teenager took off and the mother ship was there to pick him/her up.  i have always been of the opinion that we are not alone and well now i know that to be true.  of course you ask the question, why me, why did this being presence it���s self to me?  i sensed the lesson for me was continue on my journey continue on my search for peace.  it was like the being and i had something in common, assuring me that there are struggles no matter who you are or where you are in the universe.  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned

and daytime resort complex,across the unlit road,to the employee housing complex,probably one-quarter mile southeast, and uphill. after leaving the pavement, i was on the steeper narrow dirt path,and had to hold an arm out to block tall weeds and shrubs. as i walked,i was looking forward and up, and i saw what i first thought was the moon,but it was moving toward the east very slowly. as i stopped and watched the object,i realized it was slowing down. i noticed a very rough surface and saw a very small piece of debris fall away at the same spot from which arose a small blue-white flicker of flame. the object was moving slow enough at this time, that the flame was not influenced by the wind or the forward motion. the object moved from approximately a 7:00 position to a 4:00 position across my field of vision.The object took maybe two to two and one half minutes to cross my field of vision. i was walking south- south- east. after the object passed over the trees and ridges to the east,i stood still, and hoped to hear it hit. i heard nothing . i then hurried the next couple of hundred yards to my apartment, and rushed in to tell my girlfriend about the funny-moving, odd-looking thing i had just seen. she pretty-much just appeared uninterested.I then went back outside to see if anyone else was able to see what i saw.The security guard was just pulling up outside by the side

not ever remember discussing the subject again with him. i asked around and only one other person admitted to me that they had seen the object.The other person was born again religious and simply shrugged it off as a manifestation of god. this incident occurred on (over?) the warm springs indian reservation.The object was easily five times the size of the sun or moon.The object was mostly dark, but was clearly visible, and had small patches of reddish-orange, and other small patches of blueish-white.The small piece of debris that sort of popped out or off was from a blue-white patch.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

just south of san clemente when i noticed a slender triangular shaped object above my car. i couldn���������t tell the size of it. it was either really high and very large or really low and not that large.  if i put my arm all the way out it was the slightly larger than my hand.  it had lights pulsating in sequence beginning from the point of the triangle (the front) down to the back and then back up to the front. when it reached the front the lights would pause for a second and then start the rotation over again.  i followed the object for a total of about 10 minutes, and was able to get a pretty good look of it. the lights on it where a light blue in color. the bottom/belly of the object appeared to be rounded. the object appeared to be a midnight blue in color but that could have been a reflection from the flashing blue lights. for about 5 minutes the object was going with traffic while zigzagging left and right over the freeway.  after a little bit, still traveling in a zigzag path, it began to speed up until it traveled out of sight.  at 9 pm my boyfriend called me. while explaining to him what i had seen,  i saw another light.  at that point i was coming up to the agricultural check point on the northbound side of i-5.  at first i thought it was an airplane. when i got closer i realized it wasn���������t moving and it was only about 100 yards above the freeway. it was a solid white light approximately the size of my thumb at arms length just floating about the freeway. as i drove past it i was able to look out the drivers side window and see nothing attached to it. it was just a single bright floating light.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional

Laredo","country":"Mexico","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My 10 year-old son and i were camping at a remote ranch in northern tamaulipas, mexico. the purpose of our visit to the ranch was archaeological explorations of indian campsites, which i have been exploring regularly since 1982. the ranch is located on the rio grande, about 5 miles northwest of the city of zapata, texas. our campsite is located on a small plateau about 1/2 mile west of the river. i have been a police officer since 1993. my background (field of study) is astronomy and archaeology. \r\n\r\nwe arrived at the ranch, the rancho san fabian (ca. 4,500 acres) late in the afternoon of april 16, 1999. we managed to get in about 1 1/2 hrs. of exploration before we had to proceed to our campsite to get set up for the night ahead. we planned to spend the entire next day exploring the myriad archaeological sites on the ranch. this ranch is very remote, and the nearest mexican city is nuevo laredo, some 40-45 miles north. in 1999 there still was no electricity on the ranch. \r\n\r\nmy archaeological field notes for the date in question (04/16/99) indicate that my son and i started gathering firewood in the area of the camp, but i left briefly to gather more a short distance from the camp. upon my arrival my son reported a close encounter with a coyote while i was gone. we started a campfire, the only light in this very dark area. the fire was started at about 8:35 p.M. my notes indicate that it was a very pleasant evening, and an owl was heard hooting in the area. \r\n\r\na few minutes after getting a roaring fire going, i noticed a bright clustering of white lights low in the southwestern skies, a few degrees above the horizon. there is a north to south trending ridge that runs about 1/2 mile west of our campsite, otherwise the view of the sky is uninhibited. the only trees in the immediate vicinity are low, thorny mesquite trees. the cluster of lights were obviously moving, but i was unsure how far away they were. the lights appeared to be getting slowly closer, and they traveled on a course that led them to a point due west of our campsite. \r\n\r\nat one point i realized the lights were getting much brighter, and i suddenly realized they were moving directly towards our position on the \r\nbarren plateau. my first thought was that the lights were from a mexican military helicopter, and they (mexican military officials) had spotted out campfire. however, i strained to hear the sound of helicopter rotors, but no sound was heard. i still believed it was a helicopter, and the object was getting much closer. i expressed concern to my son that the percieved military helicopter might attempt to land at our campsite. he became obviously distressed, and i ordered him to flee with me into the brush just east of our campsite. the area we fled to was in a gully that runs on the east edge of the plateau where our camp is located. my intent was to take cover in the darkness away from the brilliantly illuminated (by the roaring campfire) campsite. \r\n \r\nhowever, it did not take long to realize that there was no sound, and the lights, a \"v\"-shaped assemblage of five quite bright white (w/slight yellowish tint) lights appeared to be affixed to a triangular-shaped aircraft that was flying directly towards us. the point of the \"v\" was oriented in the direction the object was flying. the object traveled at an unknown height from west to east, to a point approximately 75 degrees above the west horizon (nearly overhead, but not quite). my son and i hunkered down in the brush, quite amazed at what we were seeing (and not hearing!). the object banked slowly left (north) and angled in a direction generally toward the distant city of nuevo laredo. at its closest approach the object stretched approximately 10-12 degrees in maximum width. the object then began banking slowly toward the northwest horizon and it soon disappeared from sight. it is noteworthy that the object was more difficult to see (dimmer)after its closest approach to our camp. the lights appeared to be blocked somewhat by the object itself after it began to fly away from our location. \r\n\r\nmy son and i soon returned back to our campsite, where our vehicle was parked a few yards from the campfire. we discussed what we had seen for a while, quite mystified. however, necessary chores still needed to be performed, so we attended those duties, including preparing supper and generally organizing our camp.\r\n\r\nwe kept a close eye on the sky, and i made a note that the skies were clear and very dark and transparent, and stars were clearly visible all the way down to the horizon. the m13 globular star cluster in hercules was easily visible to the unaided eye, and the m51 \"whirpool\" galaxy in ursa major was easily visible in 10x50 binoculars. i also noted that the omega centauri (globular) star cluster, low above the southern horizon, was very bright to the unaided eye and partially resolved into stars with the 10x50s. i also noted that during the evening hours my son and i observed (and heard) numerous high-flying large jets traversing the sky in a north to south direction several miles west of our campsite. this is along a well traveled route used by airliners and large freight jets. these fly at about 30,000 feet during their long journeys to southern destinations. additional notes indicate that it was a quite cool night away from the campfire, necessitating the use of light jackets. i noted that my son, jeremy, finally went to sleep in the truck at about 11:10 p.M. and i followed at about midnight.\r\n\r\nmy son was so impressed by the object we had seen that the following day while still at the ranch he made a sketch of it. however, his sketch shows a triangular-shaped object with 7-9 lights on its leading edge, whereas the actual object we saw had five lights, with one at the apex of the forward \"point,\" and two lights on the leading edge of each rearward trending \"edge.\" \r\n\r\nwe have spoken about the sighting of the strange object many times in the intervening years, but the memory of the event is still quite vivid in my mind. it is enhanced by the fact that notes about the incident were incorporated into my archaeological field journal at the time (expedition #687). \r\n\r\ni have been interested in astronomy since 1974, and have watched the sky regularly since then. i am quite familiar with the various objects in the sky, both natural and man-made. i am also familiar with most types of conventional aircraft, and this was most certainly not one of those. i am certain that it was a single craft, but don't know its origin, obviously. i would be inclined to believe that it may have been a high-tech experimental aircraft, but what troubles me is why such a craft would be operating over this remote and not very extraordinary part of tamaulipas, mexico. there is nothing of a strategic nature anywhere in the region, save the u.S./mexico border itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n

and we had just finished eating dinner at our friend b's house.  around 9:30 pm we decided to go into town for the festivities, and since there were more than a handful of us, a few of us had to jump in the back of my buddy t's truck.  we were all laying down in the bed of the truck so that we wouldn't be pulled over.  it was myself, \"k\", \"b\", and b's brother \"c\", who were in the back of the truck.  \r\n\r\nas we drove along, we were all talking loud, looking around at different things as we whizzed along wilcox rd, when suddenly i hear \"k\" yell out, \"hey, i see a f---ing ufo!!\" and i was like, \"what? you're kidding,\" and i look up into the middle of the sky directly overhead and see this strange shape that at first reminded me of an angular cloud, in a kind of boomerang shape, but a cloud that was moving, and moving quite briskly.  it immediately clicked in my mind that this was not a natural object or a natural cloud.  it moved in a fashion that is impossible for a cloud, and there was not a natural cloud in the nightsky, it was completely clear out.  as my disbelief turned to awe i continued to stare at the object as it glided over our position in complete silence, and i saw that within the cloudy substance that flowed from the front of the object to the rear, was a geometric boomerang shaped object, with sharp lines, as if drawn by a ruler, contrasting against the background.  the cloudy mist-like substance seemed to spring forth out of nothing from the front of the object, and trailed over the rest of the craft towards the rear.  and as we gazed on in amazement for what was probably at most, 10 seconds, it approached the tree filled horizon, and that coupled with our turn on the road, took it out of our view.    \r\n\r\nwe could not believe our eyes, and started cursing a myriad of profanities uttering our complete amazement at what the hell just happened, and what the hell we just saw.  \"b\" and \"c\" had looked up a bit later than \"k\" and i, and had failed to see the geometric boomerang shape within the cloudy substance, but they did see the cloudy mist, in an angular fashion, gliding across the sky in a straight line briskly.  it had absolutely no sound at all, no lights, and moved in a completely straight line, in a direction that i believe was north or northeast.  we have no idea how big it was, only that it looked extremely large.  when talking about it with \"k\" later he told me that he held his hand up to the sky afterwards, with his pinky finger and index finger extended outwards, the others tucked in, in a sort of devil's horn you might say, and he felt like the distance between the two fingers pointing outwards was a good approximation of the wingspan of the strange object in the sky.  this however, really does not solve the qustion of just how big it really was, rather it only makes the argument for it being rather large.  if it was close to us in the sky, it was still huge as all hell, and if it was even higher up in the sky, then its size is even larger, almost mind boggling large. \r\n\r\nthis story is written with all honesty and complete truth.  both \"k\" and i had always believed in the possibility of ufos, but had never seen or experienced anything like this in our lives.  after talking about it more and more, we both feel like this is an event that has changed our lives forever.  to us there is no question about it: this was a real ufo, and it was not of this earth.  there is absolutely nothing manmade out there, not the stealth bomber, or anything, that can match up to what we saw that night.  immediately the following day after seeing the object, i began to research online what sightings of ufos were out there that met the same description, and i came upon a sighting of a ufo seen over belville, texas, in september of 2009, case number 19343.  the article describing the ufo fit our description perfectly in almost every detail.  the way it was described to be moving, that at first it seemed to be a fast moving cloud, but not a cloud at all, the way it looked, and the way it glided across the sky in a straight line.  after reading this i knew that this was the exact same craft we saw, and that we were not alone in witnessing such a spectacular object. \r\n\r\ni will forever be changed by this.  let people judge me how they may, but i speak the truth.  this is what i saw, and i was not alone in seeing it.  something is out there.

patio. we normally sit out from late dusk until it is well dark.  we watch the stars and an occasional airplane that flies over. however, that night was different.\r\n     ���������about 8:30 i noticed an object directly overhead. for a second, i thought it was a low-flying plane. we quickly realized it was not a plane. this object was shaped like a triangle and had three white lights, one on each point of the triangle. it passed over us making no noise. i called for my teenage son to come out, and all of us stood in awe for the 30 to 45 seconds it took to fade away. it also made a few quick turns before continuing on its original east-to-west direction.\r\n     ���������i have witnessed some strange events in my life but never like this. . . .���������\r\n\r\n     the

otherwise noteworthy. using msn white pages, my best guess of the viewers��������� location would be on the east side of aiken, about a half mile southwest of the intersection of highways 302 and us-78.\r\n\r\n     the aiken municipal airport is located some 7 miles north of that location. \r\n\r\n     this is the first eyewitness account of something unexplainable published in this newspaper
