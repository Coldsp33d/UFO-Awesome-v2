(if you would like to see video i only have it on an analogue video tape. my digital camera would have never been able to catch sight of it.)

up,as i heard an airplane that was particularly loud. i saw at first what appeared to be a single, sphere shaped craft that seemed to be trailing the airplane. it was \"silver\" in color when i first spotted it. as i followed the sphere trailing the airplane, it suddenly stopped. i mean it just stopped moving and was perfectly still. i couldn't believe my eyes. suddenly, the sphere began to turn baby blue as if it were reflecting the sky. it wasn't an immediate change, but more like an exotic lizard--it didn't take more than a few seconds. subsequently, it then changed from blue to the most amazing green that would describe as emerald, then red. when changing colors it gave the appearance that the craft was \"wobbling\" as the craft would begin the color change at one end of the sphere and it would make its way to the other side. the best way i can describe it alternately is like a modern lighthouse that moved its light beam in a circular motion parallel to the ground, almost like an old fashioned police car siren. i was pretty much just standing in the middle of the street completely mesmerized. about 2 minutes into this i see another sphere that shot by the stationary sphere at incredible speed. i then moved my focus to the new object. it was identical to the first. in order to keep up with it i was pretty much just spinning in circles. i then see another sphere catch up with the fast moving one (#2). they flew in tandem for a few minutes or so and then suddenly reduced their respective speeds to half that of a conventional aircraft and it was at this point that i noticed the silver appearance began to fade as the crafts began to oscillate and change color, still adhering to their formation. very spooky. in all i believe that i saw 4-5 spheres--but given their intermittent high speed and hovering behavior, it is hard to say precisely how many there were in the air at that time. definitely at least 3 as at one point there were 3 craft in my field of vision. the funny thing about all of this is that during this whole experience there were still airplanes that were flying either to or from the airport nearby. the craft just seemed to effortlessly avoid the airplanes and at times they appeared to be chasing them, only to turn around and shoot off in another direction. the whole event lasted approximately 20 minutes as one by one the spheres just seemed to disappear. they didn't fly off into the horizon but just kind of vanished instead. this is the second ufo that i have seen...Both sightings within 2 years of each other. both were here in north carolina, one in greensboro and the previous one in snow camp, north carolina which is about a 45 minute drive from greensboro.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

for my nightly walking-jogging exercise. while facing south on the crest of the hill at one of the high-numbered avenues- about 44th ave., doing my stretching exercise before heading down the hill, i looked roughly southwest and saw four large, bright, flat discs forming a diamond shape (one up, one down, one left, one right), all white, with each light, in seemingly random order, flashing slowly off and on. just four lights stationary in the sky, and they appeared to be no more than 3 or 4 blocks away. i watched for a few minutes, then proceeded down hill southward to anza street, which was the next street down, walked westward, and stopped at the driveway of the house which sits at the top of the cliff. (if you're familiar with the famous cliff house at the beach in san francisco, you stand out in front of the place, look up toward the top of the hill and see a house. that's where i was. i watched from the driveway of that house.) i stayed there and watched for a few more minutes. the lights stayed in the same spot and continued their blinking. i then went back eastward to 44th ave., and continued downhill to the level of the ocean, in an attempt to get closer to where the lights seemed to be positioned (it appeared that they were hovering above the beach near the safeway). as i continued down the very steep hill, i lost sight of the lights, because the houses on my right blocked my view. when i reached the bottom of the hill, which was near the safeway grocery store-at-the-beach, the lights were gone. there were some people waiting at the bus stop near the bottom of the hill, and i thought of asking them if they had seen anything, but as i looked at them, i could immediately tell that nothing unusual was occuring, or had occured. i continued my exercise walk up and down the avenues as if nothing had happened, but i told a couple of friends about my experience. incidentally, i was not- and am not- a drug user. i was calm throughout the experience and maintained an objective attitude. i felt nothing strange or unusual. nothing like this has happened before or since. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

out for a closer look. at first i thought i was jerking the binoculars in my hands but i held them against one of the support beams of the entry way. i could not get over what i saw through the

appear on the opposite of its movement. at one time the object split apart and became two and joined back togather to form one unit. the object would not remain stable veiwed through the binoculars but just looking at it with them them object was like a star or satellite moving forward then backing up doing the same thing over and over. i watched this object for at least 2 hours. two pale white

seemed to be a very bright star.  we both commented on this \"star\" then a few minutes later we observed that the star had not only moved up and to the right but had gotten brighter.  we are aware that we can see aircraft going to the atlanta airport.  we see them all the time but this was different.  then we observed the \"star\" to move vertically and to the right, then vertically to the left while this \"star\" was doing this we also observed that it would get very dim then get very bright.  we got your binoculours and went outside because this was very odd to us and then we both observed the \"star\" to continue moving up, down, to the left and to the right and at the same time once again it would get so dim we could not see it then it would very bright!  when we first noticed the object we thought it was odd because almost every night we sit with the door open and are very aware of what stars we see every night.\r\n this was something we had never seen before.  i myself am a beleiver in ufo's and my husband is a huge sceptic.  the fact that he could not explain what we were observing really excited me.  at first we though it was a airplane but it made no sence with it moving in the manor it was moving and the brightness of this object dimming then brightining, with no clouds around to speak or see of.  we went from just laughing and courious to complete confusion and amazement. neither of us could make out a normal explanation for what this was.  finally after all of the movement and the dimming and brightness of this object it simply dissapeared.  we could no longer see it.  it dimmed and never brightened back up.  we have been outside with our binoculers ever since we first started observing it around 9:10 just trying to find this object.  we just came back inside and my husband and i felt we needed to let someone know about this.  this is very far out of our comfort zone as far as reporting this.  if this wasn't such an amazing moment, we would had not felt the need to share what we both saw tonight.  we both grew up a few miles from an airport and we both feel we know when we see an aircraft.  this was too odd the manor of which this \"star\"

see me and we went out. when we got to (edited), in laconia, we parked in the back in the separate parking lot. we turned off the car and it was totally silent. we were just sitting there and i looked up at the moon. i saw this weird black-shaped object. and then, i said to my boyfriend, \"what was that?\" he looked up at it and he said, \"if it gets any closer, we need to leave.\" i kept staring at the moon to see if it was just a plane or something. it moved back across the moon. it was huge and it looked like it was zig-zagging or changing shape. i couldn't tell. he said, \"i think it's coming closer.\" it flew so fast over the trees getting closer to where we were. it felt like it was zeroing in on us. it blocked the moon. and then, we started panicking and driving away. i thought were were going to hit the [cms/tg/pid] building. we turned left but it felt like we went off of a jump. you know that feeling? like we were on a rollercoaster? and we were in the air. i was trying to pay attention to everything that was going on but it felt like i couldn't. when i looked up, everything was black. the smell was not nice but it was like something you could stand. it was an odor i've never smelled before. i heard absolutely nothing. it was silent. i felt immobilized like i had no control over what i was doing or over my body. i could see nothing. it was like opening your eyes in a pitch black room.\r\n\r\ni felt really nervous and scared. i don't remember crying or screaming. i held on to the center console because i felt like i was lifted. i was holding on so tight that my thumbprint is imprinted on the center console. and then, when i finally realized what was happening, i was so close to the windshield that my body was going forward with my arms behind me. everything was black. i heard a loud noise like a horn. once. and then, the car just dropped. i hit my eye on the dashboard and the airbags came out. i couldn't believe what had just happened. i held my face and i looked over at my boyfriend. i saw that his left arm had blood. i said, \"are you ok?\" i looked at the windshield and it was cracked, totally, but only on the passenger side. i could see d but i couldn't see anything outside. the only thing that made the car drop was the sound of the loud horn. when the car dropped, there was a loud boom. after that, we just drove so fast out of there. the smell went away after we drove away. and i started crying. and i said, \"what the hell just happened?\" my boyfriend said, \"i don't know, i don't know.\" i didn't feel like they were following us.\r\n\r\nwhen we got home, my mom said that she could hear me from the outside while i was freaking out. i couldn't stop crying. my mom said, \"calm down and tell me what happened.\" i said, \"you're never going to believe me.\" \"is it my car?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nand i said, \"let me explain,\" because i felt that if i didn't explain it fast enough, it was just going to go away from my mind. at about 12:15 am, a cop arrived. i told him what had happened while i was sitting down at the dinner table. my boyfriend was sitting next to me. it was then that i noticed that there was no more blood on his arm or his clothing. the cop didn't believe me at first until he finished looking at the car. he told my mom that there was no reason for the air bags to come out because nothing else on the car was damaged. he didn't check underneath the car but we found out later that the underside was totaled. the cop said that he was going to the place where we had been.\r\n\r\ni just felt thankful that we'd gotten out of there. but i couldn't stop crying for more than 2 hours afterwards. my mom said, \"you should go take a shower and get the airbag dust off of you.\" but i didn't want to be alone at all. i felt lucky. and there were no scratches or anything anywhere on my body.\r\n\r\nthe first night, my dream was that i was a little girl, maybe 6 or 7 years old, in an elementary school classroom. i was looking at myself as a little girl. and then it was like the teacher called me up and i couldn't talk or say anything - but everybody else seemed to say something for me. like everything i wanted to say, everybody else was saying it except for me. they were saying exactly what i wanted say. i have never had a dream like this before. where i am a little girl and see anything about the past. i did not feel right at all.\r\n\r\ni am better now. i still worry about seeing this thing again and i pay attention to the sky at night. i really don't go out at night, anymore, because i'm scared.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd witness account:\r\n\r\nmy name is d. i am sixteen years old and i live in new hampshire. last saturday night i went out with my girlfriend, who lives in laconia, when we had the following experience: i was with her around 11. we wanted to take her mom's car because it was nicer and we wanted to go look at the stars. we went to (edited) at the back parking lot in laconia. there were 8 cars already there when we arrived. little by little, the cars started leaving one by one. we were the last car in the parking lot. then the lights of the parking lot and the lights of the houses around us and the lights of the houses down the street started to go out one by one. then my girlfriend noticed something blocking the moon and asked, \"what was that?\" i knew it wasn't a cloud because it moved back against the wind and blocked the moon again. i don't know how to explain this but it turns into a ball when it wants to slow down and move around quickly and when it wants to go fast, straight, it turns into a flat plate with maze box-shaped lined lights. these were on all the time. the colors were dim yellowish white and did not change. i cannot tell whether these were part of the bottom or not. it flipped a lot. i did not know which side was right or up on it. it was doing this over the trees across the street from the parking lot. it suddenly crossed the street towards our car. its size was as big as 14 houses. it was really quiet. that's when we had to leave. but i did not have time to turn on the headlights.\r\n\r\nwe put the clutch in to start the car and jammed it into 1st and floored it. the front end got picked up and the car could not move. we steered left and right but the car just kept on going up into the air. my girlfriend was scared and she had boogers coming out of her nose while i was cursing. the car was going up and the back wheels were off of the ground. then i looked out of my window and saw that the parking lot park lines started getting smaller. both our windows were down this whole time. the front windshield started to crack and shake and the cracks spread from the passenger side to the driver's side. it popped outwards like it was pulled out.\r\n\r\nsomething yanked my wrist. not aggressively. and the whole time in my head something was telling me \"don't panic,\" or \"don't be scared.\" and it wasn't in english in my head but i got the meaning. it wasn't a language. i don't know how to explain it. and on my girlfriend's side, it had her half-way out of the window. her butt was off of her seat, maybe one-and-a-half or two feet? and the car was pointed almost completely straight up at the stars. yet i saw no stars.\r\n\r\nevery time i tried looking at it, in front, a white film went over my eyes. it was kind of like staring at the sun with your eyelids closed. i could not hear her screaming but i know that she was screaming. my ears felt like they kept on popping from the altitude. i couldn't hear. the smell was like unbearable, like you want to close your nose. it was spicy, like pepper-sprayish, and clean at the same time. it was a smell that you could stand but you would close your nostrils because it still smells bad. when i tried to fight and get my wrist back in the car, that's when the grip got stronger. it was pulling my left arm up out of the window. there was no pain but it was strong. i was trying to fight off the grip on my wrist. my tongue was numb. the horn beeped by accident and the grip got a little loose. it beeped again in the struggle and my arm flopped down in the car. my girlfriend also fell back in her seat and we realized we were still up in the air. ! it took 2 seconds for the car to drop. when we dropped, the air bags came out. we floored it as fast as we could through the town. it was almost a straightaway to go to my girlfriend's house with very few turns to take. during this time, both of us couldn't stop crying. we arrived at her house and her mom asked, \"what happened?\" all this took place from 11pm to 12:30 am. it seemed like we were in the air for 10 minutes and it felt like it was forever. her mom called the police, and a policeman came.\r\n\r\nthe policeman did not believe us when we first told him what had happened until he looked at the vehicle. there were no scratches or dents or anything. he said that there was no reason for this to have happened to the car when there are no dents or scratches and no reason for the windshield to shatter and pop out the way it did. he had no explanation for why the windshield popped outwards. also, when i went to open my cell phone in front of the policemen, i got shocked by it.\r\n\r\non monday, i went to my doctor to get a whole physical to make sure i was ok. my wrist had a puncture wound while my forearm has a cut that is semi-circular and there's blood on it. i do remember that when i first looked at my arm after i got it back in the car, it was red with blood. but by the time we got to my girlfriend's house, there was no blood anywhere. on the center consul of the car, there is an imprint of her hand. i don't quite understand what the policeman said but it was something about the skin of her hand leaving an impression.\r\n\r\nnow, i don't like to feel bumps in the car, or feel anything that trembles like a boombox. i don't want to be out in dark areas at night. i also don't like to walk out to my mom's car, anymore, outside.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

boyfriend was leaving my house, then he called me on the cell phone and said to come out side. i went out and he pointed to the sky. there was all these roundish objects. they were lit up kind of orange and it seemed something was spinning around it. the color changed or flashed in the middle of it (blue/white). two of them stayed the left and got really close together and separated again. they darted up and to the side and came together again. coincidentally there was what looked like a falling star that came flying down and disappeared. one was moving independently. 4 of them that were to the right started making formations. they made a triangular formation and held position. then they separated and took off in different directions. they came together again in a straight line formation. they separated again and came together in a circular formation then separated in different directions. they disappeared behind the clouds in the sky going up. we could barely see them through the clouds for a little while. then one came back down through the clouds and held it's position. again, there was no noise at all coming from any of these objects. we watched it and it started moving again up and over the direction of what looked like the 405 freeway. past carnegie middle school. i live in carson california and i am not sure how far these objects were from my city. they were very clear. and big. the neighbor looked out his window at us and i pointed to the sky and he looked and came outside. his wife watched from her porch. the neighbor watched with us for about 10 minutes. the object went up into the sky higher and higher up until it disappeared. we walked back towards the house and we were talking about how amazing it was then 1 of them came back but it stayed pretty high up in the sky it traveled straight then it appeared to slow way down. from my viewpoint it looked like it almost stopped. then it went straight up slowly though the clouds it went higher until it disappeared. at 12:10 i called the carson sheriff station and reported it. i tried to record it on the ipod nano but it couldn't from that distance. i have about 35 minutes of audio while trying to record it in the sky it 1 was about 10 minutes another was 20 minutes and a couple were about 2 minutes long. each time i tried to record it, it could not pick up the objects. they were very big. they were about the size of the moon when the moon is out. one time one of the objects moved really fast all the way across the sky. there were 2 small planes that had past by towards the end of the sighting. the planes did make noise. and they had the typical light that airplanes have and traveled in a flight pattern that planes fly.  these objects were bigger than those planes and they were farther away. these planes had to have seen something.  one was going one direction. then later the other was going a different direction. again, the planes did make noise. the objects did not make any noise at all. it was very quiet. i could hear the insects chirping. this went on for so long, that someone else besides us and the neighbors, had to have seen it. the formations that they made were incredible. it was also incredible how close they would get to each other and then hold their positions. we were not scared. we were just really amazed and excited. i don't think they were here to harm anyone or anything. please, if anyone else saw this, can you come forward and let us know what you saw. i was viewing this from carson california 90745 usa (la county area) this event lasted about an hour.  thank you","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

all started when my neighbor put up infrared led's\r\n to stop my cameras. this didnt work so some how, don't ask me how but he was able to infiltrate the city street light's. since that date 021310\r\ni started noticing strange events on camera.What appeared to be black spheres of energy started to do unexplained movements and sounds.This would go on every few days,and when i noticed something different i made sure to have it filmed.So this is it people!! i have watched and learned studied there movements, patterns,functions,and how they work together as separate \r\nforces, with a special function.Like bee's or insects, looking and gathering\r\n useful energy.Processing it, then taking it back to the triangle in the sky.\r\nwhen to day's work is done all six types combine and form one side of the triangle.This in turn powers the main craft, to open the\" gate\" for inter dimension transfer.Other craft and forces are able to come and go when it's\r\nopen.I knew from the very first sighting, that this must be recorded every second that i saw something,so i could study it more closely. since this started, i have lost most friends and people that respected me. i cant talk about making contact, or waking up to find three pages of formulas for time travel. i have not seen them in two weeks now i don't know if they are done with me, or just moved on.What i have will shock most of you this is to be taken very serious most people will not watch more then two videos.I want help with tracing pulsarts and quasarts, so we can collect the useful anti-matter.Then we could open a sub-parallel black hole, all the benefits \r\nof a black hole but no side effects. how cool, we are about one hundred years behind, so we need to take this more serious.Contact is real not like the movies always but through telepathic mind sensory communication.If you you tube \"footage of a real black hole\" by mr.Wildrhino, you will see just the first part of the film it actually seems to collapse or die.You will see in the end how it looks like a nuclear explosion in the sky,but its sub parallel\r\nso we don't know it's there.My i.R camera can see it is the only way i could witness this.Any way i have a months worth of footage that blows me away every time i watch it. show me if people are ready for this and i'll try to upload more,i don't know why it's so hard to upload but i get kicked off most times. i try ,the truth is really out there.\r\ni am no body special(before) i would have never believe this stuff, we need to think on a simpler level with everything under are noses. ask me any thing you want about clan(bh021310).I have all i have spoken in a very well documented film and photo format. want to see actual picture's of what people are trying to draw? when i started to read the stories of eye witness account's. i knew i cannot keep silent no more. what ever is going to happen to me has been planned well long before i knew about it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:54:17","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22874,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5893596,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04172010-0010","longitude":-122.3847754,"occurred":1266110040000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Bullet,

going over. this was nothing like either. i also knew that volcanic ash covered the uk and it was a no fly zone. then the light started heading upwards and got fainter and then it stopped dead at which point i ran to get my partner to see. the light then moved slowly and stopped again then it started to flicker and was gone as if heading upwards. when it had gone i looked back to the east and there was another light moving exactly the same as the first and did exactly the same disappearing in the same place. i have to admit to being a non believer but i was exhilerated by the sight and as i said i am very used to police helicopters and planes going past but never have they been silent or stopped dead in the air as i saw tonight. at the moment i saw the lights there were no flights due
