that. nor could it be a light projection from the earth to sky. it was located in the upper southwest quadrent. it remained stationary for over 15 minutes. i returned to the house, but came out an hour later. it was still there. this time i noticed an aircraft flying below it and could compare sizes somewhat. the triangular object was much larger, perhaps 50 times larger. i watached for another 15 minutes. the object remained stationary. an hour later i returned to look but it was gone. i hoped the triangular object was being viewed by the aircraft and that i might read about it in the

on the american side , somewhere over the pensilvania -ohio corridor . i'm sure someone there must have seen it as it was huge ! the size of the ball/flush light seemed to be as big as a moon . the

no idea of what it could have been . while looking at this i felt some pressure at the temples but i think it was due to my trying to keep up with it as to not losing it from my view , plus it was in

the constellation of orion when i heard a brief ���screech��� sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which i was viewing. thinking it was an owl i quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  at first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  it was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. it was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that i could hear.   as it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  it was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. there was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions had a very faint glowing quality to them.  as it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  it looked completely flat like it was a projection.  it began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. the total event lasted around 8 seconds.\r\ni have my master���s degree in physics and teach college level physics as a career.  i am also involved in astronomy.  i am about 20 minutes drive from a naval base and do hear and see military aircraft from time to time. though it is possible that i was seeing a ���secret aircraft���, i am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  i would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though i could be way off.   once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. the measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  it all happened very fast and was short in duration, making it difficult to be definite on measurements.  all in all, i saw a craft without doubt and i am perplexed by what i have seen.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile,

meteor or space junk or satellite or anything else like that. \r\ni have been seeing this craft for about 5-6 years now, here in wisconsin. it appears as a bright, white ball of light, and sometimes, a lot of times, it will fade out gradually and disappear completely, and then re-appear, sometimes getting larger in size. it basically sits in one spot, just \"hanging\" there in the air, moving slowly up and down, left and right, around and around, sometimes fast. it always seems pretty close. a lot closer than stars or airplanes. \r\nsometimes, right when you look at it, it will disappear, as if it knows your watching it and/or is playing around.\r\nit does not have any other lights on it, it is just one big ball of light. it hovers above the woods sometimes and sometimes in the fields, or the horizon. i live in the country, outside of platteville. i will see it very low on the horizon sometimes when the sun is going down. i have seen it during the middle of the day a couple times.\r\nmy mother and little sister are the only other persons that i know of that have seen it. i'm sure other people around platteville have seen it, because of how often i see it, but i'm not sure.\r\nshe(they) has only just seen it recently though(mom,sis), january 30th, of 2010. we were on our way to shullsburg, wisconsin, taking my younger sister to a friends house. it was around 4pm, so it was still light out. i'm not sure which direction we were driving, but as always i was just kind of eyeing the skies and spotted it and pointed it out to her. i have told her about it before, and she has never doubted me but is the type to have to see something to believe it, and she couldn't explain it herself.  \r\n\r\nwe pretty much observed the object the whole time on the way to shullsburg, with it sometimes disappearing for a while. on our way back to platteville we only noticed it peeping out a few times until we got close, then it appeared, it was near our airport, and i noticed a plane or jet flying up towards it, climbing higher and starting to go faster and closer to it. me and my mom were both observing this as we were coming into platteville. when the jet/plane got right to it, the craft disappeared completely. the jet/plane then slowed down and descended, right then the craft re-appeared in the same spot. \r\nwe were both pretty stunned by this, and i was very excited because i've always heard of this type of sighting, when a jet or plane chases a ufo but have never seen it until now. \r\nthe ufo i see though, i have not really heard any similar type of ufo craft. not as bright and close, and fading away and re-appearing. i see it very often. what made me first notice the craft, 5-6 years ago, would just have been me watching the skies, as i have always had an affinity for ufo's. when i see the craft i don't feel frightened or any negative effects, they aren't here to do any harm, i do not believe. \r\nthe photo's i have included are of the craft. \r\nthis is what happened when i photographed it. \r\ni cannot explain it, it's not like this before or after i take the photo or when i'm looking through the lens, it's strange and i don't

gray flying object. was almost a perfect ���������v��������� shape with couple circular light under each wing! \r\n\r\nthe material/skin or color of the object was kind of translucent not transparent like camouflaging with the dark background of the sky and the color was a dark dimness gray, the lights were a circular shape white/gray very, soft, faint color, not flashy and the intensity was very dim and consistent.\r\n\r\nthe flying object was moving from east to west going towards the ocean almost parallel to the santa monica bld. and was flying at mid altitude at slow and consistent speed just cruising, no noises, no vibrations, and no changes in the brightness of its lights or the shape of the object. i observed it for i would say a minute and half or two the most, then slowly vanish, and disappear in the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\ni don���������t know how to explain how and what i feel with this experience, besides to be thrill and somewhat perplex for what i witness, i just know that was very real and i don���������t know if anyone have seeing something similar but i would be more that happy to take a polygram test to validate my story. this is probably the most profound experience of my life, very real, very fascinating, a lifetime occurrence for sure.

my husband and i saw a large bright white light hovering about 150 feet from the ground water level over johnson's bay to the west of our house.  on the first night, it was raining when this happened.  on the second night it was cloudy, no stars, no moon...And on the third night, there was a full moon off to the east.  \r\n\r\nwe ruled out that it was an airplane or helicopter because it was too low, hovered far to long, and was totally silent.  on the first night, we watched it for about half an hour and it disappeard in a poof!  on the second night, we watched it for an hour, and then went to bed before it disappeared.  on the third night, we did the same.  \r\n\r\non the morning of march 29th, fire chief emilio rodriguez called us about 8:30 a.M. to see if we had been on-line to look at the weather cam.  he was excited and said, \"the camera caught on film last night this large white light shaped in somewhat of a flattened ball that dropped straight down from the sky and then hovered in the same spot without moving until finally after hours, it just seemed to drop to the ground and disappear.\"\r\n\r\nwe were both curious and skeptical at first, but also at the same time had an erier feeling that this was something very out of the normal. we have no major air bases near us, no military and no industry that would be experimenting with something like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

southeast portion of the stae.\r\n i was a few miles outside of wrens georgia when i noticed 2 bright lights off to my right moving in the same direction as i was driving. at first i thought it was just a low flying military cargo plane, because i see those from time to time. . the lights faded out. that got my attention. and it was then i realized i hadnt heard the plane like i normally do. \r\na few miles down the road, i saw the lights again. this time stationary over a really large field. i pulled over and got out of my van to watch them. they seemed orangish at times, and at other times they seemed white.\r\nwhatever it was , it was completly silent. no sound at all. and i had cut off the van so i could hear it if it had made noises.\r\ni called my mother on my cell phone because she was the only one i knew that would be up that late during the week. right as she answered, two more lights appeared. one to the left of the original two, and one to the right. none of them moved. i know that area really well, i travel that road twice a night, coming and going. there is nothing there to make those lights. after watching for a few minutes, they just faded out. \r\nso i got back in the van and continued on my route while on the phone.\r\n  as i got closer and closer to wrens, the lights would sometimes reappear, sometimes only one. sometimes two. right outside of town, i saw one of the lights directly over the town of wrens. it faded , then reappeared. then faded again. i lost track of it while in town, the city lights made it impossible to see the sky properly.\r\nas i got to the other side of town, i begin looking for the object/ or objects again. right outside of town, as i was looking up, way up high in the sky i saw between 10-12 lights appear together in a cluster, not like in the field where they were seperated by a lot of space. they appeared , flashed and were gone. this was at a really high altitude, not like over the field. \r\nit was a really dark night, and i never saw an outline of anything. just the lights. but i do know this wasnt an airplane or helicopter. no sound. it cetainly wasnt a planet. ive been driving at night for 9 years. i know what stars and planets look like in the night sky. this was not those.\r\nit certainly wasnt a radio tower or anything like that either. since that night ive stopped in the area where i puleed over , and there isnt anything that causes lights in or near that field. \r\ni honestly have tried to come up with a rational explaination for it, but i cant.

lights washed out all but the brighter stars and planets.I work outside at night providing security and am able to observe the night sky.I am good at spoting satelites in the early morn9ing hours most nights.I also get to see some great shooting stars,airliners,small planes and helocopters  and even sometimes large dark bats and lighter and higher,birds heading north west to i assume the marshes or ocean.\r\ni am able to tell the difference between these objects and except for the bats and birds i usually can tell right away what i'm seeing,be it a satelite or high up airliner.\r\non the night of 4-08-2010 i was watching the sky where i had ealier seen a very good shooting star(southeast at about 30 degrees off the horizon).I noticed movement directly above me moving northwest very fast,as i looked up i saw a flash of movement go from about my 11 o'clock to about 3 o'clock or about 120 degrees.The object appeared to be lower than small airplanes,or about 1000 ft up.The object was very fast,made no sound,had orange dull lights at it's front and back and the section between the lights appeared as a shadow against the nights sky,but could be made out ,much as a black bat that flies above in the darkness can be seen black on black,but moving.\r\nthe object must have been at least 100 ft long and possibly larger if it was more than my guess of 1/4 mile above me.\r\nit flew from above my left shoulder when firmly spotted to my left horizon which was a five story building at my 3 o'clock,heading northwest towards santa cruz area as the crow flies.\r\ni was very startled and right away became highly scared.I checked my cell phone to bring some reality to what had just happened and it showed 3:14 a.M.\r\nmoments later i spoke to supervisor during a routine check and he was supportive but a little unsure about my need to tell such a unbelievable tale to someone.If somthing like my experience happens unexpectedly i think it is normal to want to tell someone who walks by.In hindsight it probably is better thought about beofre telling just anyone,but ,oh well!\r\ni stayed at my post and now was hyper alert and keenly watching the sky .At about 3:50 a.M i observed a white light \"turn on\" in the due sout section of sky from me.The light was again a 1/4 -1/2 mile high or about 30 degrees.The object was about two miles due south of me and aproxamitly over the town of sprekles california.I was so startled to see a second object that i became almost in shock and did not check my cell phone for the exact time.The object appeared just as bright white star does,it did not blink or pulse,made no sound that i could hear and took straight off in the direction of the first sighting(northwest).The object moved in a straight path with no increase or change in speed.The speed appeared steady and much,much faster than the small planes that fly at that hiegth some nights, but not a streak like a shooting star.\r\nat 4:06 a.M ,very alert now,i observed a third object \"turn on in almost the same area of sky as the second object(bright white light)it may have been another mile south at most,copied the first light in every aspect,and wisked away heading northwest,also amking no apparent noise.\r\ni am reporting this in hopes of bringing some details into record of a very unusual sighting i observed in the monterey bay area.\r\nthank you for taking

ran out and directly above house at an estimated 1000 or so feet up, alot lower than any other planes, was a huge diamond shaped craft. it had a bright white light at all four tips of its diamond shape, but also the craft itself could also be seen as a solid goldish green diamond.\r\n it traveled at a steady speed, est 15-20mph, and was traveling ne 60. on approach it made a very quiet low rumbling sound and as it flew above and then the further it got, the more high pitched and strange sounding it became.\r\n as it was directly above the house i had a few short seconds to run back indoors yelling for my girlfriend to come out quick quick quick, as i have seen this same thing about three years ago flying almost the exact same direction but lower, and was believed by her at the time, but with skepticism. this time as i awoke her from a deep sleep she did get to see it, as it was traveling so slow. so now i at least have a witness to it, yet it all happened in a minute or less and i must've wasted 20 seconds of that when i first was looking at it in amazement, for this time i could clearly make out and see the exact shape of it, but had no time for a camera. it was not \"bat\" or wing shaped like a b2 spirit bomber, this was a oblong diamond shape. a little bit more enlongated in the front and rear than the sides. the white lights were not blinking on each of the tips, and were very bright and large. there may have been a fifth light but i cannot remember the color of it, none were blinking.\r\n as it traveled further away, the solid shape of the body of it started to disappear. when it was directly overhead it appeared a pale green and then a translucent goldish color. as it disappeared on the treeline about 500 yards away, all that was visible were the corner lights.\r\n when it was directly above and flying overhead it did make a sound. it was a high pitched hissing whining sound, like a turbocharger without the engine. the further it got the more high pitched it became. it was low enouugh that if it were a jet or conventional plane of some sort, this late at night hte whole neighborhood would have awoken. just happened to be directly above my house, yet again. but this time i saw the shape. it was amazing.\r\n after my girlfriend calmed down from being angry for waking her up, she then thought it was pretty cool to see too, and says \"you should have gotten the camera\". now she believes i was telling the truth 3 years ago as well.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

and just standing around enjoying the nice day. i was already looking at the sky when i saw whatever it is that i saw. its weird how it flew though, because when something is flying for example an airplane you can follow it across the sky and see how its following the circular motion around the earth through the sky. but, this thing was almost like it just cut through the atmosphere. just through a little chunk.  i have never seen anything that size it must have been gigantic! if i were to hold a 50 cent american coin at half arms length up to the sky it was about that big. i cant really explain how fast it went it was really weird because it got really quiet right before i saw it than it was almost like it just showed up and sat there for a second than it just zoomed off. but there were no tracers or cuts in the sky that i noticed. it was like a off shaped 3d triangle and the color of it was a mango-yellow   with a very light hint of light blue at the front tip.. i'm not the only one that saw it three other of my friends saw it too. my girl friend saw it as the same color. and the two guys i was with saw it as a greenish blue colors. i didn't really know what to think because i want the only one that saw it i thought it was very cool to see something so unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(with the video its the image 3m 26s in. it kindof looked like that but had horizontal yellow lines in it)\r\n\r\nlink http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=6jel4fr4hre","distance":"Over One

anyway, i came back in and went to close the curtains in my front room when i noticed a bright white light just above the cellphone towers in north spokane valley. it didn't move and was extremely bright white (like a roman candle but no tail and it didn't drop), and then i saw what looked like a helicopter with red lights approach from the south and get close to the light, and abruptly flew away. about the same time that the helicopter left, the green/red/white \"star\" to the southwest looked as if it got a lot closer and became very bright. once the helicopter lights disappeared completely, the \"star\" reverted to its original position. the bright light then dropped closer to the cellphone tower's height. approximately 10 min later, the bright white light disappeared behind the cellphone tower hill altogether. \r\n\r\ni still don't know what the heck is going on with these \"stars\" but it's becoming more frequent of late. not to mention the two unexplained \"brush fires\" since last summer (2009) on the southeastern hills near mica peak that no one seems to notice or give news time to.\r\n\r\nand i don't think they are coming because they are already here.
