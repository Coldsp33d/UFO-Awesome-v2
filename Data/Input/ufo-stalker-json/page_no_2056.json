late at a bar in huntington beach for a friends concert. i had dropped them off and continued north on my normal route home the streets were empty and i remember getting that feeling of anxiety or like when the hairs on your arms and back of your neck stand up, like something is about to take place that you would rather not have happen. i remember feeling tense because i was running into every red light although no one was on the road and i couldn't help but feel the sensation that like i was running from something or like as if i was being watched or chased. i remember feeling a small sense of relief every time i would pass another motorist or local seven-eleven, i even stopped to buy a pack of cigarettes although i had quit the month before i think i just needed the reassurance of the cash tender to make me snap out of whatever i was feeling but when i got back into my car i felt it again like an aura was surrounding me in my car. as i continued northbound i lit a cigarette at one stop sign when i saw the first flash, it was as though someone had taken a photo of the street from above, i initially shrugged it off as i was too focused on getting home. there was one more flash that seemed to be 20-30 feet ahead of my vehicle, thats when i looked up and saw what appeared like an arrow tip formation of lights changing colors, it looked as if it was traveling in the same direction as i as the tip of the arrow was pointing in my direction. at first i believed it to be a commercial aircraft or jetliner as we have many airplane traffic by john wayne airport so i tried to ignore it but i remember that the colors kept pulsating like a heart beat so i continued to follow it through my windshield. the formation was composed of perhaps 9-12 lights all at different variations of brightness, the tip was a crimson-red that pulsed to a tangerine-orange, the two rear lights were purple and would change to a light blue, and in between there were white and yellow dimly flickering lights. on this particular night i remember that the moon was not out and the sky was quite dark so i couldn't make out any solid structure they could have been attached to. i was still driving behind it waiting to see if it would fly further away or reveal a flight pattern but it would not move forward nor fall back, it was as though it was hovering at the same speed that i was traveling, and that is when i got the feeling of anxiety again except this time i felt like i was being watched. it would stay with me for about 4-5 miles and finally the leading light started to fall behind, still throbbing the same crimson pattern, it was as though it was changing formation. the white and yellow flickering lights were gone by now and the arrow was now pointing the opposite direction but continued before my vehicle until it began to travel in that direction. these lights were following me for approximately 10 minutes before they past over me, disappearing to my rear. i didn't look back or see exactly where they dissipated but i remember a terrible head ache, in fact when i finally got home and got out of my car i remember vomiting because my head hurt so bad. i wanted sleep really bad, my eyes felt like they were shutting and i couldn't control them thats when my girlfriend came to the door and found me laying in my own vomit, she asked if i was drunk but i explained to her that i had been sober for the later part of the night. i don't remember exactly what time i had arrived home but i saw the clock as i was explaining the incident to my girlfriend and the time was almost four, i remember thinking how could a twenty minute drive from my buddies house to mine prolong to an hour and a half. my girlfriend still doesn't know how long i was laying out on the front porch. this event sticks out in my memory because of the strong emotional feelings of anxiety and helplessness. i have only shared this experience with a select few including my girlfriend and they all say i should seek other witnesses to this event but i have yet to find any.","distance":"101-500

airplane and it had only an orange glow.  \r\n\r\nwe live about 20 miles from the airport and we see planes on approach all the time (but we can hear them too.)  the light (object) was traveling what seemed to be the same flight path, at the same height and speed as an airplane on approach.  however, as it got closer, i couldn't see any of the other (blinky) lights that normally are evident on any aircraft.\r\n\r\nas it got closer, it seemed to be higher than airplanes would normally be over our house, and it was silent!  i quickly asked my grilfriend to come outside and see it.  at that time it was directly over head and we both agreed that it was no airplane.\r\n\r\ni observed the obeject as it passed over head and continued to the east. normally, with planes (no matter how high they are) as well as with satellites  they travel from west to east over our house and disappear over the horizon.  in this case, the object continued eastward but seemed to climb in altitude. it went higher and higher until it was too high to see any more.\r\n\r\ni have contemplated, this event for over three weeks. i have obsevered many airplanes since the event and cannot figure out what it was that we saw that night.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

that looked like it might shower soon. i was watching a twin propeller airplane that was very loud and not flying very high go across the sky heading in a northwestern direction. \r\n  as the plane was flying out of the area, a small black object caught my eye to the southeast of the plane, maybe a couple of miles back from the plane's position. the object seemed to emerge from the dark cloud formation over the area. i thought it was a bird that had flown very high because it was not making any noise like the plane or any flying object i have watched usually makes. it was heading in a northern direction, slightly different than the course the plane had taken. when i judged that the object was moving faster than the plane had been moving and was not a bird, i stopped walking and stared at it fly across the sky. the object's flight was so gracefully quick and smooth as it flew. it moved completely different than the plane had moved and with no noise emanating from an engine or propulsion that i could notice. i did not see any kind of exhaust trail and the sky was not in a condition to make contrails very easily. i watched the silent, black sphere-like object smoothly and quickly make its way across the sky, actually passing adjacently behind the same path that the plane had taken, which i could still hear and see as it flew further away. the black sphere-like object did not reflect any light as it flew overhead, nor did it have any kind of running lights on its surface that i could see. i walked along the sidewalk trying to follow the object and keep it in my line of sight. the object then gracefully arced into a lower trajectory, still heading in northern direction and i lost it as it dipped below a tree line that was across the street and went out of my view.\r\n  i have no idea what i saw flying overhead, but i know that it was not a bird or an airplane or a jet or helicopter. i was puzzled by the experience and after i lost sight of the object, i was amazed at what i had witnessed. it was only after a couple of minutes at staring at the sky and trying to find the object again that i decided to phone my wife and tell her what i saw. i am still a bit awestruck at witnessing the ufo, and as much as i am skeptical about what i think i saw, i am inclined to believe that it was not a man-made flying object. i was so captivated and amazed at what i saw, and it happened so fast, that it did not occur to me to try and take a picture of it with my phone until after i was speaking with my wife on the phone.","distance":"Over One

believe it was april 2nd, 8:30ish pm, me, and a bunch of friends(4 if memory serves.) were playing spot-light tag in a lightly wooded/prarie grass type area behind my neighborhood that we called \"the weeds\". \r\nwe spotted a lumunous globe approx. 5ft. in diameter stream from out of the western sky until it was above a tree line the bordered a corn field ajacent to our position. we were in a very gentle rolling valley. \"the weeds\" making up the southern slope, & the cornfield making up the northern one. we were about 3/4 the way down our side of this valley playing when we all just kinda became aware of this thing kinda all at once. i don't remember like anybody yelling, \"hey!!! look at that!!!\"\r\ni just remember we all seemed to look and see this thing all together.\r\n   anyhow. it flew from the west until it was directly accross from us at the top of the cornfield above this tree line. it's speed of movement can only be disribed as, \"as fast as you could zip the beam of a flashlight across a wall.\" very fast!!!\r\n   it was, as i said, approx. 5ft in diameter. it glowed a soft turquoise blue. and it made zero noise. this part i'm kinda fuzzy on. it either turn orange, & then desended directly into the tree line! or it desended directly into the tree line & then turned orange. i can't remember which. either way, the only thing we've got that could desend like that? are helicopters. which the rotors would have been torn to pieces in the trees. or a harrier jump jet. which makes all kinds of noise. this object/craft was entirely silent! while on the ground it was orange. \r\nit stayed there for what seemed like maybe a minute, or two. \r\nwhile there it pulsed in a slowed ebbing constant rythmn. \r\nit then change colors back to the blue. i believe before returning back to the sky to it's old altitude.(no more than 150ft. it seemed like) & zipped directly back the way it came, every bit as fast as it had appeared. \r\n   i don't believe any of us experienced \"lost time\". none of us were afraid either during, or directly following the event.\r\n   a very interesting sidebar! it left an indentation where it landed approx. 5ft. in diameter, & 3ft. or so deep. stupidly, we played in this indentation! made it our fort! it was not a \"crater\". no burn/scorch marks. more like the dirt had just been removed. \r\n   \r\nsidebar #2: \r\nseperate from this event, my best friend told me years(3 or 4) after this that he'd seen a saucer above his house(across and a door down from my house.) when we were like 7, or 8.  the above event happened when we were approx. 10/11. he said he'd seen these lights through the curtains in their living roomwhen he gotten up to go to the bathroom, he looked out, and saw this craft floating above the street light at the end of his driveway. he ran to the front door to get a better look, only to not see it. he went outside to fine that it had moved above his house! he said he paniced, & run back in to his bed. he also said he'd had \"nightmares\" about them coming back to get him for year afterwards. it should also be noted that there was a strange blacken circle on the street directly in front of the very light he'd stated the craft was hovering over for years while we were growing up. \r\n   now the part that makes my skin go creepy. as a teen years after friend #1 had told me of his experience?(now age 15/16) my other friend and i were talking late one night. out of the blue, with no prompting,or mention from me, he brings up that he too had seen the craft that friend #1 had seen! apparently at the same time, on the same night! friend #2 stated he too had gotten up to go to the bathroom, and saw lights coming through his bathroom window. which faces friend #1's house. he then run to his kitchen, where he said he looked through these luever/shutter things they had on the inside of the kitchen windows. he told me he saw basically the same craft that friend #1 had described. a saucer with multi-colored strobing/flashing lights. friend #2 said he too paniced, & run back his bed. \r\n   so i had two seperate people, that i trust, tell me the same story from each of their own pov's, but they tell me this years apart! independent of each other. with the second not knowing what the first had told me until after he'd told his side of the story!\r\n   i still know both these gentlemen. but they have families, and i seriously doubt that they'd be willing to step forward. however, i am 100% willing to take as many poly-graph tests as you want me to, to prove to you that everything that i've just re-counted to you did indeed happen to the best of my knowledge just as i described.\r\n   please e-mail me a response as to if mufon has ever heard of an encounter like the one i described having in \"the weeds\" on april 2nd, around 8:30 pm. i really want to know if anybody else has seen what we all saw that night.\r\nthank you for your time & consideration.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n[cms/tg/pid]","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

my girlfrends dads house, it is around 3 miles north east of given adress, i dont know if you want my address or adress of sighting, adress of sighting was on school road just passed flynn road on left heading east. they appeared as 3 lights or points with 2 closer together on the left ( middle one about 25 degrees of the way between them from left) and they were either all one craft moving extremely fast directly away from us or 3 seperate objects moving away in formation or 3 seperate objects getting closer together in the same ratio or respect or proximity to each other (looked like if you zoom out with a camera) and dimmer. then they disappeared. the first part you just read we saw for around 4 secondts. then they dissapeared. we jumped up on the back of a pickup truck to see farther over the tree line because they got closeish to the treeline when they dissapeared. and we saw nothing for around 3 seconds. then we saw one appear and then another appear then the first start to fade while another was appearing then the second 2 fully appeared just as the first faded out then the 2nd one started to fade as the 3rd was still bright and the 3rd fade just as the first two had before. it could have been 6 seperate objects because we saw 3 points in  2 defferent places but not at the same time, im just saying if they were 3 objects at our estimated distance they must have went out then accelorated incredibly fast  then decelorated so fast that nothing i can think of could have survived the g force involved. a person would be nothing but splat after a ride like that. \r\n\r\nok as far as your \"points\"\r\n\r\nwe were stripping out a classic bmw to sell parts off of all day since around 11 am, we finished that for the day so we were just relaxing, dave (my girlfrend<autumn>)'s dad was selling a truck so we went outside to watch him haggle. and we saw em\r\n\r\nwe went stepping back towards the east as the other 3 people walked north west towards the house we saw it then jumped on the truck and then i said \"holy s**t theres your ufo right there\" the whole time from when i saw it to when i was on the back of the truck was around 8 seconds, then i saw it again then said that just as they dissapeared, the other 3 looked and it was too late so they were laughing at us because i was really serious when i said it so they must think im nuts, well the 2 people that were there to buy the truck sure did but mabey not autumns dad he might have believed me.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object it looked like a really bright but small sunset then i noticed the points\r\n\r\ni think i covered the movements and actions\r\n\r\nadrenalin rush and extreme extacy like it made me feel so happy to have actually saw something i have been so interested in for the first time. i have been researching and reading/watching about ufo's for years but i have never seen anything like what i just did, this is the first thing i have ever seen that i can not just explain to myself, like it was a miracle that god must have created, like something that just cant happen.\r\n\r\nthey slowly lighted and faded 1 at a time then we watched for 5 minutes after and never saw another thing.\r\n\r\nask me all the questions you want, we both will participate in whatever, you can interrogate us and criticise us and we will hold our story.\r\n\r\noh by the way, i havent plotted it on a map yet but there is a dopplar weather radar ball on the corner of c-38 and passenhiem road in the general direction we werre looking, but the ball is a bit farther than my distance estamet, help me with the geography and

cylinder about 200' above the water, very bright lights flashing and they weren't red or green, which might indicate a known aircraft. he also said that the object seemed to be slowly rotating. i tried looking the event up and haven't found any reference to it, and with no other explination present, i'd call it a ufo. i told him this and he didn't want it called that lol. i explained that if he didn't know what it was, then it was unidentified, it was flying, and it was an object, and that it didn't nessisarily have anything to do with aliens.\r\n\r\nunknown for most factors. i also do not know who the other witnesses were. merely reporting because it should be. i believe 99% of sighting have some sort of explination, and in the event that this particular one doesn't, than you've

2 miles down the road or less and stopped at a lil conveince store and the object was just leaving the baseball fields directly overhead where everyone had s topped to watch. there is a newspaper writeup where the army claimed this object was a baloon of some sort.. which is not even realisitc with the design of the object. i am in the navy and have never even seen or heard of anything like this and am trying to simply know if anyone has a copy of the article or knows of how to obtain it. \r\nas far as anything different in myself or my family i don't recount any or have ever seen another ufo again in my life. except for the occasional shooting star.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":22805,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.5500611,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04132010-0018","longitude":-85.505247,"occurred":533721600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tennessee","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,   Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1271222597000,"summary":"Rectangular small city close to the size of a aircraft carrier","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Kentucky/Louisville","timeZoneName":"America/Kentucky/Louisville","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8535,"locationName":"Celina, Tennessee","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:134633"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"One evening i was listening to the local npr station. the host said that the iss would be visible that evening at about 10 pm in my area. so, i gathered some friends to watch for it with me. we saw what we assumed was the iss, but when it was almost overhead, a yellow object instantaneously accelerated away from it at a speed that appeared to be at least double what the speed of the iss was. the object took off in a direction of about 300 degrees normal to the path of the iss. i am very sure that the acceleration was instantaneous! the path of the iss was not altered as far as i could tell. i do not know if the object's path was flat or followed the earth's surface, but it was straight until it disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nto answer #5, i wondered what the hell it was and thought that surely the astronauts knew about it. i figured i would never get an answer if i inquired about it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22804,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":63.590893,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04132010-0017","longitude":-154.4915419,"occurred":944028300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alaska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1271216809000,"summary":"Object shot away from the international space station with instantaneous acceleration.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3786,"locationName":"Bland, Alaska","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:134634"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Los Angeles","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"New ufo over the van nuys ca sky seen by x17guy photog on 4-13-2010 at 2:20 pm at woodman & roscoe blvd.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":22803,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1915766,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04132010-0016","longitude":-118.448457,"occurred":1271193600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1271215342000,"summary":"It was a sphere like ufo seen by me over my house.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/22803_submitter_file1__DSCF1778(2).JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Los Angeles, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:134635"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2056}
