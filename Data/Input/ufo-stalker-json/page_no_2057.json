died so i ran back inside to get my camcorder. sure enough a set of lights very bright, maybe at 5 to 10 thousand feet a few miles away from my position heading directly towards my position. my first thought was it was just an aircraft with landing lights on, but soon noticed forward movement was extremely slow and lights appeared to alternate in color, but were mostly brilliant green/blue hue. still felt it was conventional aircraft at that time but continued to watch. but then object stopped and just seem to hover for a few minutes, this is when i felt this situation was unusual not normal flight characteristics, especially considering the light pattern never changed even when the object moved at a 90������angle, again very slowly but light pattern configuration never changed this continued for about 10 minutes, then object again changed direction and headed back south west until i could no longer view it, yet light pattern configuration again never changed. when lights disappeared from my view,  before i went back inside my home noticed a couple faint flashes from the direction of my wooded area, same direction i witnessed the object, i have no game camera's mounted, started feeling a bit uneasy so i went back inside for the night. my living area is remote and rural so ambient light sources are very few.  my camera and camcorder were unable to pick up the

have an unblocked (by the window) line of sight on the object. i went outside and stared for maybe 5 to 10 minutes and then i just came inside and went to bed. i have been very puzzled with my

was 18 or so.  he just got his license so wanted to go specificaly ufo hunting.  i lived in exeter at the time so we had traveled to kingston.  we pulled over the side of the road where there was this wooded hill.  as soon as we parked and got out of the car this flying object came over the horizen.  then it immediately reversed direction.  this is how we knew it wasn't a plane.  then it slowly dropped appearing as if it landed in the woods.  i being 9 years old started running in the field until i came the the woodline.  at that point i got scared as we had no flashlight to guide us through.  then we ran back to the car and left quickly amazed at what we just saw.  the object was round and my memory is faded as to what the lights were like.\r\nthe biggest impression i had was that this thing landed.  didn't actualy see it land but saw it gradualy lower itself until it went out of site into the woods.  it was close enough though to where i felt it reachable if we vetured into the woods.  the fact that it reversed direction without turning around was eye catching as well.  i often wonder if we could have had an alien encounter.  i don't remember if we did.  i just know what i saw this night.  there was a witness with me whom i haven't spoken with in years.  he was 18 and i don't ever remember discussing this incident with him either.

and very little in the way of ambient light.  my parents called me to the back yard from my bedroom and i went out to join them and watch a strange light in the sky.  the light was like a very bright star, and it was at about 60-75 degrees above the western horizon.  it changed color from red to green to blue to yellow to white as it moved in a fairly tight formation up, down, to the right, to the left, down, up, and in zig zag patterns.  there was no noise, and we watched in awe as it continued its color changes and slow random movements across the sky.  within a few minutes, another star like object appeared near it, also changing color and moving around randomly.  the objects were fairly close together when an arc of light moved between them, back and forth.  one of the objects then disappeared as the remaining object continued its random movement, until it moved lower in the sky and became obscured by the tree line of the forest in our back yard.  i was only 8 years old at the time, but i remember this incident clearly.  my parents and i were clearly freaked by this incident.  my dad called the police and reported the sighting, and i believe there was an article in the

disappeared. i was about to call my husband around 11:52 pm but then i heard this humming noise. almost like a woman humming softly. so i rolled down my windows some more and it got louder. all of a

except for the fact that instead being orange it was white. and i could tell the humming was coming from it. but the thing that bothered me the most was that the light coming off this ufo didn't shine onto my vehicle. it didn't cause any other the surrounding area to light up or be seen. it went across the sky, blocking my view for about 3 seconds, then disappeared. i looked back at the road and realized i had come to a complete stop in the middle of the road. i quickly started driving again and looking around to see if it would reappear. i called my husband and told him about the finding right away. ever since i saw it.. i've been seeing glimpses of shadows. i thought maybe it was my glasses but when i took them off i was still seeing things walk in front of me. i'm also terribly too

there was high visibility ��� light cirrus clouds near the horizon, low-lying but nothing but blue sky above 10,000 feet.  i looked up and saw what i thought was a star.  this took place around lunch-time, between 11:30 and 12:30 roundabouts.  the star was very bright and i thought it was strange because i couldn���t see any other stars.  then it started to move, very, very slowly west to northeast over the course of the next 7 minutes.  \r\n\r\ni tried not to take my eyes off of it because it was small and clearly above 30,000 feet as i could see some 747s making contrails (short trails due to such clear conditions) below and around the ���star���.  it was not using any of the sky-lanes that planes normally use.  \r\n\r\noccasionally, maybe three minutes in, and then at the five or six-minute mark, it would stop totally for 30 seconds.  sometimes it seemed to have a pulsing, circular aura around it that was only faintly discernible from the sky around it.   i was wearing a good pair of sunglasses with polarization so the sky was very blue and the star quite bright against it.  when i took the glasses off the star was still visible but difficult to track.  \r\n\r\nthe bizarre thing is that my eyes went right to it, and there was 360 degrees of clear blue sky.  if i hadn���t immediately seen it or known it was there, i could have missed it.  would have missed it.  \r\n\r\nit was very bright.  again, i thought it was a star.  that high up, that shape, that type of light.  the weather was perfect ��� spring time and about 72 degrees.  i wanted to shout to the neighbors to ask ���what is that���, but for those 7 minutes the neighborhood was a ghost town.  \r\n\r\ni didn���t take a picture because my phone was inside the house and i knew if i took my eyes off of it i might lose it.  sure enough, just as it passed directly overhead i glanced away for a second, maybe two, and then it was gone.  weirdest thing i���ve ever seen.  i work outside and i know the air traffic here.  this was highly unusual.
