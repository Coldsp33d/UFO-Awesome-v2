what's that!?..Oh my god..It's moving!!..It's f*king moving!\" while the driver still drove at 55mph-60mph, i kept track of the object for about 3seconds. the object was not far up in the sky, but instead it seemed to be pretty low to the ground. i saw it moving down towards the ground as if it were going to land. it moved downward in the shape of an arc, a movement i believe no airplane or helicopter do when they plan to land. anyhow, i do not know if the object landed because i lost site of it once it got too low to the ground because of trees covering the site. i noticed there was a house near where the object was, but there may be more than just one. the driver did not see what i saw, but i wanted to ask people around the area where i saw this object if they had seened something similar to my story but i was too scared of doing that for fear of being called crazy.  what made me first notice the object was its perfect sphere-shaped bright-white glow. when i first saw it, i didn't think anything of it; until i saw it was actually moving downward as if to land, i thought it could be perhaps a ufo because of the way it moved downward, forming an arc path. during the siting i felt in disbelieve; it was very unexpected because i was not looking at the sky to find strange things, but yet there it had been very tangible. while still on the phone with my mother, i told her what i had seen: the bright white light shaped as a sphere. after the sighting when i got home, i asked myself what it could have been and started iliminating possibilities and i could not find an explanation for it. so i arrived at one conclusion: an unidentified flying object..Apparantly about to land.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":22768,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.3826474,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04122010-0003","longitude":-98.8139946,"occurred":1270791600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1271072369000,"summary":"Moving sphere object with a bright-white light","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/22768_submitter_file1__BrightWhiteFlyingObject.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Rio Grande City, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:135230"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Durham","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was out taking my dog dj. out for a pee. i looked up and saw a blimp like object that looked as a saucer shaped object that moved with no sound and no motor? it moved slow and it was dark matter that was the ship is the only way to decribe the way i realized how huge it was..The light behind the craft made it visible and you could see the boackness of the ship outline. you could see the errieness of the ship..I was so afraid just because of the size of this thing??I guess that i am in shock !!!My dog just looked at me fall to the ground ? why is this beeing a regular sight with just me and not all of the area???I just wish that the government could protect me and thne rest of society???I wish all of us (suvivors) could unite and demand the governments help in this matter??But we would probably just get the advising of broken bones and all? seems that that is all the gov. is use to do instead of uniting the way and truely starting a force that can automatically help us stop this unseen force. and somewhat unstoppable..\r\n                        [cms/tg/pid]  if i keep seeing these ufo's i may have the cradentials of a ufologist? why not?

make out any kind of defined structure. \r\n  at the time we were just emerging from a hail storm, the ceiling under the hail cloud was about thirty two hundred feet according to the nearest reporting station,hoquiam, washington. the object seemed much closer. but it could have been at an elevation of between one thousand and three thousand feet. \r\n  it moved at a high rate of speed. i would estimate at several hundred miles per hour. probably close to mach 1. it made an ascending, climbing turn of about ten degrees and then turned back to the left about 15 degrees and leveled off. it still looked very low. less than 2500 feet above ground level. in just a few seconds it had moved quite aways away. possibly as much as ten to fifteen miles. then it seemed to slow or even stop. maybe over aberdeen. but it was to far to say.\r\n  being about the size of a small aircraft and being so bright it was easily outshining the stars that had come out after we emerged from the hail

light comming through the limbs. it appeared to be about a mile away if that. the strangest thing happened while i was watching, a falling star crossed in the bright white lights path. for a brief moment i thought they might colide in mid air. but they did not. i watched the bright white light until it was completely out of sight. and saw no more falling stars.       we do not usually have aircraft comming in from this perticular direction, that was what really peaked my curosity. i just watched the light and the falling star and really thought they might colide.","distance":"501 Feet -

looked like the wins of a large plane could not see a tail or nose was moving not very fast a steady course west - a little north altitude was changing they would pitch side to side slightly causing

observing them (2) and went about my work, after another 10 min i went in washed up and joined my wife watching a movie about 3-5 min after sitting down i muted the tv as i thought i heard something i sure did there were 3 helicopters i believe s-70a's they were pitch black,, coming from the east quickly at first as they were over the fields to our east we could hear them throttle back and seen them drop altitude a bit as they slowed down they started a slightly north of west track and ended up flying right through where i had seen the two reflective  objects when they were holding in one

4:12 (i looked at the clock to see how long it had been since i seen the objects) it was at that point i felt it was something and decided to find somewhere to let someone know.","distance":"501 Feet

helicopter in the distance. the object had a very bright font and tail light. we thought it was odd that the lights were much brighter than helicopters we have seen in the past and lacked  blinking lights. the object appeared to be heading west of i-17. what we assumed to be the front of the helicopter was tilted downward as the other light was above the \"front\" light. the lights then became parallel evenly spaced. at this point, we thought the object was a plane heading north and that we were seeing the bright lights of its' wings. then it disappeared as if someone shut the lights off suddenly. \r\nmy daughter were puzzled and started joking about being one of those people who claimed to have seen a ufo. approximately 40 seconds later, the object was visible again and this time it seemed to be much closer. it now seemed to be coming towards us again (instead of heading west) and the lights were extremely bright. the object moved slowly and smoothly- still evenly spaced. it once again moved west and then came to a still.The object was motionless and as we continued driving, we passed it. as  we passed the object, it appeared to be on the edge of the west side of i-17 (before 101 loop and i-10 exits). we drove by ( and somewhat under it). i slowed down, rolled down my window and saw that there was a thin object between the two lights. it was solid and the object was close enough to see a gray mass, (perhaps metal because there was a reflection off the mass caused by either the object itself or the lights on the freeway). no loud sounds...Nothing.  i tried to find an exit to pull off and watch it.  my daughter was able to turn around in the car and watch the object while i tried to find an exit. within seconds (and before an exit), it was gone. it is difficult to say how big it was. i believe it was no bigger than a blimp. it was close- close enough to see the underside of the craft.\r\nthere were other cars on the freeway. someone else had to see this. i wish

was infected with a ton of chemtrail activity so i grabed my camera and began filming the aircraft laying these chemtrails all over the place.\r\n\r\nback and forth,back and forth they went for what seemed like forever..\r\n\r\nit has always been a theory of my own these aircraft are masking the presence of ufo activity among other unknown reasons.When i see these aircraft with chemtrails..I always make it a point to look for ufos and many,many times i have seen \"spheres\" which always take on the color of their surroundings..If they are in or near clouds they will appear white and if they are in the clear blue sky they will appear transparent but discernible if you continue to look closely enough..\r\n\r\nby doing this i have led a few people to see these craft when they otherwise didn't even believe in ufos..\r\n\r\ni have witnessed ufo activity several times with the chemtrail phenomenon and this time i was armed with a camera.\r\n\r\ni didn't see anything like i normally had previously but i did notice a faint object the shape of a \"bell\" directly above which seemed to be out of the path of these aircraft's pattern..I grabbed a pair of 10x binoculars and i picked up on the object so i pointed my camera in that general direction and started snapping images and i was able to capture a triangle/bell shaped object.It was stationary for several minutes before disappearing. i started to go inside and i felt like i should stay out for a few minutes more..That i hadn't seen enough and that if i went inside i would miss the craft if it returned or appeared in another part of the sky..\r\n\r\nfinally after about 3-4 minutes,i thought it was over when i began to get an feeling of being watched and i heard in my mind \" turn around and look at me\" and i caught it just before it disappeared..It is beyond my ability to understand...But i believe with all of my heart.. i was basically told \r\n\r\n\"hello,here i am!!\" like i was a participant in a game of \"hide and seek\"\r\n\r\nthis is not the first time i have been absolutely \"compelled\" to look at a direct spot in the sky and had a ufo sighting..\r\n\r\nso i just i started snapping pictures indiscriminately and that is when i captured the faint sphere when i pointed my eyes in the certain point in the sky..\r\n\r\ni have seen several ufos while watching the chemtrail activity in this area..I live in the appalachia mountains directly on a mountain top that is part of a state park with one part being very high bluff which overlooks the major city in this area and it has been a perfect spot to watch much aeronautical activity..Including lots ufos.\r\n\r\ni only recently purchased a camera..But i have seen many,many ufos since being in this area..\r\n\r\nthese are only the images i have of this report..I have a few others but these were the first since i began filming and they were daylight captures..\r\n\r\nthe first image is a copy of the original and the second is a copy of the image with different color filters which bring out the craft from the background color of the sky..\r\n\r\nthe third image is of the craft that appeared and in my mind i was compelled to look and there it was observing me..It wanted me to see it!..Otherwise i would have continued looking in the other direction..\r\n\r\nthey have not been altered and are real..\r\n\r\ni had to turn nearly 180 degrees to catch the craft in the third image after it compelled me to look in that direction..\r\n\r\ni offer a little info about my background..I have held a high level security clearance for the dod and worked in intelligence with one of america's top tier defense contractors and i used to be a deputy sheriff.\r\n\r\ni need to know why this is happening..\r\n\r\nthis event happened

talking, and her little brother noticed a dim light of northwest of us.  he was starinng out of the back window, and told us, so we all, begin to watch it as it would go out of sight behind hills, and i would say we spotted it when it was about 5 miles away. i say this because we watched the object for about 15 min., or longer, it has been a few years since i talked about it.  but it got closer, about 3 miles away now, and split into 2 dim lights.  they would go back and forth real softly.  then it came to the top of the valley in which we were  in, the opposite end or northwest side, and turned into 2 lights ...One blue and one red.  the place where we were at has a creek running through, and encircles an island about quarter mile in diameter, and the lights went to each side, one at the south end, one at the north end.  when they did they immediately brightened so much, they lit up the whole island and a good part of the valley.  i focused on the blue light as it radiated so quickly.  what made us lose sight is fear, we didn't know what was happening, but i remember hearing a buzzing in my ears, like hearing static and low buzzing.  we all turned and ran, as we were standing at the top of the road parallel to the line up of the lights. her younger brother was so frightened he began to screem and cry as we ran, i was the last and was very frightened.

of swiggle lines as the ones in the program that 3 different states reported. i watched all night (around dawn:5 hrs). from far i could see it move substantial distances in an instance, changing shape from a twinkle, to a star shape, to a diamond shape. the colors would variate red, blue, green, and white. with the binocculars (closer) i could see that the shapes i saw from further were actually being formed from 3 or 4 flourescent lines wrapping around one another, twisting, making all kinds of impossible maneuvers, and comming back together (just like i saw in that program where mufon

(the air force jet seemed as if to discourage them from hovering any lower?) \r\n\r\nsome of the lights seemed to appear and disappear randomly. one red light(orb) was constant and much lower and closer to me, appearing larger. it was glowing bright reddish/orange toward the center. \r\n\r\nthere's a strange/interesting intuitive aspect to my experience as well. i felt there was some kind of connection/communication through telepathy... very difficult to explain. \r\n\r\ni was in a state of shock and amazement, i guess you could say. i didn't think to grab a camera. i didn't even watch to see how long they were all out there. i didn't feel afraid, but it did take a while to process the experience. it was very positive actually, and deeply profound. it gave me lots to think about. they looked just like other star-like/orb/lights i've now seen on youtube from sightings all over the world. wow... there really is something to this whole \"ufo\" thing. definitely worth investigating further... much to learn with all of this.
