passed by the northwest expressway exit we noticed two white lights a mile or more ahead of us which at first glance looked like nothing more than a low flying small airplane heading towards us.  as we got closer we both noticed that this object in the time it took us to get to it had never moved.  in fact, as we got closer and closer we noticed it was hovering over a field just off the highway.  i would say it was less than 100 yards above the ground and less than 50 yards off the highway so we drove right by it.  it was definitely not an airplane because it wasn't moving, but then it wasn't a helicopter either.  i even rolled my window down as we drove by to see if i could hear propellers hoping it was a helicopter but it was completely silent.  it was just before the sun set but the object was too dark to actually see the shape of it.  but, i do know that it did not have wings like an airplane because i was really straining to see wings as we drove by.  we noticed more white lights on the object as we got closer and judging by their arrangement would say it was either in a cylinder or disc shape but that would only be a guess.  there were probably a total of 3 to 4 bright white lights on it.  and occasionally i could make out a tiny red flashing light underneath but it was not a consistent blinking like a plane would be it was more random.  i watched it in the mirror as we passed by and it was still there for as long as i could see it.  it never moved in the 5 or more minutes since we first noticed it.  and i never saw it leave.  surely there are other people out there who saw this.  it would have been very difficult to ignore if you were driving on that highway that night!  there is a small airport just several miles east of where we were, i wonder if they

it was.\r\n\r\nfor the next 2-4 seconds i clearly saw 3 lights forming a triangle speeding across the sky directly south. there was also a light right in the middle of all 3. there was a large distance between the lights, because at the speed they were moving, they stayed in perfect unison probably 5-6 miles apart from each other. \r\n\r\ni'm not sure whether or not these were rim lights to some large craft, but it seems unlikely since the distance between them stayed in a perfect triangle. if this is the case, the craft must have been absolutely huge.\r\n\r\nthe speed of this object was

a positive identification if they were aircraft. i could not. there was no other lights attached, no body glow or other distinguishing or familiar markers. tonight, approximately the same time, april 8, 2010, they appeared again, this time witnessed by my wife and daughter. this time i caught them as the came out of the north by north west and crossed the southern horizon at approx 30 degree apex and dissapeared to the south/southwest. again, they moved in a pattern, separated by considerable distance estimating altitude above 5,000ft. this time, with binoculars i did notice a dull red glow accompanying the flashes, however i am convinced they are not conventional aircraft. also, thier speed was such that they crossed the sky in about a quarter of the time that a high altitude aircraft took to cross the same distance. considering the speed, formation and lack of any other lights and no dicernable body shape, i do not believe they were planes, helicopters or other conventional

large triangle ufo's currently hovering over san diego, ca in the clairmont mesa area, they are now glowing red.  they have merged into one and separated back into 4 again.  wife and 21 year old stepson have eyes on target at this time.  i will be trying to get pics/video as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nokay correction she was confused, or i made a mistake the lights were white not red.  white lights. i specifically asked her (as i am a 20+ year u.S. navy combat veteran) if they displayed red lights on left wing, green on right wing, fog landing lights underneath, red light on top of tail section etc...\r\n\r\nshe said \"babe...They were triangle and started as 3...Then 4 then merged into one, then it was 2 white lights \"in a linear perspective\" (i am still trying to get some amplifying information as to what she meant by linear), i understand that as one white light right behind a 2nd one (she said that they were very close as in right next to one another).  they did not separate back into 4 again.  right now they are remaining as 2 white lights.\r\n\r\n\r\ni already made a voice report to ruben.\r\n\r\nnow that i got the initial report off i will do my best to answer your questions.\r\n\r\nmy wife initially called me at 8:38pm pst from california.  she was on the 15 north freeway heading north from south san diego (around naval base)\r\n\r\nshe stated that she was driving and noticed 3 rather large triangle shaped craft silently hovering at approx. position angle 4 in the sky as she was south on the 15 north freeway looking north towards clairmont mesa.  this was at dusk initially where she was able to make out a definitive triangle shape.  as darkness settled in the triangles became white lights in the sky merging in and out of 1.\r\n\r\nthe motion she described as being very slow...Almost at a standstill and hovering.  no sound of propulsion as they were silent.  now we know that miramar marine corp air station lies to the north in the direction she was facing.  she is a san diego, ca native and had never seen any aircraft like that operating in the direction she stated.  she knows (having been married to me long enough as a chief in the u.S. navy) the difference between helicopters and aircraft.\r\n\r\nthey were floating triangle bricks basically.\r\n\r\nher feelings were that of pretty intense nervousness.  she is still a little shaken up by it.  i had always been the sci-fi guy listening to coast to coast am...She would just roll her eyes at my x-files likeness ;-)\r\n\r\nbut she has now seen something (which kinda sucks cuz i have never gotten to actually see one).  so she is a full believer now.\r\n\r\nshe broke off contact at approx. 9:30pm san diego, ca time as she had to be somewhere.  but according to her they seemed to be in no hurry to take off or avoid detection so they may still be airborne.","distance":"Over One

it was, but it was not one of ours. i was extremely curious. i kept glancing through trees as i drove to try to keep it in view, but i realized i would not get a good view unless i turned east. i turned east onto hillsborough avenue instead of taking my turn to the west. i was concerned about time, as i had a meeting at 7 pm miles away through traffic. the object was not coal black, but grayish black as though it was partially transmitting light.  it seemed to be about 5000 feet high, but i was unsure of its length and height.  it appeared to be about three of four times as long as it was high and maybe the size of a twin engined commercial jet, but taller. most peculiar was that it appeared to be flat, like a gray flag that did not wave. it appeared to be 4-5 miles away and perhaps 20 degrees above the horizon. i realized that it was foreshortening in length, which meant it was turning to the east, and that i could not catch up. before it started its turn to the east it was moving through roughly 1-2 degrees of arc per second.  i turned around, got back on i-4 this time, and headed west. i could no longer see the object, even in my mirrors. surely someone else saw the thing, as this was rush hour traffic, and it had to cross the path of i-4 from tampa to orlando or maybe just stay on the north side of i-4. i decided to report it to mufon. i did not think to take a picture with my cell phone. it made no sound, nor did it have lights or a contrail.","distance":"Over One
