was clear without clouds and the temperature i my car marked outside 61 degrees. arriving a few blocks from my house , my wife saw the red lights on the from and then  we started taking photos and stopped the car and started taking video with my wife's iphone because mine had the battery very low. the lights were red and orange and in one moment changed to white. it was exciting since a few years ago we had had this kind of experience but the lights were very distant. at one point i thought i could communicate with them and flashed my car lights and coincidentally one of the lights that passed also turned off and lit the same way i had . the viewing was brief and in a quick moment they could no longer be seen.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
