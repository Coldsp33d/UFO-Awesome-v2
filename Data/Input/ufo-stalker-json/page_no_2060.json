brother. i had just spent the entire day visiting legoland with out of town relatives. it was a very beautiful, warm day that day, so the night sky was very clear and we decided to draw the blinds open, and slide open the patio door to let some fresh night air in. we were just enjoying our beautiful open view of carlsbad from our backyard which faces palomar airport. it is quite commonplace to see planes landing and taking off, even at that time of night. at about 8:45 pm, my brother and i were standing in front of the kitchen window which also faces the backyard. my brother suddenly asks me if i've ever seen a ufo. i thought it was a bit strange of him to ask because we were chatting about a whole different topic at the time. as he was asking me this, i saw him gazing out towards the kitchen window and so i looked out the same way. what i saw were 2 diamond shaped objects very brightly lit, a very golden yellow color. my first thought was they were 2 airplanes in a holding pattern waiting to land at palomar airport. i initially dismissed my brother's sighting of the 2 objects as airplanes and i quickly looked away. however, i quickly looked back since he was still staring out there all this time, and i took an even closer look to see that the objects did not look like planes after all. in fact, in addition to not really looking like airplanes, they were quite large in comparison to the real airplanes in the air at the same time. they were just suspended in air and not really moving anywhere at all. this i found very strange. as my brother and i were coming to realize that we were actually looking at a ufo, the objects instantly disappeared from view!\r\n\r\nthen, about 15-20 seconds after that, they reappeared again, but this time as 4 diamond shaped objects with the same brilliant glow and golden yellow color. this time they were in formation, sort of like a parallelogram (slanted square formation). by this time, i called out to my husband who was in our bedroom and also to my daughter who was in another room, to come outside to the backyard to view this strangely beautiful sight. so all of us were standing outside my back lawn viewing this light show which was out of this world, nothing like any of us has ever seen. i felt a bit scared, very excited and in awe, all at the same time. i did not want to keep my eyes away from the light formation in the sky, for fear it would disappear once again. \r\n\r\nthis ufo light show went on for about 2 minutes. the objects did not move anywhere, again they were merely suspended in the sky, glowing and staying in their slanted square formation. i still don't even know exactly how far away they were from us. i believe one of the \"diamond\" shaped objects faded a bit and then appeared again brightly during this timeframe. at the end of the light show, the lights simply \"turned off\" and we no longer could see the objects. it was as if someone had just turned off the light switch. they had literally disappeared!\r\n\r\ni captured only one picture shot of the 4 diamond shaped objects on my iphone camera, but not at a good close up view. my brother however did capture about 30 seconds of it on video with his camera. unfortunately, it also was not a close up view. his video is available on youtube.Com at this link: http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=9ymzhlarn3m\r\n\r\ni'm looking forward to another light show again soon! it sure would be nice to know what exactly we were looking at!","distance":"Over One

approximately 8:50 pm i heard my wife and her brother speaking quite loudly about what they were seeing in the sky.  i quickly went into my backyard and clearly saw what they were talking about.\r\n\r\nmy home is located in carlsbad, ca and our backyard has a clear, unrestricted view from southwest to northeast. i was startled at first, then settled down and basically enjoyed the view.   here is what i saw:\r\n\r\ninitially there were 4 objects, very bright in the low sky.  judging the distance was difficult, but my assumption was that these objects were north/northwest in the direction of camp pendleton.  the objects were extremely bright, mostly \"gold\" or \"bright amber\" in color.  the objects were stacked two over two and seemed to be in a pretty tight formation, but there definitely appeared to be some spacing between them.  the objects seemed to be moving very slowly or hardly at all - it may have been that they seemed to be moving only because of the brightness of the light.\r\n\r\nafter about two minutes, two of the four objects \"disappeared\" and the other two remained.  the shape of each of the items seemed to be cone-like, or maybe to be more precise they were condensed versions of a \"bell.\"   the remaining items stayed in place for a short time and then they also disappeared in a flash.  \r\n\r\none of the things that i found striking was the fact that there was a good deal of air traffic at this time from the very nearby palomar airport.  a number of small planes stayed in the air while i was observing these golden objects.  rather than continuing to land as would normally be the case it appeared that pilots were staying in the air.  in addition, i could see several helicopters also hovering.  this is highly unusual, sinced palomar is a very small airport and gets a minimum of takeoffs and landings.\r\n\r\nmy wife, brother in law, stepdaughter, and myself spent the next hour or so talking about what we had seen and to a large extent we all had pretty much the same reactions and observations.  \r\n\r\nat first i must admit i was somewhat scared, but overall that feeling subsided and turned to curiousity.  i would have run inside the house to get a camera, but didn't want to miss a moment of this awesome sight.  i have always had a very, very skeptical view of the notion of ufo's and the people who report their existence, but after this experience i might be changed forever on the topic.","distance":"Over One

conditions existed where you could see your breather vapor when breathing.  i was an a1c, on duty air force security police airman as a passenger in my flight chiefs vehicle.  patrol car was facing west.  i was talking to my flight chief looking out his driver���s door window.  movement at the top edge of the window frame caught my attention; i noticed a brilliant white/off white light move at the top edge center of the window straight down.  the luminosity of the light was bright enough to compare with venus, however, the size of the light was about the size of a bb or one of the round metal ball links on a pull chain for a light closet or ceiling fan.\r\n\r\nthe light, (#1), continued straight down from the upper edge of the window frame.  as it reached a quarter way down the space of the window, a second light, (#2), (same size and color intensity) appeared slightly to the left of #1 and began to trail #1 starting from the top of the frame straight toward the horizon.  both lights appeared to be traveling the same rate; #2 light did not over take #1 light and, #1 did not pull away from #2, keeping equal distance from each other. \r\n\r\nas #1 light now reached the middle of the window, it immediately took a 90dg left turn (right as you looked at it) the was no arch to this turn it was previously travelling in a straight downward direction then an immediate 90dg turn and headed west until it disappeared from sight.  the #2 light continued in a straight downward direction until it disappear at the horizon.  both lights did not have any flaring, pulsating, or oscillation of lights.  it was a solid color white or off white color.  no twinkling of different colors.  the lights did not have a tail trail like you would see a meteor reentry.\r\n\r\nsightings of both these objects lasted approximately 4 seconds.  long enough for me to yell to my flight sergeant, \"holy cow! do you see that!\"  as he turned the objects had disappeared, and us being air force police, he was looking for something in his immediate surroundings.  as i was stammered that he did not see anything and i was highly amped up with what i saw, he continued to press me for info.  i

that i  personally had never witnessed a ufo, they said they have had several sightings beginning in january and that \"they\" are out there almost every night. so as i was leaving the lady's father said i'll go see if they are out there tonight. about a minute later he came back in and confirmed they were. this peaked my interest. so we all went outside, i loaded up my things in my van and then i looked skyward to where the people directed me. at first the objects just looked like stars until they handed me the binoculars. i had trouble keeping the binoculars steady until i rested them on a large car jack. as i focused in on the object i saw it quite clearly. it looked like when fireworks explode, the initial burst except there wasn't a burst or explosion. there were several lights that appeared to protrude from an inner object that was perhaps spherical in shape but not visible. it absolutely was not an airplane or helicopter. then my new friends pointed out a few more similar objects in different parts of the sky. the objects appeared to oscillate somewhat about 10 - 15 degrees. my new friends said that on other nights the objects would sometimes appear to make rectangular patterns and even \"morph\" into one another. they also mentioned that they've seen what they refer to as the \"mother ship\" that was absolutely enormous but since i did not see that object i will confine this report to what i saw personally witnessed. these \"star-burst\" objects were there the entire time i stood outside these people's home which was a little over an hour. since these people said that the objects are there almost every night, i'm going to continue to work in that area but watch out for them now. i told these people about ted phillips whom i saw speak at the mou conference last july in independence, mo. i told them about the \"marley woods\" and how mr phillips wouldn't disclose where exactly in missouri it was located but that it was in fact a ufo hot-spot. also i told them that a lady i met at the conference told me that the marley woods were around the area of licking, mo which was a little over an hour by car down hwy 32 from where we were in lebanon, mo. i'm

the lake. above the tree line was a glowing red ball, and it was getting closer. \"it's just an airplain comming towards us.\" i said, knowing airplains don't move that fast, but before i could second guess myself the bright red orb simply dissapeared. everything whent quiet. i remember watching the reflection of the moon in the water being eclipsed by a shadow. so i quickley looked up to see a giant triangle slowly come to a stop over our heads. my friend and i held eachother like whimpering school girls. it didn't make a sound. i remember lights on the bottom of it kicked on. a red, blue, and green light, one on each corner. i was so scared the experience is blurry, and hard to remember. we watched the craft slowly move west over the wheat field behind us, turn back into the twinkling red ball and sink into the horizon. i don't think i've ever ran so fast in my life. we where almost home when we noticed jets in the sky. these where verry obviousley jets with lights on there wings.

[from camera experience taking pictures at night.]  any pictures of that ball of light ufo was better than no pictures, and i wanted all the pictures of it as i could possibly get of it. eventually,  a big tree got in the way of me seeing it, and it seem that the ball of light was just getting dimmer and dimmer as it travel away from me (smaller in size too.)  possibly, because of the direction the ball of light took was near in direction where the sun would eventually come up.  i moved over to a spot where i thought where it might pass through an open area to view it which the ball of light should not had taken too long for it to reach that area.  but i never did see it after waiting for it about a minute.  at that moment, i thought \"maybe it was getting too dim, and that's the reason i can't see it.\"  then i thought, \"well, maybe i could see it on the computer if there was any light still being emit by the ball of light. \"  so i took 3 more pictures, but i still didn't see that ball of light once it went behind that tree.  i then thought, \"maybe it instantly disappeared like that first ball of light. [april of 2003].\"  i went back inside the apartment, and i looked at the clock to see what time it was, then i noted that time down.  i saw my compass laying on the desk, so i decided to take a compass bearing of that ball of light route which was at 45 degrees of 360 degrees (almost north east).  this ball of light that was seen in mesa, arizona is identical to the ball of light i seen in pensacola, fl back in 2003. identical in shape, in light, in speed, and in altitude.  identical. this observation i just had was much closer than the first observation back in 2003 which i filed a report to nuforc back then.  i had a really good look of it. i saw no out lines of any structure for a ball of light to be attached.  it was simply a ball of light very similar to a globe.  unquestionably, it definitely look like it was a solid sphere, not just a light.  it almost seem like i could almost reach out and touch it; being, it was that close.  it was actually awe inspiring to observe this little ball of light just silently and slowly traversing through the air with it being bright yet gentle enough as to a soft glow to allow me to intensely gaze at it for every little hints of details that it may have for me to see.\r\n \r\n  since 2003, i been searching on the internet for any logical explanation of what that ball of light may be.  in the past week, i seen maybe several ufo objects, but i started to discount them as being ufos. then last night when i was watching 1 video on youtube showing ancient ufos depiction,  i was giving reason to every depictions why they were not ufos since it could also be intercepted in a different way.  now this may sound a little odd, but i was actually going to start thereafter showing some of my pictures on youtube.  pictures i took over the years, and give reasons why some pictures that other people took may be just birds, or planes, or whatever because there was a logical phenomenal reason for each one, and how some other people's photo may have these kinds of phenomenal occurrences in their pictures.  in another words, i turned on my views to that of  ufos were not real because i didn't see any real hard evidence except for only pictures as possible proof.  and maybe what i saw back 2003 was just something of a fluke created by the  military with their new invention or contraptions.  however, this morning,  i awoke up from a dead sleep at 5:00am which i normally don't get up that early.   i figured, since i up, i make some coffee, then i just go outside to drinks some coffee and smoke a cigarette.  i was probably no more than a couple minutes outside when i saw this ball of light.  now this all sounds very incidental, but i was going agree with some of those people out there that ufos are not real, but this morning quite literally and instantly reminded me again about the facts that  ufos are indeed real.  no questions or doubt about that; they undeniably and truly do indeed exist.  i have pictures of that ball of light now, unquestionably those pictures shows somewhat as evidence as to the  fact that there are ufos possibly extraterrestrial in origin.  and there is very good chance that somebody saw that same ufo too in the phoenix area this morning.  the question is: are they going to come forward maybe onto this site to say, they saw it too.

hears a very loud sound, similar to the rumble of a rocket engine. while reading a sgt rock comic book, he hears shouting from ouside, that \"apollo\" is landing. two children appx. 10 and 9 are outside playing basketball in the driveway. the child in the home races outside as the sound begins to fade. as the child exits the home, the object is now only a small speck moving awaty into the clouds. the 2 children outside were excited and ponting toward the shy. they had seen the craft very close above the back of the house and descibed the craft as an upright cone shaped metalic craft that was dented. it was descending and had multicolored lights and 3 landing legs with circular pods on the feet. the craft was coming down over the house, but it did not land. it quickly rose and disappeared in the clouds going in a southward direction. it was a clear warm day, with no rain. there was no smell of exhaust or jet fuel and there was no visible smoke. the structure of the home had no visible damage to the roof or discoloration. the children were excited and thought it was an apollo landing. it was described as appx. 20 ft high and a silvery metalic with many dents along the structure. this rural suburb is outside youngstown , ohio and is appx 65 miles from cleveland nasa, and 4-5 hrs from dayton, wright patterson afb. nothing was ejected or found in the area around the home after the crafts departure. the craft was a cone shape that narrowed at the top, it did not contain visible external storage compartments or modules. it did not contain a ladder or identification nunbers or lettering. the craft did have observation ports or small windows. the area contained tall grass with wheat and corn fields. there were no bodies of water. there was no follow up or

lander that experianced navigation problems and had to descend for a potential landing. perhaps the pilot even saw the children playing and decided to give them a memory. the craft was dented and most likely had problems in the past and may have struck trees. the craft did not have any stencils, numerals, or identifying symbols, but it did have the required flight lights.

witness, to visit. \"t\" had to find out which part of the sky the big dipper was in for [cms/tg/pid] high school latin class so after dark we went outside and walked about 50 yds to a large field used for farming which had a few singular trees on its border. i also was carrying \"t's\" yougest brother,about 3 yrs old, in my arms. it was an extremely clear,crisp fall night with unlimited visibility.We were standing on an old dirt farmpath facing south/southwest when we both;i think at the same; shouted what in the hell is that? though the top of a thinnly leafed and branched tree about 40 yrds away was a brilliant white light with trailing red light which looked like a yo-yo on a string.The white light was large and very bright and very close the red moved very erradically.There was absolutly no sound coming from the objects we freaked..And ran out into the field for a better look. what we saw was the objects began to pulsate different colors red,green and ithink blue the colors would go from dim to bright without going out. i saw then that there were actually 3 objects with 1 in the front and two in the back-in a triangle-like geese fly.The objects then banked in a slow arc and started to head straight toward us-still silent-and moving only about 5 to 10 mph-very slow.The rate of flight speed remained constant throughout the sighting. the objects came directly over our heads-my estimate is they were about 300 ft high and 45 ft in diameter-but truthfully it is hard to judge size and distance on totally unknown craft in a totally clear night sky with no known point of reference-but they were close.When this happened i could see that the light source was on top of the crafts because you could see the bottoms of the crafts ccontrasted against the lights the bottoms were round-bowl shaped and looked as if they were made out of dark metal there were no other appendages or wings.The craft were heading back from the direction they had come from s/sw.We really got very excited-the hair on the back of my neck and arms were standing up.We ran downthefarmpath about 75 yrds to another friends house-[cms/tg/pid]-who also witnessed the crafts pass over his house and until the crafts passed out of visual range. so it had been one hell of an exciting night in a small town aswe told our parents who didnt know what to think and that was that-so we thought.Well 2 days later-oct.23-an article appearred on the front page of the daily herald ,a roanoke rapids newspaper,that [cms/tg/pid] of jackson,nc had seen a flying saucer along with other witnesses in the roanoke rapids area.A friend of my father who was from roanoke rapids told him of a man hunting on the roanoke river on oct21 when his boatmotor broke down.Three unknown objects flew over him so low that the lights from the objects were reflecting off of him and the river,but he heard sounds like tin cans rattling which we didi not hear.Then on oct 25-26 the us air force  called then came to my parents home in jackson to question \"t\", \"h\" and i about the sighting. there were 3 of them-a major or col in uniform and 2 radar techs in jump suits from the roa.Rap radar base.Evidently they found out about  us from the article in the paper.The officer was very peed off that we didnt report the incident when it happened.The officer then told us he was associated with project bluebook which we proceeded to answer the booklet questionaire.Iasked 1 tech what was it that we saw and he replied orion which was bs then and is bs now.....","distance":"101-500

6,2010) driving down i-5 prior to getting to san clemente, maybe in the laguna hills area i notice 4 bright orange lights in the low southern sky.  knowing that the lights could not have been street lamps, because of the brightness of them, i brought it to the attention of my family.  my father in law looked up and noticed them immediately and tried to get his video camera setup, however by that time we had lost sight of the lights.  i tried to maneuver around traffic to get a better shot on them, but it appeared that one of them started sinking faster behind another.  at this time we lost total sighting of them as they dropped down behind a hill ahead of us.  we continued to travel south on i-5 to see if we could get another glimpse, but unfortunately we could not see them anymore.  from where we were i would say they appeared to be directly south maybe above the nuclear power center just south of san clemente (possibly north of there) or out above northern camp pendalton.  really hard to judge as it was dark, but these lights had to have been seen by many people.  (as i did see this event already reported by another poster.)\r\nmy wife, daughter, father in law, and i tried to debunk this as being possible helicopters or bright street lights which might have confused us as to their height in the sky.  but we just could not find a conclusion to it.  especially when we saw the one light drop out of the sky a bit faster than the others.  could have been flares...?  maybe, but the uniformity of the other 3 lights made this seem like they were in some sort of constant movement/formation.\r\nmy daughter was quite shaken and scared, but my father in law and i were very curious and rushed home to see if we could find on the internet or on the news of any other sightings.  and as the other poster stated there was quite a bit of traffic and more people

the clouds. i knew it wasn't a jet, plane, helicopter, and was nowhere near the flight path of the airport. it never occured to me to stop taking pictures but only to keep taking pictures of what i saw as we traveled. the day was partly cloudy and the weather was beautiful. as we went from one freeway to another i opened up the sunroof and kept shooting as best as i could and zoomed in as best as i could to try and get a better image of what floated in the air for a while not moving in any direction even though the clouds moved freely east from the coast which was only a few miles away. the object shined every so often. the object hovered without any sound. it also looked as if it was very light. there was nothing attached to it. there was only one. as we drove i felt as if i were taking pictures of something no one else might have seen at that time. i only wanted to get a good shot of what was hovering so high in the air, but still can not identify what it was.\r\nafter finally looking to the sky once again to capture it once more, it was gone. there was nothing anywhere else in the sky that i could identify as the object anywhere i looked. i have more pictures than allowed

it has just become dark in the evening and then across from us up above the forest on the top of the hill across from us.. approx. 5 miles away we saw a red light just over the horizon;  first we thought it was a cell tower light as it was red.. but then the light became bigger and bigger it looked like it was a rectangle sitting with the tallest part up and the corners at the top looks a little curved.  we watched it for approximately 5 minutes when all of a sudden a bright yellow light left the red object and moved toward the northeast across the sky... after a few minutes it was out of our sight and the object from which it came from seemed to get smaller and appeared to be a light blue in color.. at times it was hard to see after that and it appeared to be just above the trees at the top of the hill (horizon level)above the forest there.. to this point neither one of us had ever seen anything like this... bill my boyfriend has been hunting and fishing all of his life and has never seen anything like this he is 61 and i am 62 and have done a lot of camping until a few years ago and also i have never seen anything like this.  ( note griffiths airforce base is located approximately 10 miles south/south west of where we were fishing. we had been fishing for a while in the dark, we had a lantern on so we could see our fishing poles when all of a sudden this yellow object flying about 1 mile in the sky in front of us - never any noise  (between the large hill where the red object was that we first saw and us) and continued going across the sky in front of us kind of zig zagging and moving in a south/south west direction after a while it was 3/4 of the way  down lake delta and we saw a smaller white light leave the yellow object and then fly away toward the south. after that the yellow object continued in the direction of lee, ny..   after another hour we were looking up on the hill across from us above the skyline and we could see the previously red object which was now a very light blue and getting a little bigger but not as big as it was when it was red.. the light remained there the whole time, a light blue, but we could barely see it, then it started getting a little bigger so we could see it better and   when we looked up again after an hour a white like light left it and  moved in the sky toward the northeast ..Toward the end of the lake that we were fishing at; we noticed it for a short time and then it was out of sight. around 10:40 we decided to pack up our fishing gear and walk back to the car, which was located on the side of the road in back of where we were fishing...Approximately 1 /10th  of a mile..  we had just got our things in the car when we looked up toward the lake and saw another extremely bright white object between the edge of the lake where we were fishing (located right in front of us when looking toward the lake,  and an island out in the lake  approximately 1/2 way across the lake it floated right above the water and just stayed in place it was like the bright new lights that christmas ornaments now have the ltd lights and it looked like the lights were in the shapes of strobe lights, side by side kind of like looking at a shape like a brick wall but all uniform and line up like boxes all over it; it was like looking at a very bright white star close up.   all of this was a little shocking but when we saw the white light close up at the end, that was almost a little scary;  it was like the object was checking us out after we left our fishing site... note we did have a lantern at the fishing site, so what ever it was would know we left the site on shore.   we think these things we saw were ufo's.   bill told me to get in the car and lets go... i had a better view of the bright white object then he did.. i walked across the road where we were parked and i felt like something or someone was looking at us.   note the night was cool, there was a little fog starting over the lake when we left.. but no fog on the road when we drove home, we could see the stars the entire time we were there.  note everything that was at patterson-wright airforce base have been moved to the griffiths base in rome, ny.  we do not know if this had anything to do with the griffiths base or if it was ufo's... this is something we will never forget.
