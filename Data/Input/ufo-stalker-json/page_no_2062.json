about 4:55 pm i went out on a terrace (with my camera in hand) as the day was very warm at 20*c & still mainly clear with sporadic wisps of white clouds. following an intuition i've focused my eyes on the southern sky but couldn't see anything , except some flying birds & jets. however , knowing from past experience if i just start taking photographs in a particular area i felt i was drawn to , most than likely it will show up on the camera & on the computer. so , i've aimed the camera in that part of the sky & begun snapping pictures , 5 in total .  the object did showed in micro close-up which i went through frame-by-frame on the iphoto intending it to enlarge it as best as i could. the image of the object is best on the 3rd photo. it was directly in the south with about 70% off the horizon line & it seemed to be over the lake ontario. \r\nthe total time it took me to take the photos was perhaps 2 minutes.\r\ni have e-mailed the close-up & the full original photograph to mufon's

we watched for some time when we watched the light fire a missle of light we watched in amazment as we seen the light missle strike another similar ball of light they threw light missles at one another for some time when finaly the new helicopter like light zig zaged back and forth and the light dissapered as if it had been destroyed. the first light stayed in place for some time until we went in the house for the phone to call our neighbors and when we came back out the light was gone.\r\n\r\na incident similar happened in the town of cameron, mo about an hour away in 1997 the next

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  on april 3, 2010 in mesa, arizona, i was outside watching for ufos and i saw: 2 ball size objects (no lights)[object-1 and object-2], 1 possible satellite (dim light), 1 huge (blimp size) ufo (low altitude, no lights).  during the late afternoon of the same day before the night event,  i think i captured on camera an ufo at close range which is the reason why i decided to watch for them possibly occurring at night too. \r\n\r\n  while watching at night, i spotted object-1 at an altitude height area typical of spotting either high altitude commercial jets or satellites.  i had my camera set up on a tripod; however, this object came towards me from a high angle in the sky which thereby caused me to dismount the camera and take hand held pictures. while taking pictures of it, i saw with my eyes through the camera viewer it appearing to be perfectly spherical in shape, dullish gray color with a hint of black color. it did not appear to emit light; however, it did appear to reflect city ambient light.  from my best estimates in size via experience with camera shots at that distance, i would estimate the size of object-1 similar in size to a large weather balloon size but not the shape of it.  viewing it with no camera but with eyes only:  the object-1 appeared to be at a high altitude, traversed slowly typical of a satellite or drifting balloon heading east, barely noticeable in the sky until spotted, no audible sound were heard. duration of object-1: 46 seconds starting at 20:41:31.  object-1 never changed in shape or in light intensity throughout the entire observation of it. pictures were taken (no tripod); faint light can be seen upon adjustments of lighting in photo program. \r\n\r\n  object-2 similar to object-1. heading: south east. duration: 65 seconds starting at 20:55:58. object-2 never changed in shape or in light intensity throughout the entire observation of it. pictures were taken (no tripod); faint light can be seen upon adjustments of lighting in photo program.\r\n  \r\nobject-3 (possible satellite) 5 pictures were taken with a camera on a tripod until object observation was lost upon readjustment of camera view. no enhancements required except via d-lighting low. light characteristic of 1 second exposure is not typical to any known jet or plane light pattern.  object-3 had a level flight coarse, but interpretation of light characteristic is unknown at this time.  however from past observation of satellites with eyes only, object-3 appeared to be a satellite with minor fluctuation in light intensity. duration: 16 seconds starting at 21:00:46\r\n\r\n  object-4 (blimp size) was unquestionably an ufo of some sort in my opinion.  i first noticed the unknown object within a 1 mile range with my eyes only.  this object had no lights on it nor did the object emit any lights.  the size of the object is comparable for that distant of being an extremely large commercial jet, or comparable in size to a large c-31 military transport jet, or comparable in size of a goodyear blimp.  it was almost unnoticeable while traveling except it almost stand out from the background scenery as a large and dark, elongated object traversing very slowly in speed which the speed is very comparable to a blimp speed.  the altitude is estimated to be at the altitude of a blimp flying, or at the altitude of a landing-approach of commercial jet.  i had a difficult time trying to locate object-4 with my eyes while trying to locate object-4 through the camera's viewfinder since the viewfinder on the camera has a darken filter.  once i was able to locate it on the camera, what i saw quite literally sent chills down my body as being startled but not frighten,; yet,  i continue to take pictures of it with the remote. the object appeared to be a huge eye looking thing.  it is possible that it might be a blimp because of it elongated shape, but i doubtful of that.  at the ends points of the object, it appeared to come to a point similar to how our eyes come to a point at both ends.  a blimp is more rounded at those ends.  in the center of this object structure appeared to be a wavering, huge darken, circular-like mass area as in some similarities to the iris of a dark, color eye on a person.  outside the darken circular area but in the area that comes to a point, the color was of darken, yellowish color with maybe a hint of orange in it.  while looking at it through the camera, it appeared to me to have a mean-like look which that part is what sent chills down me.  i managed to take 4 pictures on the tripod before i completely lost sight of the ufo including searching with my eyes only.  only one pictures shows up with no enhancements required; plausibly, one of the search light from the light show that was taking place near my location possibly lit the object up which was pure luck for me. duration: 19 seconds starting at 21:15:34. pic-1 resembles (to some extent) the object which i saw through the camera's viewfinder. further cropping and resizing (pic-2) shows something completely unknown and bizarre yet enlightening in features as to being unique.\r\n\r\n  about 10 minutes later, a jet making the sounds similar to a fighter jet headed nw in direction towards the commercial airports but in opposite direction of the ufo's heading.  i took 3 pictures of that jet.  now i know how all this sounds with \"light show\" and \"eye looking\" terms used; however, this event did take place, and this is not a concocted or exaggerated event.  this is a true chronicle of the event and how it unfolded that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:19","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":22640,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4191343,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04042010-0007","longitude":-111.8279624,"occurred":1270354500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,

between proctor, tx and comanche, tx.  large front windows with great views.  i noticed one, at first, moving to my left up ahead(fairly low altitude but ahead of me)...Small blinking lights similar to an aircraft...Didn't pay much attention to it as it was typical looking, but, then...It suddenly gives off a brighter yellow light which only lasted about 10 seconds or less.  i was driving pretty much straight in that direction.  a few seconds pass...Maybe 30 or so...I see another one, this time it was closer like i was driving under that same area as the first siting.  i asked a passenger sitting in the front seat of the bus if he could see the lights as now 3 or 4 appear more directly overhead.  the passenger gets up and moves to the front window and we discuss what we are observing.\r\n\"you know, this is the area where they saw those ufo's near stephenville\" is part of the discussion.  the last one i saw was so directly overhead that i had to lean forward and look practically straight up.  i really could not discern altitude.\r\ni was thinking that a negative aspect of summer was all the bugs that hit  auto's and bus windows and create quite the mess as the insect activity was picking up as the sun had only recently gone down.  but, then...I began hearing \"popping\" noises like i was hitting large bugs or beetles on a regular basis...It got fairly intense, actually..But, i also could hear what i thought was the same \"popping\" noises hitting the roof of the bus.  bugs can't hit the roof of the bus..Only the front when one is travelling 65 mph or so...I ask my passenger if he can hear that \"popping\" sound on the roof ??...It was like a shower of something although there were insects hitting the window and front of the bus, also, so, it was difficult to verify what i was hearing.  however, i was convinced i was driving directly under the (ufo) area and something was falling from the sky (nothing visible) only the popping noise as something was falling on the bus.

(you hear me describe this on the video.)  there appeared to be slight movement or rotation, but i can't say that with any certainty.  \r\n\r\nafter the camera battery ran out, i watched the object for a few more minutes and then went back downstairs and tried to convince myself that there was a rational explanation.  i came up fifteen minutes later and the object was still there.  went to bed soon after, so i'm not sure how much longer it stuck around.  kicking myself for not continuing to watch, but quite frankly, i couldn't quite believe what i was seeing.  it was only the following morning when i reviewed the footage that it really began to sink in.  (p.S.  the event occurred at 12am, but i'm saying 1am because you have an error message that keeps coming back when i put in 12.)\r\n\r\nto be certain, i recorded video out the window at the same time the following two nights, but no lights appeared.  i searched around online to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting.  it looks like there were two other reports on or around march 27 -- one in tracy, ca and one in blue lake, ca.  specifically, i believe both of those reports also cited the pulsating red light atop blue lights.  \r\n\r\ni tried attaching a video and picture of the object, but keep getting an error message.  (please contact me and specify the format you need.  happy to provide original footage if it's helpful.)  would appreciate any info.  \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":22632,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.3956662,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04032010-0007","longitude":-118.5594691,"occurred":1269676800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1270361019000,"summary":"Brilliant blue ufo with three levels of lights and one red light on top","tags":["ufo","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":7,"locationName":"Santa Clarita, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:136492"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Canton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Around 9 pm my brother and i went out into a field next to our home with binoculars to look at some stars and whatever else we could see. as we sat there all we were seeing were planes. after about 15 minutes i took my eyes away from the binoculars and two greyish objects flying from the sw caught my eye. i was expecting them to be plane or something like it, but about instantly i could tell they wernt. i said to my brother, \"hey look at those\" as i pointed in their direction. i looked at them through the binoculars but could only see their shape with no details except some lines on the bottom. they were very low on a level of aircraft and were dead silent. they flew side by side in a straight line with a large gap inbetween. they got closer and i could see they were circular and had dark curved lines on the under side. there were no visible lights and the size of both was hard to tell, but if i had to estimate i would say they were 25 feet across. as we watched them we was amazed because we had never seen anything like it. they were visible for about 15 to 20 seconds as they flew to the ne. they went out of sight when they flew over the tops of some trees. my brother and i talked about what we saw and we seemed to describe them the same way. afterwards we waited for another 15 minutes to see if more would show up, but nothing like it was seen again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":22630,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.8037373,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04032010-0006","longitude":-81.368677,"occurred":1270354500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1270358579000,"summary":"As we sat in the field the two silent circular objects flew over side by side at a low altitude.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Canton, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:136493"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Las Vegas","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was staying at the luxor on the southern side (in the pyramid, not the tower).  yes, the luxor is the hotel with the giant vertical light beam that they turn on at night, but this was separate from that.\r\n\r\nnear midnight, i shut off all the lights to take some pictures of the surrounding lights from the hotel window.\r\n\r\njust about directly above and far enough up that it appeared above the thin layer of clouds directly to the south of it (and visible with the stars in the attached pictures) was a small \"stripe\" in the sky about an inch long generally along a north-to-south axis.  it also had a small interruption in it near the northern end of it.\r\n\r\nit didn't move over the course of an hour (as that's when i went to bed), and as the stars \"moved\" as the earth rotated, the stripe stayed in the same spot relative the earth.

upstairs for a while, he glanced out the window to take one last look to see if he could see the iss and instead spotted a very small light making very strange patterns and darting at great speeds horizontally and vertically, he ran downstairs and went out the front door and was screaming a ufo. he called me out and i was like yea sure it's probably an airplane; i saw it and was in shock! i called my wife and other kids out and we were just standing there in amazement, after about 10 minutes of this i was thinking could i shoot this with my point and shoot still camera then i realized that i had bought my daughter a video camera for last christmas, which she never uses, it was still in the box (dead battery, etc, etc) so i had to plug into the outlet on our porch for power and i started shooting, i had never used that camera before so i was figuring it out as i shot the footage.\r\n\r\nalso my daughter had been telling me for a few months now that she had seen a strange

researcher. last night during a skywatch, i filmed something very interesting. there was an apparent water main break down the street from where i was, it was very loud. so i kept looking in that direction. i saw through the trees a bright shiny gold star moving up and slowly above the trees in the neighborhood a few streets away. i honestly thought it was a satellite, but i filmed it anyway. the object clearly on film hovers for an extended time before very very slowly making it's way toward where i was standing. the sky was clear, the weather was about 55 degrees at that moment. i was initially filming under infrared night vision on my sony hdd  dcr sr40 handycam. it records onto a hard disk drive, and there are no tapes or disks. \r\n\r\nas the object made it's way closer from east to west i shut off the infrared night vision and recorded under regular night vision. zoomin in on the object it appeared to be two square white strobing white lights. no faa red or green blinking lights, no nose light on the craft. i will be honest, the object did make a sound of a low airplane or jet sound when it passed over. the sound was strange and sounded muffled or distorted. the object flewover my vantage point and i tried to get it back into focus but could not. i did continue to film as it went out of sight.\r\n\r\nit gets stranger. exactly 10 minutes after the ufo flew over, a helicopter headed from south to east directly where the object originated from. it flew extremely low over the neighborhood. as a finale, a half hour later the same helicopter made another pass-by from east in a horizontal path directly over where the object came from. the helicopter was so low it was near even with the houses.\r\n\r\nyoutube

the blind and we both saw it together.  she agreed that she had not ever seen anything like it. it was really cool to watch.  as the object traveled east, it appeared that a few more of these objects also appeared.  \r\n\r\ni am 30 years old, i own two businesses and i don't drink any alcohol, or use any drugs.  i have always been very sceptical of this kind of stuff, but i am convinced this was not a plane.  this was unlike anything i have ever seen.  \r\n\r\nthese things stayed visible for about 10-15 minutes and then they were gone.  \r\n\r\nplease let me know if you have anyone else that saw this.  both my wife and i did, but then i ran outside because one of my neighbors had just returned from a flight and he had not seen anything.

been watching the skies and had noticed several lights blinking various different colors, lights above the clouds, etcetc, for a few months, and had noticed some marks on my body that i had jokingly suggested were the results of an abduction.  of course nobody believed me but i was alright with that and i was pretty happy to just go outside when my mother asked me to bring out our dog and watch the lights.  \r\nhowever, that particular night i noticed something different, there was a brighter light just above the roof of my apartment complex.  well, obviously i stood there and just stared at it for a minute trying to figure out what it might be, because i'd never seen anything like that before.  it wasn't blinking, it was just staying stationary in the sky but was way too bright to be a star.  for a minute i thought it could be jupiter, though i had no idea whether or not i could see jupiter from where i was at that time during the year because i had recently moved across the country.  then i thought, 'hey, that could be a ufo, you should go get your camera!\" and rushed into the house in order to get it, left my dog there and ran back out to stand exactly where i had been before\r\ni stood there with my camera for maybe thirty seconds, and after that i don't consciously remember being approached by the object nor it getting any closer to me.  i have this sort of unconscious memory, instead, like a marker memory, where the object grew big and bright until it filled up my entire vision and i couldn't see anything but this blinding light.  i couldn't see any features.  i closed my eyes because it got too bright for me to keep them open,a nd then when i opened them again, it was exactly where it had been in the sky.  i was perfectly calm.  i turned, walked back into my house, put down my camera, and tried to figure out what had happened.  i looked at the clock, which i had checked just seconds before going out to take the picture, and found that ten minutes had passed.  i was pretty calm about the entire ordeal, but after that i began noticing weird red marks on the insides of my elbows like needle marks and kept waking up with nosebleeds and getting weird pains in nose and sinus on one side.  they continued for about a month and then stopped. i was calm about those, too, though i probably should have worried at that point, and for some reason felt almost like they were there for some important reason that i was vaguely aware of, but couldn't quite recall.

 prob several hundred feet.\r\nthere were no acq. lights blinking like an airplane..Just the three bright lights in a triangle shape.  i do believe it was a single object.\r\nas fast as it was moving there was no afterburner fire like a jet and there was no after noise as a plane would make.  most of the planes here move from the west to the east.  i called the local airport and they had already shut down their radar as had the airport in shreveport, louisiana.\r\ni called barksdale afb in shreveport and i finally for a response and the officer who's name i didn't get told me that me that the base could neither confirm or deney my sighting. all i know is that the object was moving like a bat out of hell and there was no sound.  i was out in the yard checking on a sick dog of mine.  i noticed it because it is weird to see somthing flying from the north to the south here and at first i though it might be careflight and i was wondering where it was going. it didn't scare me.  i was excited to have seen it as it was the first flying object that i couldn't identify myself as i love planes and i know quite a lot about planes.  i hope that it was the new f23 or a stealth going to barksdale, but of course they wouldn't tell me.  i just wish the afb would tell me that i actually did see something and they can't tell me what it was.  as it is it is just my word against the world.  i know i saw it; just wish someone would just tell me what it was or that they don't know what it was either.   i'm more curius now, and i am going to watch the sky now even more that i have been.  thanks for having this site. wish i had of had my phone camera with me.  i will carry it with me all the time now.  the part that really gets me is that there was no sound with it as it was moving so

down to the street... when i noticed her looking up towards the sky. so i glanced up too. this was around 8pm or so, so it was already dark. i noticed right away what had caught her eye, and i started looking too. at first glance, this looked like a small group of geese flying in a triangular shape like they normally do during migration. i noticed each of the individual objects moving amongst themselves as the whole group traveled across the sky above us. i guess it kept my interest even more because these white colored objects were quite visible even in the dark, unlike a bird would be. and when have you ever seen birds migrating at night anyway? then this triangular shaped group of objects started moving faster.. so i leaped down from the porch to watch them continue to move, but by the time i walked around the corner of the house, my wife said the entire thing vanished. whatever it was, it moved that quickly. and absolutely no sound whatsoever. we both feel we're relatively intelligent, but neither of us can explain what we both saw. it was way to close to be a plane of any sort, and plus there was no sound. it definitely wasn't a weather balloon because it moved way to fast. it's four hours later and i still have no idea what it was.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
