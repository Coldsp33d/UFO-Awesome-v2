stood there, looking up at it as it moved around the sky, other people who were going to or coming from the store also saw it and joined us on my lawn. there were at one time perhaps 12-15 people watching it. it stayed visible and active for a considerable length of time, i remember even getting tired of standing and sat on the grass watching it while it varied from bright, to dim and back several times and moved sometimes at great speed from point to point (there were no tall structures or trees to obstruct our view, which was an arc of about 80 degrees) and suddenly stop, at other times it would lazily meander to another location only to do it again and again. it also changed colors during this display. a milky white, pale blue, yellow glow. always in pastel type colors possibly due to the light cloud cover overhead. it never came close to the ground, always above the wispy cloud cover, so it's actual height was impossible to judge.\r\n  total time, to the best of my

to convey this message.\r\n  i made my 1st sighting report in oct. 4, 2008 which was in s.E. indiana after i overheard (later verified) police scanner traffic @ around 9:30pm regarding a blue flash n-ne from my location some 20 mi. perhaps.  i imediately went outside to look and i saw a starlike object traverse the nw skyline for a few moments and turn a pinkish hue and dissapear over the horizon.\r\n  about 2 weeks ago(can't pinpoint exact date around 03/16/10) in the morning hour i observed what appeared 3 (arc welder's) flashes in sequence of 3 in the ne sky. i can only compare this as looking like the sun glinting off a polished airliner or the above mentioned welder's arc. not sure what it was, there was a jet in the air towards the nw and that's what i was initially looking at when those flashes caught my eye in the ne sky. i can't be positive however, but they may have well been sun reflecting off some white geese(which flew over) for all i know.\r\n   i am 52 yrs. old and have always had a curiousity, since about 10 yr. old, about the subject we refer to as ufo's. it wasn't until about 1 1/2  ago that i began an intensive study of ufology. in my quest to learn as much as possible i realized i had to delve into practically every facet of human life, i.E; history,archeology,science,physics,economics, (exo-)politics,biblical,etc. the list goes on.  for each subject i researched there is also someone famous for their discoveries, insights, research on that particular subject, to which is theorized(by some) correlates to an alien visitation that has occurred throughout human history for reasons of exploration, observation and \"yes\"  perhaps even biological experimentation on us. i believe we have always been observed and not until technology advanced far enough to develope/test the 1st atomic bomb , did they(aliens) begin to make themselves known in our skies near military bases housing bombs.  i believe they have assisted us throughout humanity, steering us away from self destruction with much resistance on our behalf due to hatred and greed.  i also believe that modern world governments/unacknowledged shadow governments and secret societies have had knowledge of unearthly visitors since they were formed and this information is most valueable and sacred, but sightings and visitations have been recorded throughout human existence. \r\n  i believe world governments are in limbo at this point in time on how to disclose what everyone has always wondered in the back of their minds....Irregardless of the countless witnesses of unquestionable backrounds, in all levels of government, airline pilots, scientists who are willing to testify before  congressional hearings regarding ufo's.  however, disclosure would raise very serious issues on the part of our government that even the old excuse \"national security\"  wouldn't hold up from a legal standpoint and would likely destroy credibility on the part of the u.S. creating distrust and perhaps chaos among the masses. i believe disemination- an extremely long game of sherades, has been applied to us through ancient art renderings, illustrations, cave drawings/hyroglyphs to modern tv media and books since the 1st discovery of a ufo/occupants by  any world society at any point in history. disclosure will come at a cost, you can believe that.  if it doesn't benefit those in control 100%, disclosure will not come from humans. after all, isn't  that the only evidence you will believe....Your own lying eyes. open your minds, it is the greatest story ever denied....It's the holy grail of humanity.  i only hope i live long enough to bare witness to what would be \"revelation\" in it's truest sense. a monumental paradigm shift in human history.

the northwest. it was perfectly round and the size of the sun (maybe slightly smaller), but we had no idea how far away it was. it rolled very slowly across the sky, horizontally from right to left (from northeast to southwest), and was trailing orange flames behind it. the ball was engulfed in flames too and the \"rolling\" motion was very clear. if my memory serves, we also heard a deep roar coming from it. i remember watching it for as long as we could; it was at least a minute because it rolled very slowly. we were both saying to each other that we had never seen anything like it before and had no idea what it could be. it was eventually out of sight; i can't remember if it disappeared beyond the horizon or behind mountains. the time was near sunset but there was still a good amount

the lights were in the direction of eastland but possibly further south.\r\n\r\ni spent the last hour before dusk, planting beans and peas in our plowed field.  i had just finished for the day and was standing at the ne corner of the field, with a clear 360 degree view of the sky.\r\n\r\ni was observing a few stars barely discernible above me when something made me look to my south.  suddenly a bright white/orange light appeared, then 4 more next to (east of) it.  the four came on all at once.  they all blinked off at the same time.  these lights were approx. 10 degrees above the southern horizon.  they lights only appeared for a few seconds each time.\r\n\r\ni ran to the house, yelling for my husband to \"come quick, ufos!\" (i didn't know what they were at the time, still don't). i grabbed my binoculars and by the time we got to the field, the lights were gone but as we stood there, a light appeared, then 3 more in a loose triangle formation.  they all blinked out at the same time, then slightly further east they all appeared again.  each time they blinked out, they would appear a bit further east until i could no longer see them because of the treeline.\r\n\r\nmoments later, we saw at least 1 jet flying into that area and it was tiny in comparison to the lights.\r\n\r\nafter the lights were gone, my husband said, \"what is that?\" he pointed up at about 65 -70 degrees ese and said, \"watch that star, it's moving.\"  i watched it through the binoculars.  i told him it was probably a satellite but then the object did something that satellites do not do, it altered course from ene to due east and then a few moments later, it disappeared.\r\n\r\ni contacted robert powell (mufon) and described what i had seen.  we discussed it and he sent me a video of flares he had taken sometime earlier.  my husband (a military aviation veteran) and i watched the video.  the flares in the video did not resemble what we saw tonight.  my husband is adamant that what we saw were not flares and i do not believe they were either.\r\n\r\nevidently we were not the only ones to see these lights tonight.  i have a blog called \"lights in the texas sky\".  a short while ago, someone posted to my blog what they also saw this evening and it matches very closely to what joe and i saw.\r\n\r\nhere is their report/comment:\r\n\r\n\"tonight 3/31/10 around eight thirty pm we saw about 10 flashing lights. it would appear for about 1-3 seconds as a bright orange light, dissapear for about the same time, then come back. but when it reappeared, rather than there only being one there would be multiple. this is about our forth time to see these things and we only see them at night but they are always the same thing. an orange light that flashes a few times then dissapears and we dont see it again the rest of the night.\" \r\n\r\nif i hear back from the poster, i will send any information to mr. powell.\r\n\r\ni am including in this report, 3 depictions of what joe and i saw.\r\n\r\nthank you, sw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
