north (i can view the entire sky over las vegas and my balcony is partially covered so i can sit outside during summer) i witnessed the most unbelievable, most incredible object that i have ever seen in my life.   from out of my left peripheral vision i noticed what i thought was an airplane traveling from west to east.  when i turned my head to the left i saw a giant metallic tube (bright silver) that resembled a giant airplane without wings and without a definitive fuselage or tail.  as i watched this object travel eastward i was able to see the sun shine(reflect) along the side of this object.   as i watched in awe the object slowed and then came to a complete stop right in front of my viewpoint.   there was no wind (i had area rugs hung over my balcony which would sway even in slight wind)  and there were no clouds in the sky, it was a perfectly blue sky.   as this object sat there still (for about 15 seconds) i watched in disbelief as this object's sides began to shrink inward making the object smaller and smaller (shorter and shorter tube) until it became a small point that completely disappeared  in front of my eyes.   this object was completely silent and was moving at a very fast velocity before coming to a complete stop in a matter of seconds.  the entire incident lasted maybe 40 seconds.  the object was extremely high in the sky (i had to tilt my head all the way back to see it) but it was easily visible due to its great size.   i have been watching airplanes all my life and this was no airplane.  i estimate this object must have been the size of at least 10 jumbo-jets.  i have been skeptical about this topic and a non believer in ufos.  this incident has completely changed my life and i feel my mind has expanded 100 fold.

second).\r\n\r\nin any case, just as i looked up, nearly directly overhead, i saw a very brilliant flash that grew more luminous over a period of about 5 seconds.  it was moving, but not very rapidly, even as the light was intensifying, and appeared to be much higher than any passenger airplane flies.  from my perspective, it appeared to move at about 1 cm per second.  the light was bright white and grew in intensity until it was about as bright as a full moon on a clear night, but only a small fraction of its size.  while it was brightly luminescent, it appeared about 10 times as large as the largest star in the sky and equally as bright (ten times as bright as the brightest star in the sky).  after it reached its climax in intensity, it faded to a luminescence equivalent to about that of the average star's intensity.  it continued to move toward the south, but appeared to ascend to an elevation well beyond that of a commercial aircraft, and did so much more quickly than anything i've seen in the sky.  as it ascended and continued southward, it faded progressively.  just before it faded out of sight, it made a sharp ~10��� turn to the left and then faded from view after about another 10 seconds.  the entire incident endured for about 45 seconds.  while it moved more rapidly than anything i've ever seen in the sky (taking into account its apparent elevation), it didn't move like a bullet or take-off so rapidly that i'd have missed it if i'd blinked, as i've heard described in so many other testimonies.  very exciting and, although it was much too far away to see any details, i'm, personally, convinced that what i saw was a ufo that was, also, of extraterrestrial origin (both terms used in their literally/denotatively).","distance":"501 Feet - 1

with my small dogs.  the sky was clear, stars plentiful, a beautiful evening.\r\n\r\ni called one of my dogs back to me but he was interested in something in our driveway, so i walked out away from the house and that is when i saw an orange colored light to my northwest, traveling east.\r\n\r\nthe object suddenly stopped and remained still. it was now located a few degrees west of due north and perhaps 5 degrees above the horizon. it never moved from that position, which was probably close to being directly over crystal falls.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it might be an emergency helicopter, as we are not quite a half mile from the local hospital.  it only took a few seconds to be sure that it was not.\r\n\r\nafter watching for a few minutes, i ran inside and told my spouse, \"you need to see this!\"\r\n\r\ni grabbed my binoculars, flung open our front door and pointed.  he saw it.  he grabbed my binoculars but they were set for me, so he grabbed the other set of binoculars and looked again.  we discussed it and agreed we were seeing the same thing.\r\n\r\nthe light would be a deep red, then it would change to a brilliant orange, then brighten even more, to a yellow white.  every time i spoke out loud that it should come closer, or get brighter, it would flash brightly, then it would dim to red again.\r\nwhat we saw was an horizontally elongated light, with something bright hanging down from the bottom center, like a narrow \"v\".  as we watched, i began to be able to see a slight outline of an object, that the light was attached to (see depiction).  the light was mounted to some type of structure.\r\n\r\nseen from our perspective and without aid, the light was approximately 3 times the magnitude of venus at it's closest to earth.  the light appeared to be several miles away, yet through the binoculars it was fairly large.  after being able to see a faint outline of the object that the light was attached to, i'd have to say the object in total, was massive.\r\n\r\ni took several photos with my small digital camera and watched the object for slightly over an hour.At approximately 01:06, as my spouse and i watched, the light flared up to several times it's original size, then as if by flipping a switch, the entire object disappeared.\r\n\r\nwe both stayed awake until 03:00 but the object did not return. \r\n\r\ni have had many sightings but this is only the second time that my spouse and i have witnessed something like this together.\r\n\r\nfrom my perspective, the object (light) flared brightly and disappeared, while my spouse thinks it exploded, then disintegrated.  whatever it was, we both watched it for over an hour before it disappeared in a flash.\r\n\r\nnote:  this is my own personal sighting.  photos were taken only seconds apart.   depiction shows how the structure appeared, as i viewed it through my binoculars. \r\n\r\nmy spouse and i are in agreement about the 'appendage' appearing to protrude from top and bottom of the light, though he had trouble making out the structure around it.\r\n-sw","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

island ferry, as it traveled southbound from saltspring island to swartz bay, north of victoria, b.C.\r\n\r\nusing binoculars, i was following a pair of cormorants darting about one-another, one-hundred yards east of the boat. they appeared to be at a height of between seventy and one-hundred feet above the ocean water. i then saw what appeared to be an extremely bright, circular blob, of mercury/chrome light, above them and further east. \r\n\r\ni describe it as a blob because the light resembled a blob of mercury undulating very slightly, from oval to round. and chrome, because it resembled the bright, shiny bluish surface of freshly polished chrome. i would say that it appeared to be about three-kilometers in distance (there are small islands dotting the region) and it was clearly between our ferry and morseby island further east at thirty to forty degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nmy very first impression was, that it was the landing light of an aircraft on approach to victoria international airport, to the south/west of our position. the light then immediately changed its shape to that of a long cigar shape. my first impression was, that it was three-hundred feet in length. now, its shading appeared to be like brushed aluminum similar to that used in the skin of passenger aircraft. it no longer glowed like the light from before, and it was clearly, a three-dimensional object. i thought, it's an airliner on approach to sydney's nearby, victoria international airport. but, it just couldn't be, it lacked wings, windows, and notably, it had no tail section. it was, for all intents and purposes, an aluminum cigar tube suspended in the sky.\r\n\r\nseeking additional witnesses, i turned to the couple nearby and asked \"do you see that?\", and then quickly turned back to look at the object. to my dismay and great disappointment, it was gone. the nearby, single engine, otter float plane, that was near to it but farther away, was still in evidence, but the ball and tube were no where to be seen. my fellow passengers asked me what i had been referring to, and all i could do was mumble something about, how much fun the birds were having today. \r\n\r\ni continued to search the sky for anything matching its description but saw nothing else. the float plane continued on, toward vancouver island. i walked the passenger deck listening to my other passengers conversations, hoping to hear mention of the object. nothing. .  \r\n\r\nafter arriving at swartz bay, i stopped and made a call to harbour air, at coal harbour, vancouver. i spoke with their go-to guy and he said that the float plane i had seen might have been one of theirs, but none of their pilots had reported anything unusual. he had enough personal interest to put in a call to the pilot of the last plane to arrive in victoria. i waited and eventually was told that nothing had changed. \r\n\r\ni remember thinking to myself, someone new i had seen the object and that they were embarrassed my seeing it.\r\n\r\ni let it go and thought nothing of it until, i inadvertently watched a podcast called, \"dan ackroyd, unplugged on ufo's\". during the  podcast they aired footage taken in venice, california, in 2004. during the podcast i recognized the very same characteristics of light and motion as appeared in the circular object i first noted, on august 2nd, 2007.

don't believe my little brother or sister were with me, but my mom was. as we were driving home, in the later hours of rush hour, i noticed 9 white lights pretty close to the ground. the lights seemed to form three triangles, 3 lights per triangle at the tips. the triangles seemed to just hover above the hightway for everyone to see. being dark, you could barely make out the craft, but surrounding lights helped a bit. both me and my mom are largely skeptic and the both of us are atheist, so my mom passed it off as something explainable, but i was transfixed. we eventually passed it on our way home, and i never saw the lights since.\r\n two or three years later, i learned about the belgian triangle incident. the craft seen was largely similar to the ones i had seen, and the habits of the craft reported were the same. both seemed to hover slowly and over large numbers of people. i am not sure what it was, and i have considered the possibility that it was a blimp of some sort, or a sattelite, but none of the blimps common to the area during tpc golf season(the approximate time of the event) emitted lights in that arrangement and the lights were too close to belong to a sattelite i assume. so maybe it's a type of aircraft? i'm not ready to go ahead and say it's of alien origin, because i'm not a believer of extraterrestrial visitation, although i'm open to the possibility if enough evidence ever comes forth and i do believe in extraterrestrial life in some shape or form in the universe. the question of what i saw has eaten at me for four years now, and after finding this

and once again the government still blundered the recon. so many questions yet aint no answersfor them. like i said i will not go into to manny details, for political reasons that im not the least the

diego, ca at 8:30 pm pst.  through the trees i saw a flash of white light which streaked from the west to the east resembling a meteor streak, but more close.  i got up off my chair and looked directly above our condominium.  i then saw the underbelly shadow of something smoothly gliding to the south. it was barely detectable, but with the bright moonlit sky i clearly saw wingtips.  i don't believe it made any sound, but it was hard to tell since we live near an airport and there was an incoming plane arriving in the flight path to the airport.  the entire sighting lasted no longer than 10 seconds.  i am an avid sky watcher and this was not a normal event.  the plane was completely dark aside from the flash of light it emitted which drew my attention to it.  it reminded me of batman's batplane.  perhaps a drone plane of some sort taking a photo.  i did watch for from the roof our building for the next 45 minutes and it did not return.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22547,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7188892,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03292010-0001","longitude":-117.1522151,"occurred":1269747000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cross,

 i saw what looked and behaved like a shooting star.  it came from left to right, appeared like a star and disappeared just before the tree line, like a shooting star might.  i would say shooting star was what i saw except 2 factors 1. it was at a football game with lights and all that and that would make it hard to see a shooting star.  i will however give credit that if you go near where the players have practice behind the bleachers you can see the stars.  2. i watched many shooting stars 2 nights in a row just before the sighting. they are hard to see with many lights.  which reminds me we saw what we thought were airplanes chasing each other and probly what it was but thats another story.  call me crazy and just making up it was a ufo and not a shooting star but i stand behind my experience, and will back it up.
