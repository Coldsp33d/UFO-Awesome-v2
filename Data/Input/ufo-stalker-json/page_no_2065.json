need to be taken seriously right now i am not carzy or a lier just because people did not see it does not mean it did not happen..\r\n\r\nit was may 3 2008 im pretty sure. it was about 2:00 in the morning i was at my fiances moms farm near kisbey in south east saskatchewan. iwas out late with a buddy sitting on the deck it was a nice warm clear night a good night to just sit back and look at the stars while we talked about our alien theories and what not..Anyways at around 2:00 we noticed a set of lights out in the feild behind the house they were about 600 700 yards away and very low to the ground from what we could see. we stared at them for about 10 mins trying to figure out what they were they appeard to be moving in a circular motion and flashing in a pattern from left to right. we decided to get a better view so we walked up to a near by hill and crouched down but when we did all other lights around faded out of sight except for the rotating lights, at first we thought it was a semi on a dirt road but it just sat there and was far to long to be a semi at such a far distance. so we decided to walk back to the house as we got back onto the deck we saw a bright falsh of light shoot off into the sky the light looked like it came from the object in the field, the light looked kinda like a flar but it was in the shape of what looked like pac-man it only lasted a few seconds and then faded and at about that time we started to hear twigs snapping in the trees all around the house and what sounded like light foot steps in the tall grass we went inside and grabbed a flashlight, when we got outside we walked close to the treeline looking for whatever was in the bushes and then out of nowhere our flashlight died but we kept going i dident want to but i dident want to seem like a baby infront of my buddy anyways everytime we got close to the tree line we would hear a sound on the opposite side of us when we went towards the sound it would move to another part of the tree line almost like there was multiple creatures in the bush and they would make noise anytime we got close to one so that we couldent see it. we did this for about a half hour by the time we got back to the deck it was almost 3:30am we were already scared. my buddy came up with a little test to see if we were alone he is very smart and clever in his mind but what he would do is yell out \"if you can understand me snap a twig\" and sure enough we heard a loud snap come from the trees i jumped and said a few bad words. then we decided to try another test we went to one side of the yard and ran to the other side as we did we heard something crash through the bushes toward us as if it was eagar to follow us but it stayed in the bushes we were so scared that in mid run we turned on a dime and ran towards the house in fear we went back on to the deck and sat for a min to catch our breath and analize in our heads  what we just heard after a few mins we decided to walk down the ramp behind the house that led around the house to the driveway as we got to the corner of the house we saw something standing in the driveway we could not see its face but it just stood there. we stared at it for about 30 seconds or so when we heard a low whine noise come from behind us we turned to look but found nothing when we looked back to see the creature standing in the driveway it was gone. (the creature was about 6 foot 3 or so it had long arms and a round head but had no clothing from what we could see.)anyways as i was saying i was scared i really wanted to go inside so we decided to go inside. we walked towards the house we had our backs toward the house staring at the driveway when out of nowhere we heard what sounded like a loud gust of wind that slamed a bush near the front door right up against the house and it was loud i did a full 360 jump when we looked at the bush it was pretty much pressed up against the hous i was shaking so bad i had to sit down. when i was on the ground my buddy was infront of me talking to me as i looked up at him i saw a large black shadow on the roof looking down at us as i told him to look it darted away it was really fast, i got up and we ran to the back of the house to see what it was but there was nothing at about that time we noticed a large object in the shape of a triangle move across the sky above the house it had 3 lights on it one on each corner but there was no sound we could feel a slight vibration on the ground but yet no sound, it moved very slow about 10 miles an hour then all of a sudden a bright light luminated the yard and it sped of heading south at an incredible speed then it was gone. a strong sulpher smell filled the air in total shock we went inside and down to my buddy room so that we could regroup and get our minds straight so we could figure out what just happened we did not sleep for the rest of the night we were to scared. about 3 nights later my buddy woke up gasping for air and it was loud enough to wake me and i was in another room i went to see if he was okay he said he could not remember his dream but it felt like something was pressing really hard on his chest and then once againg the strong sulpher smell filled the room but only for about 2 mins. after that for about 3 weeks we had weird dreams constinly smelled sulpher and seen weird lights in the sky almost every night.. i had one dream that was exactly the same for 2 nights in a row i dreamed that i was abducted and taken to a strange place where i was stuck with a needle like object in the corner of my eye i could not speak, scream, or move then everything would go black and id wake up. when i would wake up it would be mornig but it felt like i only slept for a few mins.\r\n\r\nto this day we still see strange lights in the sky others have witnessed it as well but i will never forget that night ever it was the most frightning thing i have ever gone through....

nasa, the white house, and some other ufo tracking website. \r\n we saw a light on 09/19/09 at about 8:30 (or closer to quarter 'til nine) while on vacation in dewey beach, de.\r\nmy husband and i took our two kids and dog to the beach at night because the children had never been on the beach at night time and dogs were now allowed.\r\ni decided to take the dog back to the house. i turned to look back at my family (they were about 80 feet away)when i noticed a brightly lit, silent object directly above and just to the right of them. i ran back thinking that it was a helicopter search light and that they would be hurt by blowing sand.  wrong.  thant was just the mind trying to rationalize. this object was extremely low. lower than a hotel but higher than a house. i yelled ���look up!��� and that���s when they saw it. i suppose they didn���t notice it because it seems like the light made a fog (the fog ���made��� a cloud at the bottom that was so dense that the light didn���t touch the ground) -but the light was on the water. the bright circular object & the associated fog jerked to the left and now it was directly above their heads above their heads; so i ran back to them and we stood there in shock. not a sound. the dog didn���t even seem to care. we too were not afraid, but felt curious.  i can't tell if it was a craft or if the light was coming from a hole like a dimension if that makes sense. this is the strange part....My family saw a light with nothing fancy about it... me, the light was perfectly white and circular with a dark center and a dark line going from the center to the right edge of the circle. i kept sawing, why is it dark in the middle like that and they said it wasn't. i pointed to exactly what i was talking about and they saw something different. it felt like i was showing them a sapphire bracelet and they were seeing rubies. our experience was less than a minute. the light just vanished or went out(silly me for blinking or perhaps it was my angle under the fog-cloud.) but my husband and one daughter stated that the light did go out but then in about one second it had shot itself from right above our heads straight up. we totally expected to see this in the newspaper since a small plane was in the area (within a mile or two) and passed right behind it.  a few weeks later i was youtubing  some terms and came across a news program that was discussing it.  of course the news program didn't mention delaware so i thought i would let you know in case you documented this even.\r\n\r\nthis is exactly what we saw: http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=zqustezhy3g\r\n\r\nif you go to the site below, you will see that so many saw this at the exact same time across the us and canada not just the east coast on september 19, 2009 (like a code huh?) they all appeared at the same time, for the same duration and they all jerked in a direction before vanishing.  none of the 200 or so witnesses claimed to have felt any fear just curiosity... that's interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Ufoworldnews.Com/2009/09/19/bright-light-in-the-sky-emanating-an-intense-cone-shaped-light-and-trailing-smoke-or-fog/comment-page-1/#comment-2145\r\n\r\n\r\ni'll

it just \"winked out\"). meanwhile, the other three lights were slowly converging on the same area where the #1 light disappeard.  the #2 light slowly moved towards the east and disappeared in about the same place a few seconds (maybe 30 secs) later.  as the other two were converging on that area of the sky, another light (#5) began to come up from the area where the #4 light had been at first sighting (this all took about 3-5 minutes).  about 1 minute later the #3 light disappeared in the same section of sky as #1 and #2, and about a minute after that, another light appeared (#6) from the same area as #4 and #5, continuing upward, angling toward where the other lights had disappeared.  within approx. 4-5 minutes more, all but #6 had \"winked out\".  #6 seemed to stay in place for about 20-30 seconds after the #5 light had gone out, then slightly and slowly angled to the area where the others disappeared, and \"winked out\".  we stayed for a couple of minutes more, then went inside.\r\n\r\nwe obviously talked about it while it was happening and afterwards, but everyone was baffled and said they had never seen anything like it.  we discussed that we didn't think it could be helicopters because they came what seemed to be too close to each other before they blinked out, and there was absolutely no noise.  we also agreed that they could not have been flares, due to no smoke trails, and their speed was very slow.  their direction also seemed purposeful as the lights seemed to curve in their ascent towards the spot where they all blinked out, although they did not seem to radically change direction.  a couple of us suggested they may be \"weather balloons\" with lights, but none of us knew if weather balloons are used anymore, and everyone thought their ascent to the spot where they disappeared was very purposeful.  the lights were very bright and i don't remember noticing the placement of the moon.  we never witnessed any \"zipping around\" or fast movement, except the #6 light seemed to move slightly faster after it's pause, but still slowly.  the sky seemed to us to be clear of any visible clouds where we were looking.  there was no ambient light that i noticed other than the disappearing lights to show anything in the dark sky, and the disappearing lights did not cast ambient light on anything that we could see.  several people used their cellphones to capture a picture of the lights, but sadly i didn't have my cellphone with me.  i can't really estimate the height of the area where the lights blinked out, but it seemed very high in the sky and fairly far from us - they were far away enough for us to discuss the fact that it was probably over the oregon coast, or even over the wster.  after the slight pause before disappearing, the #6 light seemed to move slightly faster, but still slowly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":22526,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.4422169,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03272010-0014","longitude":-123.3209925,"occurred":1269661500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1269751191000,"summary":"Several lights moving up in atmosphere from sw lower sky in s-sw portion of sky ","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Grants Pass, Oregon","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:138710"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was coming out of work, walking across the parking lot.  i am in the habit of looking at the sky.\r\nnoticed an amber light.  it looked like a plane coming in for a landing, but very far out.  the humidity was high. no stars visible.

dropping bombs.  i didn���t think it was a ufo at this point, i thought it was an army helicopter or other army aircraft.  i left my room to go get my mom���s camera and returned with her and the

open.  it was then i saw that the smaller crafts that were dropped were all clustered and flying around in unusual patterns in the north west sky out of my window.  i looked at them for four hours and couldn���t figure it out.  i���m positive that they were what came out of the orange glowing craft.  they would fly diagonally, horizontally, vertically, and make turns that couldn���t possibly be made by any aircraft here on earth.  i seen them appear from point a to point b.  there was no trace of light as they flew because it was so fast.  they, like the orange ufo, were silent.  i watched them from 1:00 am to about 5:00 am then i thought i had enough and shut the blinds and tried to sleep.  i didn���t see when, or if, they left, but i did hear a loud and unusually low jet fly by a

year ago i was looking at stars and this caught my eye. at first this object would only change colors. red, white or orange are the colors i would see the most. as nights went by i would regularly check out this object. one particulary night i was looking at this object pretty hard and it seemed to start to get brighter almost as if it was moving closer to me. and it was, it got so close and so bright i could even see a red ball of light rotating around it. which explained it turning red at times. i even decided to show some of my friends and they were surprised at what they were seeing too. \r\n\r\nabout a month ago i was looking out the window just checking it out like normal. although this time i was concentrating very hard on it. suddenly the slight movements i had seen in the past (ones that kinda made me think i was crazy)turned into full out zips across the sky. when this first happened i was terrified and went into the house and locked the doors. now whenever i get bored at night i go to my window and look at the object just to pass time. and as crazy as this sounds when i'm staring at the object, in my mind i'll be thinking about what way i'd like to see the object move and sure enough it will move that way. another night i was looking at the object and it was pretty bright. so i thouht i would photograph it so i went inside to get my camera. when i came back outside it was so far away i could barely see it. i took the camera back inside and when i came back out it was bright again. last night after watching this object move so rapidly through the sky i felt i had to let someone know that mattered.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path

my friend was driving and i was in the passenger seat with my head against the window, dozing. we were driving down the 91 freeway in riverside, in the slow lane, headed towards the 57 freeway to costa mesa, where we lived. as we were driving, i noticed the sign on the freeway said we were at weir canyon. as it was a saturday night, there was alot of traffic on the freeway. i closed my eyes and began to relax for the long ride home. as i began to doze, a distinct thought came to my mind. the thought said, \"turn your head and look out the window.\" i turned my head, and i saw a red \"ball shaped\" object that looked like it was perhaps 20 to 30 feet away from me. as we were in the slow lane, there was nothing beyond that but the shoulder of the freeway. no houses, no lights, just barren fields, completely dark. i thought the red ball odd, as i had traveled that freeway many times and that area is totally undeveloped. nothing there. as we drove, i noticed the ball was keeping up with us. i didn't say anything at the moment to the driver. i just watched it. finally i said, \"why don't you speed up a little.\" she did and the ball kept up. i strained to look at it, to see if it was a reflection of some kind, possibly from our own car. i said to her, now slow down a little, so she slowed the car, and the ball was still right with us. she asked what i was doing, and i told her about the ball. she looked and saw it too. she pulled over on the shoulder and stopped. we got out to look at it, and it disapeared. i figured it was a reflection. so i took the wheel this time, and waited for the traffic to move ahead so i could get out in the lane. this time, i moved to the center lane, turned on the radio and began to cruise home. all of a sudden, i saw what looked to me like white car lights coming toward me in my lane. i called her attention to it, and she became frightened. it looked exactly like a potential head on collision. i looked to my right and left, to see if i could move in to another lane to get away from it, but the traffic was heavy on both sides and in back of me. i couldn't move in any direction. i layed on the horn, the lights were comming closer, i couldnt change lanes. this all happened in a split second, or so it seemed to me. i slammed on my brakes, knowing i would surely get hit from behind. i brought my knees up behind the wheel and covered my face with my hands, waiting to be hit from the back and head on. i waited, but nothing happened. when i uncovered my face, i saw that the lights in front of me in my lane, was not in my lane at all, but \"above\" my lane. i watched it moving slowly. i could see the front of it. it was arch shaped in the front, like a horseshoe shaped bumber, with a purplish hue around it and three huge lights under it. it moved slowly over my car, and i turned to watch through the back window and saw it move slowly away. it was enormous. i opened the door and got out. there was no sound from the craft, no sounds of any kind. at that moment, i noticed there was no traffic on the freeway. it was completely empty. there was no one. i took the keys to start the car, and realized i had not shut it off when i slammed it in to park, yet it was off. i started the car and sped off, scared to death, running red lights all the way home. when i got home, i looked at the clock. it was 4:30 in the morning. i couldn't understand why it was so late. i was tired and confused. i went to bed. when i woke up the next morning, i didnt feel well. i told a neighbor about what i saw. he said \"lets go back tonight, and see if we can see something.\" fear shot through me. i didn't want to go, but they razed me until i went. as we traveled down the same freeway, we came up to weir canyon again. i noticed there was aprox 50 cars pulled over on the shoulder, with people standing outside their cars, looking up. we did the same thing. there must have been a thousand of those red balls darting back and forth, flying around, like playing tag with each other. then suddenly an enormous white light, just popped on in the middle of the sky. the crowd gasp, and then the light went off again. i jumped in to the car and drove down the freeway to the next underpass and got off, going to the gas station at the bottom. i asked the gas attendent there if there was an airport near. he said there was. it was a light plane airport not far from there. i decided to go there to check it out, but before i could go, a huge white helicopter, with blacked out windows, flew over the overpass and hovered over my car. it looked like military, but i couldn't be sure. the blades were kicking up dust so bad, i couldn't hardly keep my eyes open, but i did see the pilot clearly. it hovered over my car for several minutes, then it flew off in the direction i had just come from. i knew this was no mistake, no coincedence. this all had something to do with what i had seen the night before. i went to the airport and watched the planes coming in and out for over an hour. no way was there anything there that even remotely resembled what i saw on either night. after that, i went home, and went to work the next morning. i wasnt feeling well, so i decided to make a doctors appointment. i went the following day. they did some test, and bloodwork. when i left the doctor, i couldnt find my car in the parking lot. it took me over an hour to find it. once i got in, i had forgotten how to start the car. when i finally got it started i got lost on the way to work. when i finally got there to pick up my friend, my shift was over and we went home. she said she felt sick too. she cried for three days, not knowing why. i asked her what was wrong, she said she didnt know. she just cried, she suffered severe depression which was unusual for her. i went to work and found i couldnt remember how to operate my machine. i had trouble walking, as my gate was completely off. to make a long story short, over aprox a months time, i slowly and surely deteriorated, little by little. i lost my job, my car, and my home, as i got sicker and sicker, becoming incapable of supporting myself. i developed a stutter that i had never had before in my life. my head and neck tilted to the right and was unable to straighten it. my doctor said for some reason, my autonomic nervous system was shot. i did not tell him what happened that night, as i believed he would think i was crazy. i was sick like that, and on medications for three years. it took three years for me to re-learn how to drive again. it has been years now, and although i am able to work, it has been a hard climb up. i still have lingering disabilities from this. all these years, i have been looking for anyone who witnessed what i saw those two nights. i have been looking for answers, and have found nothing. i watched a documentary the other night and learned of your organization, which is why i'm writing you now. i have no photos of it. i have blogged for years to try to find anyone at all who saw what i saw. i have had no luck. today, i still have memory problems in that i still have no sense of direction, and can get lost in my own neighborhood. my walking gate never got better, and i still stutter from time to time. i don't know what happened to me, but something sure did.","distance":"20 Feet or
