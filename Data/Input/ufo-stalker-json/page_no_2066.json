the 2 middle kids with him, and, he was traveling ahead of us going north on pennville road....My sister and i were talking when, suddenly, to our right, we saw this huge greyish colored \"disc\" pop down under the clouds....We both were shocked by it! my sister and i, at the same time, exclaimed, \"did you see that!!!!!?\" as fast as it descended (which only took less than a few seconds..) it immediately shot straight back up into the sky!!...I exclaimed that it had to be a ufo, and my sister gave me the \"evil eye\" and said,\"no, it was just a shooting star..\" i told her she was crazy, and, to avoid an argument, i just let it drop....It was pretty dark that night, out in the middle of the country..There were no street lights...The thing had to have been huge, because it looked to be bigger than her mini-van..It all happened in a split second...I have seen shooting stars..They look bright, and appear to be somewhat small...Also, they usually don't shoot right back straight up into the sky!!! the disc had a \"glowing\" characteristic about it..Not bright, but, bright enough for us to see it...Another strange thing that happened,was that we were headed to a \"t\" in the road..It intersects with u.S.40....As we got to the intersection, an unmarked, white police car, with blacked out wheels came squealing off of u.S. 40 headed south...Keep in mind that we were out in the \"boonies\" at about 10:30-11:00 at night...We didn't pass any accidents, and didn't see anything suspicious (except for the disc...)  there wasn't any other traffic on the road that night...He could have been responding to an emergency, but, the coincidence really unnerved me....It all happened so fast! my sister and i just let it drop...We didn't mention it again! as large as the disc appeared to be, i would approximate it to have been probably about 1-2 miles away from us....I have never seen anything like it before, or

pst, 3/24/2010. i had just left the riverside area. i noticed a object in the air over an open field on the northbound side of the interstate. at first glance, i thought the object was a helicopter. as my car approached the object, however, i discerned a rectangular shape and noticed that the object was stationary in the air. i estimate the object was roughly 500 - 700 feet above the ground, and approximately 60 - 90 feet long on the side facing me. it was generally light gray in color...Nearly the ambient color of the sky at that time. it had lights along the exterior edges, and a flashing red light on one end.\r\n\r\nmy wife was in the car with me at the time. she thought the object might be a helicopter (she made that observation after we had passed the object and it was no longer visible). i had suspected this myself when i first noticed the object in the distance, but changed my mind as we passed it by and i was able to view it more closely. she did not view the object as we passed by. we were traveling at approximately 70 mph. \r\n\r\ndue to the traffic conditions at the time, i was not able to immediately pull over in order to observe this object more closely. i was going to do so approximately a quarter-mile down the highway...But when i looked in the rear-view mirror at where the object should be, it was gone. \r\n\r\ni estimate 1 minute 15 seconds elapsed between the moment when i first noticed the object, to when i was able to discern that it wasn't a helicopter. i searched for a place to pull over (paying close attention to traffic), looked in the rear-view mirror, and noticed the object was gone.\r\n\r\nthis incident strikes me as unusual as i am typically able to discern types of aircraft under most visibility conditions (i was in the military and so am accustomed to viewing all kinds of helicopters). this one was highly unusual due to the rectangular shape of the object. it stuck in mind, because this is the first time i have ever witnessed what amounts to a ufo in my life.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

at 8pm. from my yard i can see many flights preparing to get into their landing paths as ohare is east of me, but this was different. looking east from carol stream to what appeared to be in the direction of ohare there was a cluster of bright lights in a horizontal line that remained stationary, bright and flashed red and orange at this point (almost spinning) some moving in and out of vision and some staying, but the ones that disappeared returned to sight after just seconds. \r\n\r\nfor the most part they stayed in a horizontal line or moved to a semi circle formation with some disappearing and returning and some disappearing all togehter. but there are consistantly 2-3 bright, glowing pulsating orbs that just don't move at all.  \r\nassuming they were planes, i continued to watch them to make sure they were moving lower to land, but it didn't happen. the distance from the ground wasn't changing.\r\n\r\ni grabbed my camera, jumped in my car and drove about 2 miles east to the mall parking lot where the lights were still there pulsating and moving in and out of the picture/videos i've included.\r\n\r\nstill not convinced, or maybe just freaked at this point and amazed that no one else was seeing what i saw, i drove another approx 2 miles east to a parking lot that's on a hill where i was able to get additoinal shots of the view where these orbs were still visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing visible from my back yard that night, i've checked every night since at various time to see if it was possibly planes in a holding pattern, but it's not happened since. i hadn't really noticed them spinning/pulsating from the naked eye, but noticed when i viewed the videos.\r\n\r\nthe first video was from the mall parking lot (2 miles east of my house) adn the second video was from the hilled parking lot (4 miles east of my house).  i used just a cannon digital camera and have litle skill and apparently shakey hands, but tried to zoom in/out so you can see the landscape.  i also have some pictures as well. \r\n\r\nkeep in mind the line of bright white lights in the video under the white and orange pulsating orbs are actually street lights.  keep you eye right above them to see the pulsating orbs moving in and out of view (video 2)\r\n\r\nthe picture quality is not very good, but zoom in on the lone orange orb high above the street lights. maybe a plane,but in line with vid 2 and the orbs.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and it was approx 40 degrees.  i'm sorry for the quality of the videos, but it was the best i could so at the time.

approached this object i was waiting for the moment when i could tell myself \"its just a plane\". i didn't get to do that. it was some sort of space ship or unknown something! looked like it was not of this world. it resembled a claw, kinda like the ones you use to win prizes at carnivals. except it had four \"claws\". neon blue lights at the tip of each one, they were hard to see until i got close, the shape of the claws were seemingly designed to hide the light. once i drove under the craft i noticed it had four white lights under the very center of the craft. these were not the same bright lights that i noticed from far away,those were like headlights and there were five of those, small outside lights medium sized towards the center and one big light in the center. the four white lights under the center had a small red light directly in the center of them, this was also the center of the bottom of the craft. once i passed the craft, i could not see it any more when i looked back.\r\n\r\n\r\none last thing is the physical part of this craft was blacker than the night sky. i got a real good look at this thing and will attach a sketch as soon as possible.

it...It is spearing orbs with it..I have seen this before of orbs getting speared by light beams..\r\ni have know idea why the spear the orbs ...Do they eat the orbs, recycle the orbs,...Or do they do

reminded me of the old cars they called roadsters where  the wheels were protruded and had a mental covering.  i continued on my way. i would have pulled over but it was very dark and the highway was

message back but when i tried to follow up i recieved no more messages. me and my son were driving home from st.Louis,hes 12, im 31. on the interstae still within view of the arch behind us my son pointed out jokingly that an \"airplane was on fire\". i looked up and it was up in the air in front of us not moving. we looked at it. i was trying to find anything to explain it off as an airplane or helicopter but i couldnt. it started moving and went right over top of us. it shocked us so much that we turned around to get a better look.By the time we turned around it went over topv cahokia mounds, a local native american earthen pyramid site. and was over top east st. louis in a matter of a second. wewere driving roughly toward it, back towards st.Louis when it lit up very bright and shot toward lambert airporet. in that direction anyway. now the reason i am e mailing you now is because just last night my friend saw the exact same thing in the exact same spot. i never showed him the pictures that me and my son drew of thwe craft. his drawing was about 90% the same as my sons. i would highly appreciate a connection with someone in the st. louis area that i could go into more detail about this. it was the second time ive seen this craft in the same area. i saw it about two years ago in the exact same spot as well but wrote it off as an airplane.My phone number is *** *** ****. i would really like to talk to anyone about this to see if anyone else has experienced this in the same area. i dont know if it has anything to do with the ancient native american site or the arch in st. louis or lambert air port, or even scott airforce base. i would like to keep this anonymous please. i dont want my son getting anything froim kids at his school. thank you for your time. also i have detailed info that me and my son wrote down about ten min, after the event that i could share. i have audio of me and my son seeing this and my son has a very pixelated picture on his cameraphone. any help would be very much appreciated, i dont know where to go. thank you...
