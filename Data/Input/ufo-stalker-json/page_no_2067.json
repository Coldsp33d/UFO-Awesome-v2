most. then as i was looking, i realized i was seeing something else.  i probably would not have noticed it at all had it not been for the illuminated \"windows\" in the object--because it seemed to be about the same color or darkness as the sky. there were no lights on it whatsoever and i could see no projections such as wings. the row of windows was very very long. my impression was that it was much longer than a passenger aircraft (maybe 3 times as long). the long row of windows seemed to be \"undulating\". i could not judge for sure, but my general impression was that it was flying very very low. as i was watching it, i felt it was moving very slowly, but after it was gone i decided it must have been faster than i thought. i think i only saw it for less than 1 or 2 minutes. it was flying toward the nw. as it went out of sight, i hurried to the other windows to see if i could see it, but i could not. as i was watching it, i seemed to be aware of a low hum, but if i hadn't been

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was camping solo in an area i have spent 1000's of hours at and camped at 80+ times, so was very famaliar with the terrain and night sky, as i often stargaze and watch planets/ meteors there. i have never seen anything like what i'm about to describe. \r\n  shortly before dark (the sun was just about to go over the ridgeline) i was in an open boulderfield in the appalachain mtns. the altitude here was about 4000+ ft, and is just 1.5 miles from the blue ridge parkway. there was close to an hour of daylight/twilight left, and i was about to return to camp and build a fire.\r\n  i was watching the sunset and noticed a silver, metallic looking light. it first appeared to be a plane with sunlight glinting off of it. i thought little of it, and began idly flicking my led headlamp on and off to ensure it worked before i hiked back to camp. when i looked back up the light had grown closer, and something was odd about it. i realized it was circular and that i was now looking at the bottom of the craft.(note: i've always wondered if it was attracted by my led light flicking on/off.)\r\n  it made no sound whatsoever, was flying at least a few hundred ft over the treeline (trees grow about 100 ft there), and was moving fairly slowly. at this point i sorta froze and knew i was witnessing something strange.\r\n  it flew just off to my left over the trees, and at this point i could clearly see details of the craft. it had 4 thin pie wedges at equal intervals around the edges that cut into the circle. a cross-like pattern of lights (white and yellow) ran across the bottom. there was also a mechanical look to the surface on the bottom (as it was directly overhead, i never got a good look at the top except from far away). some areas appeared raised and more silvery, while other areas appeared indented and darker. whether this was a color difference or just shadows is difficult to say. \r\n  at this point i was overwhelmed by what i was seeing but remained as calm as possible and tried to remember every detail, as i did not have a camera, and no one else appeared to be around. i really wish i had a camera or cell-phone with me as their was still enough light to clearly see many details of this craft and was flying maybe 400-800 ft overhead. a photo of this would have been one of the clearest and most convincing ever because of daylight conditions, clear weather, and it's low altitude.\r\n  because of the strangeness of this object, i had difficulty determining its size, but it appeared slender in height, and perhaps 150-250 ft in diameter.\r\n  it flew over the trees to my left, towards price park off the blue ridge parkway and was gone.\r\n  i then became a little nervous about camping solo that night, but decided to return to camp, calm down and trust my instincts. i noticed and heard or saw nothing strange so decided to stay overnight.\r\n  however, that night i did notice a very strange thing. i am an expeirienced camper, solo and with friends, but solo you hear every little sound in the woods at night. you become in tune.\r\n  i had camped out there the previous night and the woods was filled with sounds of nightbirds, insects, and small animals rustling around. the night i saw the object nothing was heard and i saw no insect activity around my campsite. i also must report i saw no strange lights and saw nothing unusual that night. what was striking was the lack of activity- i've camped there many times in the summer and it's never that quiet. the weather conditions had remained constant both nights too, with clear skies and no rain. sometimes incoming fronts or rain will cause birds and insects to reduce activity( i assume they are sheltering), but there was no rain during this period of time.\r\n  i have only seen strange lights one other time (at night), but i have never seen anything like the disk i saw that day. overall, it appeared like a much smaller version of the craft from independence day movie. it was not a plane, balloon, star ,planet, glider, etc. i was not on drugs or drinking at this time either. i have never seen anything unusual in the sky since.(this was 8 years ago,i am now 38)\r\n  wish i had more evidence, hope this helps your research. feel free to e-mail me, but i would like to remain as anonymous as possible.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then

i told everyone that there was an object over in the sky. everyone thought it was a u.F.O., even me. i could still see the object at my house, but i had to go inside and go to bed. before i went inside, it had started moving very slowly towards the ese. i guessed it would have lasted about five minutes longer until it disappeared over the herizon after i went inside. \r\n\r\ncan anybody tell

of planes and birds flying about, i was very drawn to sky watching yesterday march 22, 2010.  i am a very experienced observer of man-made and natural airborne objects.  i have been to 3 air shows at offutt afb and constantly monitor the skies for anomalous activity.  yesterday, my partner and i must have seen 3-5 bald eagle, multiple hawks, and of course the gulls that seem to fly between the various lakes around omaha.  while watching various birds and planes in the backyard with naked eye and binoculars around 5:15-20pm, i noticed a commercial jet approaching from the sw at standard altitude.  commercial jets fly towards eppley airfield over our benson neighborhood quite frequently and seem to almost be gliding in with the engines barely audible at times.  this was a twin-jet, but i couldn���������t discern the airline since the sun was very bright in the sw sky.  in an attempt to determine the airline, i focused my 8x27 bushnell binoculars on the jet.  flight aware data shows the plane as aal576, a mcdonnell douglas md-83 (twin-jet).  this is consistent with my observations, though i didn���������t get a chance to read anything on the plane.  though i must say, i wasn���������t disappointed! \r\n\r\nonce the plane was almost over the gable of the east-facing side of the house from my vantage point on the edge of our patio, i got it in binocular view.  then something amazing occurred.  as you know, i have had multiple ufo sightings since december 2008.  but this was very shocking!  out of nowhere, appeared a self-contained disc-shaped object.  i cannot say with certainty which direction the ufo came since i was looking through binoculars and had just gotten the jet into focus.  to my best recollection, it came in very quickly along side or a bit higher than the jet.  but i cannot say from which direction.  i was just baffled that any object would come so close to a jet.  there has to be some kind of radar signature for this thing, unless it can avoid such detection!  for obvious reasons, i then ignored the jet and locked in on this amazing craft.  the motion was at first a bit unstable as it seemed the craft was trying to maybe right itself in the windy conditions.  i could not perceive any sound, lights, windows or other like structures.  there were definitely no wings or other stabilizers.  the ufo appeared to be simply observing, if not ���������escorting��������� the jet on its approach path.  i will pursue faa records for any flight radar anomalies.  for comparison, the flight path data on flight aware for aal576 was as follows for that time frame:\r\n\r\n05:20pm 41.12 -96.06 13������ north 290 334 0.50 8,400 -1,680    minneapolis center \r\n05:21pm 41.20 -96.04 349������ north 279 321 0.48 6,700 -1,680    minneapolis center \r\n05:21pm 41.21 -96.04 12������ north 285 328 0.49 6,500 -720    minneapolis center \r\n05:22pm 41.28 -96.02 15������ north 244 281 0.42 5,900 -840    minneapolis center \r\n\r\nthe lat/long for our house is latitude: 41.281923  /  longitude: -96.007064.  thus, the unknown craft was flying somewhere between 5000-7000 ft., almost directly overhead.  i maintained the ufo in view for about 40-50 seconds as it continued on the path of the jet and yelled for my partner to come outside to confirm what i was seeing.  i didn���������t want to let the craft out of view, but i did try and briefly locate it via naked eye as i stepped off the patio to the north into the driveway.  neither of us could see it with our naked eye, but i could still see it very clearly in the binoculars at it cruised steadily in a northerly direction.  the sun light glistened off the metallic surface and the object did not waiver in motion as a balloon or other lighter than air object likely would.  i eventually lost sight as it went through the bare branches of our north neighbors mulberry bushes.  ironically, my dad had just asked me the other day if i had seen any discs lately.  yes, i guess i have.\r\n\r\nthough i am frustrated with the lack of \"official\" information on these craft, i am convinced these are not of human origin.  this was not a \"pearl\" or \"orb\", but rather a solid, metallic, disc craft.  why are \"they\" still pursuing such basic observations of our activities?  my guess is they are still exposing more and more people to their presence.  i cannot support the idea that this was a hologram or military drone.  but why continue with the shell game?  it's time to engage in more direct communications with these entities.  the disclosure is up to \"we the people\"!  let's just hope they have are here to help, because we have little to no chance if they are here to take us over.   \r\n\r\ni will agree to third party release if i am given all information on to whom it is being given.  mufon can be quite frustrating to work with sometimes and i cannot say i fully trust who is behind the scenes working with this info!\r\n\r\nside note: i obviously would have preferred to have my camera at the ready, but i didn���������t expect to have this sighting.  i did video tape another jet bta2278 on a very similar flight path about 20 minutes later, but didn���������t capture any anomalies that i am aware. that flight data is almost identical:\r\n\r\n05:37pm 41.12 -96.08 17������ north 281 323 0.48 6,500 -1,020    minneapolis

car in the back parking lot of my apartment building, being that the front was all full. i noticed that i had to urinate pretty bad, and decided to take care of it in the soccer field behind my building. at this time i was alone and listening to my ipod, looking around to see if anyone was coming. i sort of gazed off into the sky in front of me (facing south/east) and noticed that what i thought was a star was actually dancing around and connecting with others to make shapes (triangles, squares, spinning circles, polygons, you name it).\r\n at first i thought i had maybe gazed too long into a streetlight and was affecting my vision, but it continued to happen even after i was done relieving myself. i walked further into the field to get a better view of what was going on and noticed that the 3 or 4 lights i had seen dancing before was not the only ones in the sky, there was literally 20-40 of them. it was crazy, because they were really hard to see (light blue lights), they looked really far away but there was no doubt in my mind that they were all moving and extremely fast at that. they all kept making these shapes in the sky and changing 2 or 3 times within the same second, it looked like a lazer connect-the-dots type of show. i kept watching for at least 5 minutes before i realized that my roommates really need to see this before it goes away and becomes a story no one believes. \r\ni called up my friend lindsay, who was staying the night, and told her i was seeing this crazy ufo show going on in the sky. at first she didn't believe me but my roommates heard her say i was seeing ufos and rushed down to the field to meet me. altogether there was 4 of us now (mark, zac, and lindsay), and it didn't take long for them to see the same thing i had been watching 5 minutes prior to them meeting me. my roommates mark and zac both pointed out that hanging in the sky directly south/east of where we were standing was a bright red, blue, and white light flashing and hanging in the same position in the sky. \r\nat this point i was rejoicing heavily since i wasn't the only one seeing this. we stood there and watched the faint lights for a good 15-20 minutes before we started looking around the sky behind us (north). i noticed another red, blue, and white light haning in the sky and flashing directly north of the one that was south east of us. then i looked up, and so did mark and we both saw the same triangle shape object moving in different positions directly above us. this is where we all freaked out and decided to head back into the apartment for fear of an encounter of the 4th kind. \r\nour apartment is on the top floor in the middle of our building facing south, so naturally we all decided to go on the balcony to continue viewing the tiny blue lights making shapes. they were still going at it, and faster than before. we noticed that there were more light blue lights dancing and making shapes more over to the west of us and that there were 2 more red, blue, white lights in the sky. one of them was close to the closer to the first one, only more south to us than east, and the other one was to the east of us. this is where it got way to real for all of us. zac's girldfriend, kayla, who was in our apartment the whole time we were all watching this came out on the balcony and pointed out the 3rd red/blue/white light out of the 4 (the one south of us). she kept pointing at it for about 30 seconds, and then i had joined in with her. the light started moving closer to us after we pointed at it. it got closer and closer, as it came into better view i could see that there were 5 lights on it that would fade in and out in order from left to right. there was a red light on it and 4 orange lights that kept spinning. it only took about 20-30 seconds for it to move from far south (where it looked like a glowing dot) to over our building. it moved way to fast to be an airplane and was moving on an incline like this (/) with absolutely no sound. mark, kayla, lindsay, zac, and i watched it fly over our building and pass over the east end of our roof. i was freaking out so much when this happened, because i had never seen anything so amazing. once it passed our building i litterally felt like i was going to puke because i had never seen such a thing so vibrant and close to us. zac immediately ran down 4 flights of stairs to go back into the soccer field in hopes of getting a better view of it. when he got back he started yelling out that it was a huge circle and the lights were spinning really fast around the edges. he stated that the red lights were much bigger than the orange ones and that it was a metal circular object.\r\nzac, kayla, lindsay, and i went back out onto the field to see if anything else was going on that we couldn't see from the balcony. as we were standing in the middle of the field again watching, we saw someone coming out to us in the field. it was our old neighbor dave, who had moved out of our building and moved to hyde park in chicago, but was staying with our neighbors for a couple nights. he came out to us and started yelling \"did you guys see those lights!\" he was talking about the circular object that flew over our building. dave was in the parking lot with his girlfriend and noticed this thing fly over the building as well, making it 6 witnesses that i know of.\r\nit knew we were there, we pointed at it and it came and passed over our building, but we kept watching. the light blue lights still were going at it, making different shapes even at around 2:30-2:45. lindsay had pointed out to the 4th red/blue/white light that was west of us and we both watched it shine a light directly at us. this was too real and way too scary. we all decided to go back inside and watch a movie to calm down and go to sleep. \r\nall in all it was the most rediulous ufo display i had ever seen. i've seen dozens of ufo documentaries and actual footage of ufos caught on tape, but nothing had ever scaled the magnitude of what all 5 of us witnessed last night. we witnessed 30-50 light blue lights continuously moving and changing shape that was so fast it was hard to make out one shape before it changed to another. then we pointed at one of the red/blue/white lights and it came to us and gave us an awe inspiring glimpse of what it really was. my only regret is not owning a pair of binoculars or a video camera to capture this epic event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

county...\r\n\r\nnow that you're seeing multiple reports coming in referring to the bright balls of light in various colors of orange/yellow/amber/white, solid or blinking/pulsing, moving or hovering slowly, sometimes zipping off, sometimes dropping into treeline... all while silent.\r\n\r\nand now that you've had multiple reports from all over the place from those seeing these lights changing/morphing/shapeshifting into different shaped crafts of triangle, manta ray, square, rectangle and other shapes that are sometimes flashing like our aircraft, perhaps you'll pay attention.\r\n\r\nyou need to actually order radar reports for these sightings before writing them off simply because they might display red/white/green lights that flash.  never assume, they say.  they don't show on radar, not even primary radar which shows even flocks of birds as hits.  how do i know?  well, i, unlike you guys, have ordered and received such an extensive report that confirms this.  \r\n\r\nyou can then make up several other excuses that they are \"secret military craft\" and are exempted from being displayed on radar reports to the public, or other \"test projects\" by companies testing their secret projects... \r\n\r\nlame. the military is not flying their \"secret\" crafts under 500 feet over populated areas, hovering over properties long enough for average citizens to film them and post the videos of them on youtube. especially in downtown moscow, russia - where a guy on youtube.Com/user/olegen77 is filming the exact same stuff.  the military has no need to hover in the sky like a big flickering candle flaming ball with mult-colored prism light, before changing into what looks like a regular aircraft. an army guy back from iraq saw some and said they aren't ours and can't explain them.  there are no such fancy crafts  around here, except the war bird helicopters fully armed to the teeth that are now flying around here patrolling for some reason.  patrolling several of the areas i've mentioned and/or filmed ufos over.  coincidence?  perhaps.\r\n\r\npolice departments are easily called for the areas under these sightings.  do it.  they know if they've ordered search and rescue or are searching for a criminal.  they know if a helicopter was ordered for lifeflight for an accident.  i have called them after my sightings and they know nothing.\r\n\r\nthe \"airplane on approach\" excuse is also lame.  the videos show the same size diameter of light for several minutes, silently, before dimming down to be replaced by flashing lights and moving.  this would require the 'plane' to be turning on a dime (which is, of course, impossible for a plane).  and, of course, they don't show on radar.  end of story.  point out airports & analyze video all you want. radar reports and the fact that you can come in person and see them all you want, trumps all excuses.\r\n\r\nprior to \"instantly showing up bright in the sky\" part, with generation 3 nightvision, invisible, small, round thin bubble-like spheres can be detected - mostly blinking (nick-named \"blinkies\" or \"twinklers\").  they have no mass visible inside, until they expand (if they are going to expand-which in this state takes a really long time) or they decide to do the \"instant on\" bright ball of light thing.  they can and do sometimes never morph, but go back to invisible to the naked eye state (but still visible to night vision and infrared).  the ones that morph from that ball of light state have been seen to tranform into 5-6 different \"end\" resulting shaped crafts.  the sizes range from small car size to 50-60 feet average.  all seem to have the capability to further transform/change size real-time while flying.\r\n\r\nwhere do they come from?  at dusk (and continuing for 2-3 hours usually afterwards) a $323 military grade ir surveillance cam is sensitive enough and is the correct ir spectrum to see them drop from the sky like a meteor.  they then zip around our wooded areas presumably to do a safety check of the area.  then they settle in the trees to wait their 'turn'.  the size averages between a soccer ball and beachball in diameter.  i've never seen them sit on the ground.  i've never seen these show up during periods of rain/snow or even when rain/snow is approaching close enough to dusk to arrive after.  other people who have been observing their behavior since 2007 have come to the same conclusion about the weather.\r\n\r\nafter several minutes, hours, or sometimes right away, one will travel to top or near top of treeline and \"power up\", glowing like an orange/amber fireball in the woods.  upon closer view it appears to be swirling plasma ball of energy--2-5 foot in diameter.  upon rising slowly and clearing the treetops, they then usually brighten and enlarge in size, appearing much like a \"mini sun\" in appearance--gold/white flickering many colors of the rainbow.  this can last seconds or minutes--while hovering or while moving slowly.  the light then dims down and is replaced by smaller craft (than the ball of light) which starts flashing similarly to our aircraft lighting--most often displaying false headlight-single or double.  still silent at this point... still moving incredibly slow, like 5 mph usually, if that-but they frequently pick up speed.  sometimes they never change, and continue either as a bright golden ball of light or dimmer orange-colored sphere.  they usually take similar paths, night after night, in 2 different directions typically by my house. the \"blinkies\" are what was described in the latrobe, pa (westmoreland county) report of over 50 of them on december 10, 2009 by someone else (show them this video & i bet they'll say that's what they're seeing).  they frequently accompany the larger transformed crafts and can be seen in others' videos as dim flashes by the larger bright orbs--even in the famous phoenix lights closer video in 1997.  all blinkies can transform, i believe.  i have filmed them going from in-the-sky fake plane to shrinking back down into an glowing amber/orange orb hiding in the woods.  i assume they zip back into space at that point.  many white streaks of light have been seen by several people at high speed which we know to be them.\r\n\r\ndozen other locations not far from me with the same behavior.\r\ndozens of other states reporting the same behavior.\r\ndozens of other countries around the world with the same behavior.\r\n(names of others with video footage of same listed on my channel on youtube--too many filming orange ufos to list).\r\n\r\nthe orange ufos are reported the most because of the lack of flashing lights. people seeing them suddenly start flashing are most likely confused at what they've seen & don't report them. however, more reports are coming in of the \"fake plane\" ufos because those seeing them in person can tell they are a) silent, b) too low for planes, c) planes don't hover and would fall from the sky at that low speed, d) helicopters are really loud, e) there just isn't something right about the lights (strangely 'sharp' or inconsistent), and f) they've seen them morph.\r\n\r\nwhy, you ask... because this particular type of ufo is flying around incognito.  yeah, they don't particularly want to show off and do obvious \"tricks\" so that the military will come and shoot at them.  they just seem to want to observe us and our communications systems, transporation systems, power generation & distribution systems, mining and probably just how we go about our daily lives.  pretty much what we would want to check out if we found a new planet with life forms.  \r\n\r\nthis is all i know at this point.  i don't know who's in them.  i suspect larger ships are out in space sending these guys out.  judging by the number of places reporting them, plus the estimate of how many there actually are not being noticed yet, that there must be thousands of them.\r\n\r\nyou guys need to revise your \"chart of ufo types\" and ufo \"behavior\".  although the famous pine bush, ny has had the same types reported going back to the early 1980's (pinebushufo.Com), they have definitely increased in number.  they were proven to produce a fake sound, as well (which doesn't vibrate the surroundings, usually). if you never heard of pine bush, you need to read up on it.  the sightings are still frequent there as well. http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=kdihe0fride\r\n\r\nanother good video of them in quebec, canada sucking off power lines:  http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=nbx1mijzz8y \r\n\r\nagain, quit blowing off reports until you get a radar report proving a man-made craft.  i'm trying to keep you guys from looking like fools.  don't blow off eugene in euclid/lake erie, ohio.  i've compared notes with him, seen his footage, and it looks/sounds the same to me as what i'm seeing.  \r\n\r\nyeah, i admit, when dealing with aliens pretending to be our aircraft, once in a while a real aircraft might show up and fool us, but hey, what the heck to you expect with technologically advanced civilizations faking like our aircraft?  did you think they wouldn't be able to fool us earth-bound, fossil-fuel burning humans most of the time? gee, even our own government is developing holograms to fool our enemies... and we're obviously way behind these guys.\r\n\r\nso, here ya go.  one last report from me.  fresh enough for you to get a radar report on it.  i'll provide the gps filming locations.  the time on video files is off by 1 hour since it didn't reset for daylight savings time.  have your investigator meet me on the next good weather night and i'll show him some in person with my $3300 generation 3 scope.  \r\n\r\nmarch

that was moving extremely slow. right as we thought this is rotated slowly and we could see the whole triangle shape it had. as were looking at it it slowly rises up and over some trees that are near and a couple seconds later it was gone. we turned off the music and windshield wipers, rolled down the window and sat completely still on the on ramp for a good 30-45 seconds. during this time we could see all different sides of it. the bottom had lights on all three corners, a little dimmer light in the center, and small rectangular lights that looked like vents around the bottom. it all happened so fast i'm afraid i cannot give much of a better description than that. i turned my head as it reached the top of the trees to see if the truck coming in the opposite directions was seeing it as well, when i turned my head back i saw a zip of light and it was gone. my feelings regarding the sighting might be skewed by the fact that i see ufos a little too often and i have some kind of

my apartment around 2100. we were in the tub for around a half hour when we first saw the unknown objects. we were facing south and looking up at the sky enjoying the stars when four spheres evenly spaced and moving from south to north towards us and at a constant speed. they were lighted but not to the extent that i would say they had light.(this is hard to discribe...But the spheres were an orangish color, not bright and i discribe them as possibly reflecting the lights of the city more than producing litte.) they did not get brighter as they got closer and stayed the same hue through out the whole event. now i am not the only one to see these and the objects traveled at a constant rate not very fast but fast enough to go from our line of site in the south to out of site in the north in around twenty seconds. i would guess to say the objects were no more than two thousand feet above us, but it being night i could not tell the height. i only guess the height do to other planes in the air with flashing lights being very tough to see and these were much more clear to see. the objects held the same horizontal line pattern with no movement heigher or lowwer than the others. however, the objects moved left and right in unconventional methods. they moved fast making left to right shifting moves, yet they stayed even in their south to north motion. the objects made zero noise and were round and from what we could see were sphere in shape. all same size. so this blew my mind and my girlfriend and i both witnessed the fly over and were a little worried that we just saw something that might not have been from this world. the lack of sound, the movement and shape. the event was not over yet. so we set in the hot tub around another 15 minutes while i called my father in st. louis and told him what we saw. we then got out and dried off and walked to the apartment. i went onto the balcony and then called my sister back in st. louis to talk to her about what we saw. while telling her the story, right above my apartment appeared more spheres and many more. i would estimate the amount to be from twelve to twenty orangish spheres in a pattern this time and seeming to be at the same height as the other four and moving in the same direction from south to north. the spheres were in a \"v\" pattern and all moving at the same rate of speed. i scream out the the f. is that and my girlfriend ran out on the balcony and saw the spheres again. the pattern was like a flock of geese and the \"v\" moved north and as it moved the front or point of the \"v\" moved back till the \"v\" became flat and evened out. the \"v\" was then a straight line and still moving at the same pace. the middle then started to move out  ahead of the line line it was starting to become a \"v\" pattern again until we lost sight of the objects in the north sky. the objects were all the same shape and size. i then called the albuquerque police non-emergency number to see if there had been any other reports and to have the guys keep their eyes open in the north-west sky. i then called the fox news station to see if anyone had called them about it. they said no one had yet. i then decided to sit on the balcony for a while with my camara to see if anymore events would happen but nothing to that extent. i saw one more object take the same path from south to north and this one had no light but was a sphere and i had my neighbor see this one as well. i am not sure what i saw last night and i am not saying it was un-human but it was not anything that planes of today can do. no sound and the patterns. now i know i was not the only one to see this last night and my brother told me about this sight. i am writing this to hopefully find someone else that saw what i did last night. i do now feel that something is overhead in albuquerque, nm and hope ufo buffs keep their eye peeled to the north west sky. these objects flew directly over my head so look up tonight. i know i will be looking.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

indoors.  approximately 2 weeks ago he had a sighting of a light(s) that was very close and very bright in the sky.  at the time it gave him chills because of the irregular movement they we're preforming.  he says at one point they would be on one side of the sky, then blink out, only to appear on the other side (miles apart from each other).  he describes them as a car shape and sometimes it would \" morph \" into a ball or teardrop or ice cream shape.  they were so bright that he could pick them up on his video camera on his cell phone.  (for a reference, when he points his phone's camera at the brightest star in the sky it is not visible because there is not enough light for it to pick up on the screen).  he claims they where blinking on and off and moving in between blinks at no set pace or pattern.  the light was a white color.  at times there was one then, there would be two or three smaller ones that seemed to do exactly what the brightest one was doing.   this all went on for about (20-30) mins.  enough time for him to get 3 videos on his phone to show others.  the videos aren't perfect and wont prove anything definitely, but they still move, and show up when no other stars do in the film.  \r\n\r\n\r\nthe second sighting that happen just a few hours ago happen the same way.  he was out side on his phone as usual, and a very bright light appeared in the sky and was blinking at random.  he hung up immediately (with out saying good bye) and ran inside to get his grandmother to see the light. (he says he got her because he needed some credibility and another witness)  the light this time was as he said \" ..Almost like i could throw a golf ball in the sky and it be glowing.\"  he also says \" ..Its not the same as a star because, when you look at a star, you can see the fuzz and little lines of distortion coming off of it.  this one was a very bright, almost glowing hot white light, and very spherical.\"  he claims this one was making jumps across the sky.  at some points the light would jump so far across the sky, that it looked as though it would go out and a different one would appear on the other side at the exact moment.  the sighting lasted about 3-4mins.  \r\n\r\nmy name is [cms/tg/pid], i've had a sighting before also but only a silver ball in the sky stationary above my school.\r\n    i am not seeking anything special, i only want to do my part and report this event so you will know that these things are happening in our area.  i hope that i can see them some time too, and we will do our best to use a real video camera to capture them on film.   \r\nif you have any questions, please email me.  i am 18 and my buddies name is [cms/tg/pid] and he is 16.\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":22450,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.4504779,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03222010-0018","longitude":-93.4332189,"occurred":1269314820000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1269325475000,"summary":"Lights (orbs)  moving sporadically, covering large distances in an instant","tags":["video"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"DeQuincy, Louisiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:139860"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Portland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the 19th of march i was outside smoking when i looked up to orions belt. if i wasnt looking at that exact spot, at that exact time, i would not have seen this thing or things flying past. i have seen them on three nights in a row, with a friend for a witness and to help see what it/they are. here is how i describe it.....\r\n   on the first night (3/19)this craft or thing flew almost overhead, from south to north, silently. there were no lights, but you can see that they are like grey-ish \"v's\" or things flying in a formation or attached to a black object.\r\n\r\n the first sighting (3/19)i noticed them underneath what seemed like a flat rectangle that was very dark. they passed overhead rather quickly and flew in a straight path out to the horizon. the next day i told my friend what i had seen, and the next night (3/20) we both watched for them at the exact same time, which is 9:35. i had a camcorder running, but recorded only our audio due to blackness. but you can tell just what is happening as we see this thing!\r\n\r\n  would you beleive that he spotted these things, or this one thing with silver/grey \"v's\" under it, passing over before i did! i was glad to have a witness, and a second pair of eyes. we traced it till it got to the dark part of the night sky where we lost it. it took about 6 seconds to cross the open sky and pass out of our sight. about two minutes later my friend spotted it (or a second one) flying verticle to its original path. i did not catch that pass though. we were, and still are stumped! but there is still more to tell you about our ongoing sightings!\r\n\r\n so, lastnight, (3/21) my friend and i met once more and we had the best sighting yet! \r\n\r\nthis mass of about five or so \"v's\" in two very close but offset formations, passed directly overhead! one mass formation had several \"v's\" in it, and flew very close to one anther while the second formation had only two \"v's\" in it. these looked like one big formation though, all passing over (silently and w/0 lights) all at the time, and these \"v's\" did not drift at all between each other. they were just one five peice big mass passing silently over our heads. we lost sight as it again entered the darker part of the sky. after a couple of minutes the formation containing two \"v's\" flew over in the oppisite direction, same path though. my friend had returned inside though, so only i saw that.\r\n\r\nyou will not even notice these things if you are not looking for them! you need to look up towards orions belt, for them moving from the south to the north. they are quick and silent and hard to see on account of they have no lights at all.\r\n\r\n  i had been relating this to a local astromoner via the web, after each night of seeing this thing in hopes of getting an explanation from him.I hope he joins us soon, as he says he wants to and he has an interest thus far, and night vision gear too.\r\n\r\nwe have sketches too, and the audio recording from the second night. we are trying to get someone, anyone, everyone, that wishes to catch a look at this object to come right here in biddeford, maine and see it for themselves. i will point it out myself, if it passes over. my email is [cms/tg/pid] and i want to find out what we are seeing very bad. i will help you get here, and put you right where you will see them if they pass overhead. they are very strange and i am freaked out that they pass at the same time (exactly) each night. i lucked out on the first night, and have gotten luckier and luckier since. better hurry and get ahold of me.\r\n\r\nby the way, tonight was cloudy and sprinkle rain. we couldnt see anything due to the cloud cover. i will not stop looking though.\r\n[cms/tg/pid] \r\n  ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":22449,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.668241,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03222010-0017","longitude":-70.2493759,"occurred":1269059700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,   Square,   Rectagular,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1269325240000,"summary":"About five \"v's\" in formation flying overhead, fast, silent, no lights","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/22449_submitter_file1__FirstB.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/22449_submitter_file2__ThirdB.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Portland, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:139861"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Utica","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was looking at the clear sky with alot of stars when i saw a large whiteish light moving from north to south it came close to my eyesight at the same time it turned east thats when i noticed its shape and realized its speed was to fast to be a airplane. with in 5 seconds it was gone heading east towards albanyd id anyone else report this?It got to far away to see.  thanks","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Appendage(s),  Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":22448,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.103273,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03222010-0016","longitude":-75.225174,"occurred":1268888400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1269323375000,"summary":"Looked like 2 planes attachhed at the wings","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":5,"locationName":"Utica, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:139862"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Honolulu","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" \r\n weekend before last, i was standing on waikiki beach looking south, toward the ocean and a moving object in the sky caught my attention.  it was up about 2000-3000 ft and looked like a white hotwater heater, laying on its side, moving sideways. the small end was facing the beach.  it moved from west to east, like a floating balloon; but, as i watched, it never bobbed or tumbled; it stayed level on its side. it stopped south of diamond head crater and that's when i confirmed the gusty winds were blowing from the north-northeast by the blowing palm trees.  after a minute or so the object moved northward, a 90 degree change in direction, against the wind, toward the crater, without turning.  then i knew for sure it wasn't a floating baloon!!  \r\n\r\nit had changed direction of flight 90 degrees and was moving on its long axis as it headed north.  when it got even with the crater, perhaps it was east of the crater, it stopped again.....Holding against a strong, gusty, march wind.  in about a minute it moved along its wide axis, again another 90 degree direction change, but, it did not turn or bank.  it continued at a 90 degree direction of flight, due east.  after 2-3 minutes, my vision was blocked by the crater rim and i lost sight.  all changes in direction were 90 degrees!!  no wings or tail!! the white was brighter than the high clouds.  it was about 3pm and the sun was arching high westerly and was not in the field of view for most of the time i viewed the object.  it was easier to see, as it moved eastward out of the sun's glare.  \r\n \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":22447,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":21.3131444,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03222010-0015","longitude":-157.8490233,"occurred":1268604000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Hawaii","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1269312566000,"summary":"Cylinder flying west to east a half-mile out from the beach.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":8,"locationName":"Honolulu, Hawaii","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:139863"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Westfield","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Beautiful day working in my yard..Finished raking and took a rest on my swing.  i looked to the near north east....More east than north. there was an object just hoovering in the sky. it stayed stationary then i realized i saw some kind of energy field around it. you could see the swirling ( like an asphalt street on a hot summer day)so i could tell it was moving in place.  no i did not see it spin but the energy field was swirling. the clouds were very whispy that day i think they were cirrus. after about 5 minutes of viewing 3 jets not military that i knew, not commercial liners, but flew within 2 minutes of each other and the object disappeared.  what was so strange is the clouds or just like a contrail can make strange shapes the cirrus clouds had  formed into 2 circles as they drifted away from the area in the sky where the object had been.\r\n\r\nif i was to guess it was about 2000 feet in the air. just below the low clouds that day. location i would have to say around s.R.32 towards noblesville. now i drove down there to see if there was anything interesting and it was around duke energy. and this wasnt the first time weird things happened in about the same spot in the sky. just last week i saw 3 black helicopters fly in formation about the same area flying southeast.\r\n\r\nand a couple of months ago i saw somethg odd in the sky just hoovering a bit east of same area in the sky of 3/19/10 .....Then 3 black helicopters flew in and the objects  disappeared. i did not see them disappear. once i was distracted by the helicopters and looked back to view the objects they were gone. there were 2 that time. did not see as much detail with the earlier sighting as i did on 3/19/2010.\r\n\r\nmy feelings..Well,,as i do believe in things greater than ourselves i also realize most odd sightings can be explained. this was a ufo to me becasue it wasn't a marketing business balloon too high. it was exhibiting some form of energy field. and it was hoovering.At that same distance i can tell what commercial liner it is by the colors. this had no markings from my vantage point. it looked metalic with no outward wings,or propellers.\r\n\r\nbut what was weird to me, i had forgotten about the other sighting from a couple of months ago until this one refreshed my memory.
