the sky if they didnt go right through my view i would have never even noticed. they looked silverish black and didnt have any lights on them. they were in a tight v formation like a sqaud of fighter jets, its hard to tel there size or how high up they were but they were definently structured craft. this was in northeast baltimore city\r\nright off of the 5900 block of bel air road. i saw a ufo about 8 years ago at loch raven resivior but i could have been mistaken, but this time there was absolutley no dout as to what i saw, it creeped me out but i was also amazed at the same time.\r\ndid

towards provincetown sometime after sunset to our left (west) -  it was approx. 7:20pm. it was a nearly cloudless evening, with a thin moon and a few stars starting to become visible. it was unusually mild for this time of year. as we looked north/northwest toward provincetown we could see a very bright light, larger than a star, over the bay which looked stationary. as we watched the seemingly low and bright light flicker slightly, a small wispy cloud out was drawing near to it and we thought we could now determine how high up it really was. the light was not obscured by the cloud and was in fact in front of it eliminating the star theory we were debating. once getting into provincetown proper and waiting at a light at conwell st./ rte 6a, we could see that it was now moving slowly and heading towards us from near the airport. thinking it was a low plane or helicopter we parked our car in our driveway about a minute later and jumped out to watch it. the light passed directly over us. it was solid, not blinking, and large compared to lights seen on high altitude international and military flights in the distance and completely silent. it \"drifted\" overhead and had no faa lights. at this point it was very dark out with no residual light from the sunset. as the light went in a southernly direction back over the bay it began to dim, leaving a sort of yellow glow to it like a street light and then shut off abruptly. we didn't see it thereafter. strangely, inside our house ten minutes later the little speakers for ipods snapped on mysteriously as we were sitting down. the unit has a little lcd screen that suddenly lit up. it's never done that and we found that odd and somewhat fitting to the situation. i called the police and the airport two days later since nothing seemed to match what we saw. nothing odd reported. i did take a picture on my iphone and it caught the light but not much detail. can send if interested.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

atv, i saw directly in front and above me, where there had been complete darkness, lights appearered. these lights were in a circular pattern and i could see individual lights, i cannot say for sure how many there were because they immediately began to spin and became one big light. the object then began to move very rapidly away from me going almost due west. in so doing it left a trail of light similar to a shooting star. that was my first impression a shooting star. but there is no way a shooting star could appear out of nowhere and be at that low altitude. i cannot say for sure the exact altitude but it appeared to be only at the most two hundred feet above me. the clarity of the lights when they appeared and the width of the trail it left could only mean that it was very low. all i saw were the lights i was unable to see anything else or even a shadow of a shape. it happeded so fast and i was unable to believe what i was seeing. it was a dark night with a little cloud but very clear. \r\n\r\ni was uanble to sleep until after 2am. all i could think about was what i had seen. i kept seeing these lights appear and start spinning and then fly off at such a fast speed that it

about 100 miles an hour - it looked like a fast moving car speed. i could only watch the vehicle between the trees, probably for about 5 seconds max. my dog and i ran to see if we could see anything on the other side of the trees but it was nowhere in sight. the dogs kept barking when the vehicle passed over in their direction. it was so silent, my dog didn't even look up.\r\n\r\nsideline, when i told my husband how low this ufo was flying, he didn't think it was possible without hitting the trees. so my first report said 100 yards up. but as i was driving on the freeway the following day i noticed all the tallest street lights that are always next to certain areas of the freeway - the ones that have three lights on them. there are also shorter lights but i'm talking about the tallest ones. the tallest lights were how low the craft was flying. when i checked out the path in the daylight, there was plenty of room for it to fly that low without hitting any trees. i don't know how anybody else did not see this strange siting, but nobody else was in site. i'm tempted to go door-to-door and ask other neighbors if they saw anything.\r\n\r\nright away i called the local tv channels. the only one that had a live person to talk to said, \"that's kind of funny that you'd report that today because it's the spring equinox and you could have seen a reflection from the northern lights. this was no reflection but rather a solid, industrial strength vehicle.     \r\n\r\ni sent this information to the local oregon mutual ufo network. tom bowden responded right away and will send a local rep to interview me. however, he thought i should also send this information your way. \r\n\r\nplease give me a call or email me if you have any other questions. there were no pictures. even if i had a camera it all happened so fast i wouldn't have been able to take the picture in time. i guess i wasn't expecting such a surprise.\r\n\r\nthanks for your help and please keep my name, phone and email address anonymous.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

i was driving a little nissan pick-up. my shift ended at 2:00 am at a casino that morning in las vegas, and i was eagerly going to drive to laughlin, nevada to see the love of my life.  he was the graveyard floor person for the ramada express.  i was driving south on #95 and was fast approaching searchlight and cal-nev-ari.  i was not yet to the junction in the road where you need to make a decision - you can either keep going straight on #95 on the way to needles, california, or you can turn left on the way to laughlin, nevada.\r\n \r\nthis is the honest to god truth, and i have never forgotten the moment.  the moment i arrived in laughlin, i wrote about this in my journal (which i always kept with me).  it was absolutely pitch dark.  a two-lane highway, one lane going south (the one i was on) and one lane going north.  it was such a beautiful clear night that you could see all the stars.  when i first noticed it, i saw it high in the dark sky right in the middle of all the stars.  i thought, \"my god!  what is that?\"  i couldn't take my eyes off of it, and i could see it was coming closer and closer towards me in a northerly direction, straight out of the stars getting lower and lower towards the highway.  i was now seeing the real shape of it, and still it was just all flames.  it was rectangular - all fire - about twice as wide as a box car, twice as long, but not as high.  it was coming so fast towards me, steady as it went.  i remember those few seconds as it got closer and closer thinking, \"so this is it?  this is how i'm going to die?\"  it was as if it was going to hit me head on.  it was almost level with my truck on the road.  it seemed like it got to only a few feet from hitting me head on, and then it suddenly dipped upwards with just enough space to clear my truck and it just kept on going, never once coming into contact with me.  i was so amazed - like in two seconds, it scooted upwards and went right over the top of my truck, just clearing it, and it kept on going north as i was headed south.  i was like in a state of shock.  the only thing i could think of was that something was \"checking me out.\"  it was like when teenagers are zooming around showing off in their speeding cars and they zoom up to you and check you and your car out, and then they zoom off.\r\n\r\nonce it went above and over me, i was so afraid i shook.  i never looked back - i was just glad it didn't destroy me.  i couldn't believe what just happened, but it was true.  it actually happened.  i just kept driving, and driving, all the time praying that it would leave me alone, whatever it was.  i was the only vehicle on the road coming or going.  it was shortly after that, that i came to the junction where i turned left and headed towards laughlin, nevada.\r\n\r\njust 2 weeks ago, i found that journal that was in storage.  i was so very happy to find it and search for the exact morning that it happened.  i have wanted to report this since that day of march 26, 1995, and now i have done so.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

flying from the north-northwest towards the south-southeast.  its entire body was made of a white light and had a diamond-like shape.  to the left, right, up, and down were 4 very bright green

was intriging was how slow, low and silent it was gliding over the houses. this object appeared very different from normal air traffic here. i see planes and helicopters nightly and counted dozens of these before this sighting came along.I was on the phone with eugene erlikh at the time of the sighting. \r\ni could have made this video shorter, i do realize there is a gap where i am struggling to get the object to show up on film. i have never had these kinds of problems with my camcorder before. it seemed as the object got closer and was nearest to me my camcorder was malfunctioning. i tried everything to get the camcorder to right itself. so i left this long version in to show others why during a potential ufo sighting camcorders can experience technical difficulties. \r\nwhat is interesting is the end of the video when i finally do get the object back into focus, it has taken on the form of 2 seperate objects with the fake blinking lights. to add more..The dog at the neighbors house just as the object passes over starts barking repeatedly.\r\nwhen a real airplane is filmed especially at that low of an altitude, one can clearly see the structured craft itself. there seemed to be none on this object. only glowing lights mimicking our conventional aircraft.\r\ni have been following the alison kruse and others fake plane sightings. i didn't know what to make of it completely. after seeing this object, i am convinced there are objects that come out at night that cruise around the neighborhood, mimicking conventional aircraft.\r\nthe general public knows what is conventional aircraft in the skies. debunkers and skeptics who try to scare people away from skywatching and passing on vital information.\r\ni know what i saw.\r\nto make this sighting more interesting, about 15 minutes later a glowing orange orb ( i am thinking it was the same one) came from the direction where this one just went. it headed southeast. it was even lower in the sky, made no noise and glowed. this will be clearly be seen in part 2. \r\nin the second sighting that happened about 15-20 minutes later was even better. this object was so bright gold glowing and the camcorder doesn't do it justice at all. it was bright. moving west to south east even lower over the neighborhood. so low that it was seen through the smaller trees in the front yards. it was also silent. i do not know if this was the same object. this one glowed bright gold, the other did not. one can even see the glow seems to be coming from underneath the orb and expanding out. it was very bright. these objects make no noise. i have filmed helicopters that close and they are extremely loud, please see my other videos for reference. this object, had it been a helicopter, would have been audible on film i don't know what these things were. i know what they weren't. i don't care what some people's conclusions are regarding these videos.I don't care if some people don't believe me. i know there are alot more people all over the world seeing these orbs in the night sky. i want to report my sightings so that it encourages others seeing these objects to come forward with video photos ect, to corroberate this phenomenon. mankind has a right to know. it is real and it is happening whether you believe or not. i tried to send the original footage from my pc but i think the file may be too big. here's the youtube links:\r\npart 1 : http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=s-8oxneodaq\r\n\r\npart 2:

changing to another color.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nit was moving with the \"speed\" typical of a celestial object -- i took note of it as it was \"setting\" over a neighbor's roof.  i got online to see if

back to the camera and noticed that the object had moved. we continued to observe the object until it suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\nwe thought that the object could have been a star, or planet at first but quickly realized that the earth simply doesnt rotate fast enough to account for how far the object progressed across the sky, and even if it were a star or planet the path it would have followed acorss the sky would have been entirely different.\r\n\r\nwe then thought about the idea of the object being a aircraft, however i did not see any anti-collision, wing, or landing lights that were blinking at a timed interval on this object. the object appeared to be pulsating with no predetermined order and flashing an array of colors.\r\n i further concluded that the object could not have been a aircraft because the object was heading in a eastern heading towards the rising sun that was in the sky. if after the object lights went off the sunlight would have reflected off of the

\"ball\" or \"sphere\" or \"orb\" of light caught my attention. when i first noticed the light it seemed to be moving in a downward direction, down toward the horizon line. after about a second it abruptly changed direction - which brought me to my feet. the downward angle would have been 120 to 140 degrees and the direction change would have been upward at 90 degrees. the light was brighter than any star i could compare it too and there were no flashing or other lights attached that i could see. the light traveled completely over my head to a nearly identical opposite position in the sky and vanished almost in an instant, i'd say it seemed to fade for 1 or 2 seconds. from inside the fairgrounds i couldn't tell north, south, east, or west. i drew several others to pay attention to it, my brother, and his wife were the only two that i knew. all were in concurrence that if this were any typical aircraft the light would have somehow changed or dropped out of view as it passed over head. the light remained constant until it vanished; i marked the time at 8:21. there wasn't a lot of background noise, some idle chatter, but i heard no noise that i could relate to an aircraft.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:03:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional
