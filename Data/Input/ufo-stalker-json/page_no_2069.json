crap. i was about 17 years old(i am now 32) and i was with three friends outside of brookston indiana(town of 5000 people in white county) at my parents house. we were all drinking and smoking marijuana, which is part of the reason i never reported this. i knew what people would say. behind my parnets house, is a wide open field for about 200 yards before reaching the town baseball park on the outskirts of brookston. we were just bored kids, walking around and talking, drinking, and having a good time. at one point, two of my friends walked across highway 18 to the cemetary to get some fresh air. my other friend and i decided to watch the night sky while laying in the wide open field, enjoying our buzz and relaxing. all of a sudded, i saw lights behind me(to the west) and at first i thought they were a plane of some kind, or a high flying jet, but i kept listening for engine noise that never came(it is very quiet at night outside my parents house.) the light intensity slowly got brighter, still no noise, when before we knew it, we were both looking at the front tip of the ufo directly above us and floating slowly and silently towared the east. i was terrified. it was so huge and so quiet, it is like a totally contrasting situation to see something so big moving that doesnt make any noise at all. we lied there, both of us frozen with fear and unable to speak. contrary to other sightings i have heard of and read about, the object did not up and zip away into the clouds or off of the horizon. it just continued on its course until it was completely out of sight. never a noise, never a change in course, nothing. just a giant, black, silent triangle flying low and moving slowly over the landscape. i have never been so afraid of anything in my life. ever. i have never seen anything like that since. i am a married man(10 years) i have two kids, a good job, and no history of mental illness, or medications. i havent done any drugs since i was 21 years old, and i would like to consider myself of above average intelligence. i cant bring this up to my family or other friends for fear of ridicule, but this really happend. i wish i could recollect some more details, but that was 15 years ago, and i was a pothead for years after that, so some of those memories are gone. but what i saw that night, is unforgettable, and the only conversation we had about the object was(paraphasing) \"did you see that?\"  \"yes i did\" \"oh my god, what the hell was that?\" \"i dont know\" we never said anything else about it. when something scares you that much, you dont need to talk about it, you dont need to discuss it, joke about it, tell tall tales about, you are just thankful to god that you saw it, and lived. therefore you dont speak about such things because doing so could bring back those demons. i hope this account in some way helps you guys piece together a flight pattern, or time table, or anything, but there you go.

there to watch the sky because several neighbors has reported lights in the sky on the preceeding two nights. at around 8:38 pm we were parked on a high knoll on the farm behind the house. we were outside of te car watching the stars begin to appear and identifying constellations when a white orb passed overhead moving roughly the speed of an airplane. we all thought it was a satellite but it was very low to the ground - a real satellite past over 20 minutes later and we knew then that the light we'd seen was not a satellite.  it was a clear night - no clouds - the light was large like landing gear on an airplane but it did not flash - it disappeared abruptly. roughly two minutes later a bright orange light appeared about the treeline roughly 5-7 miles away. the lights were very large even for that distance. at first we thought it was a firework display but there was no bursting of light. this was followed by two bright orange lights and then finally three in a boomerang shape which appeared to turn away from us and go back below the treeline. the objects appeared to come from the ground up each time. once it disappeared for the last time the area became busy with air traffic - three-four planes very high up in the air and at a considerable distance. there are several large private lakes in the area that are rumored to be very deep. because the obects seemed to come up from the ground, we wondered about a uso instead of a true ufo though this was certainly airborne. we all agreed that we were not frightened but rather curious and we knew that it was no any sort of aircraft we had ever seen. the incident two days early was seen by one of the people in our party that night and he was certainly shaken up becuase he was in a cabin in the woods with no electricity when he was awakened at 6 am by a very bright light shining into the cabin's bedroom window. i will not report on this event since i was not privy to it but it was the event that caused us to go back out to the farm two nights later to watch for some sort of event - other people in the neighborhood witnessed the lights as well.","distance":"Over One

evenly spaced white lights in an arc relatively near the horizon that did not appear to move. there were other lights that extended the arc higher into the sky but they seemed to shift into a \"v\" or \"diamond\" shape. there were also other aircraft lights in the sky that were clearly planes or helicopters moving around, perhaps observing the phenomenon. i am not sure if the shifting \"v\" or \"diamond\" was part of the phenomena or was composed of aircraft observing the phenomena. we observed the lights for about 15 minutes as we drove east on baseline before stopping at the safeway on higley and baseline. the lights were still in the sky when we went into the store but were gone when we exited the store no more than 20 minutes later. the pattern of evenly spaced lights was

http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/duarte,_california) across the san gabriel river (http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/san_gabriel_river_(california)) into the city of azusa (http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/duarte,_california).  on my return, as i neared the san gabriel river bicycle path (http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/san_gabriel_river_bicycle_path) from the east, i heard and then saw five helicopters approaching from the southwest, flying in a slight and loose \"v\" formation.  i stopped at the tree line that existed then in order to avoid being spotted; i don't remember my exact position, but i think it was about 34.14775 latitude, -117.925375  longitude.  i don't remember the exact time, but i think it was between 9:30 pm and 10:00 pm pst.  i presumed that they were u.S. forest service helicopters, which almost regularly swept the san gabriel river from the santa fe dam recreation area (http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/santa_fe_dam_recreation_area) to the top of the river's alluvial fan at night (and maybe still continue to do so).  i immediately noticed that the helicopters were approaching an intensely bright ball of light about 15 to 20 feet in diameter; i didn't discern a structure or physical surface within it, but i immediately assumed that it was an alien spacecraft nonetheless.  each helicopter had a \"headlight\", and all of them activated at about this same time.  the ball of light easily outshone the headlights.  being as bright as it was, i wondered how the ball had gotten to that position without me noticing it.  the middle helicopter slowed to a stationary hover in \"front\" of the ball, while the other four flanked either side of it and rotated to face it.  the helicopter personnel used the helicopters' public address systems to demand of the ball that it identify itself; this went on for a few minutes, but the ball did not respond to any of the demands.  then the helicopter personnel verbally inquired of each other how they should continue to handle this event; after a moment or so of discussion, the ball shot straight up out of sight in less than two seconds -- maybe in less then one second.  it did not appear to accelerate gradually from motionlessness to a high speed, but instead seemed to immediately begin travelling at a high speed and maintain that same speed until it was out of view.  the helicopter personnel expressed their amazement at what they witnessed, then mutually agreed that they would not report the event to anyone.  the helicopters resumed their previous travel northeast along the san gabriel river.  i had remained more or less motionless for the duration of the event.  i spent a minute or two getting over my own amazement, then crossed the river and returned home.  i remember that i arrived at home sometime between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm pst.\r\n\r\ni described this event to my father soon after i returned home, and he seemed to believe it.  (when i was younger, he had told me of a ufo that he and his brothers encountered when they were young.)\r\n\r\nover the years, i've told the story to a few other relatives and a few friends.  i've been aware of mufon since i was a teenager in the 1980s, but i never thought of telling my story to it.  i described the aforementioned event to another relative earlier today, and he talked me into submitting it to mufon.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

about 7:30 pm, local time, a huge bright amber colored light just popped out of nowhere in front of us.  it was about 3 miles from me, and about 35 degrees up in the sky in the western sky.  i noticed it because it was obviously the only light in the sky at the time.  absolutely no stars, planets, planes, or any other sort of light.  i have seen this exact light in the sky before, at least six times this year already!  i felt as if it really wanted us to see it.  i proceeded to finish driving home.  as i was continuing my drive, it moved with me to about 10 degrees above the western horizon.  i detail on the attached movies exactly what we are looking at and where we are looking at.  when we got back to my home, i grabbed my camera out of my jeep and started filming.  the object stayed in view for about 30 minutes total.  my witness to this is my wife, ********, and the footage i have provided.  ************** both of roosevelt,ut.  after filming for about 10 minutes, the object slowly flew north toward the uintah mountain range.  it didn't fly off or zoom off, it just kind of faded out of view.  the very next day at about 6:30 pm, n unmarked blackhawk helicopter flew right over my head and went in the exact same direction as the ufo.  i even have footage of the helicopter taking pictures of me and my family.  in all of the times i and my wife have seen this object, we never ever felt any fear.  this thing seems just to want us to know it is there, watching us.  this is a very active spot for ufo sightings.  roosevelt is home of the infamous ufo ranch as well.  i would just like to know what exactly this thing is.  is it man made?  is it a natural phenomenon?  is it extra-terrestrial?  any answers you may gather from viewing this would be very helpful

mostly an amber-color but shifted to redish colors and sometimes more of a whitish colour.  it would zig-zag sometimes, it would be stationary at others, and it would rapidly move all over the place

vehicle.\r\n   we were coming out of richmond, virginia at 11:00 pm on the above date when we approached exit 58 on the southbound side of interstate 95. on one side to the west is state route 150 with high tension electrical lines on the east running parallel to i-95 and (under construction at the time) to the west is  interstate 895 overpass. \r\n   we sighted a very odd flying object going from west to east. what was strange about this is that the object had come in under the electrical lines and was lit up in very bright white lights. the shape was that of a sailor���s cap. this object couldn���t have been 75 feet overhead. the vehicle was maybe 25 feet square and10-12 feet tall. we had                                                          pulled onto the side of the road to watch this spectacle which had also attracted the attention of several vehicles on the northbound side of i-95. \r\n   the object hovered over the roadway���s columns for a few minutes and then very slowly headed east with absolutely no sound. we had a clear view for probably 8-10 minutes.\r\n   i have seen pictures of lots of different shapes of ufos, but i have never seen or heard of anything

(i often scan the sky for anomalies so that i might increase the chances of actually seeing one.) well, i got what i was looking for. as soon as i looked up, i saw what looked like a black circle floating in the sky. the object immediately caught my attention because of it's foreign appearance. the circular object was approximately half the size of a dime from my perspective and made no noise. i gazed at the object for a few seconds wondering what this object could be before i called out to greg. after hanging up, greg stood beside me and said \"what is that?\" the object then began moving down and to the right in an erratic motion. the flying object then moved in front of a cloud. this is where things really get strange. at this point, i thought the black on white contrast would give me a more defined visual of the object. however, the object seemed to be changing in shape. i felt as if my brain had a hard time grasping the true shape of the object. the object seemed to flatten out into an elliptical shape and even split in two at times, then coalesced in less than a second. once the flying object moved past the cloud, it dissipated. since it was st. patrick's day, we thought that this object could have been a huge balloon, but that doesn't really make sense if you consider that it moved down, changed shape, and then disappeared. \r\n\r\ni am attaching two photos of ufos similar to what we saw that i found on the internet.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

banner elk, nc. it was exceptionally clear. we took 2 cars, 2 of my friends were in another car. they drove to the spot before me and my other friend arrived. i got a text from them around 2am saying they saw a ufo. we quickly got to them, but they said it disappeared. they said it stayed hovered (in the distance) above the skyline and quickly disappeared. i was curious so i looked everywhere i could to find something similar to what they described. they described it as red, green and white flashes of light. all of a sudden, on my right hand side, i noticed something flashing, much brighter than all the other stars. it also flashed red, green, and white light. it stayed stationary for approximately 20 minutes before going in a pattern. the pattern was this: up, down, diagonally left, and then diagonally back to it's original spot. we then noticed 2 more, side by side, close to the star betelgeuse following the same pattern of movement and had the same flashing lights. eventually the original one i spotted began to drop, slowly, below the mountain, and then bobbed up and down, still visible. it then disappeared. the other two began to get more faint like they were farther away. then to the far left of me, one much closer appeared out of no where, also with the same pattern and colors. then out of nowhere it disappeared. the only two that were left were the two closest to betelgeuse. we sat and watched until approximately 4:30am. the two did not disappear. we left so i do not know what happened with those last two. i almost cried out of excitement, i never in my life thought i would experience something like this. i'm going back tonight with one of the friends who joined me last night, and another person who did not see them last night. we're going at the same time as last night. also, i was going to call a dispatcher to see if anyone else had reported seeing it. my gps has been dead for a while so i couldn't get the point in the sky the original object was so my friend used her iphone to see which direction in the sky it was, it started to work, and then stopped working all together.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":22379,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.1631817,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03192010-0010","longitude":-81.8715019,"occurred":1268989200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North
