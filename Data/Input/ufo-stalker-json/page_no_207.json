sky to right of dipper noticed a small round white star like object moving in straight line (came from behind my house) higher than air traffic, and blinking on/off once per second. it was moving overhead east to west as fast as a military jet. could say it was at least 36,000 feet like the jets fly.  watched it a few seconds. ran to get binoculars (20 seconds?), but when returned saw it further out towards west and could not adjust binocs quickly enough to catch.  then saw second star like object moving from same area along nearly same path, but it disappeared within five or six seconds before it reached directly overhead, or it stopped blinking.  it was  fainter than the first one. got binocs adjusted to be able to see stars clearly. then looked to path of first in the west and did not see object, but saw what appeared to be a bright white blotch (like a bright white ball with irregular shape on the trailing side) the whole thing about as big as a dime held out, falling-- from my perspective it appeared to drop far behind trees/house across street but i believe it did not actually hit the ground. like watching a shooting star - they don't hit the ground. i was surprised how close it appeared - it seemed closer to me than the last point where i saw the blinking thing in the west. i even thought for a few seconds that it had been a firework type rocket shot up from behind the nearby stand of trees. but now i don't think that.   a few seconds later, i saw a triangle shaped craft with white lights blinking on/off on three points --i saw three lights blinking in triangle shape through the binocs -- and a golden light also on it near the rear of it, along with a second craft with white blinking lights and a red light, but could not determine if it was triangle like the other, flying really fast nearly side by side, then very close and it looked like the second craft flew somewhere under the triangle and very close, both going  in the same westward direction as the first blinking object.  these two craft moved across the sky faster than the white objects had moved and were seemingly chasing after the one that had gone furthest west. i think they were much lower in altitude.  i don't know if all was related but it all took place within two to three minutes' time. i did not hear any sound before seeing the silent white \"blotch\" (so not a fourth of july rocket set off) and did not hear jet noise when two \"chase planes\" went overhead.  the low hum of an air conditioner in the neighborhood could have masked that, but a small helicopter went by immediately after, moving west to east at a low altitude, and i heard it's noise. i have not seen these blinking white objects in the sky before tonight.  do you think the triangle or the other craft shot the second object  out of the sky?? thinking about it now, the ufo that \"disappeared\" could have been moving in that area, to follow the first one, and could have been shot down creating the \"white blotch\". the one triangle was flying level so i saw the lights at the three tips, but the second one was blinking lights as furiously as the other, but seemed to be on an angle, so i could not see three lights if it was a triangle shape. i guess the two westbound craft were around passenger jet altitude when on approach to phila. airport 25 miles out. the triangle and other craft flew off to the west.  amazing. that is what i saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

perfectly straight line. it was difficult to tell whether it was moving slightly up or down, or left or right because of how fast it was moving. we lost sight of the object as it was heading east

observed several lights heading out to sea.  noticed them immediately, then realized that they were not flying, but floating.  going in and out of view between very small patches of clouds.  very unusual.  between 6 and 10 lights separate from each other and not holding a formation of any kind.  like a flock of birds crossing a lake.  when they finally emerged from the patch of clouds the sky opened up to a clear night.  i was hoping to be able to identify them at this time, but the lights slowly faded to nothing after about 2 minutes. each light disappeared separately and on its own.  not in unison.  randomly.  sighting lasted about 3 minutes.  my sister also was with me and noticed the same unusual effect.  we were both in awe of the sighting as we both knew this was not a normal formation of craft.  we are both used to seeing crafts of all kinds as i was in the military and we grew up around three airports.  two small aircraft and helicopter ports and one international/military air base.  these were not something we ever witnessed, and we both knew it was important as it was happening.  we both seemingly knew to take it all in before speaking.  no loss of time or reality, however, i did have an excited, uneasy feeling.  seemed like something out of a movie.

(i also filled as much as i can but the object was too dark at this time but you can here what was said and a single orange flash from the object and one photograph that just turned out like and orange blob) and as i said that it was for sure a ufo it stopped hovering above us and it's lights went back on and it went over the trees towards the north east. as soon as i saw the object i called my mom because i thought she would be the only one to believe me and i called her at 10:33 pm saturday june 24, 2017.  it's 11:37 and i just went to upload the images from my camera to the comouter and my whole card has been corrected. i have no evidence.. even after i showed my husband the video and the images. \r\nof this ufo. i will afmit. i feel very uncomfortable right now as i am submitting this. and i would like a response of somekind. thank you.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":84588,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":null,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06252017-0004","longitude":null,"occurred":1498343400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1498358978000,"summary":"I am pretty sure this object knew i saw it. i am sure that once i acnolaged it's presents thatso when things got really weird.","tags":["photo","video","ufo","lights","flash"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1498373746232,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"95490","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Willits , California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:8688"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" it was a clear night with the constellation extremely visible and i was sitting on my deck looking upward and enjoying the views as there was no light pollution or smog pollution to obstruct my beautiful view.  as usually i observe the sky for satellites that typically run and a north and south direction as i would have observed them in the past.  so i was facing  in an eastern direction and observed a bright yellow orb somewhere most likely in the stratosphere descending very quickly i would say almost triple the speed  of conventional gps satellites that orbit our planet.  it was 1:35 am as i marked it on my phone to confirm timing on june 25, 2017.  so this bright yellow orb descended  and conducted a 90° turn instantly with no drag or lag  in a step in motion in one direction similar to a zigzag pattern.  at one point it stopped and the closest reference point according to my astronomy app is in the algenib pegasus constellations. so the yellow orb continued on this 90° pattern back-and-forth in a step formation travelling south east and eventually losing sight  as it continued through the stratosphere further away from me.  unless this was some sort of government or military aircraft i would say that the laws of physics were certainly bent..  i can honestly say it was extremely fascinating watching this object moves so gracefully across the night sky and was the only one to observe it.   i think that's the hardest part wishing that someone else might have seen it with me.
