hunting, fishing, hiking, gardening, as well as my entire work-life being spent outdoors. i have seen many things blown into the sky by winds, but nothing like this and nothing of such a shape that went against the direction of the wind gaining in elevation the entire time, none the less disappearing from view in mere seconds. truthfully, i'm not very pleased with the whole event and for approximately 15 minutes immediately afterwards, i was just a bit rattled. i cannot logically explain what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet -

again.. in a very few short minutes...  we thought we had lost it until we got to the wooden fence and looked over it.. and saw it again nearing the horizon line ( ie  getting lower) and shifting colors to orange and them finally red   very slowly  smooth color shift.\r\n5. feelings and emotions... disbelief... second guessing... what was it what did we see.. where did it go.. and then reacquired it  for the final few minutes when we walked the length of the parking lot to the fence... approximately 400 to 500 yards further than where we were initially..\r\nactions... pure observation.. amazement... discussion. comparing what we all saw  ( 4 of us ) making sure we were all awake and seeing the same things... we watched it until it was no longer there... and the sky where it was lit up slightly brighter and white where it would have gone.. this lighter area lasted for several minutes  until it faded away also after the object was no longer visible..\r\n\r\nmuch discussion in the parking lot during and after the incident .. approximately 30 minutes or more discussing it and what to do about it..\r\n\r\nwe even retraced out steps .. where we first saw it, and walked the 400 yards again back to the fence to see if the sky was still white where it disappeared... it was not...\r\n\r\nafter the sighting.... a mix of 'excitement' and 'who is gonna believe this'  feeling...  and how can we find out if more people saw it...\r\n\r\nit was directly over a interstate highway full of traffic in both directions  moving slow for at least 5 minutes or more...\r\n\r\n6. lost sight of the object as it got lower to the horizon and much further from us.. approximately 5 miles or so away.. we watched it go behind some trees as its shifting to red color and the smile was getting smaller and  as it went behind the light post... it was centered on the light post and moved to the left of the post right before disappearing from our sight lines on top of the wooden fence... you could see the tree branches in between us and the object as it moved slightly left or west  and we lost sight of it..  immediately after we lost visual... the horizon sky around where the object was lit up white  .. like a baseball stadium light haze.. and this change was immediately noticed and commented on..  after we talked about it there for 10 minutes and started walking back taking about it.. we decided to go back again and double check the white in the sky to see if it was still there... and it was not.. that was 10:35 pm 3-18-2010","distance":"501 Feet - 1

out looking at the sky when we noticed a bright orb peek up over the horizon directly in front of us it was bright white and at arms length it was the size of a pea. i got out my night vision goggles and looked through them. off to the right of it there was another orb that hung in the air and swayed back and forth in a swooping motion about a half inch on each side from the point where it was stationary. as it was doing that another orb came from above it and moved into position above the first orb and right next to a dimmer one over the horizon. they made a triangle. as we watched them they all twinkled at different times. it looked to me like they were communicating with one another.\r\n\r\nat 8:50 paula pointed out two orbs to our imiediate right. one was amber and the other red. the amber orb was in front of the red orb and they were hovering in the same spot.As i positioned myself for a better look they started moving in a straight line accross the sky, as they moved they got closer together. they made a right hand swooping turn and became one amber colored orb. we watched them until they dissapeared in the direction of the ocean.\r\n\r\nwe turned our attention back to the triangle formation and noticed that the orb that moved into position to make the triangle was moving up higher in the sky. this made the triangle look bigger. we also noticed that the orb right next to it followed it. we watched it for awhile longer and decided to go home for a bathroom break and to get something to drink.\r\n\r\n at 10:00 we went back out to the place where we had seen the orbs and the triangle was still there. we noticed that it moved again. the top orb moved down and made the triangle look small. the orb that was dimmer was still right along side of it, they were still twinkling as if communicating. at this point i looked through the night vision goggles again and after a minute or two i noticed the same amber orb moving back into view from the direction we last saw it,(comming from the direction of the ocean). it was moving in a straight line to the immiediate right of where we were. i followed it and saw it drop a red orb out from underneath it. as they moved across the sky the amber orb slowly pulled away from the red orb, they were moving away from us. we told paula to flash her headlights at it to see if we would get a response. when she did the red orb stopped in its tracks and started going back in the same direction it had come in a seconds time. the amber orb stopped ond hovered until paula beamed her high powered laser light up into the sky next to it. when she did it came straight towards us and flew right over us. it looked like a cluster of twinkling amber lights, then when it passed us it looked like a triangle craft. it had four amber lights in a row across the back and norrowed to one red light in the front. we stood where we were for about 45 seconds then decided to move back down the road.\r\n\r\n when we stopped we looked at the triangle formation and saw that all four of the orbs were moving in and out. the formation was getting smaller than bigger, still with the dimmer orb next to the highest one. i decided to look through the night vision goggles again and when i did i saw an orb to the left of the triangle which was the same direction the amber and red orb went. it was flashing, all of a sudden it flashed very bright,so bright that lit up the sky around it and the night vision goggles. \r\n\r\nthe very next morning we noticed that there was a report of the same thing flying over nevada. the pictures that were taken over nevada were the same things we had seen in california.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the morning and i was looking up often to locate flocks.  as i was scanning the sky i noticed a very bright light that was moving forward and reversing directions to fly back where it was just at and also, hovering.  it was moving in smooth fluid motions, not in a jerky manner. the flash from this object was very bright and constant.  we were watching this object for a couple of minutes as it was moving about the sky.  all of a sudden, we noticed another bright light in the sky fairly close to the first one sighted.  the second object seemed to be moving in a circular or looping motion.  the four of us continued watching these objects for another minute or so until both objects were either to far to see them any longer or they disappeared/vanished.  we did not see the second object moving towards the first object at all during this incident, it seemed to just appear close to it. when i returned home later in the day i tried to duplicate the brightness of the steady \"flash\" from the objects, i put a piece of aluminum foil under my overhead kitchen light with the shiny side towards the light bulb to reflect the light.  even that was not as bright as the objects we saw.This

mine. we were actually looking for deer to see if they were stirring because the evening was rather cold. as we were driving along we both looked up and saw the same thing: a red object -spherical appeared - in the sky over the gulf of mexico (must have been over the water given the distance), slowly descended at about a 45 degree angle, then suddenly rocketed to the earth. two more objects followed doing the exact same thing.\r\n\r\ni immediately pulled over and both of us got out of the truck to observe the sky for aircraft. specifically an ac-130 gunship, an apache longbow (ah-60), or other fighter aircraft. this area is home to eglin afb and hurlburt field afsoc (air force special operations command) and there are many exercises the military performs nightly. i was thinking it was a 105 howitzer round from an ac-130 gunship but when i searched the sky i saw nothing. i know these aircraft can operate blacked out but it just didnt seem like that type of aircraft. my friend is a few years older than me but weve both lived here all our lives and are very familiar with the military aircraft around here and their operations. it should be noted that the night was absolutely clear and it was nearly full moon.\r\n\r\napproximately fifteen minutes later i was driving down the exact same road and noticed aircraft occupying what appeared to be the general airspace in which the sighting occured.\r\n\r\ni found out two days later from my friend that an article was published in the local news. i did some homework and the following is the website of the article, as well as, an email thread featuring me and a seperate eyewitness that was interviewed by the local newspaper the northwest florida daily news:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Nwfdailynews.Com/news/test-26225-base-objects.Html\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom: me\r\nto: eyewitness\r\nsubject: re: mona from daily new gave your email\r\ndate: thu, 4 mar 2010

know what flares look like and im pretty sure what you saw (and me for that matter) wasnt a flare. the objects i saw slowly descended to the ground/water at about a 45 degree angle, then suddenly rocketed with no trail of any kind. im not ruling out that the whole thing may have been some weapons exercise on base using some technology that the public knows nothing about for reasons involving national security but it was weird nonetheless. \r\n \r\nand yes i wish i had a camera. i saw something strange on my way to the airport in pensacola around 0400 last summer too. \r\n

fall from the sky.  they said it was a flare from base, but i do not believe that!  we live in valparaiso, but we don't live that close to base to see that big of a flare.  this fell at an angle and was really big, it was quite creapy. its one of those times you really wish you would have had a camera, ya know.  i was told that i would see more of these \"flares\" thoughout the month, but i have not seen anymore since that night. \r\n

(pst). in one of the videos my wife mentions 12:00 central time; this was the end of the sighting. i parked the vehicle at more or less a forty-five degree angle to the road with the headlights pointed towards the glow of las vegas in the sky. this glow also illuminated the mountains and landscape (silhouette etc.). \r\n\twe had pulled off the road to see the stars in the remote sky; we were not there to catch a sighting (13 years married with no break from the kids-type trip). we were in a hurry to get back to vegas but decided to stop along 375. we initially left the car running and lights on with my wife sitting in the passenger seat. i left the car and came around to her side and proceeded to watch the horizon. once we both saw how many stars there was i told her to turn off the car and step out with me. we had both been standing there for just a few minutes trying to get both the digital cameras and the video camera to pick up what we saw. just then i noticed a bright object (not a shooting star) high up in the sky headed towards vegas. \r\n\tthis object was very small or very high but did not exhibit normal characteristics of a plane. there were no flashing strobes or sound from engines etc. this object being small, and disappearing quickly, did not really grab my attention. however, moments later from the same direction the object disappeared from came two lights flashing. they seemed motionless and as if they were affixed to each other. in other words it seemed that they were attached by a bar or direct line etc. they flashed for a while before i even considered pointing the camera at them. there are many cattle crossing lights of similar color along 375. it finally dawned on me that those lights had to be miles away and could not possibly be the same type of lights; these lights were much brighter and intense. \r\n\ti pointed the video camera at the objects and could not pick them up until i turned on night shot. the two larger lights were very visible; in addition to this were two other smaller lights that could not be seen with the naked eye. we watched these objects move from left to right going in the direction of rachel. as the two primary objects (po) moved in this direction you could see other smaller lights moving around them. they would zip from one point to another. as they shot away their illumination would dim. in all probability, there were probably more objects out there than we captured or even saw. i based this on the fact that after watching the video, you can see objects you could not see with the naked eye.  \r\nthe po traveled from the direction of vegas until they were almost perpendicular with 375 before we lost sight of them. we waited for a few more minutes and then decided to leave. we had only gone about a mile or two when my wife screamed ���there they are again���. this time the po were only a few miles from us (i am guessing about this, their contrast in the night sky made this hard to tell but they were definitely very close to us).  in the video i try to use the ground as both a reference and to help make the camera focus as it should. as you will see in the video, based on the ground etc. it seems that they were right on top of us but i could not figure out why we were not being dowsed by the light. also, i did not see any report of this light on the ground. it was as if the light did not travel or radiate like normal lights. this was very strange for something so bright and intense.\r\nthe po made very slow movements. the additional smaller objects seemed to jet around the larger ones and were more agile.  in one of the videos i think i see something like electricity or sparks coming from the po. now the strangest thing was that the po seemed to merge with each other right before they ���blinked��� off or out. also, strange is that i heard my wife say they are gone but she says this at least a second or two before they ���blink��� out again on the camera (not sure why there was a delay between her eyes and the camera). in the stills there seems to be a structure present.  \r\nas far as feelings went, i think we were just in amazement of the objects. when they reappeared closer to us the second time i think we were both a little frightened. it seemed to be checking us out. we got a little more worried about the remote location and the fact that there were other objects moving around the po. i do believe that if we stayed there, the objects would have come closer. i had no feeling whatsoever that the event was over with when we left. these objects were clearly doing something related to that general locale. we decided to leave based on the fact that each time the lights went off, they came back on closer. \r\n\r\ni am not sure how to answer the radio button at the bottom of this screen. what third parties are you referring to?  all i am really seeking is if someone knows what these images are and just how close they were to us. i will submit the videos after speaking to someone in person via phone. \r\n\t","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the second floor. i told her what i had seen. we both concluded that it had to be a ufo. two days later my friend called me and said she had seen a strange white light shining into her bedroom as well. we only live a few hundred yards from each other. told her what we had seen, and we concluded that it was the same night, and around the same time of the night. we realized that the light had been closer than we first thought, because she saw it in a window that faces north! this is not the only weird, unexplainable thing that i have witnessed while living here. however, it took me 8 months to report this event, and i did so because i searched the report database and found an almost identicle report from july 5, 2009. in pa. the witness mentioned a radio station; cat country. that radio station is about 15 to 20 miles from my location. i realize now that i have been following the reports almost daily in search of a story like ours from my area. and i found it this morning. i am reporting this today in hopes of giving someone else who may have seen this event validation about it. also, i am anxious to see if others who witnessed the blinding white lighton the night of july 5, 2009 will feel compelled to report it here.  eventually, i hope to report the other unexplained events that i have witnessed from my mountainside view.
