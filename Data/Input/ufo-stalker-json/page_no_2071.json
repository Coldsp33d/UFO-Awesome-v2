az.\r\n\r\nsometime between 11pm and 1 am on the night of march 8-9, 1997, i woke up to use the rest room.  as i stood next to my tent, i was facing north and enjoying the starlit sky for a moment before i went back to sleep.  then, i noticed a light moving steadily from my left to right [west to east] above the rim of the canyon i was in.\r\n\r\nthe light appeared to be a globe or orb glowing continuously.  because of the size of the light and its relative speed, i first thought it was a light civil aircraft.  as i watched, i could see no aircraft outline, nor any other running lights (e.G. wingtip strobes, red or green running lights).  all i could see was a globe that was the color of an incandescent lightbulb.  i judged it to be too large for a typical light civil running light.  i did not hear any sounds that an aircraft or helicopter would make.\r\n\r\nbased on the size of the globe, its brightness, and angle above the horizon [maybe 20 degrees - a guess because i have not been to fish creek for six or seven years], i ruled out a sattelite.  i spent 12 years in the marine anti-aircraft warfare field and spend many nights in the desert observing aircraft, and many hours watching radar scopes, and have watched sattelites go overhead.\r\n\r\nas i watched, the light disappeared behind a rock formation that jutted up from the canyon wall.  i waited for the light to appear on the other side of the rock formation.  i waited a minute or more.  it never reappeared.\r\n\r\nwhile i observed it, it never changed speed or direction.  i don't think it was an aircraft landing light because i don't think it would have been that bright from my angle which was appeared to be perpendicular to its line of flight.  i don't know what it was.\r\n\r\ni can't compare it to the phoenix light observed five days later because i did not observe the phoenix lights.  recent interest over the march 13th anniversary of the phoenix lights prompted me to make this report.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

trail, it was like vapour all around the structure.\r\nin a night with no clouds, one single strange pentagonal cloud was crossing the sky at a speed too high for being a cloud (besides there was no

fixed wing aircraft, like a lear jet possibly. it was completely silent, and the two lights appeared to be offset for the direction it was travelling. i've seen birds at night time, but this was different. it was travelling so fast and straight and it looked to be a void in the middle, neither black or light gray like the sky, but just an empty space in the middle of these two fixed points.

ufo.\r\n\r\ni had just left junction 17 prestwich/whitefield in manchester to go to preston at approx. 11.50pm  on 16th march 2010.\r\ni looked through my drivers side window towards the purple sky and noticed an unusually bright light, like a torch shining into my direction.    \r\n\r\nthere was also a smaller light some miles behind it in the near distance, which i can see blipping aircraft lights.  i will explain more about this further down.\r\n\r\ni ignored it at first thinking it was a light from a plane  or helicopter.  but as i was near junction 15, i can see that it was a huge perfect triangle shaped object with 3/4's of it lit up with many bright whitish round lights on the underside. not like automobile hid intensity lights, but powerful car fog light type.   in the darker corner, i could see one or two smaller permanent red lights which do not blink.\r\n\r\ni thought it was a reflection on my window, until i wound it down, and wow! it was still there!   not that high up in the sky, and it remained totally and perfectly still, in the same place almost right above me!\r\nit was not busy on the motorway, so i quickly pulled up on the hard shoulder and quickly got my camera out.\r\n\r\nas soon as i stepped out and pointed it towards the triangular object, it had simply vanished, as if it knew i had noticed it and was going to take pictures.\r\ni remained looking everywhere at the sky, it was quiet and no sign of anything?\r\nthe time was approx. 11.52pm or so.\r\n\r\ni got into my car and very soon  past the junction 15 sign,  i then  saw the smaller light coming closer towards me, which i mentioned earlier, and indeed, it was a small aircraft flying across my path on the motorway.  it had the usual blipping lights on the plane and   i knew it was an aircraft, but the other one was huge,   definitely  not a plane, stealth fighter, helicopter, 747, police helicopter or toy ufo etc.....\r\n\r\ni couldnt say how high it was,  maybe 6 or 7  street lamp posts high?\r\ni do recall when i was driving on the motorway towards it, it was towards my right above eye level.  i  didnt have to lift my head up to see it.\r\n\r\ni just felt excited and knew to take note of important details.\r\n\r\ni have always been a ufo fan and watched all the ufo hunters series, other ufo related sites and know my aircraft shapes etc..\r\nbut i never thought i would witness one myself!\r\n\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\njeff wong\r\n37 years old","distance":"501 Feet - 1

saw two bright lights appearing to be underneath a street light across the way. when i locked on to it, it appeared to then \"level off\" and fly away into the distance in a slight curve around the pole, the lights on when to the right of the pole, off when to the left of it and fading to the distance. it didn't head all the way left as the airplanes do that land at the airport. it especially caught my eye because it looked similar to two white lights i saw in that same direction last june and posted to mufon. these lights were not clearly unconventional, but an hour later, taking in groceries from the car to the house, hovering directly across the cross street were two bright lights that were stationary, with a helicopter flying underneath it. the helicopter could be heard, the \"plane\" never made a sound. after i looked at it for a few seconds just hovering there and the helicopter moving beneath it, another light appeared to the right and the object started to \"glide\" away in that direction. a red light then appeared and flashed in a non-discernible pattern. i watched the triangle of white lights with a red light in its middle slowly move away and the helicopter followed it. i could clearly hear the helicopter and no other sound but traffic when it passed close by. ironically, or synchronistically, the june sighting already mentioned also included a triangle that flew over my house a short while after i had seen the object or objects with two white spheres. also, this monday night, my friend at my house and i heard rumbling off and on throughout the evening. after the sighting it got loud enough that we could feel the rumbling indoors and went outdoors to investigate. in the direction that the triangle object was hovering in when i initially saw it, it sounded as if jet engines were rumbling during takeoff when hearing that as an observer close to the ground by an airport when the planes take off. i doubt they were jet engines because the sound would usually build up then suddenly stop as if the engines were literally shut off, but if a plane were making the sound it should have faded away. the lights and sounds monday night were strange. i've included two images i created from pictures i've taken of areas in which i saw the lights from the perspective i saw them, \"photoshopping\" in the anomalous craft, lights and

meteor. it became suspended in the air and there was three individual lights in a triangular shape still heading downward but now it was also moving side to side. a fourth light appeared and finally a fifth light. it looked like a(y).  it was incredible! i had never seen anything like that.  i was still caught up in amazement when i noticed a silent object in the sky moving towards me about a 1/2 mile away from me. this object suddenly released what appeared to be another flash of light which startled me,  and as before this light starts coming down to the earth, splits in two, then three,
