my sister if she could see it, at first she said no, the clouds were moving pretty fast, then she said \"yes, it's a plane.\" i told her that it wasn't moving, that it was the clouds moving. after a minute she realized this was true. still she said it was probably a satelite. i asked why a satelite would be blinking, she said the sun was probably hitting it as it spun. i don't think it was a satelite, i would think satelites would move across the sky, not be stationary. the light was bright and blinked on and off. it never moved from its spot. except for the clouds, it was a sunny day.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\n\r\nmy wife, and i live near the intracoastal waterway in west palm beach, fl.  last night around 11:30pm i was taking our two small dogs for a walk down along the waterfront on flagler drive.  it was a clear night, with very few clouds, and about 65 degrees.  i was about a block south when the sound of a large jet starting booming in the sky, seemingly a little northwest of our location.  i didn't really think anything of it as jets take off & land at palm beach international airport, toward the direction of the sound.  you usually start hearing the sound change, like the doppler effect, as they either land from the east, or take off into the east.  occasionally you could see a the small, slow moving lights of a smaller plane.  after a couple minutes i realized the loud jet sound was not changing or decreasing.  it seemed so close, though there was nothing to see in the sky, even though it was very loud.  even one of our little dogs started getting frightened & started pulling back toward the house.  he had never reacted like this.  the propulsion sound was loud enough to be similar to what you would hear standing near a jet on the runway, maybe a hundred yards away ... definitely under a fair amount of throttle & not idling.  the best thing i could think of was that there was something hovering with a very powerful engine, or propulsion system, with little or no movement in one direction, or another.  but it didn't have that extra whine that you hear from the induction blades, that normally sound like a whistle.\r\n\r\ni really knew this was not normal, and though i've never seen a ufo, nor have ever had desire of wanting to take a ride on one ... the experience was giving me that sense of unexplainable uneasiness.  i really felt i needed to get back to my wife.  by the time i got back home she was already on the front lawn, and had timed the sound as already having lasted about 8 minutes at that high level of volume.  it actually was loud enough to get her out of bed.  she got changed quickly so we could head off in the truck to hunt down the location of the sound.  the odd thing that we started to realize was that there was no one else alarmed by the sound on our street, like only we could hear it.  as we headed north we did see one group of kids outside by their truck, stopped in the middle of a side street.  we thought of stopping, but wanted to keep moving.  we could not believe how few people it had alarmed, as though whatever it was was only audible to certain individuals.  that was at least our initial thought, as it was also evident that only certain younger kids could hear it, apart from us.  as we got to southern boulevard, which is a main route to the airport, we kept the windows down to keep tracking the sound.  sometimes it seemed to be all around us, but then it would re-concentrate to the west.  we then pulled up along side a jeep cherokee with the front windows rolled down, heading in the same westward direction ... with two younger guys in it.  we asked if they heard the same sound, just so we could be sure there was \"someone\" else out there who heard this.  they said they were trying to track down the sound, as well.  they took off in front of us, as we both continued toward the airport.  just as we were cresting the i-95 overpass, which gives you a direct view of the airport, the sound stopped.  no planes were taking off, and there were no odd lights in the sky.  we got onto the road just to the east of the runways, but at that time my wife started feeling car sick, which she never does ... and said she really felt she did not want to enter the proper airport grounds.  we got home about 12:30pm, and kept trying to listen for it to start up again, to no avail.  however, our other little dog got quite nervous & started pacing around and looked up at the ceiling a few times.  he did not want to come back in the room.\r\n\r\nall day today we scanned the local news & i typed different criteria into google like \"loud noise, west palm beach,\"  ufo, west palm beach,\" etc. .... for any news of the noise, or any strange news, but there was nothing.  it's really been quite disturbing & unnerving, especially as there is no one who's called us to say they had a similar experience.\r\n\r\nthanks for letting me submit this.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nbarry","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22306,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.7206724,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03152010-0009","longitude":-80.0448346,"occurred":1268634600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268698511000,"summary":"Very

area of waukesha (se wisconsin) on an off since last april, including a sighting at around 3:00am by myself and my husband.  the most recent of these sightings have been in the past week or two.\r\n\r\nthese are basically lights in a circular shape that appear significantly lower in the visual horizon than the \"stars of the night sky\".  they are also larger in size (about x5 to x10) than a bright star on a clear night (visual perspective).\r\n\r\nthey appear either instantaneously or \"fade\" into view.  usually they appear as a single instance, though on one occasion two were witnessed in close proximity to one another.  for the most part they simply seem to hoover - though their light seems to pulse and change color (mostly orange-ish).\r\n\r\nhowever, eventually the do move - and the movement is barely perceptible - but quite odd - the seem to move in a up and down or side to side pattern. and in the case of the two being sighted together, one of the \"balls of light\" seemed to \"zip off\" directly to the east (right) of its hoovering counterpart at an extreme speed. for the most part they seem to move off quite slowly (fade from view) or simply \"blink out\" instantaneously (disappear)\r\n\r\nwe've tried to capture photos, but lack the appropriate equipment (our cellphones is about it for cameras).  we've also talked to quite a few people in the vicinity of the park and river who've also noticed these orbs or spheres recently too.\r\n\r\ni think the thing that causes a person to notice them is that they are so much larger and lower than the stars, and their strange behavior/movements and color shifting.\r\n\r\n(2 comments - 1 - this form is way too cumbersome.  get someone in your group who has familiarity with designing ui or hi to make the form much more user friendly and you'll probably get a lot more reporting.\r\n\r\n2 - allow a default form set to be defined for anonymous posters.  some ppl will be glad to report such phenomena provided they can automatically do so with ease and without fear of public ridicule.  when we saw the first occurrence last year, i looked up \"where to post ufo sightings\" and found your site.  however, one look at your form and i opted not to.)\r\n\r\nthe only reason i am taking the time to make this report now, is these \"spheres\" or \"orbs\" myself and a number of my neighbors are seeing in the waukesha wisconsin area are strikingly familiar to those currently being seen/looked into near lake erie.  i'm sure there are a number of ppl in the area who could substantiate similar sightings (i've talked to at least 20 dif ppl who have seen these things), but they'd probably only do so if they were assured their names would be omitted and they'd not be \"on camera\" in any way.\r\n\r\nthough i remain largely skeptical on the topic of ufo's as a whole, these are definitely odd occurrences and they are reoccurring. though to be honest, i don't have the time to be camped

city located in western ny state about thirty miles south of lake erie.\r\n  it was very cold that evening, so we decided to skip the parade and get dinner at a local restaurant instead..  while driving from the restaurant, i glanced into the sky, and noticed a round orange light, almost directly above the parade route.  at first i thought a news aircraft was filming the parade.  then i saw a second and then a third and a forth.  they were all the same size and shape, and upon further inspection, i decided they were too high up to be small air craft.  they were traveling from east to west, and moving very slow.  if i had to guise, i would say the objects were about one mile apart, and spaced at an even distance.  i thought maybe air craft, but most air craft you see, have flashing navigation lights.  these objects had none , just a solid orange light.  we had already ate dinner, and were on our way to drop off the kids at their grandmothers house to spend the night.  she lives on a hill above the city , so while my wife brought the kids into the house, i stood in her front lawn, and watched the lights.  two were gone, but two were still visible. the sky had no clouds that evening, and one of the lights seemed to diaper (go out) and then come back on.  in all i would say the whole event took 45 minutes to an hour.  too long in my opinion, to be jet air craft.  i never reported this event, until i saw a news report stating several people sited similar lights in the sky over lake erie, in cleveland ohio.  \r\n  cleveland is about 130 miles west of jamestown.  i have never been a firm believer in the super natural or ufos. , but what i witnessed the night of december 5th, is definitely unidentified.

beautiful colorful sky & the very unusual 3 large swan-like white cloud formations , that particular window faces the south-west . as i was standing & wondering about these clouds i've noticed the white sphere-light moving below , (at this point i've decided this time i'll try to take a photo of it), first from the lower regular cloud & gliding in & up , than past above the 3 swan-like clouds . \r\ni have 5 sequenced photographs of the ufo lights . after taking these i stood there admiring it for , perhaps a minute or so , at least that's how long it felt as i did not look at my wrist watch . \r\nmy digital camera registered the time though while taking & trying to zoom in on the subject , & the recorded time begun at exactly 4:46 pm to 4:49 pm .\r\nafter watching them for short while , the white sphere just disappeared :-(\r\nthrough my observations on these flying objects , especially the last 12-18 months , they seem to have a preferred routes , lol ! \r\n most times they fly in an exact line from the west to precise south of the usa , (i've checked on my sm. compass).  \r\nbtw , in the western sky that the ufos seem to fly from is where the toronto international airport is located , perhaps it is of some significance .\r\n( also last year my friend noticed \"lights\" driving past the airport towards brampton & i've seen them again in the same flying pattern as usual & it is on his & another friend's insistence that i should start recording this 'phenomenon' in some form ).\r\n  the 2nd \"favourite\" flyby route seems to be in a straight line from direct east towards exact south ! ( & always fly near or over the lake ) .\r\nas a footnote , i did forwarded this info along with attached jpeg photos to mr. jim moroney at the aufosg on sat. march 6th / 2010.\r\np.S.  actually i am surprised at managing to 'capture' the ufo on my camera as it was some distance from where i reside & my camera is a simple kodak 10.3 mp with a 3x zoom only .\r\n\r\np.S.S.  on your media attachments i was only able to file 3 of the 5 photos that i've taken .","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":22284,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.5932955,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03132010-0012","longitude":-77.7402081,"occurred":1265589960000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268548497000,"summary":"Beautiful sunset & a white orb surprise !","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Toronto","timeZoneName":"America/Toronto","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":34,"locationName":"Etobicoke,Greater Toronto, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:142220"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2072}
