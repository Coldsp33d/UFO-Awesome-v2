pulsating hum. sitting strait up, i turned to the left to see three ghostly figures materialize in the next room as they were approaching my bedside.  please remember that we had no electric and i had never been to a movie or heard a radio show to that point.  two of the creatures looked just like the gray aliens you see in the movies and the one in the center was much taller and looked different.  as they got closer they told me to relax and go back to sleep telepathically. the floating sensation i felt helped stop my nervous shaking as i blacked out.  the next morning my grandmother met me half way to the kitchen and asks if i was all right.  she said that i had sunburn on the left side of my face and looked very tired. in the back seat of the new buick on our way to the farm i felt compelled to lay down on the floor with my back to the front seat.  the telepathic message was like the one i received from the three ghosts.  moments after laying down we t-boned another car on route 13 near blackbird.  everyone except i was seriously injured and taken to the hospital. the year i believe was 1959 while at the park i noticed about 12 flying saucers to the west of the park.  to my great surprise i had a visit the next day while at my friends home that lived around the corner from my grandparents home at 806 brown st.  john's father answered the door to find two air force people in uniform asking to speak with me in private.  my mother stood with the air force officer to my left and the sergeant stood in front as another man entered the room dressed in black wearing a hat and dark sunglasses. i was asked to tell what i saw as follows: i saw bright round objects mostly in triangular groups of three flying in a manor not like any aircraft known.\r\nthey were able to stop and turn on a dime and when they departed to an altitude near space they took off so fast that they appeared to vanish at about a 30 degree angle into space. for the next hour the air force guys tried to get me to change my story and i was growing tired of repeating myself.  i then parroted back one of the officer's stories as a way to make them leave. i noticed the officer look up at the guy in black for approval, as i could  see the guy in black shake his head left and right. now i knew i had to convince the guy in black and realized that the officer was taking his orders from him.  so i came up with a better idea that got the approval from the big boss in black. the man in black never said a word to me even after asking him direct questions.  he then folded his notebook and left followed by my mother and the officer.  there are many other strange stories about hard to believe events, but either you believe or not will make no difference.\r\n\r\nthis is my recorded statement so others like me will take some comfort in knowing that they are not alone?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22279,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.2271182,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03132010-0007","longitude":-116.0293071,"occurred":-570816000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268529495000,"summary":"Three

march 12 i choose a different location which provided a better view and saw a light matching the news report to the northwest. the light was orange-white and about the size and intensity of venus two-fingers above the horizon.  the light was seen at least three times between 7:15pm and 7:48pm starting as a bright light, then dimming and in the first observation moving to the southwest. the light was observed by not only myself but three other individuals. the light or should i say lights were observed by naked eye, video camera, and binoculars.  through binoculars not only was one light seen, but a second the same color and of lower intensity slightly above and to the right. a faint light was also seen fading in and out in the same area until 8:08pm. \r\n\tthere was light air traffic in the area and the two closest airports are burke lakefront airport 10 miles to the southwest and cleveland-hopkins airport 18 miles to the southwest. first thought is it may be an airplane circling over lake erie for an approach to cleveland-hopkins airport and the bright light was the landing light. the sky was partially cloudy and the light could be dimming either by cloud cover or the plane

shoot an approach to cairns army airfield. as we watched they very slowly drifted from right to left. they were southwest of cairns airfield. there was no sound only the lights. i called a employee in the hangar who also was looking at them on my cellphone. anyway, as we watched they started disappearing. my friend who was in the hangar said to him it looked like an army aircraft flew toward them and when it did they started disappearing. i didn't see that from my position. one by one they started disappearing till they were gone. me and my partner were discussing what we had seen while waiting for the other employee to come. about five min. later we saw two more of the lights suddenly appear in the same area but higher up. these lights stayed lit for several minutes then they disappeared. the one on the left disappeared first then the second. later i talked to at least two other employees who saw the lights besides me and my partner. i've seen ufo's on tv shows about the \"phoenix lights\" and to be honest these looked like them. honestly, if i had to guess i think they could have been flares from an aircraft at high altitude but i just don't know. i've never seen flares in this area all of my life but i suppose it is possible. other than that i have no idea what it was. but i know i'm not the only one who saw them. also there was no sound that we could hear.

route as most passenger plane routes to msp airport, but the light configuration i thought was pretty wierd so, thats when i realized i couldnt hear the craft. i continued watching it but it did not follow the route but instead continued on a south western path rather than going to msp airport.   i did stand out on the patio and could hear the passenger planes at the same distance.  all im saying it definately was a ufo    not that it was alien but.... what do we have that capability?...Also it was not flying as fast as the regular planes     i really wish for the first time in my life that i

looked up in the south-western sky and i saw an object moving slowly. i thought it was merely a plane or a helicopter, then i noticed there was no sound. at that point i told my dad to look at that object and tell me what he thought it was. we thought it was maybe an osprey, blimp or balloon- it was far away and difficult to tell it's shape. i even thought it was a trash bag.\r\n\r\nas the object came directly above our home, we were able to see the shape very clearly. the unidentifiable craft was a very large flying pyramid. it looked nearly identical to the pyramid of giza, except it had a tall antenna with 3 horizontal bars & two areas on the side that were indented.\r\n\r\nat that moment we realized it was a ufo. when i say \"ufo\", i don't mean an extraterrestrial craft, i mean that it was not a known craft that i have seen. the craft was flying at a very slow, steady speed in a strait line. it came from the south-west & kept going without pause to north-east. we watched it until we could no longer see it. the craft was brown in colour, had 4 sides & was flying fairly low, maybe 3-4 telephone poles up.\r\n\r\nwe saw this ufo on july 1st, 2007 at 7:25pm & watched it for approx. 5 mins. my dad and i were so busy analyzing the craft that i did not stop to think to get my camera! i'm still very upset that i didn't get my camera, it would have been a great picture too. this is not the first time i have seen ufos, but this particular sighting was the best one.\r\n\r\nwell, i attached a sketch of the \"flying pyramid\" (that's what i call this sighting). um, if i tell you about my sighting, you're not gonna report me to those men in black guys are you? that is why i hesitated for years to tell you.","distance":"101-500

to look for my dog.  i looked up and saw a gray reflective horseshoe shape object about 100 feet above me.  the object moved very slowly and seemed to disappear into the night, it was very dark gary, sort of reflecting, but hard to tell due to the night sky.  i had been reading this book and had a pen in my pocket and drew it in my book as i stood there. at first, i was stunned, was it my imagination?  i looked harder, i did not see it approaching me, it was just there and then moved slowly over me, very slowly and i was astonished it was so low to the ground.  i knew it was not like anything i had seen before, i live about 15 miles from will rogers intl airport.  but it wasn't a flight path normally used.  it seemed to be crawling over my head over the edge of the house and where i was standing about 10 feet from the porch.  i thought maybe it was a blimp, but did not have that shape, the horseshoe shape was clearly defined as was the two round fan shapped objects at the end of each side of the horseshoe that i seemed to be able to see thru.  as it was going slowly, over me i could see the sky thru the vent things.  the reflective surface was gray but the edges were sort of fuzzy, it seemed to reflect my house lights.  i brought it up at a mufon meeting a month later (i am a member) that 2 other people (also mufon members-a couple) had seen it the same night and and agreed that my picture i drew in the book was accurate.  i believe them because, while we were discussing things at the meeting, prior to my mentioning it, i showed the drawing to a the wife member sitting next to me.  she stated she had seen that and asked me to show her husband was standing at the back of the room.  i did and they both discussed the date, i had not told them the date yet, and they confirmed my date.  i believe they said there were others with them when they saw it.  i reported this out loud to the group with the dirctor there.  it is not like anything i have seen before, 200 feet long  and 50 feet wide with a chunk out of the center about 1/3 of the way in from the end that gave it a horseshoe look.  at the tip of each horseshoe was a round fan with blades (or thats how i perceived it) that i could see through to the night sky.  i had enough time to draw it as it moved over my head, about 2 minutes. i looked up after drawing it one more time and good not see it any longer.  in my excitement, i did not notice  if it made noise that i could hear at the time, but upon memory i could swear it made a very quiet humming noise.  i am submitting this as a mufon member of my own accord, no one had prompted me at the time to record this event. maybe it is an ifo because the state director at the time did not ask me to report it or do an interview to document the event, he did not approach the other couple either that i know of.  by the way the other couple was in tulsa area, i am in mustang, just west of oklahoma city.  that is a very long distance, over 120 miles away seen on the same night by me a mufon member and them also mufon members, what's the chance of that!    i do have several other sightings  to record.  maybe they are not ufo's.  military maybe but not like anything i have seen.  but that's what i (we) saw.  i showed the drawing to 2 family members who work in aviation navigation and also military air traffic control and it was unfamiliar to them.  i will notify our new state dirctor that i filed this report.  i originally drew it with pen, but after trying to make a picture of it by hand, i decided to see if i could get the image of the surface to show on a paint program.  this is very close to what i saw.

the spaceship had lights around it saying \"eat at joes\".\r\nit was the happened to be in the same direction of the ocean as when i saw something large and metallic the year before 2008 that looked just like the craft i saw as a child, also sometime in june, it plunged in the ocean and never came out i was watching the sunset from my living room window.\r\nthe incident last summer i awoke at 3:30 in the morning and out my window where the ocean is at least a half a mile down i have abroad view of it due to living on a hill,when i awoke the was the brightest light coming from it seems like the edge of the earth where it curves though i do not know how far my visibility is.This light was so bright the were huge shadows of me on my walls and as bright and far away the source was coming from there was no way it was from a boat or any kind of earthly vessel,it stayed lit for about 20 minutes,although it was early i tried to call my neighbor to verify what i was seeing and the phones were oddly busy,you know that fast busy sound,not a normal one.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":22256,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.024313,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03112010-0006","longitude":-124.06138,"occurred":1248085800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268333420000,"summary":"Bright

the ss horizons edge boston, a casino cruise ship and company i was employed for at the time out of lynn, ma. we were drifting on the outer edge of the stellwagen bank marine sanctuary during casino hours. as we started to make our way back inside the vessel to return to work, we heard a loud \"whooshing\" sound from about 10 to 15 degrees off the port-bow. this is not an uncommon occurence as waves continually hit the bow; especially during inclement weather. but we knew right away the sound was a bit \"off\". we hurried to the port side of the stern and saw what seemed to be a spectral, greenish, faint-glowing, disc shaped object (at best estimate, about 50 to 100 feet in diameter and about 500 feet out) come clear out of the water and hover for what seemed to be 45 seconds or so. we both confirmed with each other, that we could \"feel\" or somewhat \"sense\" heat coming from the object...(and subsequently would both later suffer from unusal yet uneventful bouts of dehydration and cold-like symptoms regardless of how the amount of fluids we drank.) the object then rose sharply to about 1000 feet and shot away, aft and ascending, until we couldnt see it anymore... that particular movement of the object took less than 10 seconds... there was absolutely no sound of any kind and the erradic movements it made as it came out of the water, was as if someone were hoisting this thing up on the end of a chain and it sawyed a bit back and forth. i have never seen anything like it before or since. naturally, i have never mentioned this incident to anyone for fear of any social reprisal... and we have subsequently, stopped speaking to each other all together. i have only mentioned it here, and will probably never mention it again. i just had to tell someone.\r\n\r\n\r\njs","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22253,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3621608,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03112010-0003","longitude":-71.0506532,"occurred":1216445400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268313446000,"summary":"The

was about a half mile away so i pulled over to the right lane. there was an older model car going very slow in front of me.I was frustrated, but decided just to bear it out. i glanced off to the left of the freeway, which is elevated quite a bit above the actual street level of the surrounding city.\r\n   i thought something looked real strange, a large part of the street lights..All lights, were blacked out except for some tiny brilliant white blue lights arranged in a pattern on top of a huge blackish/dull dark grey object. i decided to pull off to the side of the freeway and get out for a better look. the car in front of me also pulled off to the side in front of me. we were both right at the mouth of my off ramp, bell. \r\ni got out of the car, left the kids in the car for safety reasons and the old couple in the car in front of me got out too. we stood there silent watching this thing. i at first thought these were helicopters maybe spraying malathion, but there was no noise, at all. then i noticed that the lights were fixed, not like helicopters and they were bluish white and intense.The body of this thing was huge, way bigger than a couple of football fields, triangular, solid and the color of the body was real dark so you couldn't actually see it, except for the city lights blacked out underneath.All of a sudden i became aware that \"you were not meant to see this\" in a stern sort of benign way, and it slowly started taking off,silent, forward and up at a slight angle. it banked left in  front of some hills, it blacked out the lights, that's how i could see it still. it kept banking left with it's roof? facing me the whole time and once it was facing east, towards palm springs it just super blasted off. it had just taken me an hour to drive from where it disappeared, but it was gone in maybe 10 seconds!I watched it disappear and when i turned back the other couple was leaving. they said they hadn't any idea why they stopped and hadn't seen anything.I was flabbergasted!Here i had just seen the most important thing in my life!When i saw the phx lites, i freaked out.\r\ni was scared, excited and awed and i will never forget it!","distance":"101-500
