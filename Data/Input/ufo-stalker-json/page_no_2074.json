moving anymore. i drove to get a closer look and it was suddenly gone, so i doubt it was a balloon, because it had vanished while i was driving towards it. it was there one minute and gone the next. i

the distance. we were on my college campus and when i first saw the light, i thought nothing of it. when i noticed it had dramatically changed position in the sky compared to the building and surrounding trees i pointed it out to my companions and they both saw it. we then observed the \"orb\" to move from right to left, down behind the building in the distance, rise back above the top of the building, then move even further to the right. at this point me and one of the two friends decided to travel across campus to the nearby field and observe the light without and buildings in the way. the campus rests on top of a rather large hill, so we were able to get a clear view of the object from where we ended up. from here we were able to see the object in a much clearer view. on that particular night, the stars were out in full view, and when comparing the object to the stars in the sky, we were able to conclude then that the object was far too low in the sky to be a star, too large and bright to be a star, and didnt appear to be millions of light years away, as it was only just above the horizon, which isnt ordinarily where stars are so clearly visible in the early evening sky. from here we continued to view the object for about 30 minutes before we were joined by another friend, who was unable to come up with any sort of rational explanation as to what the object could be. we continued to view the object until we thought that it must just be something natural, but when we started off to head back inside, i watched the object vanish from the skyline, as if someone had flipped a switch on the light to make it turn off. seeing how stars, planes, helicopters, and various other explanations could not account for a silent, slow moving, hovering bright orange orb in the early evening sky, i can account for nothing else other than some sort of object which i dont have any reasonable explanation for it, so i turn here. friends, what do you

noticed an unusually bright light south-south east of our house.  it is hard to estimate the distance, however i would estimate it was between 5 and 10 miles. the light was flashing in a seemingly random pattern. each color was turning on and off independent of the other.  the on time of each color seemed to be random also.  when a color turned on or off it was instantaneous, unlike a light bulb.  when i first saw these lights i watched for several minutes to see if it was moving.  it was not traversing in any direction.  my perspective was that the object was jerking around a central point possibly in a tight pattern.  the light was brilliant enough to cause it to appear like a point source light causing a dancing star like optical pattern. i observed the light also with binoculars exhibiting the same visual effects. i wanted confirmation as to what i was seeing, so i asked my wife to come out and look at the object.  she did observe the object for several minutes until she got cold and went indoors.  the only difference in her observation, was she did not think the object was moving at all.\r\n\r\nsince it was cold outside that night, we stopped observing while it was still present.  i checked the position of the common planets (online) and there were none in that part of the sky that night.  this light was magnitudes brighter than anything else visible in the sky that night.  i am a private pilot and can verify this definitely was not an aircraft.  we live under the seatac airspace and have aircraft transit this area often, so we are quite familiar with the appearance of aircraft.\r\n\r\ni realize this may not be highly accurate, but i thought it may have some significance.

been photographing them on occasion ever since. they seem to appear mostly on cloudless days,start in the morning and increase throughout the day, also seem to occur more on weekends then week days. i see them while going to work, riding my bike and at times photograph them from inside my car. sometimes they are so large and right above me that i can take a great photo, i dont beleive them to be standard jet trails or plane exhaust, i beleive they are the product of a \"cloud cover\" program involving global warming or perhaps a military program of somesort,i also see them in the backrounds of tv shows filmed recently, they are very obvious. my feelings about this situation is that someone is commiting a crime by doing this to our skies, it doesnt seem right and there will be negative

the thunderbirds perform their fly-bys and aerial stunts.  my camers was a minolta gsn slr 1.4 lens and i was using 200 speed film for the event. i did not see anything unusual in the sky at the time but i just recently noticed objects in the photos i took back in 2001.  i was in the air force for 12 years and i have been to many air shows over the years with my family. i am starting to review all of my aerial shots from past air shows. i have accumulated a few hundred. after extensive research into the subject it has occured to me that these objects are seen near air shows, fireworks displays, military bases, air ports and rocket launches.  f.E warren was home of the space command and my sons primary duties was to guard the silos in a three state area because he was attached to the security forces at warren afb. i hope these photos, i took that day, prove that there are some strange things going on in our airspace. i have always kept great care in my equipment so i know that the lens and

just several planes flying in a close formation but that is explainable because they may have been landing. when i got closer i saw that there were seven small blue blinking lights like you would see on the bottom of airplanes. it was these flashing lights that lead me to believe they were planes at first. as i got even closer i saw that they were completely still. totally frozen. hovering motionless. it couldn't be planes. they can't hover.\r\nthe lights were pretty close together. they formed kind of a long triangle? not the usual triangle that people see. the people in my car said maybe they are. why would seven soundless helicopters sit there hovering in the dark without their search lights on? it didn't even move a little like balloons would. me and everybody in the car came to the conclusion that it was a ufo.\r\ni don't know that it was aliens but it was weird. other cars on the highway were looking up at it too, so we weren't drunk or hallucinating. the lights weren't randomly scattered. they were in a geometric formation witch lead me to believe it was one craft. \r\nwe were on the highway so we didn't stop but as we kept driving we saw two or three more of these lights higher up and not close to the craft. the were the same exact blue blinking lights that blinked on and off about once every second. i would have just thought they were stars if i hadn't just seen the same thing closer up in a formation.\r\n\r\nalso, in the past around a year ago i saw what looked like a rod. i was in miami and it was during the day. the rod was really far away and the way that the sun reflected on it made it not possible to be a cloud. as i kept looking at it i thought that it probably wasn't a plane cause it was going really slow but i wasn't sure because again it was far away. all of a sudden it shot off and disappeared.\r\n\r\none time i was in a car in orlando and i saw a white ball floating in the distance. but since the car was in motion the tree line got in front of it for about 6 second. when i could see the place it was again it was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe last two sightings i didn't think much of but i thought i would let you know since i was making a report anyway. the first one though was really weird and i'm positive it was not explainable by known aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen i fill out the report i will be doing so for the lights at the airport. for the degrees of angles you should know that i drove up to and under it.\r\nfor the distance i don't have a good idea of how far up things are but it was close and it was lower than where clouds are.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":22230,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.0461854,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03092010-0004","longitude":-81.9488042,"occurred":1267944480000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cross,

him to come quickly and see this thing. his brother ignored him. he ran over and dragged his brother to the spot. his brother could not see it and walked away. he watched for a few seconds and again went and dragged his brother to the spot at which time neither could see it. viewed from it's left side and below, it was a 7' tall man in a copper colored fitted shell that was metallic looking reflective material. it was 1.30 pm in the afternoon ,bright sunshine and mostly blue skies. the flyer was ascending at a 35 degree incline at walking speed. from its elevation he thought it might have left the ground 30 secs prior. he estimates it was eighty feet away at about 30' elevation ( right over a telephone poll he used for distance) and he had a clear unimpeded view. the flyer had a forward tilt, ski jumper attitude and was climbing slowly and silently.\r\nthe shape was immediately recognizable as a man wrapped in an aerodynamic shell. the hooded head and shoulders were smoothed together ,the chest was large 3' plus across. it tapered down to what was obviously feet pointing down.\r\nhe really wasn't thinking about it too deeply because it didn't make sense to him. he had never heard about the flying humanoids and was relieved to have me give some credence to his account. his brother was non responsive to the whole affair and only after i told them about this phenomenom did he think his brother might have actually seen something. which is strange because he was uncharacteristically being yelled at to come quickly. he said his brother was definitely worked up, instantly. we looked at a map and determined the starting point might well be a big church that takes up a large area.\r\nhe drew the flyer and captured its simplicity. the brothers are keeping

sudden 2 sets of lights came out of it traveling down and east. the bright object started dumping flaming objects like coals on a barbecue, they were falling to earth but would extinguish before impact. some were very large, fire also appeared to fall. when this fire stopped 2 more objects with lights came out again, this time flying upwards. the larger object emitted more flame and cinders, i thought something may have been wrong and it was possibly going to fall to earth, instead it flew straight up until it became very small and stopped. the fire stopped. it suspended itself at that elevation until the fog covered it and i could no longer see.\r\ni know several others stopped their cars to watch as did i.\r\nplease respond if you saw this too...Pc_dynamics@yahoo.Com\r\n\r\ni was in eureka california on california street heading south\r\ni looked because it was a huge bright ball in the sky resembling a very large star but way to close to be a star\r\ni thought it was a ufo as it could have been nothing else\r\nits actions were as stated above,after being to close to be a star and after all the action this object flew straight up until it looked like a star off in the far distance and stayed there until i could no longer see it due to the fog.\r\ni was frightened for the people who may have lived below the object and thought possibly they were in danger of it crashing down, i began to cry, to much fire and embers to have this ship in proper order","distance":"501 Feet - 1

portland and noticed a very strange cloud formation. from the looks of it, and the area, it appeared to clearly be an exhaust trail from a plain, but it does not look conventional. i had my girlfriend snap a few pictures while i was driving with the camera phone. you can sort of see them, but the pics need to be enhanced if anyone can do that for me that would be great! in one of the pics i drew an outline next to the exhaust trails of what we actually saw. some of the lines were to reference other exhaust trails that appeared to be flying along side of this craft that looked more normal. because of the very sharp turns and movement that had to be involved i do not believe this was something our government has, or would be flying in daylight over a big city.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22218,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.4403294,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03082010-0003","longitude":-122.7638661,"occurred":1267752600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268041001000,"summary":"Strange

saturday on a spring day. the sky was vivid blue clear as a bell. my friend and i marcus were with our girl friends and decided to go to a place where many young people at the time went to make out. it was a wooded area about 2 miles out of town. when we arrived we got out of the car and were talking basically having a good time with the girls. i saw the object first coming just over the tops of the trees. the object was a red color with nothing metallic. the object seemed to have some kind of radiating back and forth through it. the object floated over the trees very slowly coming to a clearing then stopped all of a sudden. from the time a first saw it i could not take my eyes off of it. i felt like i were almost hypnotized and at the same time i felt we were being observed. my friend marcus was talking to me but still had not seen the object. marcus keeps calling my name but his voice sounded far away. and although i heard and could see marcus i couldn���t take my eyes off the object. then i saw marcus looking at me wondering what i was looking at in the sky. i saw him look around and i realized that he saw it too. his mouth fell open with amaze and seemed to be hypnotized himself. about that time the object went out into the sky at a speed i didn���t think was possible. i am sure faster than the speed of light. i looked at marcus and he at me. i ask him what he had seen and he answered me saying a ufo.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

back from anyone. \r\nwhat i saw that morning has haunted and intrigued me everyday since. \r\ni was in my truck at the intersection of stassney lane and ih 35 east bound on stassney sitting at the stop light. it was rush hour and lots of other vehicles waiting as well. it was a cloudy morning with a ceiling of no more then 1500 ft i estimated afterwards. as i was waiting at the light\r\nan object caught my eye just coming out of the clouds to my front and right. other people at the light saw it as well. the object a grayish metal color came partially out of the clouds. the portion of the object we all saw is best described as like the shape of a ram air parachute.\r\nthis part that was visible was very large and you could see squared sections around the edges and was definantly made of some type of medal. \r\nonly a portion of the object came through the clouds and hovered and you could see the clouds moving past it. it was amazing. i looked at other drivers and we all missed a cycle of the stop light watching this thing. it made no noise. it stay there for about 30 to 45 seconds and backed into the clouds and it was gone. it did not go straight up but backwards just like where it came from when it appeared. \r\ni am a firefighter/emt and have extensive knowledge of aircraft and flight space around austin and this was not anything i have ever seen before or since. i tried looking up aircraft with similar shapes and size and found nothing.\r\ni would be glad to make a drawing for you if needed. \r\nplease help me try and figure out what i saw and help me put my mind to rest. \r\n\r\nthank you\r\njohn cole","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Path then
