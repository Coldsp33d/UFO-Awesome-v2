yukon alaska, which is part of the early warning system. the site was manned by usaf personell. many times during the evening shifts we would get radr images of unidentified aircraft molesting civilian aircraft bound to different destinations through out the world. these aircraft were incredibally fast and could turn on a dime. we had several times that the aircraft in question would molest an sr 71 heading through alaskan airspace. you know haw fast the sr71 is. the manual ground speed, as dertermined by the operatoers was over 2600 hundred miles per hour. these craft would com in from different headings and molest the aircraft for a few minutes and then spead away in some different direction. some of these turns were impossible for the military and the civilian aircraft.\r\n\r\nwhen these air space incursions happened to militarry and civilian aircraft alike anchorage center would yell on the hot box if we had any military aircraft molesting the civilan aircraft. our proceedure at the time was to turn on the scope camera to record the incidents. i am sure there are records of these interdictions in the usaf files if you know what to look for. \r\n\r\nthe reason i am writing this letter today is that i am watching the story of the jal pilot that saw a ufo over alaske in the 1980's. i want to tell you that i am sure this pilot saw wahat he saw. if you look deeper into the incedents over alaskan air space you will definately find the proof you need. i am not sure what the usaf did with the record of these incursions. but i know they happened and there is alot of guys stationed in fort yukon alaska that could tell you more about these incidents.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22214,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":66.56735,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072010-0032","longitude":-145.2513402,"occurred":137380440000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alaska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268031859000,"summary":"Radar

the sky over the lemoyne/new cumberland area. this time i decided to report it after i noticed two become remarkably close. planes obviously do not fly towards eachother and take up course together unless it's a military mission. after going inside and showing my husband the blinking lights i've been telling him about i decided to go back out. again i witnessed white and red strobing lights (at least 4 at once) in different parts of the sky as i looked towards the new cumberland area. \r\n\r\nshortly after returning out the second time one flew over my house towards new cumberland. it was triangular in shape judging by the lights. i couldn't see the body of the object just one red strobing light at the front point of the object and white lights on the other two points. it seemed to be moving about the speed of a plane but there was no sound at all. about 3 minutes later another one flew over following the same path. three minutes after that a third one, flying the same direction, passed by but this time more over the neighbor's house. this one had a different configuation of lights. this had two white lights and an amber one. \r\n\r\nas all this is happening i am continuing to see strobing white and red lights off in the distance up to 4 at a time. \r\n\r\ni have never witnessed so many of these lights at once or so close. but one thing seems to follow a pattern. i always see these lights in the same area on very clear and stary nights starting anywhere from 9 pm to 10 pm.\r\n\r\nhopefully if you look out now you can still see

noticed 4 to 5 yellow orange lights in a row. they were southeast of gordon texas just above the tree line. if i extended my arm towards the lights i could cover them with my thumb. in other words they were not close to me. the lights were  very intense.  to the right a new light appeared and the far left light disapeared. i went back to the barn to get my phone and when i returned the lights were gone.The total time that i watched them was for a few seconds. i immediatley recognized the formation as i have seen a similar one before. several months before the big sighting at stephenville tx, i was on hwy 6 near carbon tx. when i saw the lights i was almost directly under them. i stopped behind a trucker and his wife who were looking at them also. this thing was huge.Make a fist and extend it to the sky. it was the width of 4 fists. the lights did not move,but rather one new light would form to the right and the far left light would disappear. when the new light was forming it resembled a neon sign that flickers before it comes on completely. in between the lights there were no stars present. but when the left light would disapper stars could be seen. consequently, when a new light was forming to the right the stars would fade and only the new light and the light next to it could be seen. we also noted a jet flying above the lights in a circular pattern. the jet was making noise but the lights in a row were silent. i do not remember how long we watched it but it  traveled west until it went out of our sight. i also do not know how many minutes passed until a new light would form. i was rather excited and did think about that at the time.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

looking around the sky because the weather had been cloudy for the past week or so, and i was taking this opportunity to enjoy the view.  i ended up looking up toward the southwest and there was this light in the sky, it caught my eye because it looked like a cross in the sky.  i sat there for about 15 minutes trying to figure out what it was and nothing i had ever seen before looked like this.  then we went to get a camera and the whole time it didn't seem to move from its spot.  after we got the camera we went to wendy's for some food and i started filming it.  i ended up calling my friend and asked if he was seeing this.  when he called me back i was talking to him and while that was happening a helicopter or plane i don't know what exactly it was dark, but it did have a bright red light flashing on its tail.  anyways when it got close to the object it turned the other way and flew out of sight.  after we got some food we went to victoria park to get a better view of it.  still it hadn't moved and was still flashing colors.  i filmed it some more, and as i was doing a plane flew toward it and when it got close to it, it turned back the other way.  we ended up watching it till about 11:30 then we had to go.  i did see it again around 12 when i went back outside to check if it was still there and it was.  i wasn't around when it left but it happened between 12 and 12:30.  that was how that happened.  but the next night i saw the same object again just floating the and flashing different colors, but this time it was closer and it was more visible.  didn't have a camera tonight because it was too late to get one, being that it was about 11:30 or so when i caught site of this one.  this time it was more to the west.  my friend and i were driving around when this happened so we decided to follow it and try to get closer to and also find a good dark spot so we could get a better view of it.  we ended up driving for a good hour to the west.  we ended up stopping at a road out in the country where we had a better view.  as we were watching it was moving farther away, but as it did it seemed to dim and then light up quick and then dim out again till it disappeared.  the whole event this time was about an hour and a half.  the first night i first caught sight of my heart was pounding and it like gave me a burst of energy that lasted for the whole

daughter said \"oh that is an airplane\" \"i said have you ever seen an airplane marked with only orange lights?\" at this point i was still kinda joking about saying. \"nope. ufo. not an airplane.\" and we were laughing about it. the lights stopped and remained stationary out over lake michigan. we continued to look at stars. i decided to get out the binoculars.I looked at the orange lights and saw that it was a perfect triangle of three lights. we all took turns and confirmed what we saw. i did not state to them what i had seen first but asked them to tell me what they saw so i would not implant what i was seeing into their responses. all of us, my wife, my son (12) and my daughter(14). after a few minutes the lights started moving again,it happened as if it was in response to us having realized that it was no airplane, planet, or star that we were looking at. it moved at high speed from west to east, at least 10x faster than the airplanes (blinking with red and blue lights, easily discernible with naked eye and binoculars). when i realized how fast it had to actuall6y be going i ran up a small sand dune so i could continue to watch it and it was no where in sight after only about 5 seconds of having went behind the dune. (the night before my wife and i had seen another strange object that did almost the same thing from sirius traveling to the south west, hovering for a long time and then returning to where it started. we were wondering why there were so many orange stars in the sky that we never noticed as kids, they could not all be heading toward supernova.) we looked around the sky and started to look at other orange stars. several of them were actually triangles made of three orange lights. my daughter and i were watching one just off of north, we turned around briefly to respond to something being said and in the few seconds it took to listen, when we turned around there was one coming fast and low, it had a row of perfectly straight orange lights, it was moving at extremely high speed. as it flew over we could hear the sound of it cutting through the atmosphere. when it was directly over head there was a visible central light concentrically located between the other three, that was not visible before. it was triangular. there was a bubble of distorted light or energy of some kind pulsating from beneath the craft. this was like a purplish or blackish dark cloud or bubble beneath the thing. as it passed the row of lights looked more curved as it moved away as if the back were more of an eye shape. we watched the orange lights flying around, far off, for about another 15 minutes until the kids got cold. my wife and i went back down there but nothing spectacular was happening then.

craft, i had hundreds of flying hours, many of them at night in formation with other small and large aircraft. i have also been studying astronomy/cosmology/physics for over 20 years. i was travelling on i-84 towards hartford at about 9 pm (it was dark) when my cb radio \"lit up\" with a lot of chatter from the truckers, \"what the hell is that?\", etc. etc. i looked to my upper left and saw a huge craft with brilliant white lights (no \"beams\" like headlights on a car). the lights were pretty much equi-distant from eachother. it appeared to be low (maybe 1000 ft agl) and it didn't appear to be moving. i had no depth perception due to it being night, so i can't really specify distance but it was (approx.)less than a mile away. i could not see any structure, just the lights. as far as size goes, i can't really estimate due to the lack of anything to compare it to. as a pilot, what i observed gave me my first and only perception that it was an elaborate hoax by some knucklehead with a huge glider who put on several bright lights. the issue of aircraft flying in formation never even entered my head because whatever it was, it was not a formation of aircraft--it was a rigid structure. trust me on that one, it was not a formation of aircraft. if it was a bunch of ultra-lights, what were they using for their artificial horizon? anybody flying at night w/o an artificial horizon would be on a suicide mission--look what happened to jfk jr., and he had an attitude indicator. so for me, it ended with me thinking that it was an elaborate hoax. i never thought of it again until 20 years later when i read a book called \"night siege\" which, as you know, is about the \"hudson valley ufo\". the pictures in the book are what i saw that night.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

upon seeing him i asked him to have a look. the next time i see him he relates this story to me. this happened to him in athens texas. at the time we spoke february 18, 2010, the event had just happened approximately ten days earlier. the time of the abduction was 11:00 or 11:30 pm.  he was shaking and had goose bumps covering his arms as he was telling me his story.   i reported this abduction to another web site but did such a botched job, i felt i had to file it again. \r\nsubject got out of a car he was riding in with friends. he was going to walk across a field surrounded by woods to an apartment complex. his reason for not going directly to the apartments was that he did not want someone at the apartments to see him with his friends. as he was crossing the wooded area heading to the field he felt a presents above him. some how he knew it was a ufo without looking. he started running through the woods to escape. this is when he heard a twitching noise in the bushes in front of him. he turned and ran in a different direction but no mater which way he turned he would hear the same noises ahead.  the noises keep him running in a circle. then he became paralyzed and could only move in a jerking motion and fell to his knees. at this time god told him not to open his eyes. he became weightless for a few moments. next he was examined with some device that he called a scanner.  as it was moved around his head he could hear a buzzing sound similar to a radio being tuned across the band. this devise made his hair stand up as it was moved over his head. as he was relating this to me he was holding both sides of his head as if he were in pain.  while in the craft he hears someone say,  he is still alive. then hears someone one else say,  i need a transfer then a string of numbers.  for some reason he felt that these numbers were very important and related to me that he wished that he could be hypnotized to reveal the sequence. the duration of the time he was abducted was approximately fifteen minuets. he told me that he cried so much that his shirt was soaking wet. the event was so traumatic that he prayed to god that if he made it through the ordeal that he would give his life to god. when he was returned he was standing, his arms outstretched, looking up at the sky. the condition of the sky before the abduction was cloudy, after his return no clouds with the stars clearly visible.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22196,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.2048735,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03072010-0014","longitude":-95.8555207,"occurred":1265616000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1268005194000,"summary":"Man

around 7pm the flights were on departure so the aircraft were flying towards me in a north easterly direction and this is where my uncertainty on the object being a plane comes in, as it was flying towards luton airport ( south westerly ) bearing right heading west it was visible for just over a minute, there were planes leaving the airport just prior and just after the event which tells me that there would possibly be radar signatures from planes in the vicinity and possibly the tower at luton itself ( i have been told that their scanning range is 12 miles up with a 25 mile radius

simply melding into the next  \r\n\r\nthe object had a fluent movement and did not fluctuate in height while visible, my view of it was not impeded in any way, there was a slight shimmering of the

stargazer since i was a child.  when i look at the night sky, i know what i am looking for, i know what i am looking at, plain and simple.\r\n\r\ni happened to watch a program on tv just the other day titled \"the fayetteville incident\" which took place approximately one hour from my home near fayetteville, nc.  the description of the ufo from that program reminded me of my incident.  in fact, with the exception of the color of the craft, which the gentleman in that program described as orange, i believe we may have seen the same thing.  also, i experienced 2 seperate incidents, the first involving 3 lights witnessed by myself and my sister and a second incident involving 1 light witnessed by myself and my 14 year old nephew.  \r\n\r\nthe first incident occurred sometime near the end of february or first of march 2008.  i have simply forgotten the exact date but i am positive about the time of year because of orion's position in the sky, which i am very familiar with.  i had been to my sister shawn's house for dinner and left between 9 and 9:30 so she and her younger 2 children could get ready for bed.  as i stepped outside the house and closed the door behind me, i immediately began looking for and identifying constellations in the sky.  there were no clouds, no moon and very little light pollution from any other source which made it quite easy.  as i turned north to find polaris, i noticed a very bright light moving towards me from the north/northeast.  having been a flight nurse with an air ambulance company, i am somewhat familiar with various types of aircraft.  i noticed right away there was a white light on the nose of the craft and being very, very bright, i assumed it was flying at a pretty low altitude.  then i became aware that there was no typical triangulated blinking pattern indicating lights under the wings nor was the craft making any noise.  i watched for a second then i stepped back to my sister's house and knocked on the door.  she stepped outside and i pointed and asked her, \"what is that?\"  we watched in silence as the first light turned west and headed away from us.  we could then clearly see the back of the craft.  it looked like a 3 story craft with 2 or possibly 3 white lights on each story.  our attention then turned to a second light approaching from the same direction and traveling at the same speed.  we watched it and i even jokingly said to her, \"what would you do if a third light appeared?\"  she responded, \"run.\"  not a minute later, indeed a third light approached us from the same direction.  all 3 were the same, flying at lower altitudes, composed of 3 stories with white lights and moving slowly without making any noise whatsoever.  we then both became aware of a slight noise coming from behind us and to the south.  we turned in that direction and immediately realized that as the noise became louder, they were obviously military aircraft, 2 jets to be exact.  we live approximately one hour from not only ft. bragg in fayetteville but also approximately one hour from seymour-johnston air force base in goldsboro.  we are both quite familiar with the fighter jets and helicopters as they fly over our homes at times.  we both agreed that more than likely they were f-15 strike eagles from seymour-johnston.  as we turned back in the direction of the lights, we managed to get just a glimpse of them as they simply disappeared.  there were no light trails as if they had accelerated, it was as if someone simply turned off a light switch.  one fighter jet headed directly west in the same direction as the lights while the other continued north before turning east, making a complete circle then eventually heading west as well.  both jets continued west until they disappeared.  shawn was a little unnerved by the incident while i, being the scientist of the two and certainly a believer in et, was excited yet disappointed that i didn't get to ride in a ufo.\r\n\r\nthe second incident occurred either near the end of july or first of august 2008.  i distinctly remember because venus, mars, jupiter and saturn were visible at a little after 8 in the evening.  at various times, i would \"kidnap\" my older nephews, kyle, 14 and shane, 12, and teach them a little about astronomy.  on this prticular evening, kyle was outside walking up and down the path talking on his cell phone.  cell phone reception in middlesex is unfortunately not very clear and being outside usually makes it a little better.  it was approximately 9 pm when my phone rang.  it was kyle calling from the yard.  he said, \"jenny, come look at this light, is it venus?\"  feeling very proud that my astronomy lessons had not been a total waste, i stepped outside and immediately saw what he was referring to.  there was a bright white light situated to the southeast.  althought this light was stationary and obviously a little farther away, the size and shape appeared to be similiar to the lights shawn and i had seen months earlier.  it was harder to tell about the altitude because it wasn't heading towards me nor did it travel over my head.  i immediately recognized that it wasn't venus.  the positioning of the light was totally wrong as venus is always to the west/southwest and although it is the brightest object in the night sky, it isn't that bright.  also, venus had already set.  although jupiter was in fact situated to the southeast, it's was lower than the light and it simply wasn't nearly as bright.  i could also clearly see both jupiter and the light at the same time.  suddenly, the light began to move slowly to the west.  this startled kyle and he ran into the yard where i was.  he said, \"what is that?\"  i had told him and his brother earlier what shawn and i had seen so i said to him, \"well, it looks like what your mom and i saw.\"  from my yard, my mom and dad's house is right in front of me and directly to the south.  the light continued to move very slowly from the southeast until it was right over my mom and dad's house.  it then accelerated at such a rapid rate that in my opinion, no human being could have withstood the g-forces and inertia that would have been involved.  and i'm sure this light accelerated instead of simply disappearing because unlike before, this time there was a light trail.  kyle and i both walked out further into the yard and looked to the west along the tree line but it had simply disappeared.  we then heard the same noise as shawn and i had hear before.  and just like before, 2 military jets screamed out of the south, turned to the west and disappeared.  although this sighting had not lasted as long and i had not seen the light as clearly, it appeared to be the same thing i had seen before.  in my opinion, it indeed was the very same thing.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

my son and i watching for the percied meteor shower looked like a star zig-zagging across the sky. the second was witnessed by my wife and i and was a bright white light/orb brighter than jupiter and venus and was stationary above my house. it started moving away and faded to nothing.... it just blinked out. i estimated that it was as low as a small plane would fly. now let me start with two things that happened before my sighting at 2:30 this morning. there might be no relation to the event and to perfectly honest i hope it does'nt. at aprox. 1:30 am i went downstairs to get a glass of water. when i reached the top of the stairs on my way down i thought i heard a shuffling/knoking  sound coming from downstairs. my wife was asleep upstairs and the kids were at there other parents houses (we're like a modern brady bunch). i heard the noise again as i reached the bottom of the stairs, turned the corner into the kitchen and there was nothing. i then heard something that sounded like it was right outside the window. i looked out  and could see nothing. i did'nt think much off it and dismissed it as maybe a cat outside. i went upstairs and lied down in bed. ever since my first sighting i sleep with my bedroom blinds open at night. as i was lying there i noticed what looked like a red flash reflecting in my across the way neighbors window. i thought that maybe it was someone's brake lights reflecting. i looked down and out and there were no cars on in use. it was very quiet the neighborhood was asleep. i thought, \"that was weird\". i then thought' \"whatever\" and lied back down and fell asleep. i was shortly after jolted out of sleep by who knows what. sort off like when you here a loud noise or someone moves you while sleeping. i than sat up to get a drink of water, looked out the window and noticed what i first thought was a perfectly oval disc shaped cloud. it was not moving at all and was a dull greyish-white. i thought, \"what the hell, thats got to be the most perfectly shaped cloud i've ever seen. i looked at it for at least a full minute and it did'nt move an inch. i could easily gage that because it was right next to the brightest star in that part of the sky at that time. it was right above the across the way neighbors roof tops and if i sat up in the bed further i could see the moon coming up from below and just to the left of this object. the object was not illuminating light but was reflecting the moon light off of it and was kind off standing out of the moon light. it was about the size of my thumb held at arms length. it seemed to be sitting directly over a set of lakes here in town close to my house. they are, spring lake, lake ralphine, and lake ilsanjo in east santa rosa. i did'nt wake my wife up i guess because at first i was'nt sure what i was seeing. after about a minute and a half this thing had not changed position or size until all of the sudden in about five seconds (at most) it shrunk in on itself to what looked like a small star and blinked out to nothing! that's what my last sighting did! in roughly the same part of the sky! wtf! this to me seems like maybe it took off away from me shrinking in to nothing in a very short amount of time. i woke my wife up as it was shrinking/taking off. by the time she looked out it was gone. i was a little freaked out about it as it was so close and clearly a disc! ok what the hell, three sightings and they get closer each time? come on, what the hell? i then started thinking about the noises and the red flash. i told my wife and she started to get creeped out. hopefully these are coincidences. i could'nt sleep the rest of the night and kept looking out the window. an hour or so later i saw a small flash of light in the sky and it looked like it was heading the the east and disappeared. it was much further up. that one could have been anything. still though, quite an active night! i did'nt think i'd ever see an up-close disc!! wow!!

was outside smoking a cigarrette. the star seemed to have a colored strobe on it but it wasn't moving like most aircraft and remained mostly in place except for motions latarally not vertically. i told my wife as i went into the house and got my telescope from the back bedroom. once i aquired the object in the viewfinder it became appareant it wasn't as star or a plane. it was clearly a sphere and it radiated a light of all colors; yellow closest to the sphere and red further out, ending in violet. the light were not just light but seemed to be more colored spikes than a light hue from other stars or the moon. it moved back and forth qiuckly in a short pattern like a right triangle. my wife looked through the telescope and confirmed what i saw. we watched it until it left our field of view around 12 a.M. we talked about it and both decided that what we saw wasn't a plane or helicopter or a star. we agreed on the shape and the colorful spikes, and we agreed it was nothing like we had ever seen before. the next night at around the same time it was in the sky again except it was exactly 180 degrees from the first night, meaning it would have been exactly behind me from the first night. it demonstrated the same behavior until disappearing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

a very clear blue sky above and we were noting how many planes were going by.\r\n\r\nto my left i saw a round white orb shaped object appear and pointed it out to my friends. one of them commented that it was a balloon, but my other friend said it was way to high and looked too big and i agreed with him. it was moving pretty quickly across the sky and then directly above us stopped dead in its tracks. we all commented if it was a baloon it would not do this. after a brief stop for around 4 seconds, it then continued off to the right across the sky at speed again. i grabbed my phone camera and pointed it skywards. as i hit the camera button, the object simply dissapeared. we all commented how weird it was, there was just no sign of it in the sky anymore and we were all watching it and all saw this thing just dissapear so i couldn't get a picture.\r\n\r\nwhat makes this even stranger is a few minutes before i saw a similar object going from north to south above me. now this was going very quick and i only saw it for a couple of seconds before it dissapeared to my left behind the house. i ran and looked into the direction it was travelling and couldn't see anything. one of my friends asked, what the matter was and i explained i just saw a white orb shape object travelling pretty fast from north to south.\r\n\r\nso basically a similar object viewed within minutes apart from each other, one traveling quickly north to south, the other west to east. if these were balloons, you wouldnt think they would be going in different directions so quickly and especially strange that one of them just stopped dead.

as we both walked towards the car from the front door of the house, my father had mentioned that the evening's moonlight was unusually bright and it was helping to put the planets mars and venus into plain view and so we all looked upward to see what he was talking about when suddenly my father noticed something else and said \"hey, what is that?\" and he directed both myself and my brother-in-law to look in the direction where he was pointing to - and we all saw two small star like lights moving at a significant rate of speed towards each other directly overhead but slightly to the southwest of us; if these lights had not been moving, then i would say that they would have easily been mistaken for stars, but all the other stars in the night sky were stationary like they usually are, but these two lights were definitely the only two lights that we could see that were moving, and they both appeared to be close enough in the upper atmosphere to be visible, but yet once again i will say that they easily could have looked like ordinary stars if they weren't moving; they were both star-like in appearance but also had a dark reddish glow in the center of them and they seemed to \"sparkle\" just a tiny little bit; one was headed in a northern direction and the other was moving in a southern direction and they were both headed for each other at a pretty good rate of speed in which first appeared to be like they were going to have a head-on collision, but then suddenly the one light that was traveling south abruptly stopped dead in it's path of travel and then the light traveling north stopped abruptlty in front of the other light that just stopped - then the light that was just traveling northward immediately reversed it's direction and began traveling south - it didn't turn around, it didn't spin, it just started moving in the opposite direction that it was just traveling in - so i tracked it with my own eyes for a good several minutes as it continued to travel in a southern direction until it was no longer visible and vanished into the city skyline about where all the street lights begin; the other object that had stopped abruptly was no longer reddish in color and had blended into the night sky along with all of the other stars so we could not identify which light it was. i was so intrigued by this event that it made the hairs stand straight up all over my body and my heart was pounding and i was trying hard to stay focused and let my brain try to comprehend exactly what i was looking at. i didn't take my eyes off it for a even a brief second and i kept shouting to my father and brother-in-law \"do you guys see this too?\" and they were both in shock and awe at what we all were just witness to at that very moment. we are still not sure what it was that we all saw; we have ruled out that it was a satellite or possible piece of space junk re-entering earth orbit because that does not explain the strange movement and behavior of these objects. my father is also a veteran of the air force and even he is not aware of any man-made craft that can move like these objects did. my personal opinion is that whatever the object was that abruptly stopped and reversed it's direction had to be under some sort of intelligent control in order to do that kind of movement. even from watching video footage on tv of the space shuttle and various other man-made space vehicles in flight, i have never seen something move like these lights did in the sky over us that night. this is not the first time that i have personally seen strange things in the sky, but it is definitely the first time that i have felt compelled to come forward and report it without fear of ridicule, especially since it was witnessed by two other people in my family other than myself, and i would be very interested to know if anyone else in our local area also witnessed the same event at the same time on the same evening.
