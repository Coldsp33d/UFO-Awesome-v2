everything.It was me,in the back of the car,my friend,in the front,and her mom drivin..We was bout 12 at the time and although this was 10 years ago,i can remember almost everything from 15 years ago or further,no exageration...Anywayz,we drivin and we come to the top of the dyke...And all of a sudden my friend said \"oh my god,what the f*** is that?!!!\"..And we looked to the left and saw 5 huge balls of lights..So her mom looked and slammed on the breaks.They didnt move at all..They where just sittin there in one spot..They sat in a zig zag position..Id have to say these things were about 2 or more miles away from us.I was in shock at first but nothing shocks me too much so i jus felt like,this is pretty cool..Very interesting.They never moved and these lights were white and unbeleivebly bright...If you could take a star and blow it up in size about 10times,thats what they looked like..So after a couple of minutes she dropped me off at my house,which was only 3 houses away from that dyke.Grabbed my mom and ran her over there and they were still there.For whatever reason i also had brought out the house fone,i guess to make a call and when i turned it on it was staticy..Ive done this before but it was never staticy before.Anywayz.She believed what she saw kuz this was her 3rd time seein a ufo..They had absolutely no noise whatsoever..You couldnt here anything!..Then in a blink of an eye they were gone.When they left i started to feel a lil warm..Not from being excited because this was before the real excitement arose and i didnt understand why i felt like that.Now we know what airplanes look like.I live on the shore,so theres an airport across the water,i live 45minutes away from the newark airport,and theres another one not too far..I see and hear them all the time..Theres helicopters i see all the time..And i know what military crafts look like bekuz alot of my family was or is still in the military and i was going to sign up myself..What i saw resembled absolutely none of those crafts...Helicopters are really the only ones that jus hover in one spot but they dont have lights that bright and they are pretty loud..I deffinately know what i saw and i must say that was pretty impressionable,it left a very vivid memory.","distance":"Over One

go into the house. the light was strobing on and off, it appeared to be stationary, i stood and watched it for the duration it was in the sky trying to rule out things it could be. the strobing was a faster pace than typical airplanes and it appeared to be one single bright white light, while planes strobe white, red and blue lights. after 2 or 3 minutes the light blinked off and stayed off, there didn't appear to be clouds that it went behind, but it was a little hazy in that direction, i watched to see if it would reappear but it didn't. i also stayed and observed planes fly through that part of the sky, their lights appeared normal, so i don't think it was atmospheric distortion of a normal plane's lights. i checked the satellite tracker on spaceweather.Com but there were not satellite flybys during the window of my sighting. i can also rule out a planet or a star shimmering with atmospheric distortion because this light blinked completely on and off with each pulse, it was not a shimmer. so it could have been a balloon with a bright light on it, a plane flying west away from me with unusual lighting or something else. i'm really not sure so i thought i might as well report it

the emergemcy room at lourdes- rancocas hospital.  the emergency parking lot was full, so we parked across the road in the north building lot, facing south.  the sky was unusally dark, with only the moon visible to the rear of my left shoulder and two stars to my right. this may have been due to all the light in the area.\r\nwhile sitting there in the car, i noticed a light that i at first thought to be an airplane, being close to both philadelphia (15 miles west) and the macguire afb/fort dix complex (20 minutes to the east). there were no other aircraft visible until after the light disappeared.\r\nthe light appeared to be a long way off in the distance and was visible slightly above a guy-wire on an electrical pole on the opposite side of the street. there were no contrails and due to distance and being in the car, we were unable to determine if there was any sound. i called my wife's attention to it after a while as it had not disappered in a few minutes.  we could not determine the size or shape, but it seemed to give off a sparkle or twinkle every now and then almost like an aircraft. this continued, in a due south direction until 12:39 am march 6, when it finally disappeared into the lights on the side of the building and behind the building itself.\r\ni figured it to be a satellite or the international space station, very large, to be visible for such an extended period of time and distance. it looked like no aircraft that i had experienced in the us air force or naval reserves. it also did not resemble the five disc-shaped ufos that i saw with my brother-in-law in montclair, nj in september 1959. they went from horizon to horizon is approximately 15 seconds, in a jerky, start- hover fashion.  they were in echelon formation and the left inside wing craft was oscillating, as though it was having control problems.\r\ni decided to report this just in case someone else saw the same thing early this

for most of the flight. at about 6:00am we were flying over a big city probably milwaukee when i noticed glowing lights at a distance several miles ahead of us.  i was suddenly amazed because the lights seemed brighter and bigger the all of the city light combined.  it was the brightest light i had seen from a plane window i love sitting in a window seat and looking out. what puzzled me was that the lights looked like they were under water.  i had the feeling that we were flying over water so i looked down to make sure. there were few clouds and i could see the rapples on the surface of the water, because the moon was full. i kept looking at the light as the plane got closer. i started getting apprehansive as the plane approached it. it didn't seem man-made. when we finally got over it i was terrified and could look no more because i thought it was going to capture the plane. there was a gentleman sitting in the window seat in front of me. i am sure he saw it too. i think he was affaid too because he turn away too. i wanted to ask him about it but my connecting flight was leaving in a short time and i was travelling two others so i didn't have the time to find him in the airport. \r\nnow i going to try to give a detail discripting of the lights. i noticed three lights close together under the surface of the water. the biggest one looked like a giant light bulb. it was several miles in diameter. it was yellowish. the one beside it was a little more the half the size and it was reddish. it was also huge several miles in diameter too. the third one was smaller and greenish. i will assume that it was less the 2 miles in diameter. they were all brighter then any light i have ever seen except the sun. i do not believe they were from this world. \r\nthere was another light at a distance the size of a city it was greenish but we didn't flying near it. unless you guys tell me that there are several giagantic under water projects going on in lake michigan i

face the northwest and happened to notice lights above and to my north position moving east to west. they had already passed overhead when i saw them. there were 3 lights in a triangular pattern with 2 more lights  to the right of the first three. the two individual lights were spaced at equal distances from the group of three. my first thought was an aircraft but there were no red and green recognition lights. then i noticed that the middle light started moving closer to the farthest light and came to almost appear that it was one light. then it moved back toward the middle position where it was when i first saw it. the lights then appeared to turn to the northwest and at that time i was unable to see it because of tree branches and homes. after i lost sight of these lights, i scanned the sky for any other lights, aircraft, satellites, etc., but did not see anything other than the familiar stars. \r\nthe pattern of the three lights was very small and i was unable to see if it was one unit or three seperate lights. i was trying to use background stars as a base of this observation and see if i could see any lights through the center of the three, but was unable to verify. the intensity of the brightness was that of slightly brighter than a satellite passing over, but had greater speed and then gave the appearance to turn. i did not notice any sound from the sighting and there were no other aircraft in the vicinity at the time of this observation. \r\ni was in awe when i first saw this as i have almost always been able to identify objects in the sky both day and night. i have been a licensed pilot for 36 years and i am constantly watching aircraft, both civilian and military, as well as satellites which pass overhead in the evening. i was very intrigued to finally see something that i was unable to identify. \r\nwould you be kind enough to let me know if anyone else spotted this pattern on the night indicated? i am very curious to know if i

was 19 years old back in 1969, hanging out with 3 of my friends when some other friends invited us to go to a party out in the country about a mile or so out side of sedalia, mo to a regular party spot.\r\nit was about 7pm or so when my friends and i were heading out to the party. we were about a half mile or so outside of town driving down a country road when i noticed, out the back drivers side window, what looked like a darkish silvery object. from my view point, the object was on the other side of a row of big trees and seemed to be just about at tree top level. it seemed to be about a quarter mile or so away(although i cant really be sure how far it actually was). \r\ni shouted to the other people in the car to take a look at this thing. the driver stopped the car and we all got out to get a better look. one of the strange things was the lack of any noise from the object. i could hear the light breeze blowing through the trees, the barking of a dog somewhere off in the distance, but nothing from the object that i could detect.\r\nthe triangle looking object was slightly turned at first, which showed me that the shape seemed to be triangle. it was moving in the direction we had been coming from, and kind of seemed to be just floating along (not moving real fast, but not dead still either.\r\nwe all stood there with our jaws hanging on the ground, so to speak, wondering what in the world we was witnessing, when all of a sudden the object turned away from us and broke into 3 different smaller triangles and then they shot away up into the sky. the 3 objects was gone out of sight in a matter of seconds. i did not see any blasts of flames like you would expect from a jet engine or something like that. i mean there was absolutely no noise that came from the 3 objects that i, or the other people with me could detect.\r\nwe all got back into the car, very excited needless to say, and headed on toward where the party was going to be. when we arrived at the location, the people there had built a campfire and about 12 or so people was standing around it, looking and pointing toward the direction that i had seen the objects.\r\ni approached the other people with the intent of asking them if they had seen anything, but before i had the chance to ask, people started asking the 4 of us if we had seen anything on the way to the party.\r\nit seems that from the vantage point of the party location, that the people there had a pretty good view of this thing also. they had seen the single triangle break into the 3 different triangles and shoot up into the night sky as we had seen.\r\nof course that was about all everyone there talked about most of the evening. \r\nduring the next couple of days, i talked to a few different people in sedalia that had seen something that night also, although from talking to them, it seemed like they did not have near as good of a view as we did out on that country road.\r\ni have seen shooting stars, planets in the night sky and some weird stuff, but never anything like that night back in 1969.\r\nthank you for giving me a place to tell my little bit of ufo history.","distance":"501 Feet -

woods in that direction and no airport or towers. as i watched it appeared to be moving up very slowly. it looked as if it were getting larger in size but i then realized it was getting closer. it started to flicker a bright orange color as if on fire. i thought it my be a plane about to crash into my house! i was frozen and continued to watch. it moved to slow to be a crashing aircraft. it stopped flickering and was just a solid orb like ball of light. it almost resembled a spot light from a helicopter being shine directly at you only there was no ambient light coming from it. it was as if iluminated from the inside. it proceeded toward my house only about 200 ft. in the air. i was extremely puzzled. i thought that it must be a helicopter. there were no navigation lights or strobes to identify it as an aircraft. so i opened the window expecting to hear the sound of the rotors but heard nothing but absolute silence. i watched as it went over the roof asfter i lost sight i ran to the other side of the house and watched it from there. it was still moving slowly and then it accelerated extremely fast into the distance where it was no longer visible. i chalked it up to its 2am and tired and went to bed. a few days later at about 8am during dinner i saw it again. i told my brother and mother about the previous event and they just kinda laughed. i pointed out the window and said look! they saw it as well. he said it looked like it was on fire. it stayed just above the tree line for about an hour before just disappearing. it re occured a few more times since then. i looked up if there was anything else like this happening and saw videos on the lights in arizona and decided i should atleast report this so people know to keep an eye out. i have recently purchased a

witnessed an event that i never saw before until that night. it was early evening and beginning to get dark and the sky was clear except for a few scattered clouds. suddenly i noticed a very bright light in the sky almost directly overhead and moving at the speed a satellite would appear to be going. i thought maybe it was the iss or maybe a shuttle mission passing over the area. i looked for signs of an high altitude aircraft but saw no nav. lights or strobes and there was the absence of any jet sounds. then to my amazement a second light, about half as bright as the first, appeared behind the first object on the exact flight path. both objects exhibited typical ballistic trajectories except the second object was going faster than the first and closing at such a rate that i believed i was about to witness a collision or maybe some sort of killer satellite bearing down on a target. there was still no aircraft sounds or lights from the second object. to my amazement the second light suddenly moved to the left (they were going away from me)and caught up with the first object and seemed to pace it as they both went behind a cloud and disappeared over the horizon growing ever dimmer. i have witnessed many orbiting satellites since 1957 but they never did anything like what i saw on that september night. the entire event lasted about 10 seconds. it wasn't an irridium flair or a meteor. the second object had to have been under intelligent control to have made a manouver like that at what seemed like a last second change in course. i'm not claiming it was aliens i'm just saying it was real strange to see that type of manouvering going on that high up at what seemed to be orbital height.

or filmed a similar object.  my experience dates back to 1967 so its been a while.\r\n\r\none warm summer night around 10pm, with a clear sky and unlimited visability in lakewood washington, located approximately 3-4 miles nw of mcchord usaf base near tacoma i witnessed a very strange object close-up that also caused some physical reactions to myself and the surrounding yard where i was playing.\r\n\r\ni had planned to go bass fishing with my grandfather the next day and was practicing my casting in the back yard with my pool and a rubber weight.  the air had been extremely still, typical of summer nights in the region.  occassionally, depending on air traffic and winds, we were very close to the flight patterns for approach to mcchord air base and i always loved watching the c5's, b52's, phantoms and helicopters passing over the house at 1500-2000 feet on final.  normally they wouldn't pass over us at night because of sound constraints for the civilians but now and then they would.  i was very familar with all types of aircraft coming and going over the years both in daylight and night conditions. the sound of a c5 or b52 with full flaps on final at 1500ft can't be mistaken.\r\n\r\nthis event/sound was different.  as i stood in the back yard i heard a low multi-pitched hum i hadn't heard before.  knowing the flight line i looked to the northwest and waited for watever it was to come into view.  the property was fairly surrounded by fir trees of about 75 to 100' around the perimeter so i didn't have a line of sight to the horizon.  as the pitch grew closer & louder the surrounding trees started to sway but there was no wind.  then a triangular object appeared over the tree tops moving to the southeast toward mcchord usaf very slowly.\r\n\r\nthe object was at about 100-125 directly above me and barely cleared the trees.  it was triangular in shape with a large perhaps 25'diameter sphere in each corner which looked like glass glowing red to orange to yellow in a marble swirl patern.  the sound was very low frequency, perhaps less than 100hz with another at perhaps 500hz.  as it moved to the southeast it rotated clockwise slowly and made only a little over one rotation while in my sight for nearly 1.5 minutes in which time i'd guess it went 4-5 city blocks.  it took that long for it to move over the house and out of sight over the trees.\r\n\r\nthe superstructure between the spheres was a semi-dull metalic open framework with diagonal braces between two main stringers similar to a large metal structural building truss.  there was no platform of structure inside the perimeter of the framework and i could see thru the entire structure with the exception of the spheres in the corners.  it was nearly silent as it moved and the huming was at a level close to a moderate speaking level volume.\r\n\r\nas it flew over the trees moved violently without wind, my hair stood on end and i became light headed and a little sick to my stomack like motion sickness.  i also got a static shock from my fishing pole and i dropped it in the grass. once the object passed everthing went back to normal.\r\n\r\nthe object i estimated had three equal sides approximately 250-300' long or more. it just cleared the tree tops to the nw so i had a perfectly clear look at it.  the brightness of the spheres illuminated the super structure.  i asked my grandfather if he knew of anything like that and he felt initally that it was some sort of structure being carried by a large helicopter.  a hellicopter that large wouldn't have made a sound like that and i would have know it instantly.  anyone from the nam who has heard a huey comig for miles knows the sound and it was pretty large to by hung from a bell of a chopper.  this sound was an electronic hum and was nothing like an aircraft.  i never saw it again but its bothered me my entire life.  i just like things explained and with some level of credability and understanding.  it was a and remains a mistery to me but perhaps someone has a solution or explaination.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

chair, which turned and looked straight at him, when he came in. xylon ran trough the kitchen, and then noticed another being on the other side of the kitchen island, he was grey, had a bulbous head, wrinkled skin, and had 3-4 fingers on each hand, and was running one hand across the tile countertop. he got so frightened, he tried to run downstairs to reach our bed. when he reached the stairwell, he ran into our daughter (10 years old), who was also trying to escape two beings who were in her bedroom. she had a different story. she had some sort of controlled dream state, where she and her grandma were shopping in a mall, and were on an escalator. everyone stopped moving, except she and grandma-- then, they saw beings from another world, walking around in there.  she woke up, and then, saw the real beings (who were grey, and almost no nose, a slit for the mouth). one was about seven inches taller than the one in front, next to her bed. she tried to scream, but, was so frightened, no sound came out. they continued to \"study\" her, and finally, the one closest to her, reached his hand out, and slapped her, i assume, to get her to talk/ scream.  she finally did manage to let out a scream, threw the covers off her bed, fell forward, off the edge toward the beings, and under their legs, and ran down the hallway, turned the corner, and ran down the stairwell, where she encountered her very frightened brother, racing down the stairs to our bedroom.  suddenly, after trying in vain to wake my husband up, here came my children, racing down the stairwell, turned the corner, and ran through the doorway, into our bedroom, screaming at the top of their lungs: \"mommie!  mommie!, there are monsters in our house!\"  my first duty was to try to calm them down.  they tried talking over each other, to tell each of their stories.  finally, they managed to get the whole thing out. i was so frightened, i was really afraid to go upstairs, and i did not want to leave their sides, since i was the only one wide awake!  the next day, my son tried to explain what happened to his father, who kept not believing his son... finally, my son remembered the big noise of the trash cans crunching, when their small extremely well lit ship ran into them, as it hovered, careening down the narrow street with lots of parked cars to avoid.  he went outside, down the 45 degree short drive-way, and found the metal cans, which had been taken out to the street level for pick-up, at the bottom of the drive way, and they looked like something had folded them in half, as if there was a knife crease horizontally, in the middle of the two of them.  something had to hit them mid-level, and very hard, to make a metal, corrugated can to fold practically in half.  i then told him about the strange light pouring into our bedroom as if something without a motor, was hovering over our house-- and how i tried in vain, to wake him up, by shouting and shaking him.  my son never slept in his room upstairs, or any bedroom --except mine, until we moved, and until he was fourteen years old, he was suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome, as i was. the fact that one of them slapped my daughter across the face, really made her feel frightened, and violated in a way she cannot deal with, even today. i am not sure if we were abducted, or if they were just in our home, observing us.... i still do not sleep well, and have a stress-related disease.  it is almost like i have to stay awake, to guard my home, and myself.  i keep big dogs in my room, now, out of fear this may happen again. my son was traumatized for years, afterward. my husband never did wake up that night.  our kids were afraid to sleep in their own upstairs rooms, and never felt safe in that house.  finally, we moved.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

he suggested that we cross check my experience with other reports on your site.  i was sceptical that we would find anything at all, so imagine my surprise when i found a report that eerily matched and corroborated mine.  the report that i'm referring to is listed as having occured on may 10th 2007.  to be honest, i can't say that i remember the exact date but i know that it was in may because a relative's birthday had just passed.  i had for a while passively inquired as to whether or not anyone in the neighborhood had seen anything which they apparently had not, and was in fact at the very time of the incident attempting to call the friend whose apartment i had just left.  this event took place possibly as late as 2:00 a.M. (the exact time i can't recall) on the north end of the city of columbus as i was returning home.  the object i saw was (and i emphasize) very low to the ground and moving slowly, such that i was able to follow near behind it for nearly two miles.  i had just begun to travel northbound on whitesville rd., on which i lived, when crossing a highway bridge i spotted it over the trees.  it almost seemed to be trying to fly parallel to the road on my left-hand side.  i slowed down and drove cautiously never taking my eye off the thing.  i was alone on the road which had no outlets that would take me anywhere other that directly beneath it.  i approached my house which was also on my left-hand side and watched astonished as the object flew directly over it and seemed then to align itself directly over the road.  i stopped the car directly in front of my house and stared up after it as it moved along down the street.  with it then in plain sight i could see the shape against the contrast of the stars.  it was a large triangle with dim orange lights in each corner.  i remember chuckling in fact because i'd recalled years prior watching a t.V. show wherein a man, in europe i believe, described the exact same thing.  i let off the brake and slowly followed the object northward for a little while before it broke away from the road and headed west back behind the trees.  i lost sight of it, turned around, and went home where i sat in the driveway a while before getting out and staring another while in the direction it had gone.  on a side note, columbus has a small airport and residents of the city are very accustomed to seeing run-of-the-mill aircraft, everything from commercial airliners to jets and helicopters, and none of these could have been mistaken for this.  from the moment i saw it i knew it couldn't be anything comparable.  in addition to being slow moving ( i followed it at around 30 mph.) it wasn't likely more than 300 feet off the ground.  i say this given that i watched as it flew over my house which coupled with the massive pecan tree in the front yard gave me a familiar perspective on height.

was starting to go down.\r\n\r\nas my wife and i also looked we saw 8 to 10 bright lights, low in the sky and far off just above the beach homes south of us in the direction of the town of buxton.  the lights were bright white and twinkled a bit. the lights were not in any sort of formation but were scattered,made no noise and stayed in place the whole time.Another person driving a car pulled into his driveway and as he got out of his car  said \"looks like the air force is messing with us again!\" laghing the whole time. we had been watching the lights for several minutes by now. we kept watching for several more minutes until very slowly the lights started fading out one by one untill all were gone.\r\n\r\ni have been going to the outer banks for over 20 years. there are many air bases in the area va beach air station,norfolk navel base to name two. i have watched all sorts of fighter air craft fly over the area in my time. some just flying up the beach others dog fighting each other while spitting out decoy flares with each turn.\r\n\r\ni am a police officer with fifteen years of obsrvation experience. again there was no noise with these lights. they stayed lit way

four or even five lights by the time i got home. these lights would fly fishlike at times. real squiggly. they would come from any direction. sometimes they flew up, down or around and would go from horizon to another edge of the horizon. sometimes they would fly to this one triangular point and disappear.  one time was very dramatic. there were clouds and there were clear patches. where it was clear, you could see the stars. when these star looking lights would start to move, they flew into and out of the clouds. there were three or four and on this occasion they flew into a cloud and there was a huge light explosion. no sound, just tremendous flashing inside the cloud. they never came back out that night.\r\nbut, they were back the next night. this had gone on for several summers and i always checked the paper to see if any one ever saw them besides me.\r\ni tried to call the airport to the atc tower but couldn't get anyone to answer. \r\non a sunday night in sept.(2,9,16,23,30) 2007 or 2008, i took my dog to the donelson playground on the corner of m-59 and coleman. they tore the school down and it's just a huge field. as i walked daisy towards cvs drugstore i kept looking up. this time i saw 2 lights come from the ne and 2- come from the n and three come from the nw and several more come from the se and two or three come from the w. they converged over my head, still high up, and put on a mobility show is all i can think to call it. it was really something to watch. they'd fly into each other and then split up. then fly outwards, to the circular area of the night sky you can see, going in all directions at once. then back they'd come into a very small area above me again. i have always wondered how many others saw that. it just isn't possible that i was the only one.\r\nlater on that fall, again on a sunday i saw one light flying fast first n to s then right back the same path it had just come only it hung a left (w) so quick and then i saw why. two military jets were chasing it. this was about 9:30-10:00 pm on  a sunday night.  well, after that incident i didn't see them all that often. i do know the difference between satelites and airplanes or those huge spotlights they use to bring attention to store openings or a carnival.\r\ni had others come and see these lights. it was no big deal to locate them on any given night.\r\ni never knew how to look into it until today whike watching channel 25(discovery channel). it was a program that mufon had looked into about a guy named bledsoe.\r\nanyway, i tried mufon.Com and up you popped.\r\nit has been so long since these events transpired that i might have the weekday mixed up about the light show over the playground. but, the two jets chasing the one light was on a sunday late in the summer/fall. it was sept or early oct.\r\ni didn't go out during the winter to walk the dog but i did go out to look for the lights. funny, it's like they don't like the winter all that much either. very scarce on the light sightings. maybe two or three in a ten day period. i was so used to them it just wasn't a big deal any more.\r\nother people i showed them to saw them and knew they were under someone's or somethings control. they just didn't fly in a straight line of any sort. i showed at least four or five people who all saw them.\r\nactually, i don't need confirmation (i know what i saw) just want to talk with others who saw them, too.\r\nthis last summer i was hard pressed to see even three or four all season.\r\nthey sure were fun, tho. so, if you know of anyone who would like to talk about them or if you know anything further about them, i sure would be interested!\r\nthanks,\r\njuanita rutledge","distance":"Over One

fell prostrate  was turned onto my belly by unseen forces.  i had an overwhelming feeling of warmth and friendliess, as though my best friend in the whole world was with me.  its hard to explain, like the feeling was imposed on me without my knowledge or control over it.  my head was turned to the side, so that my face was directed towards a wall.  i noticed something moving in my feild of vision.  i was unable to move, exept to slightly turn my head as though it were very heavy and hard to move.  so i moved my head to see what was moving in the corner of the room.  because of the influence of the drugged feeling, i had no fear at that time and felt a feeling of welcoming a good freind, again as though it was a feeling imposed on me, not seeming to originate from my own mind.  hard to explain.  then i saw the crease of the corner between the two walls open, like the walls became soft and kind of bent to allow the corner crease between the walls to spread open and stretch open, like an orifice or opening.  it was a cynder block wall.  it became fluid or soft and moved apart, and beyond was blackness.  then i seen the figure of a humanoid being, inside of the blackness, it slowly floated or was riding on some kind of support from behind, not sure.  it was similar to the classic image  of how alien beings are portrayed by the media, exept that where the nose and mouth should be, there was perhaps a nose and mouth, but were not very recognizable and had folds and wrinkles that made it hard to make out the features plainly.  it had great large slanted but not squinted solid black eyes, a large bald head and was wearing some kind of dark colored cloak or clothing.  i could not see its legs or feet as though it was floating or riding on some  sort of linkage or support of some kind.  it also had long spidery thin fingers, and on its fingers were shiny metal conplicated looking devices and some of them had needles on the end.  it came out of the black opening in the corner slowly and proceeded to advance towards me until it was over me and i was no longer able to see it as my head was laying down and seemed to heavy to lift.  at this point i was starting to wonder why i was so glad to see this being, and suddenly realized that i should not feel this way.  then a wave of fear came over me and i was unable to move or fight or flee or even to look and see what was going on.  the next thing i felt was a needle, which i assumed was one of the instruments the being had attached to its fingertips.  i felt the prick of the needle at different points along the side of my spine.  each time it entered my back i felt what i thought was an electrical stimulation in my back along the spine, and whatever corresponding limb was near each puncture site, that limb, arm or leg would spasm and move when the electrical impulse would fire into my spine, as though the nerves going from my spine to my limbs were being stimulated electrically.  at this point i was unable to move my head at all, and did not see the being leave, but eventually, i was able to move, and i got up and went to the corner and the wall was same as ever, intact, hard, seemingly undisturbed.  i had no idea what this being was, or its intention.
