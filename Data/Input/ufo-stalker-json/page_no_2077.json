can not pinpoint the year or month only that it was about 4 years ago and it was late at night.  an odd light caught my eye in the distance over a road about 5 miles away as a bird flys that i later needed to travel.  i turned down the road and the light was more distant but still to the east. it never looked like a plane in the way it moved and it was odd enough that i kept watching for it.   it was almost if it shifted around rather than fly at normal speeds.\r\n\r\nthen it was no longer in the distant east, it was directly ahead of me due south.  i slowed down at the t intersection and looked up at it.  it was stopped directly over me / slightly ahead of me but only 100 feet off the ground....It was not moving / stopped still and it was not a commercial plane/jet.\r\n\r\nit did have a lot of bright lights on it.  it may have been round or angular it all happened very fast and i did not really stare at it except to see the bright lights had stopped above me. self preservation instincts took over and i rounded the corner and stepped on gas to get away from it.  i thought maybe it was some new military craft and i was afraid that they may use me as target practice.  it made no noise.  since then i have talked to ex military people and no one knows of any craft that can do that.  there are a few houses around the area.  \r\n\r\nit is definitely unidentied flying object.  i was probably the #1 sceptic in the world but now i know first hand they exist. i know planes and jets and never before or since have ever seen anything like this anywhere. \r\nno planes fly to the airports in that direction ever.  they never would fly that low and they certainly would not stop above me and i have no explanation on how it was far east and then suddenly in front of me. it was not an illusion it literally stopped above my vehicle.\r\n\r\nthis is the first i ever reported it and i know it does not help you much except i know they exist.  for years i explained it to myself as an experimental military craft and part of me still believes this.  i dont know what it was and i do not want my name mentioned anywhere ever.\r\n\r\nuntil this day i truly regret not stopping to see it better but at the same time i remember how frightening it was and i just wanted to get away from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22149,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.321664,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03052010-0014","longitude":-90.496556,"occurred":1141624800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1267833511000,"summary":"First

they were first assigned to walker that there had never been any mention or scuttlebutt about the \"roswell\" incident from the 40s.  one night he came home from work(they lived in base housing)and she said he was very frightened and white as a sheet.  he said that there had been an incident on the flight line and that afterwards he had been told that everything about it was classified and if he spoke about it he would be prosecuted. \r\n\r\nhe told her that a disc shaped object had landed on the flight line and that they had surrounded it...At a distance...And it sat there for approximately 2 hours.  she said that all of security, dcm, base commander etc responded to the incident.  they photographed it non-stop. there was no interaction between anyone and the craft and after about 2 hours on the ground it simply lifted off and flew off as quickly as it had arrived.\r\n\r\nlater she said they had another incident with the same craft but this time there was some limited interaction between the it and one of the aps vehicles.  she said that this time as my dad told her it did not set down but hovered over the base for a period of time and for a little while seemed to follow one of the aps vehicles. \r\n\r\nmy dad left the af after 54 and never talked about this to anyone that i'm aware of....He passed away about 15 years ago.  i overheard my mom talking to someone about this when i was younger but never discussed it with her until later in life.  a little over a year ago my mom passed away after battling cancer.  prior to her death we setup a video camera to record my mom as she talked about different things....On one of these days i asked her about the walker incident and she retold the account again basically as i had overheard it years ago.\r\n\r\nas there were a lot of people that supposedly were aware of these incidents i've always been surprised that no one has ever come forward about

these objects may have been unmanned military craft.  but the one i seen on cherry valley road was definately not any craft known to the public and did not fit any discription of any top secret craft

up at the night sky anyways, but on this particular night i heard a helicopter approaching from my right of me, thinking nothing much of it i get out of the car and pan my head over in the direction of the helicopter. when i did this, i saw a very large object slowly approach over head and it looked to me like it was being escorted by a helicopter. the helicopter was flying directly adjacent to this very large triangular object, i'd say it was about 2-3 football fields in diameter. i saw the 3 bright lights making out the triangular shape, and noticed a very slow pulsing red light in the bottom of the object.\r\n\r\nstunned at what i was seeing i froze to look at the object in the middle of the street. it was about 6-700 feet above me flying fairly low and extremely slow for an aircraft that large. the curious thing about it, was that it made absolutely no noise. all i heard the whole time was the sound of the helicopter and nothing else. when the object went straight over my head, i felt a very eerie feeling like i was being watched at that very moment. after it went over head and beyond the horizon, it looked like it was heading toward (the direction) of march air force base into the san timoteo canyon. the total event only lasted a few minutes, and i thought it was very interesting that it looked like the helicopter was escorting it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

lights were gone, but we saw and heard 10-15 jets flying much higher in the area above their house.  funny thing though, i heard no noise coming from the ufos.  the only thing i felt was excitement, i was wearing extremely high heels and am 5 months pregnant, otherwise i would have ran toward the lights, becausse they appeared that close.  about 20 feet behind my parent's house in the pasture just

was on february 23rd at about 8:07 pm. i was walking to my car, having just left my friend's house, and as i got about five feet from my vehicle i looked up. my eyes instantly went to the brightest light in the sky, which was a plane with two white lights and a blinking red and white beacon light. as i realize what i'm seeing i notice that behind the plane is what looks like a dim star moving at the same speed about three inches behind the plane. as i start to focus on the dim light, it brightens itself and then deviates from it's path trailing behind the plane, and drops at a faster rate towards the ground. as it falls about four inches from where it was, it gets dimmer, then ( as if drawing a u in the sky ) gets brighter and starts heading back up and to the right. my friend's girlfriend pulled into the driveway and as her headlights hit me, i took my attention off of this amazing light to get out of the way and when i looked back up, it was gone.\r\n  then on march 3rd at 12:37 pm i'm driving to work. as i pull up to the light on 75th street and wherli rd. to make a left on 75th, i notice directly ahead at my 12 o'clock position, i notice what looks like a star in the middle of the day. that day there wasn't a cloud in the sky and in the middle of all the blue was a bright ball of light that had a dark spot underneath it. it was a shiny object that was reflecting the sun and the dark spot underneath the shine was the bottom of this object that wasn't being hit by the sun. as i watch this shiny craft, it moves slowly to the right and them right before my eyes, it slowly cloaks itself, losing it's shine but still has it's shape. it was the most extraordinary thing to see. this object was able to mask itself to the point where i eventually lost it after about 5 seconds once it made itself invisible. i don't know if it went out of our atmosphere and that's why it slowly lost it's color and mass, or whether it cloaked itself, but right before i lost it in the blue, i could still see it's shape but it's reflective surface was gone. just like if you took a crystal ball and hung it in the sky, where you can see through it but still can see it's three dimensionality.\r\n  last but not least, the very next day i'm on my way home from work at 7:36 pm and just as i turn onto 75th street to go up to wherli rd., i see another bright moving star. this time i pulled over and got out of my car to verify what i'm seeing, and to try and use my phone to take video of it. this moving star slowly moved above me and after about two minutes of watching this bright light with no beacon lights, or any other lights for that matter, it got dimmer, and dimmer, and then disappeared right above me. i was absolutely astonished. three sightings in weeks of each other. i don't know why i'm seeing so many sightings so close to each other, but i'm sure of what i saw. i wanted to see if your investigators can keep an eye out here because this is amazing and someone should be watching the sky up here, cause something's visiting here and it needs to be put on video and documented. \r\n   thank yo for your time. by the way, what camera can i buy that will be able to capture the night sky if i want to take video of what i'm seeing?\r\n

clear w/ some light clouds w/lots stars apparent.  the street we live on is very dark & i commented to my husband that the lights, that illuminate the steps to our house (our house is on a very small hill) were out due to a recent power outage, which would make climbing those stairs slow going.  as we started up the stairs to our home, there appeared a beam of light that came from nowhere. i quickly turned to look behind to see if someone had just shined a flashlight at us, but no one was there.  i turned back to my husband, who was 2 steps ahead of me, and noted there was no shadow that would be there if the light had come from behind me.  immediately he looked up, thru the trees but did not have a clear view of the sky, so he did not see the source either. the light lasted about 4-5 seconds then just went out. interestingly, i perceived a white light, he perceived a bluish light.  it illuminated about 15 feet of stairs & part of the driveway. the really strange part is the stairs are borders by thick, fairly high bushes & thick and very tall redwoods, which is why he could not get a clear look at the sky from the stairs. i don't know how a clean beam of light could have gotten thru the bushes and the trees, but it did without casting any type of shadow. the light was bright & offered alot more light & covered alot more area then the decorative malibu type lights that usually are on.  as soon as i made it to the top of the stairs i scanned the sky.  nothing...No planes, no noise (only alot of neighborhood dogs barking), no \"something weird\" in the sky. my husband wanted to get into the house immediately, as it was very unverving for him. for some reason, i had no negative feelings and wanted to stay to scan the sky, but went in but returned a few minutes later to let the dogs out in the backyard.  i noted nothing unusual in sky.","distance":"20 Feet or

of a bluff and we can see down into the valley heading east and south towards river falls and points south and east which include hudson, wi, roberts, wi prescott, wi, hastings mn etc.\r\n\r\nour home is a multiple level home with our master suite on the top floor. i had been on the main floor doing some furniture rearranging when i stopped for a minute to go upstairs to our bedroom/bathroom. i was in our bathroom and happened to look up and out the windows on that side of our home which faces down into the valley, east and south as i just described. i often look out those windows when in our bathroom because the view is pretty at night, a black night sky with a few house lights far into the horizon in the valley.\r\n\r\nas i looked out the window there was suddenly a very bright light in the sky, flashing, getting brighter and spreading in all directions. it filled a good part of the night sky and seemed to hang there, like in slow motion and it left me with what i call an afterglow, like one would get when a flashbulb goes off in your eyes. i did not hear any sound with it and i can not tell how close it was though i could swear it was right outside my window and over the several acres behind my house as it sweeps from the crest we are on and down into the valley where highway 65 runs north to south. \r\n\r\ni did not notice a color but i was totally focused on the light and how bright it was and how big it was.  i am not sure how long it lasted because i just stood there staring at it. for whatever reason during the time that i was watching it i did not give much thought to defining it. that came after i stopped watching it. i was mostly just in awe.\r\n\r\nwhen it was gone i washed my hands and went quickly back down to the main level of our home and asked my daughter if she had seen it. she looked at me like ���seen what���? i told her what i had seen and she said no i did not see it but i believe you. odd thing for her to say now that i think about it. i looked out our rear kitchen window which faces the same direction as our bathroom to see if there was anything else and i did not see anything.\r\n\r\ni turned the tv channel from cnn to the weather channel see if there were storms in the area because sometimes we do get thunder or lightening in the winter. everything was clear winter sky for our area. i later took note that the stars were out which i had not even seen before when i was watching this light.\r\n\r\ni went looking last night on the web to see if anyone else had seen it and then saw that there had been another quake in taiwan in the same time frame. nothing about lights in the sky. i have heard stories about how sometimes lights will appear in the sky before a quake because some kind of electromagnetic energy is being release but the quake was in taiwan so i would not think we would be seeing lights for something like that here.\r\n\r\ni was curious again this morning because seeing the light has stayed with me and i looked again and saw nothing till it occurred to me to look on mufon and saw that someone else had seen it, or at least it sounds like they did. i checked here because i have seen odd things before and knew about mufon but never reported anything on the website.\r\n\r\ni was beginning to think it had been a transformer blowing on the hill. now i know that is not the case because the other person who saw something was actually in town and from their description and would not have been able to see a transformer from where they were.\r\n\r\nmaybe a meteor? it had to be pretty darn close to be so bright and visible if that is what it was, and there was no sound.\r\n\r\nmy feelings were excited, yet i was moving kind of slow. there was no fear, more like wow, that is incredible! what is that? did anyone else see that? was i the only one? i remember thinking it was something different.  i think i am going to have to draw it if that is possible. i also remember thinking something about the earthquakes we have been having.\r\n\r\nthinking about this it makes me think of a light that our family saw in the night sky on a friday night about a week ago. i know it was friday as it was end of the week and no one wanted to cook so we were on our way to get a bite to eat. we were heading north and then west towards hudson, wi on county road ss and i looked out my car window to the north and east as my husband drove and saw this strange light in the sky. \r\n\r\nit looked like light that had been sent through a prism and you could see vertical bars of light touching each other all one color very pale. i asked everyone else if they could see it and we slowed down and pulled somewhat to the side of the road so that we could see it better. there were four of us in the car and all of us saw it. it was pretty big and high in the sky. we discussed whether it might be from a search light but it did not start from the ground up and nothing seemed to be around in the sky to make it. it was just there in the sky. i wondered about northern lights but it seemed to have too distinct a shape for that. \r\n\r\nwe watched it all the way into hudson on county road u and then n till we got on highway 94 and headed west. on the way back we did not see it. the drive from our home to hudson takes somewhere around minutes. i���m now wondering if anyone else saw that light too.\r\n\r\nour feelings/comments about this light were curiosity and we talked about what it might be and how odd it was. \r\n\r\ni'd love to know what these lights were.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":22128,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.8658363,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03042010-0011","longitude":-92.6224482,"occurred":1267672620000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,

Unknown","city":"Dublin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was standing outside in the courtyard of three portable buildings at cottonwood baptist church, all covered by a separate steel-framed covering/roof. the buildings are positioned on the south, west, and north sides, with the east side being open. at approximately 7:40pm, i heard a long afterburner sound, probably 15 to 20 seconds worth. it sounded exactly like an f-16 engine, and i'm confident that it was not a twin-engined jet or a group of jets.\r\n\r\napproximately one minute later, i was on the east side of the courtyard facing west. i was watching the activity in the courtyard when something caused me to look up over the roof of the outbuilding to the west. i saw four orange lights forming the corners of an inverted trapezoid. the lights were of medium intensity, very similar to seeing an old streetlight in the distance. these lights did not seem connected, and as my eyes adjusted, i thought i saw stars between them, though i can't be sure because of the lighting around me at ground level.\r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed them, i knew immediately that these were the lights that had been seen before from this same location around thanksgiving. my wife and son along with several others had noticed the lights in the same position (west) in the sky during an outdoor fellowship meal.\r\n\r\nthe lights did not change position or intensity. since i registered them as streetlamp-like lights, my mind guessed an altitude of 500 - 1,000 feet. the interesting thing about my vantage point is that there is a very narrow distance between the top of the outbuilding's roof and the steel-framed roof, limiting the combinations of altitudes and distances that these objects might have. if my altitude guess is correct, this would place the lights directly over the town of dublin.\r\n\r\ni had time to realize that i was seeing a light event, look for structure between the lights, and sense that there was none before they went out one by one - i believe that top left, lower right, top right, lower left was the order they went out in. they turned off in a manner consistent with a power source being removed, rather than the flickering or changing intensity associated with a burn-out event of a flammable object. the delay between one light going out and the next felt precise. if you say \"one and two and three and four\" that's the time pattern they followed.\r\n\r\nbecause of the afterburner sound beforehand, i was completely convinced that this was a military operation from the moment i saw them. i immediately switched to looking for structure, and couldn't see any. after that, i mainly focused on the upper left light because it felt \"closest\", and i looked for structure around the light. no structure was detectable.\r\n\r\nat 8:23pm, two military jets flew over, one to the west of the church, and one directly overhead. the one overhead registered as being at greater than 10,000 feet, and had just enough engine noise to make me look up and look for it. that was the last thing i saw in the sky before we left.\r\n\r\nno one else around me at the time (7-8 adults, ~30kids) reacted, but i did find out that a couple of the girls in the kids group saw the lights as well. within an hour of the event, after relaying the story to other adults, two different men told me that military jets and helicopters had been flying extremely low around the stephenville and hamilton areas in the preceding days. of significance, there had been a very low flyover of the a&m agricultural research facility at the corner of hwy 281 and hwy 8 (lingleville road). this location is approximately 12 miles north/northwest from the location of the sighting.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

down for a brief second and the object was gone. my daughters friend was sitting facing her and saw her face light up from the glow of the light that came down from the object. i can have her send in

i leaned forward and looked up and observed a bright light meandering along under apparent intelligent control. i immediately recognized the light as some kind of propulsion. the craft was very low in the sky maybe one hundred yards or more up, it was just below the mountain line in the background. the flight pattern of the craft was a very slight and gradual weaving from left to right barely noticeable. then, suddenly, it accellerated faster than any aircraft i have ever seen and i have seen the fastest aircraft in the world, the sr71, take off many times. then, the most amazing thing of all happened, the craft, while accellerating, made an absolute ninety degree turn to the right(east), which confirmed my thought of the light being that of the propulsion system, the light was no longer visible because the craft had turned, and there was no light visibly emminating from the back after it turned, then it was gone in a split second as it accellerated even faster. i was able to see just a shadow of the craft against the moonlit sky as it dissapeared, and as fast as it took off it did appear to literally dissapear. \r\n\r\ndue to my job at the time, i was in this particular area six days per week and generally around the same time, and i had witnessed many strange things in the exact same area on many different occasions. such as, lights that would appear in the sky and just drop straight towards the ground as if they were dropped from the sky, also i watched a light race around the inside of a cloud very rapidly, the light was literally inside the cloud not on the exterior, there was no beam coming up from the ground, the light just kept racing around and around inside the the cloud. then, one day in broad day light flying directly over concord, nh was a black object that appeared to be block shaped and had a flame trail about one hundred yards long emitting from what appeared to be the back of the object. i have photos of this object. the very next day i saw two army helicopters following the same path as the object had the day before.
