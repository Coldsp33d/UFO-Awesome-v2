lights the past few nights, which is strange in itself.  all the house were lights off, since i was about to go to bed. suddenly a light came on from directly above my window, from outside of my one story home. it just blinked on, with no sound, or anything else. there was no movement (like a helicopter passing over, etc) and it was silent. it was a quiet night outside, no traffic or noise, or random lights. our yard lights were turned off, and none of them are near the window, anyway. at first, i thought it was a neighbor's lights, but when i pulled the curtain back to look, there were none on, which gave me a chill. it was so creepy. it really caught me off guard and scared me a little. one minute im quietly looking out a dark window and the next minute a light \"turns on\" straight above my window, lighting up my window, me, and half my kitchen. like someone pointing a light at you. it was a grayish white light, similar to an multi-led flashlight, it wasnt harsh or extremely bright, it sort of \"glowed.\" it was a perfect column of light, lighting up the window, and me. it was like nothing i'd ever seen before. i stood there for a few minutes, trying to figure it out, but not at all brave enough to go outside.  just as i had finally decided to go wake my roommate to show her what was happening, just as soon as i stepped away and turned to leave the room, it silently blinked off. it had felt like it was in the house with me. imagine sitting in the dark in your house and suddenly someone turns on a spotlight a couple feet above your head.  it was very unnerving.  when i read the report from the same date and almost same time, i got chills. i thought i should file a report. ive seen several ufo's and strange things in the sky here, theres airports and govt bases in every direction, and a huge expanse of land with govt and private sites up in the fremont hills. lockheed-martin, nasa, and lawrence-livermore labs all have facilities not far from

of mf my house. i always look up at the sky every night and do a little stargazing. i was outside for a few minutes before i looked up at the west/southwest sky. at 8:05 p.M. cst, i noticed what appeared to be a very bright \"yellowish\" star that i have never noticed before but it appeared to be moving very slowly north. there was a light breeze that was making the tree limbs move a liitle so i held up my right index finger as a reference to see if it was an optical illusion. the object actually was moving very slowly to the north. i watched this object for about one minute before the acceleration.\r\n\r\nthere were no blinking lights that would identify this as an airplane. i actually counted three airplanes in the sky after this happened. it was just an extremely bright yellowish sphere shaped object that was moving slowly to the north. all of the sudden the object accelerated \"extremely fast\" and travelled north for about 1 to 1.5 seconds. i cannot even estimate how far this object may have travelled at this speed but from the point it accelerated to the point it stopped (i held my tape measure up to the sky starting from the tree that was in the horizon when it started, to the tree in the horizon where it stopped) it was three feet and two inches on my tape measure.  the object then decelerated \"extremely fast\", stopped and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this in my life and my jaw was left hanging open. this was an amazing sight to behold, wether it was a government craft or a craft of extraterrestrial origin. unfortunately i did not have my video-camera with me to record this. after witnessing what i did tonight i can assure you whenever i go out from now on i will have my

down the main st.Here and notice a rainbow over the lake.Oshkosh is right on lake winnebago.They call this town,city on the water.This lake by the way is only 20 ft.Deep and thats the deepest part.So anyway i decide to head out to the park that sits next to the lake and take a picture of the rainbow before it diminishes,its about a little after 7oclock evening,i could pin point the time if i could find out what time it rained here on june 24 2006 but its between 7 and 8 and just about 7:30 when i get there i geuss.So i get there and grab my camera 3.2 digital biofocals made by simmons.And yea the rainbow is now diminshed but its wierd cuz its like a pryramid shape so i thought cool pictures anyway ill take three i have a thing about pics i dont like shooting more then i need so i make a mental note 3 is the limit so i snap the first shot wait a few seconds take the second shot this is when i notice something else is on my camera now it takes up the whole view and i cant figure out what im looking at its so detailed and i think a bug is on the lens,so i look no bug i look back to where im shooting and there it is.And i can see why i thought it was a bug its got some windows and looks like some sort of octagonal shapes on the top half like skin or something i cant explain it just so much detail and no time to take it all in .And i have a picture to shoot yet so i take it.After the shot i stay there where i was for several minutes just looking over the area.It then dawns on me that i might be breathing in some of this black smoke and im not sure the way the wind is blowing.So i wanna leave because this ship shot out a bloom of black smoke the color ive never seen before.One bloom while it hovered and you can see it above the craft,the other one thats being shot out i didnt see untill i exposed the picture,but at least i got that much,and theres two orbs in the air above it and one in the water i didnt see either untill i exposed the picture.I would like to mention also i didnt expose these pictures for over a year,i just wanted to forget about it.But im ready to release it mostly because i cant get anyone to look at these pics and tell me what the hell this is i know what it is.And i know where it could have went in but ive been scared to go out there and take a dip myself.David

closely as the web-cam doesn't have an eye-piece. also upon reflection, i heard no unusual sounds while i was up on the roof. \r\n\r\nabout 5 minutes later, i went back up on the roof to take a few more shots from the same perspective, but i didn't pick up anything out of the ordinary. i've tried to explain their presence as glare, reflection, or weather balloons, etc - zooming in on them and asking certain rational questions. their height off the ground and their solid appearance is truly baffling to me, and i would like to know if weather balloons can be \"bell shaped\" or could possibly

attention was drawn to what appeared to be an intense flashing light.  i grabbed some inexpensive binoculars and focused them on the light. while viewing what appeared to have been one blinking light now became something else.  \r\n\r\ni'll try to create a picture: in the binoculars the light jumped around in measurements of great distances or there was more than one light.  for comparison purposes i'll use tis analogy: when i look at an airplane in the binoculars the blinking lights move back and forth about a 16th to 8th inch increments. the lights of this object, however, jumped back and forth randomly or it was following the frame-work of a triangle, i'm not sure.  it didn't jump point to point but anywhere within the lines of the triangle.  the spacing was within the distance of the two inch binocular forward glass.\r\n\r\nwithout knowing the distance of the object, but within the magnification of the glasses (an airplane light jumps a 16th inch or so) these lights or the light was jumping two inches or slightly more, randomly possibly within a shape.  it was difficult to believe what i saw so later i tested the visual by viewing several airplanes, trying to duplicate the distance of the jumping lights. the airplane lights at many distances remained the same, i.E. within that tight 16th to 8th inch measurement.\r\n\r\nto condense what i saw is this: with the naked eye i saw a single light that had an unusual snap to it.  it grabbed my attention.  i looked at it with binoculars and the one tight area blinking light became many randomly moving lights with movements that suggested hugh distances in a frame-work.  it lasted  minutes until it disappeared from view.  i'm assuming that it was moving away from me, but the object or light(s) was so far away that i could not detect its apparently eastward slightly southern movement as it disappeared.

had several mornings when it was -25f- suddenly and surprizingly. and i thought, \"who brought cold air in?\"- as a sort of joke- because the extreme temperature was not normal- with the conditions we were having in general.\r\n\r\n during this time i was on trip home in car (toyota) driving from thunder bay, via dog lake road- and my youngest daughter beau was with me in vehicle: she is 16(just short of 17th birthday) and sitting in the front passenger's seat.  as we passed the large culverts which are situated in the mackintyre river- just across the road from a major gravel pit- she said to me that she saw \"circles floating in the river!\".  it was late afternoon- 3:30/maybe 4:30? and we were in a bit of a rush: i was taking her home, and planning to return to town, as another daughter: age 21:mother of a 3 yr old and a newborn pre-mie who was still in neo-natal icu at hospital- i was planning to go back to her house for the night.  so, i did not stop, turn around to go back and see.\\\r\n\r\n  my daughter described the circles as \"looking like big white innertubes floating in the water\"  or \"like a mushroom cloud- as in a nuclear explosion: when it fans out and looks like a tube- like that.\"\r\n\r\nit was about 8 days later that i was once again in transit, bringing my daughter home from town, this time at about 9:30 a.M.- and she mentioned that the circles were still floating in the river. i stopped, turned around and went back for pictures, and also took videos: as much as i could with my digital camera.\r\n\r\nwe were in awe of what we were seeing.  and it took time to process- at first impression, we thought perhaps the circles were forming, there in the pool-  but as we continued to ponder the sight, this explanation just did not seem adequate to describe how they formed.\\\r\n\r\nand it was like being in a state of shock: as though- what it is- you are realizing, and yet- slow/ like numb- or half asleep- coming out of fog- to realize just what you are seeing.\r\n\r\nwe wandered about, taking a few other pictures, then headed homeward on backroads- observing and checking out other beaver pools/ rivers etc. because you are thinking \"perhaps there are more elsewhere?\"- at the same time realizing- you have never seen anything like this:!! ever- anywhere- in person/ on film/ in a magazine/ or a book.. not anywhere>\r\n\r\nthen, we came home and downloaded the pictures and videos to computer,and then cleared some other pictures off of camera, and charged batteries- and just watched, and wandered, and sat and considered... thought about who to talk to/ what to do... began to think perhaps we should contact some sort of news??  but by this time, day was late and light (it was dark and cloudy all day) was too far gone for further observation.\r\n\r\nnext day: tried contacting the \"argus\" at tbay university: thinking- \"colledge newspaper/ liberal- connected to science- might want to investigate?!- and not be inclined to censor...\" but when i called there, i was told that they had closed their department for christmas break- \"keep an eye on them, and contact us in january or february if you see them again\"  and this just sort of- surprised me, and put me off- \r\n\r\ni then debated whether to try contacting the public newspaper- chronicle journal- but was unsure whether they were still there... didn want to send someone on a wild goose chase... had to go look first- and it is perhaps 16kms from where i live- almost 1/2 of way to town/ we got ready and went back: and there were only 2 circles left in the eddy- 2 large ones, and a misshaped medium one, and a small one...\r\n\r\nso we took more video, and wandered about and took other still shots of area... there had been no melting conditions between the previous day and this: so i was  baffled as to why- so many were now missing.  we had had a small dusting of snow: enough to show that a deer, a wolf, a couple rabbits, a squirrel- had gone through the area- but no moose tracks< car treads, people prints- no other traffic.  and none near the river banks of any sort.\r\n\r\nthen i managed to make my way down to the river edge, and i was able to snag one of the circles with a stick, and pulled it to the bank, and we had a closer look- and took pictures- to show size, diameter, and make up(i pulled the disc about 1/2 way out of water, and daughter took picture of underneath side with light shining through).  i did not pull it all the way out: as i did not want to break it.\r\n\r\ni took my glove off- and felt the ice with my bare hand- and had daughter do the same: and we observed that it looked like frozen bubbles, and felt somewhat like styrofoam- in texture. \r\n\r\n i eased it down into the water, and gently pushed it back out into the pool: and i was sad as i saw that it no longer rotated in the same rythm as before: it had lost its natural momentum- it felt like an, ���h darn- i killed it`- sort of a situation.  there was an aura of sacredness- to the entire experience.  i did not want to break or take one away from the river.\r\n\r\nin the hours, days and weeks that followed- i showed the video to various and sundry people, and observed actions and reactions...  still wondering where or who to talk to-  most would look, and say, `what the hell is that���!!���`... and i would say, -these are ice circles- in the mackintyre river...\r\n\r\ni went to the chronicle journal- asked to see an editor- and whoever it was i saw, sent me to the radio/t.V. station.  i went to the radio/t.V. station- and the referred fellow- was intrigued when he saw the film- but it was the next day ( dec2, 2009 )- and i had looked on my way into town, and saw that the remaining 2 circles were now gone: and still not really melting conditions: we had had more cold/ more snow-\r\n\r\nand when he heard they were no longer there- he said, -it is hard to make a story about something that no lonter exists.-   -and - we would need to get our own footage...-   and then he wanted to make a copy of the video from my camera- and i let him do that- he took the camera, queued to the spot- to his office while i waited in outer waiting room- and brought it back after.  i felt like i was making a major mistake in that- but no files were missing- \r\n\r\ni still get a sick feeling in my gut, though- just thinking about that-\r\n\r\nanyway, onward and forward.... at some point i managed to upload some of the video and re-sized pictures- to the web- phantomsandmonsters.Com and facebook- and youtube...\r\n\r\ni am thinking that there may yet be remnants of the circles in the pack ice, downstream from the pool where we first noticed them.  we had a snow that filled the ponds with a couple inches of slush: just within 36 hours of our filming: and then the deep cold set in: and it is only beginning to melt- now- in past 32 hours.\r\n\r\nwhat intrigues me the most is how- the experience is rather dream-like.\r\ncomprehension is inhibitted by social and emotional- conditioning or other factors- but when one tries to actually explain- how- such things formed: one comes up with ideas of answers that are not- shall we say- socially acceptable- in normal circles.\r\n\r\nwhen facing a riddle- the simplest solution- no matter how improbable or unbelievable- is most probably the answer.  sherlock holmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe discs were made of frozen bubbles: mixed with tiny white hailstones: looked like the water was touched by a rod- or rods- that were the temperature of dry ice or colder: causing the water to boil, and freeze instantly- and the number: 9 almost identical circles: to me it suggests\r\na configuration of some sort- of 9 feet or legs- and the smaller circles may have been touch points of hozes- just a theory.\r\n\r\nfrom the size of the discs: about 30inches across each- if placed in a pattern of 3 isoscolyse triangles- comprising a fourth triangle in center: distance would indicate a base of about 15 feet across- a size that would fit just within the eddy where the circles floated...  \r\n\r\nand having played with the dots- concept- in paint, and then put at an angle- in the stretch-scew mode- created a configuration which- if superimposed above the pictures of the circles: matches. \r\n\r\n- -  -- - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ---- - - - - -`\r\n\r\nwhen facing a riddle- the simplest solution- no matter how improbable or unbelievable- is most probably the answer.  sherlock holmes.\r\n\r\n= - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - -- - - - - - - -\r\nand so, time passed, and just recently, i was contacted by a person, claiming to have affiliation with a movie documentary company in toronto- and doing a film in connection with william shatner... ���nd wanting me to give them my videos for their production.  <\r\n\r\ni am still looking for someone with an honest, scientific interest in investigating the actual facts of the situation.  it would take a skidoo or perhaps a helicopter: search the river downstream (perhaps less than a mile) to see whether the circles are frozen in the ice at the next beaver dam or snag.\r\n\r\nconsidering the nature of the find- it seems important to me.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,
