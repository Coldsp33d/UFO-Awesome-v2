midnight and she was describing her ufo experiences to me. i looked up to answer a question she had asked me when i saw a very bright white beam of light come down through the ceiling and flash behind her. the beam was about the size of a tennis ball and had a few jagged edges. the only thing i can compare it to is a lightning bolt. at first i didnt say anything but it was so extraordinary i had to tell her. she went on to tell me about a recording of crop circle tones she had, she played them for me and we decided to take a drive. before we left i said out loud \"i am totally open and i hope you will show yourself to me.\" we got into her car, put the crop circle tones on the radio and drove to the highest point on the mountain where she lives. we pulled into a turnout, turned the engine off and started casually talking, i was so into the conversation we were having that i didnt really expect to see anything. within a few minutes i saw the same beam of light shoot down from the sky into her window and illuminate the front of her shirt.It was a very foggy night and we coulnt see anything around us. it was like a white sheet surrounded the car. a few seconds later the beam came down again in the same spot. we looked at each other and said wow did you see that! we sat in that spot for a few more minutes before we decided to move a little further down the road. as soon as we moved and turned the car off the beam came down again right outside the drivers side window. we decided to slowly keep moving down the road and every time we moved and turned the car off the beam would come down into the drivers side of the car. i was a little anxious before we left the house because i didnt know what to expect, but when i saw the beams of light a calm feeling came over me. my aunt and i think that us seeing the lights was a show of approval for the experieces she had shared with me earlier in the night.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

duration and was significantly larger that i was accustomed to seeing.  it looked like a burning fireball traveling at a high speed similar to a meteor.  it kept falling and then split into two smaller burning fireballs and continued to fall.  i was concerned it would impact the earth but before they hit the ground each meteor split into two orbs or lights (thus four total) and each light turned and travelled horizontal to the ground for several miles.  we then noticed a fifth and all five were travelling at different speeds to the west.  we watched them fly for several minutes. they did not fly in any formation and appeared to be travelling at different speeds and altitudes and they appeared to bounce around a little.  next, we could not believe our eyes when we noticed a second fireball that did the exact same thing.  there were 10 orbs or lights total traveling in two groups of five towards the west.  we watched them for about 5 minutes until they were so far away they 'set' on the horizon.  the lights were white with no color and we figured we watched them travel 12-17 miles or more above the ground.\r\n\r\nthis event was so unbelievable, i was shaking and in such

with prior military service.  i wanted to put this out there.  i'm a cynical , skeptical person and would not believe in ufos if i did not experience it myself.  \r\n\r\nit was a warm summer day and i was a 12 year old boy at the time.  i used to walk about a half mile back to a pond on my grandpas farm to catch frogs and salamanders.  as i was walking back home through the fields, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and i felt like someone was watching me.  i could not hear any noise, but i noticed the birds and animals stopped their noises. i looked behind me and did not see anything.  a voice inside of my head said \"look up\".  i looked up and noticed a metallic looking disc shaped saucer in the air.  it was a perfect circle, had no lights and was a dull grey/silver color.  it hovered about 200 feet directly over me as i stood there in a kind of shock.  the disc was fairly small, maybe 30-35 feet from end to end.\r\n\r\nthe next thought in my head, which was what i can only guess now was some type of telepathy, was \"don't be afraid, we won't hurt you\".\r\n\r\ni felt a peculiar sensation for what seemed to be 10 seconds.  i only felt the same thing years later.  it was a vibration throughout my body.  i went to a rock and roll concert where there were dozens of large speakers set up.  i was in the front row right in front of the speakers and the vibration was quite similar, but with very loud music and this thing was silent.\r\n\r\nthis thing never emitted any noise, smoke, or flame.  i broke out of my short trance as every hair in my body was on end.  i ran through the fields and screamed for my mom who came running out into the back yard to see what was wrong.  she looked at this saucer and her mouth just dropped open.  now here is the really interesting part that tells me this was definitely an alien craft.  it hovered for 4-5 seconds near us.\r\n\r\nit was still hovering but had risen to about 1000 feet by then; i never could discern a cockpit or bubble on top.  now we lived on top of a hill in the hudson valley at the following lat/long:  42 degrees 24'26.08\"n and 74 degrees 03'18.62\"w.  this saucer, without any noise or smoke etc. shot off at an incredible speed over the catskill mountains.  it was a clear day also.  it flew over the mountains past hunter/windham in a straight line while ascending gradually to clear the mountain tops by about 1000 feet and disappeared at 42 degrees 19'49.40\"n, and 74 degrees 14'25.06\"w which is a distance i measured at about 12 miles with googleearth  (in 3 seconds).  this extrapolates to 4 miles a second or 14,800 mph!  i have been in the military and nothing we had, especially back then, could go anywhere near that fast.  it takes the shuttle almost a full orbit with 3 large fuel tanks to build up that kind of speed and i always heard sonic booms with military aircraft at mach speeds.  this thing was intelligent, fast, and not of this world.  there were other sitings in the hudson valley in 76/77 but these were mostly odd hovering multi colored lights at night.  i can't remember much else about the experience and i wish i could give you a better time frame.  we told a few family members but no one believed us.  my mom still lives up in new york but i have moved to florida.  i must say there is something out there and i went from a skeptic to a believer.  i don't really want contact and am not looking for any attention.  i just wanted to put it out there in case anyone had something similar happen to them.  i always wondered what would have happened if i just stood there.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

in the northeast from my position, and planets would never be in this part of the sky.\r\n\r\nthe details: the lights were the magnitude of venus, very bright, a steady light (like a planet looks, no twinkles like a star).  in fact, it looked like 2 venus���s in the northeast sky at 8pm eastern time usa.  i held my hand up to see if the lights were moving; i thought maybe they were flares.  there was no movement. i was in the military and know how flares move.   the lights were 45 degrees from each other; the one right was higher, left lower.\r\n\r\nmy friend and i kept observing, asking ���what the heck is that?��� for about 2 minutes. then the light on the bottom left winked out slowly, and 2 seconds later, the one on the right winked out.  there was no movement across the sky; it looked like they were moving away from our viewing position, or disappearing.   there were no more sightings after that. \r\n\r\nmore info- i live in an area where you see the commercial planes flying west out of philadelphia.   while we were observing the 2 objects, they disappeared while a plane flying out of philadelphia came between us and our viewing position of the objects.   using the plane as an altitude reference, the lights were higher.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":22077,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.8220535,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03012010-0011","longitude":-75.8274413,"occurred":1265443200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1267491241000,"summary":"Two

11-02-2010 it was visually strange.  it was a clear night  and i had just left fred meyers store at about 8:30 pm.  as i was driving up central ave. toward ocean blvd.  i thought i saw at the top of central and ocean a green light over the flashing yellow light.  my first thought was oh no they didn���t put a stop light up here!  but as i got closer i realized that the light (the same color as a green traffic light) was bigger and higher up then the flashing yellow light.  it looked like it it was behind the methodist church where there are big power lines.  it wasn���t like a regular green light because the light glowed and moved around, like millions of fireflies.  now my curiosity as to what i was looking at kept me driving toward it.  just as i realized what  i thought it was there was a flash and it shot straight up in the sky leaving a yellow trail of something that had been shot out of it.  i was so shocked at what i saw!  you hear about them but you never plan on seeing one.  total time from seeing it to it vanishing was about 30 to 45 sec. i went home as scheduled and told my children who believed my story.  i didn���t give it much thought after that.  \r\n     a week later on 11-07-2010 i had just gotten out of my car from work at my apartment and  again it was around 8:30 pm when for some reason i looked up over my apartment.  it was again a clear night when i saw a white star move.  i continued to look at this ���star��� which as high as it was i figured it was over empire lakes which is behind my apartment building complex.  as i continued to watch the star it started to glow bright white and get larger.  then it shot off north leaving again a yellowish trail behind it shooting south.  i was not surprised but full of dread this time for some reason.  this also took about 30 to 45 secs.  again i went in and told the kids that i just saw another one.  again they believed me.\r\n     the only thing that really makes all of this weird is that two days later i woke up at 10:00 am.  everyone in the apartment, including the cats were still asleep.  i found this odd as my 9 year old granddaughter who slept with me at the time is usually up at the crack of dawn.  my cat yuki cries at the door at 9:00 am every morning like clockwork to be fed.  i was the only person awake.  gradually, everyone was up and about and seemed sluggish.  i discovered that i didn���t feel well, had a headache and my throat and windpipe were extremely dry, bone dry.  my lymph nodes in my throat were swelled up to bursting and i had three horizontal cuts on the bottom right inside of my mouth.  i felt like this for about five days.  i didn���t get checked out by a doctor as i didn���t have any health insurance at the time.  i do have an appointment in march and i will ask the doctor to check out the marks in my mouth.\r\n\r\n     previously in 2003 to 2004 i had lived off seven devils road in a secluded spot on the ocean on tokyo lane.  i didn���t write down exact times of the things that happen to me while the kids and i lived there.  i was constantly plagued by the coast guard helicopter flying directly and very close to my house at 2 or 3:00 in the morning several times a month.  when i say close i mean just over my roof top!  i thought that they may  be rescuing someone but there were never any reports of vessels needing assistance and they weren���t near the water.  one time i woke up to what i thought was a spot light over the house and thinking the coast guard was at it again.  i got up out of bed to flip them off.  just as my feet hit the floor i heard the coast guard coming!?  the light went out and i got back into bed terrified.  i heard the coast guard once again fly as fast as they could southeast toward bandon away from the water.  \r\ni woke up one time with every joint in my body on fire.  when i say joint i  mean every place that a bone connects to another bone.  it was so painful i couldn't move. this lasted  for about 20 min. and then the pain faded away.  it was an uncomfortable feeling living there and night time was always stressful.  i was fatigued all the time, the children said they felt like they were being watched.  we left in 02-2004 and the children and i were grateful to leave and move back into town.  \r\napparently, it doesn���t matter where you live.\r\n\r\ni have shared this with very few people.  my friend in california believes my stories and is greatly concerned.  hopefully, this will help and in some way be another piece of the puzzle.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

coming towards me overhead. at first i thought it may be the safety light that you see commonly on commercial aircraft but as it came closer i realised that the light was perfectly round and bright and was not flashing at all.\r\n\r\nwithin 30 or so seconds another one appeared behind it, following the exact same flight path as the first. there were 8 in total that i witnessed within the next ten minutes. they seemed to be flying in pairs and each pair followed 2 definate indentical paths.\r\n\r\none pair would come toward me and take a smooth curve off to my left. the next pair would curve off to my right. they had a sound coming from them that i have never heard from an aircraft before. the best way i can describe it is to say that it reminded me of a 2-tone car alarm siren coming from approximately 1-2 miles away. i did think that was what i was actually hearing but this sound was in perfect timing with the craft being overhead. this sound would disappear as soon as the craft were out of sight and then reappear as soon as the next pair came into sight over the horizon.\r\n\r\nthey were perfectly smooth in their flight and were travelling at what i would say was a slighty slower speed than normal commercial passenger aircraft. the overhead height was approximately what you would expect of a aircraft being on it's landing path, maybe 30 minutes from landing. i could see no bodywork at all as you would on an aircraft, just a very bright red circular light.\r\n\r\ni have uploaded 2 mp4 videos taken from my cellphone. the craft appear unsteady when in fact they moved perfectly smoothly. i am afraid i could not get my camera very still. if you turn up the volume very high 3 minutes into the first clip, you will be able to hear the 2-tone sound that was eminating from them. this sound was in fact much louder in reality and was the same volume and duration for each craft but the phone just couldnt quite pick it up well enough. i'm not sure why this sound was only picked up for a short time.\r\n\r\nalso, it appears that i was filming just 1 craft when in fact i was trying to switch from one craft to another. i had trouble getting the pairs into one shot but if you observe closely at 18 seconds into the second clip, you will see 2 crafts in the same shot. all 4 pairs travelled in this manner.\r\n\r\nfeel free to contact me via my supplied

helo because it wasnt moving. being ex-military and having worked with helos i became immediately confused because it was totally the wrong shape. it was rectangle. then my mind took in the distance ahead of me and i knew it was larger than anything i had ever seen in the air and not moving. as i waited for the light to change i held my thumb up and measured it with my thumbnail pressed against the window, it was wider than my thumb. i drove toward it determined to get closer, my heart started pumping like crazy and as i got closer i could see more detail on the tailend and what i presumed the right side. it was grey/blue in color on the bottom and side and the whole horizontal-rectangle rear-end was darker to black and i could see tall verticle bars (blue/grey) from top to bottom set within the dark area all along the back. the sides and bottom seemed smooth and its edges separating top, bottom and back were sharp. it was hovering about 1,500 ft above ground just below the cloud. (i'm an ex-sky diver and can judge pretty good)\r\nas i drove closer it began to move southwest/west into the heavy cloud hanging there. it dissapeard into the cloud as i turned off hiway 60 and homestead road. it had started moving down homestead road as it dissapeard. i parked the car and got out but it was no longer visable. it was a beautiful day that morning and it was clear except for that one darn cloud. as the cloud moved on i waited to catch a glimpse but saw nothing further. i still felt confused as to what i had just witnessed. i hesitated telling anyone, but eventually told my sister. i have not mentioned it to anyone until now. i saw something on tv about mufon and decided to contact you.\r\ni was so intriged by it's size that i set my odometer on the car to zero and

still could see no signs of aircraft of any sort.The lights were very bright and impossible to not notice.There were 2 cars behind my truck and they were sure to have seen the sight as well as the folks that had pulled over.I studied the sky carefully.I have worked at night alot in my  life.I have seen the space shuttle re-enter the atmosphere,space junk fall and catch fire,comets,meteors of all sorts,apache helicoptors with lights underneath,and passenger jets with landing lights on.These lights were quite unique in comparision to anything ive ever seen.The light they admitted was white and bright with no colors at all.I would love to get a look at the radar at 8:02 pm.It was several small craft or one very large one.","distance":"Over One

grab a bag of clothes to bring in. i glanced to the north to what i thought were a few airplanes flying near each other, i looked again to notice that these lights were far to unusual to be typical aircraft. i ran inside to fetch my video camera and my father. what i saw was approximately 4 and 15 objects at any given time. they would group and scatter frequently moving in very erratic paths. the changed their direction effortlessly within a full 360 degree spectrum. their lights were pure white and pulsed without a distinguishable pattern. on several occasions many of them would disappear from sight only to reappear again in completely different spots. about 10 minutes after my dad at i began watching them, two jets came along and seemed to be attempting to get near the objects. the jets were easily recognizable compared to the objects, they moved in very linear paths, had the common red and blue aircraft lights and turned in stretched arcs. every time a jet came near one, the object would \"bounce\" out of its way at a sharp 90 degree incline, then would quickly change directions again. i was watching this from 18th and van buren looking straight north, starting around 8:30. we continued to watch for 15 minutes or so from this location until they all began to head further north, out of our viewing range, so we hopped in my car and headed out on mckinley, just north of twin lakes and continued to watch them dart back and forth across the sky until they eventually sped off to the south east, moving far too fast to keep an eye on them by car. i managed to capture a little bit on video, though most of the time they were moving too fast and changing direction too frequently for my camera to stay focused enough to see them. the video that i do have does capture the unusual sequence of lights blinking on and off, and reappearing elsewhere. i cannot say that what we saw was a group of ufos, or a strange government test, for that i am unsure, but these do defy a logical explanation on my behalf and i feel deserve some sort of investigation. i will release the video after email contact when i feel comfortable with whom contacts me. i do not wish to come off as arrogant, i just prefer not to open a can of worms. i am typically skeptical as far as unusual sightings go, but this left me unsure as what to think. thank you for your time.","distance":"Over One

clear night. a friend and i where laying on our backs on a trampoline in the back yard of a house in a suburban neighborhood. \r\n i noticed some small white objects flying directly over the trees to our left. i orignally mistook these objects as birds. i took a more interested look at the objects, as white birds in that area would be unusual. as i looked, these objects seemed to notice my friend and i as well. as the objects appeared to be following each other, the lead object flew directly overhead and stopped. the lead object was closely followed by 2 to 3 other objects and one straggler, about a second or two behind. directly over our heads at that point were 4, maybe 5, white, circular shaped objects. i would guess them to be 1 to 2 feet in diameter. they may have been spherical, but our perspective did not allow for an accurate interpretation. they were approximately 15 to 20 feet above our heads. these objects had formed themselves in a circle (like ring around the rosy). they hovered for maybe another second or two before they starting moving, still following one another, in this circular shape they had formed. within another second or two, they were moving at such a fast rate that there appeared to be a solid white circle hovering above us. they did this for another few seconds or more. then they stopped in a very quick manner to the same circular shape that they had originally formed. as my friend and i looked on in disbelief, these objects took off to our right from a complete stand still to a rate of speed that was extraordinary. they were beyond our sight in what seemed to be less than a second. \r\n i have tried to rationalize what we saw that night and could not. what truly made these objects ufo's was the speed in which they could move, the exraordinary trick they seemed to do for our amusement, and the fact that during all this menuveuring they did not make one sound. they were completely silent. the objects did not seem to be illuminated, just white in color against the night sky. it was a very peaceful and pleasant experience and i felt a little proud to have witnessed it. i have told very few people of this incident over the years, simply because it is not something i would have believed myself have i not seen it with my own two eyes. anyhow, that was my only ufo experience, yet one of the most interesting experiences of my life.

vehicle.  i happen to look to my right across the lake and saw a bright light below the tree line.  the object did not blink nor did it move or make a noise.  i walked to the end of the deck as the light was unusual as there are no houses across the lake in this direction.  i got to the end of the deck when i looked to my right and then saw a second light.  again, same height, same color, same size, no noise.  i watched for a few seconds and then went into the house to prepare for work.  about 5 minutes later i came out of the house not thinking about the lights, got into my vehicle and then proceeded down the driveway towards the water when i noticed the lights once again. this time the lights appeared to be moving so i stopped and got out of the vehicle.  the two objects were now moving straight upward and were now above the tree line they remained the same distance from one another and at the same brightness.  i watched until they came to a stop they were about 8 times the size of the stars in the sky. the sky was totally cloudless.  at this point the object to my right seamed to move east while the second object appeared to be still. when the objects were in now a perpendicular position to the prior position they moved off in unison as if the first object was pulling the second.  i watched for a few minutes until they disappeared beyond the hills and headed southeast towards portland, maine.\r\n\r\nday 2 february 23rd. time 9:40 coming home from work pulled into the driveway and once again walked up to my door in total darkness.  i always look up to the sky and to my amazement i once again saw what appeared to be the same two objects appear behind my house and pass over the lake and over the hills only this time heading in a more south direction. same as before no sound, same size as before with the same brightness. i watched the two objects move in unison for about 3 minutes until they disappeared.\r\ni went into the house and went right to

looking out into our yard. last night the moon was overhead and lit up my backyard like a spotlight. but suddenly i noticed, there was a definite separate beam of light about 3 feet across coming straight down in one part of my yard. the light beam ended up moving towards one of my windows then held there about 3 feet away from it. our fruit tree in the backyard is covered in bright white flowers right now. first on the tree i saw what looked like a wave, that caught my eye, like when the heat is coming off the blacktop on a hot summer day. it obscured part of the flowers, but the other flowers and trees in yard were clearly seen. i have high end energy efficient silvered windows that block 99% of the uv so that was really weird. then i saw 2 lights in the fruit tree. little tiny like led's bright white, reminded me of when you take a flashlight and see the cat eyes looking back in reflection only much brighter. the lights were about the distance apart that eyes would be. i noticed because i wear glasses and they projected some light and they reflected off my lenses. then i saw what looked to be a projection on the white flowers on the fruit tree of a head and shoulders of a mottled brown and black reptile humanoid figure. it seemed to be mouthing words or something, no nose, reptile like folds where the nose would be, dark yellow eyes, it had a hand? with 3 claws one was bigger than the other 2, it motioned while speaking? teeth too, little points, they were white so they stood out against the color of the mouth. i couldn't hear anything, words or sounds for that matter. we have a marsh nearby and right now the frogs are mating so it is loud. i didn't even hear that when this happened. after a few minutes the beam, image and eyes disappeared. i looked outside and saw an out of place blue, white star scintallating and then it disappeared. if that star was projecting something and it hit my window from that angle then it would have hit the spot right there on my fruit tree. never saw that

around 9:15 or before 9:30pm.  i was walking\r\nto my car with three adults (wife, son & cousin) along with two of my \r\ngrandchildren (ages 2 and 5 at this time).  walking near us were other \r\ngroups of people who also were walking to their vehicles.  there were \r\npatches of clouds in the sky that somewhat resembled an old ripped-torn\r\nblanket.  the moon was slightly to the right from the direction we were \r\nwalking.  the moon was pretty bright and was more than 3/4 full.  as we \r\nwere walking, my eyes picked up on three rapidly moving lights in the sky.\r\nat this moment they were slightly to the lower right side of the moon and\r\nwas moving slightly closer in our direction but still in moving in a\r\ndirection that they stayed a good distance above and in front of us.  i\r\nhonestly could not give you an estimate of their altitude, but i do know they had to be higher than the clouds because they were also transparent\r\nbehind the clouds, and as they traveled in clearer parts of the sky.  a\r\nfew moments after first seeing them, i immediately called out to my group\r\n\"look at these lights in the sky!!!\".  but, as i was watching them move\r\naway from us, i, somewhat in an embarrassing way, said \"oh, it's not what\r\ni thought it was\".  but as i continued to watch them move further away and\r\nalmost out of sight, two sets of three lights (6 total plus the initial 3),\r\nswooped down from opposite directions and lined up on each side of the\r\ninitial three lights (totaling 9).  they appeared to have slowed down as\r\nthey lined up, side by side, and suddenly, they bolted away at an incredibly\r\nhigh rate of speed and disappeared from sight.  i've never seen anything\r\nmove as fast as these objects and when they were nearest to me, i could not\r\nhear them.  also, they continued to elevate as they disappeared from site.\r\nwhen the others sets of lights came into view, i excitedly yelled to my group\r\n\"oh my gosh! did you see that?  what was that?  i can't believe i just saw\r\nwhat i saw!!  my wife was less than 10' in front of me and she had our two \r\ngrand children on each side of her, and, my son and his cousin was probably\r\ntwo steps or 10' ahead of my wife.  from my point of view, it appeared they\r\nalso was witnessing what i was seeing, and hearing all of what i was saying\r\nfrom the point of me initially embarrassing myself telling them to look at\r\nthese lights in the sky.  but as i continued to excitedly ask them what\r\nthis was, my wife faced me and asked what i was talking about.  my son and\r\nhis cousin also did not hear me.  the other groups of people who were walk-\r\ning near us did not speak up or acknowledge any of my conversation, and\r\nsome were probably five to seven yards near me.  there was noise in the\r\nbackground, the game was just ending, people cheering and talking pretty \r\nloud, the band was playing and the loudspeaker was still in operation - \r\neven though we were now a good distance away from the stadium.  also, these\r\nlights had a bright yellowish-white color to them.  i initially tried to convince myself these three lights were just spotlights in the sky, only,\r\nthese lights did not have a beam of light emanating from the ground to them\r\nand they also seemed to be traveling independently - not fixed or attached\r\nto each other, even though they kept their distance, like in formation with\r\neach other.  it was the most incredible light show i have ever seen...\r\nwhen i arrived home around 10:35 or before 10:45pm, i called the local abc,\r\ncbs, fox & nbc television stations hoping there were reports of strange\r\nlights in the sky, and there were none.  i also called the local airport (harris-\r\nburg international airport), and they had no reports.  even though i didn't\r\nget validation that this occurred, i know what i saw, and there is no con-\r\nvincing me otherwise....  i'm willing to submit to a lie
