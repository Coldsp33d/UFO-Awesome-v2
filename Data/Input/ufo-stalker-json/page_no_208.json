it seemed to high to be a drone and was stationary for at least 20 minutes. there were times that it seemed to perhaps shift slightly, but it is unclear if that was just a perceptual distortion. there were other times i thought i saw faint lights moving either toward or away from the object. these happened very fast/fleeting. again, because of this, hard to say if this was some kind of illusion or distortion? at another point, i felt as if i could \"sense\" or see a larger object connected to the light, again, not sure if an illusion. i actually felt a bit scared at times during the event,

see what it was. we walked for around 5 minutes trying to see it but it was constantly moving. we predicted someone else was out with a drone, as it seemed too low and small to be anything similar to a plane or helicopter. after hunting for it, we managed to catch a few glimpses of it between trees or above us. it was a black and chrome disc-shaped air craft with red/orange exterior lights. we hadn't seen anything like it before so we had no idea what to assume. it seemed larger than a basketball, maybe car sized?? but we can't say for sure as it was hard to get a good look. we're certain we saw it hover above the treetops for a couple of seconds before zooming off again. that's when we lost sight of it. we could see where it went and after 10-15 minutes of searching we still had no luck. we were and still are very confused and slightly concerned as we have no idea what it was. the area where it hovered seemed discoloured, burned, and look exposed to radiation. we went home and

least five planes that had come in from the south for landing at the local airport (possibly detroit metro). i looked up and saw a light in the sky which initially seemed to not be moving in any direction, as i watched it, it began flying in a straight path south-west. at first, i thought my eyes were seeing things. as i watched this light it started making erratic movements. a typical plane could not do this. the movements were too jerky and fast at this point. it shifted it's direction to begin going more directly south. by now, i asked my husband if he could see it, because i genuinely wasn't sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me. he confirmed what i saw. by now it was still going south but in a zig zag pattern. at one point we lost sight of it. i'm sure it's possible that this was a military plane. but i would point out, we've seen those as well, however, the flight pattern doesn't seem to match that of a military jet. \r\nin terms of altitude, our best guess is that which you'd expect a jet due to the size of the light (star), but it is just a guess.\r\nadding: we watch the skies on a regular basis, mostly just watching the stars and storms. and we've lived around airports most of our lives. so this stood out from the rest.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

these objects were flying in a box formation. then i noticed that they were not actually white, but a very shiny silver and flashing a white light. at that point, i said to my daughter, \"what is that?\" as i said it, all six ufos disappeared from sight. my daughter looked and said, \"what's what?\" at this point, i decided to say, \"nevermind\" because i thought i was just seeing things. before i could say it, as my daughter and i were still looking at the skyline, the ufos rematerialized before our eyes. this was a clear day with zero cloud cover; thus, it wasn't that they had been behind a cloud. during my viewing they disappeared three times and reappeared twice. when they disappeared, they were invisible for more than just a few seconds. we eventually lost sight of them
