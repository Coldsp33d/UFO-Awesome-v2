(i am now 60 yrs.Old, and live in vermont). the address which was then 183 hillcrest blvd., is now about 560 hillcrest blvd. due to the subsequent housing development there.  i had a friend, eberhard becker who lived on harvard ln. and whose street curved around to meet with hillcrest blvd.  \r\n\r\nthe event:  i was riding my bicycle home around 4 pm. from my friend's place on harvard ln.  i saw above our house on hillcrest blvd. a silent fireball with a long 'tail' behind it, and moving at a slow rate of speed...Much slower than, say, a meteor or ball-lightning.  it actually moved as though it was being somehow controlled, exhibiting a 'flight' of sorts in its trajectory.  i was \"mesmerized\" to the point that i actually drove my bike into a large dirt-mound on the side of the road near the end of harvard ln., skinning my legs and elbow upon hitting the ground.  i stood for 4 or 5 minutes as this fireball continued towards what at the time i thought may eventually go into lake michigan.  also, being relatively close to o'hare airport, i also thought that this may have been a jet-liner which caught on fire and was going to crash.  i recall that i told my folks what i had just seen, and also the next day was intent on looking in the newspaper to see if anything had been reported, watched the local news...And, i didn't rule out that this may have been a ufo of some sort which was experiencing some serious problems.  however, i was dismayed to find that there were no reports anywhere of even so much as a sighting, let alone a crash of anykind. (!) at that point i just put what i had seen \"on-the-back-burner\"...Not thinking very much about it thereafter...But remembering it for the rest of my life as being an unusual sighting...I never forgot about it for it 'moved' me tremendously in curiosity and emotionally, and quite decisively.\r\n\r\nall this, please keep in mind, until i saw the history channel's report of the kecksburg incident, and what surely must've been what i saw...However...Unbeknowns to me at the time and subsequently, even stranger events were to unfold which are, in my minds eye now anyway, and related to the kecksburg incident, even stranger yet...And practically defy considerations of mere 'coincidence'!\r\n\r\nnow...Here comes the strange part.  in january, 1968, just over 2 years later i enlisted in the us army.  i went through boot-camp at ft. leonardwood, mo.  i became a fairly lowly clerk-typist, despite the fact that due to my excellent standing in my boot-camp and ait scores, they wanted me to go airborn rangers.  i declined.  i was told by my recruiter that he'd make sure that i would go to japan and other asian countries, which he said would also most probably include viet nam as well, as most young folks back then ended up there eventually anyway!  well, it turned out that despite the war and all, my permanent station ended up being none other than the norad radar installation at oakdale, pa. (which was the installation called to cordon-off the sight of the kecksburg incident a mere 2+ years earlier and collect all the materials there!!!) (!!!)  see where this is going? \r\n\r\n:-)  not only that, but they took me first, at the norad sight, out of my clerk-typist vocation, and told me i'd be much better off working there as a draftsman up \"on-the-hill\" in the norad radar building itself...But, as draftsman!  and...That's not all...One morning as i was walking to my post in the radar building, the brigadier general lloyd l. leech, commander of the post was walking down the hill and directly in my path.  i stopped and saluted him sharply as was required, and continued up to my station.  about a half-hour later, his general's aide was in my office, and stated that the general wanted to see me. keep in mind, i am only at this point a private first class...Not very high-up on the scale.  i thought, \"man, i must've screwed-up something...?\"  upon arriving in the general's office, i was told to go right in.  the general bid me to sit for a moment or two, which i did.  he then said...\"my specialist first class aide is about to deploy to a different assignment, and i want you to be my aide.  my aide will contact you with the details of this assignment.  i was immediately given a dod secret clearance...And became the general's aide!\r\n\r\nso anyway, in view of what i recently saw on the history channel, and stories of \"men-in-black\" keeping tabs on civilians and their progress through society and other related things...It is odd to say the least, that what i saw going through the late afternoon sky in december, 1965, and where i ended up, and the way events throughout my life unfolded relatively quickly and have continued to unfold subsequently in my life, i thought maybe someone there where you are may find this interesting, or possibly put more together where this incident at kecksburg is concerned.  i have ended up working in government jobs ever since, building nuclear submarines with a secret clearance, and now am being considered for a job with the aerospace industry and the corning corporation milling lenses for satellites, telescopes and lasers...Also for the us government.  ...And \"the 'hits' just keep on coming\", as it's said. :-)  just thought you there at mufon may find all this to be of a 'particular-type of coincidental nature'.  it sure seems that way to me.\r\n\r\nplease feel free to contact me if you feel further investigation or elaboration may be necessary.  thank you...\r\n\r\nrichard babcock","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

way to another school.  i had thirty minutes before the second school students were released, and it would only take seven or eight minutes to get there.  i was proceeding eastbound on e. contessa street in the residential area just northwest of the intersection of n. greenfield road and e. university drive when i noticed a black object or spot in the air due north of my location.  it appeared to be in the climb-out path of runway 22 of falcon field airport.  i stopped my bus in the intersection of e. contessa street and n. orlando for a better look, and determined that the object was stationary in the sky at approximately a 25 or 30-degree angle above the horizon.  it was featureless black and mostly round, though the edges were not sharply defined in my eyes.  (note:  i have a slight double-vision problem; traffic light one or two blocks away appear to be two lights side-by-side; aircraft in flight appear to have two wings or two fuselages depending on the angle at which they appear from my position.)  i could not see the double-vision effect in this case, however -- the edges of the object just appeared to be poorly defined.)  i considered the possibility that this was an inflated black garbage bag floating around and changing shape slightly, but it seemed to be locked solidly in one position, unmoving, and was too black -- i.E., it was much blacker than a distant black object should have been given the intervening hazy atmosphere.  (also, the weather was a high thin overcast.)  i continued on to n. greenfield road and turned left, or northbound.  as i drove northbound a light aircraft was observed climbing out of falcon field from my right to left and it passed apparently between me and the object, though it did not pass directly in front of the object.  the aircraft then made a climbing turn to the right, apparently passing to the west of the object.  i don't know if the pilot saw the object or not.  at the time i was monitoring 124.6-mhz, the control tower frequency of falcon field (i am a student pilot), and while i was not paying a lot of attention to the radio traffic i did not hear any excited transmissions or anything indicating the control tower personnel was aware of the object.  as i drove north at 45 mph there was an optical illusion of the object seeming to get lower on the horizon as though it was moving away from me faster than i was approaching it.  yet, when i stopped for traffic lights, the object was still unmoving and still at 25 to 30-degrees above the horizone, and had not gotten any smaller or larger, and did not appear any closer or farther away.  however, it had seemingly moved slightly to the west, so it was now north-northwest of me.  the angle above the horizon, and its size, and it degree of blackness did not change as i traveled three miles north from where i originally saw it -- in other words, i did not appear to be getting any closer to it; i was not getting under it, it's position relative to me seemed unchanging in all respects.  at one point i saw a woman standing on the curb on the east side of greenfield with a cellphone to her ear, and she was looking in the general direction of the object, but i don't know if she was looking at the object.  the intersection of n. greenfield road and e. mcdowell road was the three mile point from where i started, and as i drove the last half mile or so from there to the 202 freeway, the object did move further to the west and began to get smaller.  when i turned east on the 202 the object was north-northwest of me and getting significantly smaller.  as i proceeded east on the 202 i looked back over my left shoulder and lost sight of it as the freeway dipped into a trench, but when the freeway climbed out of the trench again i caught a glimpse over my shoulder of a very tiny black dot in the distant north-northwest.  a possibility, though i seriously doubt it:  mcdonnell-douglas manufactures the apache helicopter on the north side of falcon field and it is not unusual to see dark olive-drab and other helicopters flying patterns in the area.  it could be claimed that the object i saw was a helicopter.  i seriously doubt it, however, because 1:  i never saw any flickering of rotor blades; 2:  it was stationary at all times when i stopped at three different traffic lights, yet i never got any closer to it and the angle above the horizon never changed even as the azimuth changed more and more toward the west after i crossed mcdowell.\r\np.S.  i was a field investigator for apro in the 1970's in australia, but the last case i paid any attention to was the travis walton abduction case after i returned to the u.S.  this sighting generated in me the same feelings that caused me to eventually give up on ufo sightings:  most of them didn't make any sense:  even extraterrestrial spacecraft couldn't do what many sightings reported if they had any physicality at all.  this was more like a hole into our space from another dimension -- and that doesn't explain it either.  so, there it is, for whatever it is worth.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:12:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":22049,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4220243,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02282010-0020","longitude":-111.8282024,"occurred":1267226400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1267405158000,"summary":"A black spot stationary in the sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/22049_submitter_file1__001_A_002_DonCline.mp3"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2,"locationName":"Mesa, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:147358"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Las Vegas","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was getting ready to go to bed and was going to step out on patio to pray and give my thank you to god for blessing me with another day. i do this every night, and i always look up at the stars for at least a minute just looking at space, i have seen maybe 7-8 shooting stars or comets burning up since we moved here a year ago, there is no way it was anything like that. so i was opening the sliding glass door to step out and as i was doing this i saw a huge white light lower then a duel prop plane that staggered by earlier that night pretty sure it was a c-130, i love the military always watch nellis jets and choppers all the time when they go by. this light was by far the brightest thing i have ever seen in the sky, i could kind of see a faint light from the sphere in the center, then that was surrounded by a huge glowing halo of white light, then i stepped out and started really looking at it for about 15 seconds. at which point the whole thing looked to be zooming off into space, not decipitating or burning out, it looked to be completely staying that same size but moving out and away into space, is the best way i can describe it. it seemed as i watched it go out i saw this all the way til it was just a point of light in the sky that looked like all the stars in the sky, exept i stood there and watched it completely disappear.

the tent sleeping & i sat on the passenger side in the car to read, occasionally turning on the engine to warm up. inside light was on. all of a sudden a strong wind blew in. engine stopped & lights went out. i looked around. all looked calm. then i looked up & saw a mushy white metalic craft above the little hill i was parked next to. there were 5 or 6 dark windows on its side.  i got scared & did not leave the car.  i looked at the tent which seemed ok (next morning the main pole & 3 side pegs were out & rope was twisted tight in a counter-clockwise position). the color of the craft reminded me of mica. i felt tense & helpless & scared. i know i sensed a time loss & have no recollections.  at some time i remember looking up at the craft for a moment (several seconds) when it suddenly silently flew out of sight. then it appeared over the vast strip-mine area, bobbing into sight &  out of sight in the darkness. from a distance it appeared brighter than when it hovered over my car. it was around 6:30 am when i went to the tent & asked the boys if they heard anything. they did not. i noticed that the ground had counter-clockwise wind evidence i'd experienced.\r\n\r\ni drove to the mine office to meet a geologist from greensboro who was going to work on geology merit badge with the boys this day. while waiting i spoke to the owner & told my story. he didn't want to hear it. he thought i was nuts. when we returned to charlotte i told my wife. she thought i was nuts. a few people i told also questioned my sanity, so i kept it to myself...Until i read about george fawcette (lincolnton,nc) in a news article a couple of years later who was an expert on ufo sightings. i reported the story to him by phone & learned nc has many sightings & i wasn't nuts after all. now that history & discovery channels frequently discuss the topic i don't feel like the lone ranger. i talk about it now if people are interested.\r\n\r\nbut i don't talk about my behavior after that incident...Frequent sightings of sorts & an obsession to watch the skies at night...Street lights frequently going out...A slight bump on my neck i noticed. in 1993 the bump was removed by dr. ken xxxxxx in charlotte along with a few growths in my scalp. the pathology report identified the growths but could not identify the metal removed from my neck. since that procedure nothing unusual has ever happened again & lights don't go out, i don't feel a presence or see ufo activity anymore. i definitely don't talk about it to anyone. this is the first time. one time a cynical person asked me if i felt \"special\".  no! it's random. a ufo sighting made me a believer who can't ever forget the fear of that encounter & a gnawing feeling embedded in me forever. we have a lot to learn & accept.

sister as she took batting practice. my intention was to make a short video that college softball coaches could view. i filmed many homeruns that day and as i was getting in the truck to leave, i decided to review the footage. as i was viewing one of my sister's homeruns i noticed something strange. \r\n     i filmed the ball as it hit the bat, but i lost sight of it for a moment. later i found out that this was because she hit a pop up. i moved the camera upward towards the sky and caught an object that i thought was the ball in my view. to my amazement the object took off towards the outfield extremely fast and at one point seemed to move horizontally over the light pole and over the tops of the trees across the road behind the ball field(the road is an extra 100 feet towards the trees). the object showed no signs that it was descending and flew at speeds that i've never seen an aircraft fly at.\r\n     i reviewed what i had filmed later on that night at home on a bigger screen and i found that i could prove that the object was not a softball. (it goes without saying that neither my sister nor anyone else i know could hit a ball that far.)as i examined the video, i found that i had actually captured the ball on film falling to the ground in the outfield. at this point i was baffled. i ruled out any birds or airplanes due to the fact that they did not match the speed or the shape of the object.\r\n     i eventually made the batting video and i also made a seperate video of the unidentified object. i used what tools i had on windows movie maker to create a video with slow motion clips and also a sharpened picture. interestingly enough the sharpened view seems to indicat the object gave off some type of gas or air or some other type of disturbance in the sky. i am not an expert so i am not ruling out that this could just be a side effect of the program.\r\n     i do have a video and i will be including it in my report. i have not altered the film in any way except to provide a slow motion version and a sharpened view after the raw footage. i was using a hi 8 video camcorder. the footage was filmed on an 8 millimeter tape and converted to dvd using a sony video to dvd converter and ripped from dvd using \"softwaredepo dvd ripper\". i think you will find this footage significantly interesting. \r\n     my name is joseph craig garmany. i am 19 years old and i might have witnessed a ufo. thank you for your time. i hope to hear back from you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":22039,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.3880416,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02282010-0010","longitude":-84.7957773,"occurred":1266185700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Disc,   Oval,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1267394386000,"summary":"Circular object flew over the softball field that i was on.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/22039_submitter_file1__UFO.wmv"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":13,"locationName":"Newnan, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:147367"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Niota","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My father came barreling in from work one afternoon and told my family to walk to the back of the house. he said he had left work because he had seen a huge blimp heading in the general direction of our house/property. my family and i (5 sisters and myself) walked to the back of the house and there over a big plowed field 30-40 feet from the ground was this huge, lumbering, turquoised object. it appeared to be 3-4 stories tall and probably 300 yards in diameter(circular in appearance). the circular object was making a mild humming sound. my family wasn't the only ones to see the ufo. there were cars on both sides of the road as far as the eye could see in both directions of our house. the road runs north and south and visibility was half a mile in either direction. i remember seeing the flash of camera bulbs so someone in our area has pictures. i was probably 4 to 5 years old at the time but i have verified what i've seen with my older sisters. whom tell pretty much the same story. the ufo lumbered overed the field as if it was moving in slow motion and after what seemed to be forever, disappeared out of sight. my father's work place was located on hwy. 11(runs north and south). the object was moving in an easterly direction. he said he saw smaller objects dropping out of the ufo but said the ufo was at a higher altitude when he saw it, at his place of work. our house is 20 miles from oak ridge national laboratories(ornl) and this sighting may have something to do wth the fact of that..... close proximity to a weapons grade facility. i would also like to add that our local newspaper reported the following day that it was a weather balloon. if anyone would like to research the story of the weather ballon they can search the newspaper archives. the newspaper is 'the dailey post athenian'. the time frame would be 1972-1975.

in the 80's i grew up in this house, i was 19 years old at the time being born in 1966, i have never related this sighting to anyone, and as per the usual reasons i'd be labeled crazy or stoned or on drugs! but after watching \"i know what i saw\" on the history ch. i had to relate this! i'm not exactly shure of the exact date but i know it was before the space shuttle blew up by a few months so it must have been 1985, at approx. 11:00 p.M. i was upstairs in bed looking out the window counting stars and enjoying the milky way, the night was crisp and very clear with a light wind, after a while i lit a cigarette and for some reason i decided it was too late to smoke so i put it out, within several minutes i returned looking out to the stars, and as i did i noticed what looked like a satalite moving from east to west approx. then i noticed it was bright red in color, yet it was as high in the atmosphere as satalites travel, having seen several that night, but this one was just weird, being red as a street light, so i opened the window and sat on the sill, to make shure the old victorian glass was not playing tricks on my eyes, as i watched this object travel west i then noticed another object moving east same size yet this object was blue bright blue! now i saw close encounters of the third kind as a kid in a san antonio tx. theatre as a kid and dismised ufo's as hollywood stuff although the air traffic scene sent chills down my spine, i still was a true non-beliver in ufo's. in any event as i watched this red object move towards what looked like a collision course with this blue object, i had to wipe my eyes in disbelief, was i really seeing this? then i thought it might be a product of the space program nasa ect. and as i watched these objects meet they both stopped dead still high up in the apmosphere and just stood there for about 5 seconds it looked like they had docked, and i told myself this is impossible at the speed they were moving and then just coming to a halt? after the 5 seconds of stillness they suddenly split apart at phenominal speed at oblique directions they moved so fast i could only track one so i made a decision to track the red object it flew out of sight over my house and out of sight in about 3-4 seconds! now what kind of spacecraft can do that? to this day i have never heard of something sighted or reported that matches this, if anyone at mufon can shed any light on what i saw back in 1985 i'd like to know, it has bothered me ever since, because i have tried to find a simple awnser to this and have found nothing, i'd hate to go to my grave without ever knowing what i saw that night. now there are really only 3 awnsers to what i saw, 1 it was a strange undocumented atmospheric annomly, 2 these were some sort of top secret man made craft, although i find that hard to swallow, because of their flight ablilties, 3 the big one there are not of this earth! any help on what i

was a ring of lights in a circle. it was very large, bigger than a couple houses put together. the lights were different colors, they were very bright alsmost glowing. they were in a horizontal plane above this house, just sitting there. and i said what the heck is that, well putting it nicely. my friend said i dont know. i said thats not normally there, and she said no. and i said its not making any sound. it was close enough we should have heard some sort of noise . i mean it was directly accross the street from us. i said well it cant be a balloon becuase a balloon would have fire, and would not be out at night anyway. then all of the sudden it started moving. it was almost directly over the house accross the street from us, and directly above the trees. it started moving away from us. there was no sound. it was so strange. anything that big, should have made noises, and that close. it did not move up it went sideways , horzontally. away from us. almost as if it knew we were looking at it. before it moved it was just sitting there above the trees, then it just started moving , away from us. so i said lets get in the car and chase it , and get another look, but by the time we went around the block , it was gone. i thought about calling the police, but said noone would believe us. so ive only told a few people about this, and most people say they believe me. scince this happened to me, im always watching the skys. hoping to see something again. i feel very lucky to have seen this thing, just wish i had a camera, but its forever etched in my mind.","distance":"101-500

extrmely close range + or - 200 ' \r\nthe saucer made no sound when obseved. \r\nwe observed saucer for approximately 30- 60 seconds.\r\nit was disc shaped with opposing saucers top and bottom with apparent ports? arranged around circumference in center line seperating saucer segments.\r\ncolor was what is today called champaign on autos.A polished titanium color.Rare for the time period.\r\n \r\n the location was in an area no longer public accessable approximately\r\none mile behind the old mill facility directly over the creek in the valley.This is a remote area accessable at the time by a one lane dirt road,the area had been used as public hunting at the time.\r\nwe were a group of high school friends who went there to camp for the weekend.We were all seventeen years old preparing for our senior year in high school.\r\nthere were two of us at the site at the time of the sigting.Myself and another male.\r\nwe had all gone to the site with camping gear the third member of our group left to go to a girl friends and returned after dark.\r\nwe were setting up camp appoximately between the hours of 6:30 and 7:30 pm\r\nwe had selected a site which was approximately 75' from the creek in a valley with hills behind us to the north and in front to the south.As we were setting up a loud crack( which was discovered to be tree tops breaking)startled us and we turned and looked behind us and up.The craft\r\ncame into view sliding on the tree tops bending them as it traveled.It exited the trees to cross the creek valley traveling at very low speed and traveled directly over our position slightly foreward, we were looking s.E.Direction.It made no sound.The craft was no higher than 200'\r\nfrom the ground.It was an un obstucted view as it crossed the creek valley which took between 30 and 60 seconds, it re engaged the trees on\r\nthe hill in front of us and disappeared from sight.\r\ni turned and said to don \"did you see that?\" his reply was \"yea but i'll\r\nnever admit it!\".He finally did, thirty years later.By this admission \r\ni decided to make a formal report of the very close range sighting in daylight.It was literally close enough to hit with a thown object.\r\n the craft was apporximately 100'wide.It was opposing saucer segments\r\narranged top and bottom with what appeared to be ports in semetrical spaced distances arranged around the center ,approx.Three feet apart.\r\nthe ports appeared to be clear,which enabled a view of the interior.\r\n the only object visable appeared to be a human or humanoid standing in\r\nthe foreward end of the craft , holding what appeeared to be control sticks,one in each hand.The color of the craft was a polished titanium\r\nwith no emblems.\r\n the fact that it left the trees on one side of the valley and re engauged them after crossing the open valley made it appear to be trying \r\nto avoid being sighted.We would not have seen it if it had not caused the noise of breaking the upper limbs of the trees, allerting us.As it crossed the open air above the valley it made no noise.There was no vapor trail\r\nor any sign of exaust made by conventional propulsion systems.There was no\r\nsign of plasma surrounding the craft,no visable distortion of the atmosphere surrounding the craft.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500
