through a large break in the clouds, a saturn or star like object in a stationary position. the object was a bluish and white color, very luminescent with a small tail of the same color. it then did a quick backup and shot forward, gaining momentum and wobbling. it also did a small zig zag, then came to another stop. this would not be inherent of a satellite as then it faded. i thought perhaps the clouds may have obscured the object, however, there were visible stars and planets near it. i then exited the vehicle to go into the house and felt it inappropriate to speak with the trooper because he was busy. there was also another trooper present, but i also felt it inappropriate to bother him, too.\r\n\r\nmy background is in earth and space science, hence, i am familiar with astronomical

had seen quite a bit of interesting things since the 1950's. my only reaction was that i thought it was pretty cool. my feelings after the sighting? only that it is inconceivable that we humans are

64d and noticed looking east directly over fort smith a bright triangle pattern. i am an amatuer astronomer and one of the founders of the ark/okla astronomical society which we formed in 1985. we are a very active group with public viewing events and have worked with the local media on special events or call ins about unusual sightings. i am very experienced in observing the night sky so when i saw this object i immediatly stopped the car and started doing estimates. it was about 7:40 p.M. and the lights making up the triangle shape were bright red with an apparent magnitude between jupiter and venus in intensity. the triangle shape was side ways pointing south with one light in the middle. it was about 5 degrees above the horizon and clearly visible thru the sky glow of fort smith. at about 7:50 p.M. the individual lights started to look like they were vibrating then started flashing from red to white for about a minute. the object had not moved any in all this time so i called a co- worker who lives about 22 miles to the south southwest of fort smith in cameron, ok. he immediatly saw the object due east of his house as soon as he walked out. he also was amazed how intense the red lights were and described the pattern exactly the same as i saw it. this confirmed my belief the object was far east of fort smith at an high altitude for us to both see the exact pattern shape. at this time i decided to head directly towards the object and see if i can log some miles and see if the angle changes. at about 8:00 p.M. the object blinked out for about 30 seconds and came back on but this time it made an elongated triangle pointing downward without the middle light. the whole time i had my co-worker on the phone and we were seeing these events at the same time and with the same description. at about 8:10 p.M. the objects blinked out and reappeared as a t shape with 3 exactly distanced in a row with one directly below the center. at about 8:18 p.M. the objects blinked out and reappeared except the bottom light was exactly between and below object one and two. this object would slowly drift towards underneath object one and when aligned would stop then reverse coarse until it was under object number two and then reverse back again. then at about 8:35 p.M. the objects blinked out and we didn't see them again. i had traveled 14 miles thru heavy traffic and the last sight of the object was at the intersection of hwy 22 and 96. the objects at that location still were no higher than 22 degrees above the horizon and i had covered 14 miles.  by my best calculations would have put the objects probably over mount magazine at around 26,000 feet. mt. magazine is the highest elevation between the appalachians and the rockies and would be an ideal land mark from the air. several days later i had talked to several others who saw these objects and were afraid to say anything at the time in fear of ridicule. i had contacted the local media which never responded to my question of these objects being reported and i know at this time of night hundreds had to have seen it.","distance":"Over One

(there were stadium lights on so viewing was not optimal). it did seem that it could have been some sort of a hoax. but, it appeared to be glowing with its own (rather than reflected) light. i could be wrong about this though - it wasn't long after sunset and something high enough and big enough could have produced a spectacular reflective effect. i could not estimate its altitude in those conditions however i did watch it on a transit of something like 120 degrees. it simply faded slowly from view out over the ocean in the oceanic haze. my buddy has great professional canon gear and he shot a frame with the 400mm lens. it does not reveal anything though as it appears simply as a bright dot on a black field. not sure of the transit time - it could have been one minute or two. i am aware of something called an iridium flare but am not sure what that is. could this be what we saw?

outside for some reason (taking out the trash?), looked over my home to the north and saw a bright star like object moving west to east.  i thought it was a plane at first, but the intensity of the light never varied, and there were no blinking lights as on planes.  i watched it for a minute, then noticed a smaller star like object following it.  i didn't have the impression they they were lights on a single object, but rather two independent lights.  in spite of the lack of blinking lights, i figured it to be airplanes approaching the knoxville airport, but after reading three other very similar accounts on mufon's site, the lights appear to have moved across east tennessee.  maybe they were satellites, but i'm pretty sure they were planes.  i went into the house to get my binoculars to see the objects better, went into the back yard on the north side of the house, but tree limbs blocked the view.  i went back to the front yard, but the lights were out of sight.  it seems to me they disappeared behind clouds, but i'm not 100% sure of that.\r\n\r\n  ","distance":"Over One

object pulsating far ahead off to the right..Realizing it was to bright to be a plane i couldnt understand how it was so bright being obviously sooo far away..I asked my dad if he seen it and he said yes its probably a plane or helicopter so i said \"thats awful bright dont you think\"...So im watching and watching this light as i had seen unknown objects in the sky before several times....So im glued to these lights and then what seemed like 2-3 minutes after watching it at that distance it came at us in the blink of an eye what seemed to be about half the distance now closer and for what seemed another 20-30 seconds i watched this one light.Now convinced this is something strange i continued to watch..Again in the blink of an eye the 1 light went to 2 white lights...And onlt for about 3 seconds it remained 2 lights..The 2 lights then went to a red and blueish green like ive never seen b4..The red was so bright blood red with some kind of orange in it...At this point i looked at my dad and said oh my god dad are you seeing this..And he said yes...I begged him to stop so i could get out and see better .He said exact words \"hell no\"..Ok so now these 2 lights went to the red and blue colors and was strobbing super fast unlike any strobe effects ive ever seen..And i noticed only by the flashes of strobe how it was moving around us cuz it was dark and i couldnt actualy make out a shape...Logicaly thinking i looked back at the highway to see if the road was turning or if in fact it was this ufo moving..Sure enough the road was str8 as far as i could see behind and in front of us so this thingmovd bythetime i looked back at the ufo it had yet again moved (my dad was speachless or i just dont remember him saying much only looking at it and trying to drive at the same time.. so i am now totaly convinced this is a ufo..It did 3 (what i call ) skips where it flew at least what appeared to be a 2-3 mile distance per skip it was like zoom-zoom-zoom and each zoom was a 2-3 mile distance coming to a complete stop in between skips but for only a fraction of a second it paused between skips..Now how the hell could this be a human occupied craft? the g force alone would flatten a human...Also there was absolutly no sign of jet perpulsion or fire boost rockets or nothing...After the 3rd \"skip\" i noticed it was on the direct side of vehicle about 2 city blocks away from our truck...And the red abd blue strobs went about 4-5 strobs each and i could tell it was gaining distance between each flash of the strobe and they wwere super fast strobes so the distance had to be like i said before at kleast 2 miles each time...Also i have witnessed very bright cigar shaped craft in broad daylight near st louis for approx 2 minutes slanted..Extremly huge and very far away making it in my opinion extra terestrial craft..I have seen a cluster of 6 near chicago during sunrise hours lasted nearly 10-12 minutes..As a child(my 1st sighting) i seen what then in thought was saturn or the planet with rings? i seen this in late afternoon on a school bus on the way home...Many years later after other sighting i can only speculate i had a sighting as a child bcuz you cant see saturn in the daytime from your school bus...Lol i assume the \"rings\" on what i saw was actualy a disc of some kind ? ok that was alot of typing and you probably think im crazy..Lol this is some serious stuff...We are not alone!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line
