around 9:15 p.M., i was driving south on florida's tpke. when i noticed some a light in the sky, off to my left, which caught and held my attention.  i immediately asked myself, \"what is that?\"  the light i saw was standing still, way up in the air.  i thought that it might be on a tower...But it'd have to be 200 feet up in the sky, and that didn't make sense.  so i kept glancing at it as i drove on, trying to figure out what i was seeing.\r\n\r\ni managed to see some light reflected off the object, and i made out that this huge flying object was just hovering in the sky, and the light on it was constant...It was not blinking.  i could not stop anywhere along the road...It was pitch black and it would not have been safe.  so i continued for a few more minutes, constantly checking the object...And i saw what appeared to be a black, very large, boomerang shaped aircraft, with a light, and not moving...Just hovering in the sky.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately, when i could finally stop, it was at a very well lighted service area, which prevented me from really getting a good look at the the object.  at that point, it seemed to slowly move off, but i was not able to make out the entire shape of the craft.  \r\n\r\nas i got back on the road, i noticed that there were lots of planes in the sky, also off to my left, as i was near an airport, around orlando, fl.  however, as i studied the planes and their lights, it was very clear to me that the light on the object that i saw was not at all like the lights on the planes i was now seeing.  that led me to believe that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  i had actually seen a huge, unidentified flying object in the sky.  i just wish i could have parked sooner and gotten a good look...And perhaps a snapshot.","distance":"501

[i also know i wasn't seeing the lights of an airliner head on, as i see that all the time when planes come up from california in the southern sky.] what i saw was pulsating faster than you can blink. the whole object, not just wingtip lights or anything. i know absolutely for certain that this thing was not of astronomical or atmospheric origin. what i saw was crisply observed on a clear, windless night with plenty of stars for background visual reference. i can very confidently say this thing was not a meteor, comet, star, planet, supernova/gamma ray burst, or aurora...It was not a satellite, shuttle, nor the iss or any kind of reentry burn up...It was not a plane, helicopter, blimp or balloon...So with all of those things marked off, what the hell could it possibly be? you tell me. i've never seen anything so brilliant. the lights had an almost fearful yet calming effect on me. even now a couple days later, i'm mesmerized and in awe. \r\n\r\n[i thought i should also add that there are quite a few cell towers in the general vicinity, and there have been reports of black cluster objects hovering stationary near these towers. i feel perhaps all of the transmissions sent and received by these towers attracts ufo activity.]\r\n\r\ni'd be happy to provide more details. thank you.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

video camera and within a few more seconds they were just 'gone'.(like it slowly dissappeared) i called 911 and reported strange lights in the sky and they said they would call sac and the air controller to see if they know of anything. i then decided to call ketv channel 7 (this is approximately at 9:30pm)and report it to them. when the main switchboard operator answered he said that 'many people have called in about this' and he asked me if i lived around 90th and fort and blondo area. i said 'yes'. he asked me to describe what i saw. i told him and he said that this is what all of the other callers were describing. he then said that some of the caller's were actually pulling their cars over and looking at them while they called the news station. he then said that they had sent out a reporter to try to get a video or pictures of what we were all seeing and he took my name and phone number down. i stayed up to watch all of the local news stations ( i was flipping back and forth between the2 because the olympic's was on the other) and they didn't mention anything about people calling the station or seeing these 'strange lights'. i went and got a sun morning paper right away the next morning because i was sure there would be a little 'snipit' of this event in the midlands' section-but no such luck. basically, i haven't seen or heard anything re: what these lights were. i know that they weren't 9 planes flying in a row because they were too close to each other and almost 'evenly space'. there was no noise to them, either, and no blinking lights. if this was our military, it's pretty amazing that they had 9 planes flying that close together with no noise--and there may have been more of these lights that i couldn't see because it was cloudy that night and a few could have been behind clouds. i would really just like to know what it was i saw because it has forever changed my

watched them for a short time before they dissapeared upwards through the clouds. the light was definately too big to be a light on any normal aircraft/helicopter. there was no noise that we could

longboat key fl on 53 ave headin west we all saw the lights from 34th st and 53 av back then was all cow pasture at the corner (the road went west and then went 90 deg turn to north  and connectetd to cortez rd at about 75th street or so). from 34th it looked like some big lights very low at corner(looked like the interstate lights)we thoght perhaps they installed some lighting as they have had numerous accidents at corner. but as we got closer we could see it was an arrowhead shaped vehicle about 1000 ft up maybe lower. it had 3-5 very large lights that formed a shape of a v at the front(i assume front) as we got right up on it we were stunned! it was amazing at the bottom a light would flash and i could see the bottom and it wasnt like any airplane it was kinda boxy with texture not sleek and smooth, no faa lights and it never moved(from what we could tell) we were a little to the south of it but we were very close(probably throw a rock and hit it). we rolled the windows  down and was drivin at about 10 mph no one else on road at the time thats what was freaky there was no sound ad i mean no sound not a whir clink nuthin. i have heard and seen planes gliders hot air ballons helicopters blimps and they all made some noise and they were all farther away than this object. we were freakin at this time we were sayin to each other \"are we all seein this are you seein this!!?!?\" we were scared as we were in cow pasture( cow mutilations) so we wernt about to stop. we drove the entire length of that area until it was out of sight(shortly after turning onto cortez) and it never moved. we thought we would just go home and see it on the news and it would be open for discussion. never saw a thing about it. it wasnt until i saw a show on disc channel( a few years ago) that had a report of these police in like 5 counties and what they described was nearly identical to our expeirence. i am clear it was nothing convetional. i assumed it was military as we are just south of mcdill afb and the stratigic air command sac. i dont have ay video or pics but i could probaly draw a sketch but i have recently leared of a military tr3-b and it does look a lot like that. regardless i have seen many unexplained lights in the sky and what not but this was the real deal it was low and clearly visible and close. it was wtinesed by me, my wife, my step daughter , and her fiance'. the first three are here and willing to share their expierence, and without to much effort the fourth would probably do the same. i will never forget it i doubt he will either. we aint no yuppies or fine upstanding citizens but this we saw without a doubt, no lie, no hallucination! i would love to contribute anything you thought would be helpful as we wanted to the next day but we didnt know were to go or who to tell. it is real and i belive is leading up to some very important events. i look foward to talkin to you and right now my step daughter is staying with us so we 3 are available. the fourth party we havent been in touch with for years.Please feel free to contact me carl e zahrndt, jr","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

parents for the weekend.  whilst driving up the motorway on a clear night, we noticed 2 orange lights in the sky up ahead.  i pointed them out to my other half, as i thought they were planets, as the sky was so clear, but they were very different in colour to the multitude of stars which were present.\r\n\r\nas we got closer, it became apparent that they were not planets, but were in motion, albeit, very slowly.  i figured they were perhaps aircraft, or possibly small lanterns with candles which had been set off from the ground (often done over here on november 5th for guy fawkes night).\r\n\r\nas we got even closer, my other half turned to me with a very perplexed look and asked me if i had any idea what the hell they were.  they were moving against the wind, at very slow speed, but were low enough in the sky to not be distant satellites/high flying aircraft.  they were also flying fairly close to one another (scale uncertain, but perhaps a few '00 metres apart).  as they passed over the car, they disappeared very suddenly from view, despite the clarity of view my fiance had from the car window, which further added confusion to what we were seeing.\r\n\r\nthere are no airbases round about this motorway, and the objects were very distinctive in the way they moved.  the motorway also passes very close to the scottish town of bonnybridge, which is no doubt very famous amongst the members of your group (i initially perhaps thought an overactive imagination, but there's no reason my fiance would know about the reputation of this area).\r\n\r\nmy fiance and i are both research academics at a top university in scotland - i do believe in the existence of ufo's, but my partner has always been highly sceptical - after this evening, she was extremely puzzled and a little frightened by what we had just witnessed.\r\n\r\ni do not necessarily want to state that i believe this to have been any form of space-craft, but the objects moved in a very unusual manner, and by their very definition, were definately \"unidentifiable\" despite the clarity of the evening sky!\r\n\r\nas i was driving, i have no photos to validate the sighting, but thought i

degrees and almost completely clear sky. as i was jogging i notice this enormous object directly ahead of me. i finally realize it's a giant whitish looking color triangle. im no pilot but im guessing to altitude to be 5000 ft maybe..Give or take. very low. there's 3 giant lights on the bottom. 2 red and one white. the first red one lit up so bright and then dimmed, then the 2nd red light lit up and dimmed, then the white. it repeated that cycle about every 20 seconds or so i think. 2 other ufo's were behind it. they were brighter than stars by far. they were just solid white. another solid white light was in front of the triangle. as i stood there watching this a second triangle with the red and white lights became visible and disappeared within a flash. it did this 2 or 3 times. the triangle hovered silently for approx. 5 minutes then began to gain altitude. the top of it seemed to be moving or shifting or something. it was strange. im not sure how to describe it. the lights remained still and covered most of the bottom of the craft. but the top was odd.  i watched the triangle for 12 minutes. even when it was extremely high altitude you could still see the lights flashing in sequence.It eventually got so high up i decided to get back to my run. i woulda stayed for ever, it was awesome. talk about the time not to have a video camera..Would of ended the debate for good. personally im leaning towards this being military craft, given the number of bases around this area. macdill also has some rumors of secret craft and thats approx 20 mins away. but why fly

capital and palmer in milwaukee, wi.  a friend was in a meeting with a local community organization and i decided to stay in the car to make some work related phone calls.  i had just finished up with the phone calls when i decided to step out of the car for a cigarette.  i leaned up against the driver-side door of the car facing the south as i smoked.  i noticed movement some movement to my right, and looked in that direction.  an object anywhere from 4 to 5.5 feet long oriented perpendicular to the ground like so: | was floating about 15 feet off the ground.  the object was moving from the west to the east at about 6 - 8 miles per hour with a very shallow guide slope, about 1 degree.  at first i thought that the object might be a kite cut loose from its string with how smoothly and quietly it was gliding along, until it passed underneath some power lines and a few feet later it ascended vertically by about 5 feet to clear the top of a building that it was headed for. it then moved parallel to the top of the building for about 300 feet until my view of the object became obstructed by another taller building to my left.  the object was an imperfect cylindrical shape with a few small protrusions here and there.  when i realized that the object was not a wayward kite, i thought about reports of flying humanoids.  however, the protrusions didn't seem to fit with what was described in those accounts - additionally there was a brief metallic flash as light from a lamppost reflected off of the object - this does not seem to fit with the description of flying humanoids either.  other than the brief metallic flash the object was entirely black.  the closest the object's path took it to me was about 120 feet and i was able to observe the object for about 2 minutes, so i had ample opportunity to try to identify the object and for the life of me i cannot think of anything that this object could have been.  even after going home and doing a google image search for uavs nothing i have ever seen can match up with the description of this object.  my reaction to this object was initially one of pure curiosity until after i had dropped my friend off at his place,

objects and the objects were indeed low in the sky but they were flying it seemed straight 46.831431 -122.547512 elevation about 472 feet. the things that struck me as odd was the fact that was no

a very clear night at the time.  there were many stars which i looked up to see.  as i finished my smoke, i noticed up to my left a bright star like object travel from behind the house heading east.  it was silent with no blinking lights.  i was amazed and watch but a second later, a larger light came out travelling slightly behind the smaller one.  i walked out onto the drive to see them better.  the larger one slowed down as i walked out but then kept going.  the lights were definitely not planes as there were no blinking lights.  i thought right away these were different.  as the lights got across the sky to above the trees at beginning of property, i saw a commercial plane with blinking lights coming from the northeast.  the two lights flew directly across the flight path of the plane.  not sure if you can check into what plane was in the vacinity at this time but they also must have seen the two lights.  the lights then faded into the tree line across the property.  i was very excited at what i had just seen but was disappointed i did not go into the house to get my binoculars for a better look.  i was afraid i would miss the sighting.\r\n\r\nplease check to see what the

& round (not sure if it was circular or disc-shaped); i was puzzled because it didn't look like an airplane. i kept looking back at it to be sure of this. i was very familar w/the appearances of airplanes due to growing up so near an airport. i didn't see it when it left or disappeared due to the game. i told my mother about it as soon as i got home, but she discounted it. i've wondered about it every since.\r\n(note: yrs. later when i was a teenager i saw a large,bright-orange round object in the sky at dusk that was over the same airport.  i was driving on e. wabash ave. near the intersection of wabash & brown avenues. in terre haute & quickly pulled into a parking lot to look at it longer.  although it was near sunset, this object was east from my location. i was alarmed

phenomena, etc.\r\nalso, when i was in my 30s my husband saw an round, circular silver? object on the ground or hovering just above the ground on the nw corner of the property at the intersection of
