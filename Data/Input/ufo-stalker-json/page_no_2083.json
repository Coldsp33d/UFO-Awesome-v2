our dogs, doing one of the frequently needed bathroom breaks for our new border collie puppy. \r\n\r\nthe sky was overcast with the clouds low and visible, reflecting the city lights, as is common on a winter night.\r\n\r\nwe live in clovis, close to the fresno-yosemite airport, which gets routine air traffic and also has air reserve practice a couple of times a month.\r\n\r\nwe were facing northeast.  from behind us and overhead, a pretty large, dark boomerang shape glided silently across the sky going from south to north.   about ten slowly blinking red lights echoed the object's shape.\r\n\r\nwe noticed it because it was very big and right overhead and close and had blinking lights.  it just catches your eye, that does. my daughter and i noticed it at about the same time, i think.    \r\n \r\nthe lights seemed to be positioned in the midbody along the wings, echoing  the shape of the object.\r\n\r\nthe boomerang looked like about a 120-130 degree angle.   \r\n\r\nit was going pretty slow for something that big.  like it had no stall speed.  it looked low, between us and the clouds for sure. \r\n\r\n how big?  hard to say. it was pretty big, though.  if i held my arms up, i could not have covered the shape with both my hands outspread. not even close.  maybe if i had a piece of legal sized paper, that might have covered it.\r\n\r\nmy daughter and i just looked at each other and then stared at it.  i don't remember if it went out of sight or if i just went inside.  i think it just flew off.\r\n\r\ni don't remember if we said anything at the time.  nothing memorable.  maybe something like, \"boy, what is that?\"  i felt kind of stunned.  \r\n\r\nat first i thought...What is it? and tried to find a category for it.  finding no category is a little confusing when the thing is some kind of flying craft.  seems like it should be a plane or a blimp or something we know to fly.  \r\n\r\nwe didn't say anything else at the time and we didn't talk about it.  \r\n\r\nrecently i brought it up in family conversation and my  husband asked why didn't i say anything, and i am not sure.  my daughter told about it too and said then that there were helicopters flying around awhile afterward. \r\n\r\ni sort of felt like it was being escorted somewhere.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

date of this event is subject as i am not 100 % sure but it did take place in the winter months of late 1995 to early 1996. while working in a machine shop in foxwarren manitoba at the time i was staying at a farm house 3 miles south east of town and 3 1/2 miles south of yellowhead hi way 16.  one night while watching tv i had this strange sensation come over me to get up and go outside. the sensation was very brief and i almost mistook it that my imagination was playing tricks on me. but something compelled me to put on my jacket and boots and grab a large flashlight and head out the door. \r\ni also recall hearing a light humming sound that reminded me of a train way off in the distance.  i left the house and remember it being -20 or colder at the time. i walked down the farm lane about 150 meters out onto the gravel road heading west. the sky had a cieling of about 500 feet and it was a very dark night. i looked back towards the house to see 2 very large glowing white lights. these lights where about 200 feet up from the ground and traveling straight west just over the bluff of trees behind the house,soon after that there is a large field west of the house and i got a very clear view of the objects. all i could think of at the time was ok they are not planes or helicopters, what the hell are they?  i was compelled to turn on my flash light and try and signal them but something inside me said do you think that is a good idea. being alone on the farm and yes slightly scared. i opted to just observe the lights without turning my flashlight on.\r\n\r\n they traveled beside each other and made a faint humming sound and i observed them moving very slowly straight west over the field. i would have to say the diameter of the 2 lights would be 40 to 50 feet across each.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

to the window. there was a half moon that night and no clouds. the craft was about 1000 ft in altitude and about 300 yards from shore of lake hudson. when i looked at it through the binoculars it was definitely round and had lights all around the edge of it on the bottom about a foot from the edge. they were all red except at the back where there was one white light. all the red lights would blink off then back on in counter clockwise sequence around the craft. they were spaced about two feet apart. it was definitely a metallic surface because the town lights of salina oklahoma were reflecting off the bottom of it. i could not see the top because i was under it. the craft was about 40 feet in diameter. i followed it with the binoculars till it went out of sight behind some trees. i quickly

off, and the blue light in the sky turned bright green, and then shot up in the air, a few miles i would guess. it then started doing huge loops, while flashing blue, black, blue, black. i ran inside

heading north on ne 33rd ave, the closest cross street was probably prescott. the sky was almost dark, a deep twilight blue. i saw a large, cross shaped craft fly out of the east, across my field of vision, then make a large arc and head north by west and dissapear from my view behind the trees and buildings heading east by north. as it crossed in front of my car, i looked up and saw the under-structure which appeared to be a perfectly symetrical cross shape with lights on the outer ends of the arms. as it started to make it's arc, it also banked so i could no longer see the underside. the whole event took approximately 10-15 seconds. i immediately pulled to the side of the road and called keith rowell of oregon mufon to discuss the incident.\r\n\r\nthe craft seemed to be flying lower than regular air traffic, and the night sky was very clear, with a very slight breeze blowing from north to south. the lights on the craft were red and white, i think. the red lights were blinking, but i don't recall how fast. it was hard to judge the size and height of the craft, but based on the clarity of the structual outline and the speed (it was moving very rapidly) i would say it was about the size of a large airplane and lower in the sky than most would fly in that area. \r\n\r\nwhen i got home, i was out on my porch (this is just about a mile east of the place where i sighted the craft). i was noticing the air traffic, as it seemed heavier than normal. i live very near the airport. the planes i observed from my porch (normal air traffic for the area) were very high in the sky and moved much slower than the craft i saw. they appeared very ordinary. so i felt sure that what i saw was not part of the normal air traffic or craft for that area.","distance":"101-500

received any responses so i don't expect on from you either but ill try. my first memory of them visiting me is when i was 5. i was outside on the babysitters porch dangling my feet over the edge of the porch looking around. it was the summer. and like always something told me to look in my mind and i looked down the street and at thee end of the street over top of mr ks party store was an air craft approximately 300 to 500 ft in diameter coming down the road toward me. no sound just very slowly coming straight down the road. i know they were coming for me. anyway my baby sitter was sitting behind me4 in folding chair just sitting and as i stared at it i pointed up at it coming down the road and said to jeff( can you see it) then my next memory i have is waking up in a bed in his house. there is quite a bit of missing time there and cant recall any of it until im awake the next morning. then there was the summer of very strange things that were going on every day. i believe it was when i was 18 or 19, but it lasted for about 4 months. during this time i had 23 very close encounters one within 20ft including 4 other witnesses and myself then 2 witnesses then myself. this summer i was followed every day in broad daylight by a triangular shaped aircraft. long story short it has been over 10 years since ive heard the voice tell me to look up and see them until recently. for the past 2.5 months or longer there are 2 sometimes 3 extraterrestrial aircraft the are always outside my house. now i live i live in wyoming mi and i also have a girlfriend who lives in portage mi, and there are two sets of them in both places because i have recorded them in both places and have been observed my my girlfriend in portage at the same time i was observing the behind my house in wyoming. if i ask them to do specific things in my head like move to the left they will. i have 23 minutes of them on digital video and have pictures of them on my computer and there pretty awesome if you ask me. when i was younger they wouldent let me get video of them but now they don't care if i take pictures or get video or bring people to see them. every night they are there. its easier to watch them when im out in the country here in portage. i can for sure relate 3 different events with me and my girlfriend daughter her boyfriend and my self. definite abductions in 2 of them and one event where an invisible doorway had been opened to another world not our own as the boy walked through he saw people walking around like humans walk around here only these people were different in appearance and the weird thing is is that the people saw him and they were weird ed out by the fact that he was human /he looked different then they did and his sudden appearance right in front of them once he looked around and realized where he was wasn't right he started walking backwards then all of a sudden he was back in our world. lots of other stuff but im tired of typing so if you would like to get a hold of me of it least point me toward a good hypnotherapist in my area that don't cost to much let me know. now out of the 3 pictures i gave you the spectrum of light has been altered only so you can see the true outline of the craft. im using picassa to enhance the pictures and you will want to zoom in the really see what your looking at. hope to here from you,

passed the landfill(between winnie tx.)the time was about 11:45pm. we were visiting my aunt, in icu in port arthur.\r\ni had just activated(the google navigator)on my 3g phone. i was thinking to myself how cool!, we are tracking in virtual time on a satalite map...\"this must be the way we appear from an arial view.\" at that same instant my friend who was driving,in a calm collective manner says\" see i told you that there are ufo's around here!\" i looked up, my eyes immeadiately fixated, to the top left corner of the windshield.\r\nand....Sure enough!!! there it was!!!! traveling east bound, about 200 ft above the hwy. it appeared to be pulsating a irradescent/flouresent bright rainbow color, however all of the colors displayed at the same time........\r\ni find that words are very difficult to express completely what we expireinced!!! there is just not any vocabulary that i know of that can replicate what we saw!! however, i will continue at the risk of sounding  completely out of my mind...Lol\r\nthere were three rumboid shaped pulsating objects they seemed to be seperate, but yet as one unit?!?!? silently/fluidly traveling east bound,paralell to hwy 73... i have always had a scientific curriosity....I asked my friend\"did you see that?!?!What the hell is that!!!???? four times, i also rolled all of the car windows down and i opened the sun roof. this was to reassure myself that we were'nt just seeing a reflection off of the car's glass and the fact that my friend confirmed four times that we were both seeing the same phenomina. as i opened the sun roof,never taking my eyes off of the object, i popped my head up through the sun roof,and said wow!!!! that's no reflection!!! that's a bonified ufo! that very instant, the object made an immeadiate u-turn!!!!!!!!! and now it was following us down hwy73!!! i never once left visual contact with the object. i jumped down into my seat and shouted\"they are coming!!!!They are following us!! keep in mind that this is a dark and desolate hwy at this time of the night.\r\ni kept my eye on it, while my friend was franticly speeding up to get away! i could see the same colors pulsating 100ft above the pavement behind us!!,but it seemed very different than what colors you or i are use to???!!!\r\ni was almost hypnotysed by this strange sight...That's when i realized that we were not only being folowed but, also being monitored on a level that no human/animal could even begin to comprehend!!! \r\ni could see the triangle shaped pulsating rumboids getting larger, and closer, leaving and getting smaller, and yet not moving at all?!!?!?!? well my friend, as strange as it may sound, all of this was taking place simutaneousley, my eyes and brain were not quiet sure how to process all of this together!\r\nwe became panicked and sped up to approx. 120mph. again this thing never changed perspective, of course we were speeding, but the object stayed behind us, but not ever moving?!!??!!?\r\nmy friend says to me\"stop staring at it\"!!\r\nthe object got almost to the back of my car, then i noticed a yellow/amberish colored column of light slowly coming down to the ground from the object... then the column of light became very very bright, nontransparent, and became almost like an orange fire ball. i could see the grass and the dirt flying about ,under this fireball!! i started screaming\"\"\"\"they are going to blow us up!!!!!!!\"\"\"\"\" that instanst, the object started to wobble? and the air all around it seemed to ripple as if it were h20?!?!?! then the object became one with the column of orange/yellow light, it reminded me of how mercury looks on a hard surface. and all in the same split second, the object then  became a bright large sphere, with the same pulsating colorfull pattern... i was shell shocked!!!! did i just see that take place in this demension/this planet/this whatever!!!!!  by this time i could feel a presence in my persona,,,,not anything unusual,,,no strange voices, but almost like my subconcious was suddenly in charge?!!?!I never once felt threatened in that sense, but i was subtlely able to become aware of this new/unfamilair feeling in my head?!?!\r\nsounds lunicital ,i know!!!! but like i said, there is no vocabulary that we have as a species that could come close to propperly describing these events,senses,feelings,\"phenominas\"\r\nwe continued for  for few minutes, then i noticed two cars traveling east bound were coming,after what seemed like an eternity!! i was wide eyed of course waiting to see if those cars would notice what was following us. sure enough.......They all slammed on thier brakes and pulled to the side of the road!!! at that time the object behind us, backed down and in a split second, the sphere divided into two and disapered!!!!!!\r\ni feel like someone else out there had to have seen something. if so please share. i feel a sense of isolation from people who have never expireinced these phenominas, almost like i can not communicate to them the events that took place that cold clear stary night!\r\ni cant help but look to the sky every moment i am outdoors!!!! i am still a bit \"rattled\" not threatened per say...But i have a sense that who/what ever that was, is still out there, and knows where i am and what i think before i think it!!!!!\r\nwell there you go!!! that's my first encounter/interaction with anything/one that has that magnitude of capabilities..","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

(rt. 30 and cline).  i was heading west on rt. 30, and i have a habit of looking at the sky for jet with chemtrails.  i looked up and there was a jet without a chemtrail.  out of nowhere from the south comes a big silver ball.  it was headed toward the plane.  it looked like it was going to smack right into the plane.  (i was thinking that there would have to be at least 10 miles distance between them, but i'm not an air traffic controller or pilot, so what do i know).\r\n\r\nthis silver ball was travelling pretty fast in comparison to the jet, but it passed right by it as it was traveling north.  (i knew i was right, there was some distance between them).  \r\n\r\nother than traffic in front of me, all i can see are tree lines to the north and south of rt. 30.  now from the north, the silver ball reappears!!!  i am telling the truth, so help us god.  i now pulled over on rt. 30 and autin ave.  the silver ball hit the jet!!! and continued going south.  it went past the tree line again.  at this point i thought the jet would just start spiraling out of control, but it didn't.  i don't know how much time passed - 15-30 seconds, the silver ball came back out of the south headig north and simply engulfed/encased the jet.  i wanted to run out on rt. 30 and point this out, but that would have been just as crazy as what i saw.\r\n\r\nthe next thing was pretty amazing.  this huge silver ball which just engulfed a jet - are you ready for this - turned into the biggest star i had ever seen.  september 12 around 6:30 p.M. is starting to turn to dusk.\r\ni sat there for about 5 minutes and there it sat, just shining like a huge bright star in the sky,very out of place for the time of day.  \r\n\r\ni pulled out of the parking lot of the old alaskan pipeline bar, and proceeded to the mall just a couple of blocks down to order some chinese take-out.  ran in, placed my order and ran back out to see what was going on.  the big star was still there, but now there were two smaller stars on the horizon, all three formed a triangle.  \r\n\r\ni stood against my car, trying to tell if they were falling further down the tree line.  a woman came out of one of the stores in the mall, and i asked her to take a look at this huge bright shining star (very unusual in size, but also just at dusk).  i asked her to see if she thought it was slowly falling in the sky.  she actually stood there with me for about 3-4 minutes and said that it did look like it was falling.\r\n\r\nthen i spooked her.  i said something to the effect that we should have been expecting to see this yesterday, (meaning 9/11).  can you imagine what she would have done if i told her that 10 minutes earlier this star was a huge silver ball that traveled north, then south,(hitting a jet),then north again, engulfing the jet and turning into a big bright shining star, and the 2 smaller ones weren't there originally???\r\n\r\ni then ran back in to get my take-out, headed back to the office, and thought i could view this from the second floor. couldn't see a thing.\r\nthere was nothing on the news - ever - about this event!!!!\r\n\r\nthe next day, (9/13), i went to see a neighbor who \"knows the truth is out there\", to tell him all about this, but before i could get a word out, he told me his story from the previous day.  (9/12).  it was about 11:00 a.M. and he walked out his front door.  it faces east.  he said he saw this huge silver ball and after watching it for awhile, it turned into a huge bright star.  (he watched it for about a half-hour and had to be on is way.  we live in merrillville, in.\r\n\r\nso what did we see?  did anyone else see this?  \r\n\r\nalso, will someone please tell me that what i am seeing is a satellite.  how do they move?  i have been observing this \"star\" in the sw sky for almost 5 years.  i think it's a satellite, because i see them in a lot of places in the sky.  it's just that they do \"weird\" movements.  they flash, as if signalling to each other, and when i was sitting out on my deck the first summer from 10p.M. till dawn, many a nights, every hour for about 5-7 minutes, they do weird manuveurs.  they can do great 90 degree angles, spiral down, do circles and hoops.  are those satellites?\r\n\r\nthanks","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":21923,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4864644,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02172010-0014","longitude":-87.3282439,"occurred":1038643200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Star-like,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1266478866000,"summary":"Silver ball over schereville, in.
