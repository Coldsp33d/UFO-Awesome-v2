coast of venezuela in the southernmost part of the caribbean sea.\r\n\r\ni was sitting in a waterfront home with a friend, looking at the night sky while my wife was inside in the bedroom, it was a very clear night full of stars when out of nowhere, a very bright light, resembling the headlight of a car, just suddenly appears above the horizon.  this happened in front of my eyes.  while we stood in awe and shock wondering what could that light be and just where it had come from, the light started moving up in a 45 degree angle and it was flying faster as the seconds went by.  after it reached a certain altitude, the object changed direction and it started to head our way.  as soon as it changed direction, i no longer saw one bright light, it was now three lights, with the exact same distance separated from each other, the light in the center was a white light while the right light was flashing red and the left light was flashing green.  they were flashing at a very high speed.  i knew we were not looking at an airplane. it was flying right into our direction and was flying low. as it flew almost over us i could now clearly see its shape, it was a perfect diamond, and from this angle i now saw four lights, one in every corner of the diamond plus one in the center that was brighter than those in the points.\r\n\r\nas it flew over us, i was amazed that this object was absolutely silent!!!\r\nif it would have been a plane, obviously we would have heard the loud roar of the jet engines.  i then ran in the house to get my wife, who joined me outside for further viewing.  about 20 minutes later, the object flew back from the direction it had gone earlier.  that same night, from the excitement of what we had just seen, we stayed up watching the sky until about midnight and we saw five more of these objects.  they all have one thing in common, they come from the east and fly west.  some time later, they fly back eastward from the west.\r\n\r\nsince that night on 12/25/09, we have witnessed many more recurrent ufos plus other lights that hover or levitate just over the water, say 3-4 ft over the surface.  these light shows are very amazing and impressive, as up to sixteen lights gather over the sea and flash, change colors, shapes....All in what i think is a constant communication with each other.\r\n\r\nthese events are taking place almost in a daily basis, i am urgently contacting your organization to invite you to come here and document these   truly amazing events for yourselves.  i can take you to the sites for the best viewing at the best viewing times.  i am very serious and i am not interested in wasting your time nor mine. \r\n\r\nplease contact me as soon as possible.  if i do not hear from you within 48 hours i will contact you by telephone.  i really need you to document what is happening here, and as i said before, this is happening almost every night.  \r\n\r\nthank you for your prompt attention to this very important matter. \r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nthomas colmenares","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

in part i think because of the spinning and inability to focus my vision - and both my arms were numb as if they had been \"asleep\" and were now slowly and painfully \"waking up\".  i then started rationalizing because of the arm numbness that perhaps i was having some sort of heart attack or something and i tried my best to calm my mind down.\r\n\r\nwhen the dizziness subsided a bit i was able to get myself up into a seated position. i was feeling very nauseous and thought i'd better get downstairs in case i was going to be sick. movement was still difficult though. at that point i looked up (our bedroom is at the top of the house and there is a big window in the slanted part of the roof right above the bed) and saw this - for lack of a better description - spaceship that seemed to be just \"parked\" in the air about 50-100 meters above my house. from what i saw of it it was huge - i couldn't see the sides of it - and it was dark and there was a very bright pale green rectangular panel of light that was shining, although not like a beam, down on me.  there was no noise coming from it at all.  the strange thing was that as i was staring up at it, it seemed to be emanating the thought, \"this is nothing, don't look here. it's nothing\".   whether the \"ship\" really was projecting that thought or whether i was just experiencing a very human reaction to something one can't wrap one's mind around, i couldn't tell you for sure. but my experience of it was that it was sending the thought out to me. i could tell it was focused on me and \"looking\" at me - and i suddenly became aware of a feeling that i wasn't supposed to have awakened so quickly and for some reason at that point i became afraid. it wasn't a fear like \"these people are evil\", but rather it seemed to be a very primitive fear of something that was very outside my realm of experience. \r\n\r\nthroughout all of this my husband was asleep next to me. i really don't know why i didn't think to wake him up. i think maybe it was a combination of the extreme nausea and incomprehension of what was happening.\r\n\r\ni made my way downstairs and it was at that point that i saw that it was just before 4:00 am. i had a bit of bread to try to settle my stomach but the dizziness, while it abated a bit, didn't completely go away for another 2 or 3 days.  i sat downstairs going through everything in my mind and i was sort of trying to convince myself that it didn't happen. then a few hours later my husband came downstairs and the first thing he said was, \"something very strange happened last night\" and he proceeded to describe the same ship, the light (which he felt was somehow also \"inside\" the room), and the feeling of \"this is nothing, don't look at it\" coming from the ship. he had noticed i was gone (i'm assuming this is after i'd gone downstairs) then had gone back to sleep.\r\n\r\nbefore this happened i was never particularly interested in ufos or aliens. i had an open mind about it but it didn't particularly matter to me and i thought people who talked about encounters were mostly just attention seekers. well this experience has changed everything. whether i was \"abducted\", i have no idea. but i do feel as if i'm waiting for \"them\" to visit again. my husband and i have got into the habit of gazing up at the sky before we go to sleep and in the weeks after this event we saw several strange things there. we saw a strangely-shaped thing with multicolored lights flying in an odd formation and we've seen several times things that almost look like stars but they are moving - not in a straight line like an aircraft or a comet, but sort of all over the place like an insect.\r\n\r\nsomething else: that night when i went downstairs i had this incredibly happy feeling come over me as if \"someone\" were telling me not to be afraid and that everything was going to be alright. that feeling has stayed with me since this incident. i feel like whoever \"they\" are, the fact that they are here is a good thing. i don't feel any evil about it at all.\r\n\r\nps.  i've ticked the box to not agree to release this information to third parties because i'd like to know who those third parties would be first. i feel rather guarded about who i tell this experience to.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\njcs","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":21912,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.05665,"location":null,"logNumber":"BE-02172010-0003","longitude":3.72,"occurred":1248678000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Flemish Region","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1266449137000,"summary":"I saw the underneath part -

pink/red light caught my attention out the window. at first i thought it may have been the light from the crane that is in that direction but when i noticed it moving i rushed outside into the back garden to take a closer look. \r\n\r\ni was suprised to see a black round/disc shaped craft that had what looked like a pink/red spotlight that moved about from top, bottom and either sides of the craft (which was about the size of a large helicopter). this i thought was highly strange. there was no sound coming from the craft and was at low altitude, lower that the helicopters normally fly in this area. at first it was heading north in my direction whilst moving its spotlight around. then it changed direction and began moving east at a steady speed. i began fiming after a few seconds as luckily i had a digital camera with a video function in my pocket. \r\n\r\nafter about 30 seconds the craft turned the pink/red light off and i could clearly see the blackness of the craft. my heart was pounding in my chest at this point. it started to pick up speed and i lost sight of it behind the rooftops up the hill. this sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes. \r\n\r\ni ran inside to show my sister the footage then headed back outside and spotted another craft travelling the same path (in a northely direction) 5-10 minutes after the first one i saw. this one had the same behaviour as the first and i decided to use the flash on my camera to try and get their attention. (they were low down underneath cloud cover) after the first flash from my camera they dimmed the pink/red light down, then after the second flash they turned the light off completely and the black object seemed to increase in size, (maybe lowering altitude?) it hovered stationary for no more than 5 seconds, then began heading south in the oposite direction. i ran after it but lost sight of it after i went inside to grab my coat. a truelly memorable evening!\r\n\r\ni have footage of both crafts although the first one was the only one that turned out visible when i watched them back on the

admiring the beautiful night sky. there were clouds, but very high up. it was windy, from the northwest. my friend first noticed three configurations of five red lights each, steady and not blinking. they were close to a mile up in altitude, and some distance away, over new hampshire on the east side of the connecticut river. we were situated near the top of cobb hill with a clear view of the area in which these lights appeared to be situated. the groups were far apart, at least fifty to a hundred yards. they were positioned one over the other, but not in a straight line, the middle group being to the right of a straight line between the top and bottom groups. what was noticeable was that the lights did not move relative to the ground or relative to each other for close to five minutes; they just hung there in the air. i left my friend and went inside to get the others in our group. by the time i returned, probably twenty seconds later, my friend said that the lights just left almost instantly just before we had come outside.\r\nwe speculated as to what the lights might have been. they were much too high to be something tethered to the ground. if they were aircraft or helicopters they would have moved, at least relative to each other. they were too far apart to be lights from the same vessel of any kind. we could not come up with a reasonable explanation. \r\nthe sighting was not frightening, but puzzling. neither my friend nor i have ever seen or reported a sighting of any kind before. i don't drink and he had had less than one beer. neither of us uses drugs nor is either of us on any kind of suspect medication that might have affected our senses or perceptions, and we saw exactly the same thing.","distance":"Over One

mother was driving myself to school and had two of her work friends in the car also, we where driving east to south east from the small township of cumnock towards orange, a much larger country city in central west new south wales, australia. i was in the rear seat behind mum who was driving, the ufo was on the right side of the car as we drove past so i had a clear view.\r\nwe where about halfway between the township of molong and orange when i noticed in the distance a glow on the side of a small hill, at first i thought it was the sun refecting of a new tin roof but i had not noticed it before so looked out of place, it was very visible to west bound traffic and would have had anyones attention. \r\nas we drove closer to and rounded the bend i saw this very large disc object with 3 what looked like normal human being around the ufo, one was walkiing towards the road to the fence line, i didnt say anything but looked at mum and the front passanger and both where looking in the same direction as the object but we said nothing, the passenger next to me was looking out the other window so would not have seen anything. for me i  didnt want to say anything incase they didnt see the same thing but i am sure they would have, it was easily seen by anyone in the front seat or looking to the right in the back seat going west, being only 14 i didnt think anyone would beleive what i saw so have kept quite till a few years ago.\r\ntwo of the beings, for want of a better word, where standing either side of the craft holding something as was the third being. the ufo would had to of been at least the size of a large flat bed truck, about 15 - 20 mtrs in length, it had landed next to large dead tree and was about the same hieght as the tree, approx 6-8 mtrs, it was the shape of a disc with a bulge in the middle. it had landed on the edge of the small hill the road went around so the top of it was what i had seen from a distance. i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the whole object let alone the 3 being around it. when i saw the being walking towards the fence line which ran along the side of the road i am sure we where looking at each other, i will never forget him looking at our car as we drove past. we where driving slow around the corner which gave plenty of time to take in as much as i could before loosing sight of it further up the road.\r\ni can still picture it as if i had just seen it.\r\nit was not a reflection as i first thought or a mist, i know what i saw was very real and i am sure other people driving to work in either direction would have seen the same thing, driving west it would have been seen for a lot longer from a distance, in the other direction it would not have been seen until the corner. they looked too human to be alien, it is my firm belief they where from another planet, our cars may have been a curiosity, the beings would have been around 6feet tall, maybe be a little more, when the being walked towards the fence line he was close enough to the fence for me to see he would have been close to a couple of feet taller than the fence and the others where just as tall.\r\ni since found out there was a few reports of sightings around 1972 about the same time of year. i was going to school in orange from 1971 to 1972, but am sure it was 1972 and with the cooler weather i am thinking it would have been around march to april. at the time i was in very good health with no sight, hearing problems.","distance":"21-100

get it honey im right here.(still inside)  i heard the car door shut and he came running in saying he saw 4 lights in the sky that look like a ufo.  always being a believer, i still was like sure hhoney lets go look.  i stood there in shock trying to come up with another explanation of what i was seeing.  i couldnt see details because it wass enclosed in a cloud of mist or something, way to low to be a cloud.  it was very low what seemed to be maybe 40 ft, but probably more.  i saw 4 big lights shining from within the mist.  they were 4 different colors.  the shade of color coming through the clouds was blue pink green clear.  this object was of considerable size and just hovered silently over my neighbors house. i began to feel a sense of unknowing fear because my son was still outside with me. i grabbed his arm and pulled him inside still in a state of i guess shock.  it was a very strange feeling and even stranger i didnt react the way i thought i would if i had seen something like that.  i came inside told my boyfriend to look but didnt take me seriously a brushed it off.  not a believer. i then just remember sitting on the couch scared and peeking out my side door to see if it was there.  im guessing it remained for probably another ten minutes.  i amshocked that i never picked up the phone to call my dad who probably would have drove over to see.  i get a weird feeling of just kinda blanking out.  even stranger, i didnt remember to tell anyone for a couple of days, which is very strange for me!  my neighbors were retired nuns who had lived there for years.  i never asked them about it out of embarrassment, but wish i had.  i noticed some injuries that they said was a surgery, but it was odd that they up and moved back to their perish.  i wish i would have said something to them because it drives me crazy not knowing now.  dont have any memory of the rest of the night.  its like it escaped my mind until a couple days later when my boyfriend was making fun of what i said i saw and then i felt really weird, like how could i forget something like that.  this is an issue that i have been drawn to my whole life.  more of an obsession, now that i have actually seen one, i cant stop thinking about all the mysteries of this world.  i must know the truth!  i hope we have answers

very slowly in a south east direction,the sky was partly cloudy,the lights were nearly motionless,they than began forming what i would call geometric patterns,they formed in a circle revolving in a counter clock wise motion then forming in a straight line and again revolving in a counter clock wise movement with the center object acting as a hub.One of the lights then took off to the south horizon at an unbelivle speed it remained there for a moment then returned again at a fantastic speed to the other two lights they again resumed to go into the aformentioned patterns.I observed this for about five minuets,i belived the entire sighting lasted for app.Half an hour.I was not sure what to think as i have not seen anything like this in my life(nor have i since)i recall thinking the world as we know it will never be the same again.There were bullitens issued on a major t.V. station requesting viewers to please not call the station as their switch boards were jammed with reports,adding they had no information on these lights,but would report when they did.There were no following reports,until a few days later in a very short article burried deep in the paper stateing that the lights were the results of a gas experment that took place in new jersey.That was all there was reported on this sighting.I was ninteen years old at the time,and blessed with 20-10

stars moving together from\r\nwest to southwest at 45 degrees just south of ursa major (big dipper). at first i thought my eye's were playing that trick created when there's nothing in the background which makes them seem to dance around. not the case \r\nhere as they moved a considerable distance in one direction then stopped then\r\nchanged orientation from one another while keeping an equal distance between them.  there also seemed to be 2 faint lights which faded in and out that appeared to be connected in some way.  it's like there's an invisible object using some sort of cloaking to either mimic a few stars traversing the sky or \r\nrendering transparent so as to see through it.  i am now reading an increase\r\non these particular sightings.  fascinating to say the least.  after close observation of at least 10 of these sightings in the past year, i have yet to\r\ncome to a logical explanation. last bit here, they appear to be within or very close to our atmosphere as i can almost make out a shape and see contour \r\nto see around whatever they are.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21888,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.9103531,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02142010-0005","longitude":-122.061003,"occurred":1266153300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1266172711000,"summary":"3

towards central london when heard a car screetching loudly outside somwhere so i  looked out the window but didnt see the car but as turned to walk away from the window i noticed a bright light pulsatin blue red and yellow (but in more of a sequence of a few blue and reds and then one yelollow and so on) in the distance above the house line, the sky was mostly clear with a couple of patches of cloud that was quite well illuminated by what i presumed to be the moon but i could noy actuall see the moon itself. straight away i realised this was like nothing i had ever seen before. the light appeared to be moving quickly directly from west to east and approx 2 miles in the distance, low altitude but above the low cloud and was still visable faintly even when it went behind the patches of cloud. the object was visable for around 45 seconds until it was finaly out of sight. as the object left sight another object appeared in a almost the samplce the previous object had appeared and then proceeded to move towards the west in the opposite direction slowly and then just vanished without moving out of site. this second object which appeared identicle to the first was only visable for around 10-15 seconds before it dissapeared. neither object made any sound and definatly were not planes or helicopters as there where no winglights front beams or tail lights just on single point of light pulsating on and off. the skies are extremly busy of this part of london a plane goes over the house every couple of minutes at low and high altitudes so am very familiar with the appearance of planes and heicopters and this was not either.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

number) the other two groups larger then they all merged back together and and near the end of the sighting, they all seemed to cluster together tightly (i'd say they were over the cupertino/saratoga hills at this point) and they faded out, hence why i think they were not luminous but reflecting the city lights.  i saw a small plane fly by, it was definetly lower in elevation, but you could see
