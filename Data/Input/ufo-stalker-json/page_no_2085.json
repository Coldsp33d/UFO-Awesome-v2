off the lights and hang around ..Flying back and forth betwwne the ocean just off the tip to the towers of a plant in salem.  there has been more activity and since the summer. it drives me crazy to see this going on..And feel that something is going on right in front of everyone. it could be some project i am unaware of but i don't think so at all.  since that time i started becomeing aware of this activity..A couple months ago i also on night had different craft follow me..At the time that was at meadow road in beverly...It followed over me down the street and back ( it had 2 like spot

a helicopter (white with blue, fairly large one), flying to the east. then i noticed nearby, to the west, just hanging in the air what appeared to be a roundish white orb, for lack of better terms. it was hard to tell how high up, but in relation to the helicopter that was leaving the area which was about regular cruising altitude you always see helicopters at when they are flying around your area, i would guess about 800 yards to 2,000 yards high? back to the pure white orb. it was bizarre, because i was really trying to perceive it as a balloon. but at the relatively low altitude that it was at, i would have expected a much sharper outline to it, as i've seen balloons rising up at around this altitude, and they look more defined. this thing was perfectly still in an absolutely clear blue sky, but it was kind of fuzzy (at times?). hard to explain. then it actually seemed to morph into two orbs right next to each other. also, it stayed absolutely stationary in the sky. i was driving about 20 miles an hour after getting out of the complex i live in, where as i was leaving, driving like 10 miles an hour, constantly watching this thing just hang there, slightly to the north and west of me. definitely not rising, just hanging above n. mission bay drive. as i turned onto that road, wanting desperately to stop, but not wanting to miss my darn appointment, now the thing is basically right over the car, enough so that i have to stick my head out of the window and look up (it still hadn't seemed to move, it's just that my direction was putting me more and more below the object). now i'm on a fairly busy road, although not much on a mid saturday. i'm glancing at other cars and drivers to see if anyone else is looking up at this thing. it was low enough to see that it was not a balloon, or if it was, it was not drifting or going up at all, just hanging there in the sun. next thing was i got to the light where i had to turn, a red light. i look up to see it again, and low and behold it has completely disappeared from site. i mean no where. i would guess that i had my eyes off it for no more than 20 seconds, tops, having to keep my eyes on the darn road, and next time i look up, seconds later it has disappeared. then i turned into the service station (about 2 miles from my house, at the most), jump out of the car and i am looking everywhere in the sky for this thing, and there is nothing at all in the sky. today in san diego we are experiencing absolutely amazing weather, by the way, absolutely clear blue sky. when i say the sky is empty, i mean no trace of this thing. if it had been a balloon, i surely would have seen it again, no way it could have gone like that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21879,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.812474,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02132010-0011","longitude":-117.2299663,"occurred":1266090000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1266103856000,"summary":"Pure

jet coming in low, under the cloud cover, making an approach. looking out the side window, i spotted a business jet coming in low -- possibly at around 1000'. as it passed i noticed an unlit,

actually registered it, though she stated she did see it. my initial impression was that there was some sort of balloon attacked to the plane, which seemed somewhat odd. you don't really use a jet as an advertising tow, and a small sphere isn't exactly an advertising banner. nor was it a drogue 'chute -- the only other thing i could think of, but which would obviously not be used on a commercial or private jet, not would it be deployed in flight.\r\n\r\nas the plane continued southwards, the object swung off to the left (eastern) side and peeled away from the jet's path, movingly to the east with a slightly upward cant. i lost sight of it at that point, due to slowing traffic in our lane requiring my attention. i was unable to locate the object when i looked back.\r\n\r\nconditions were

few minutes i noticed it did not move, then i saw a second light they moved around about 11 o'clock high then one of them came down and headed strait up and disappeared. just then as i glanced around there was this huge blimp looking object with three bright lights moving slowly. the bright lights appeared to be rotating, as it moved left to right in a slow motion, i stared at it for a while as it disappeared into some clouds on my right side. the objects to my left at 11 o'clock was clear as can be. months before that coming across hwy 29 west bound from i-35 halfway towards hwy 183 on my motorcycle at exactly 12 midnight i noticed a bright light coming fast behind me, at first i thought it was a car but coming so fast i thought this driver will not see me and may hit me at that speed. i could tell the speed as i glanced through my mirror and it was moving way too fast. this light was lighting up the whole road. as i edged towards the shoulder the light passed me about 1 o'clock high. it was almost a blinding light. i could hear like a crackling sound as it passed over me.  the fourth and only time i had seen another set of lights going north/west almost 45 minutes from santa anna there appeared in the sky a group of lights about 1 o'clock high just as they appeared they disappeared. these have been the only times i have ever seen anything like this. since then i have been curious as to what they are. i tend to beleive these were not aircrafts the way they were moving and swirling around as for the blimp like object i had never seen such brightness glancing at the blimp it almost looked metalic as it slowly disappear into some of the clouds and the light reflected that was when i noticed how large it was. this was just amazing. for some that may think only nuts report this well, i am college educated and have worked in professional fields and very competent. i do beleive in our god and savior but somehow would like to find out more of what others in the govt

and we were sitting by her mailbox when we noticed lights down the road towards the rental property she lives in on a farm here.  the lights were small, much like backup lights on a car, so we just thought that it was her landlords working on a farm truck.  we sat by the mailbox and waited a minute or so for them to come out of the road.  when after a few minutes, the lights were still there, i pulled my car up closer to the lights.  as we approached them, they backed up into the hayfield.  i had my car window rolled down to listen, as the neighbors entrance, the first on the road  is where the lights were first-on the ground and their dogs were barking and crying and howling!  we didn���t hear any motor noises from the ���farm truck��� and wondered why it backed all the way to the back of the hayfield!  then the two lights got bigger and brighter, though there was no beam.  as soon as we saw them rise up into the air, we knew it wasn���t our friends in any farm truck.  i speed up to catch up and the faster i went, the fast it went.  the , bigger now, lights went up and over the fence of the hayfield, across the farmers road, across the fence to the cow pasture and went along about 15 feet above the ground.  i was speeding at this point, faster than i would have ever driven down the road , maybe 25 mph, but couldn���t catch up.  it flew under some power lines and straight up into the air and behind  my daughter���s house where it ���hung��� there until we got into the lot in front of  her house.  \r\n\r\nwe sat in front of her house and looked up at the lights for about a minute, when they just ���poof��� went out, or the thing sped away.  we had both  front windows  of the car open by now and can verify that there was not a single sound  of any motor or of any power plant within the ufo.  and again, there was no beam of light coming in our direction or any other.  the lights were just there!\r\n\r\nwe found out the next day that our friend, the landlady of the farm had seen the lights when she came home, about 30 minutes before we did.  she saw it in the area, above the river, behind the house in about the same location that we had last seen it.  so we know that it had been hanging around for a much longer time than we saw it.\r\n\r\nwe were all  very happy to see what we know was a ufo.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

grown daughter, who was sitting right next to me in the passenger seat.  it was 7:57pm as i looked at my clock on the dashboard since what i was seeing above me,to the left of me, towards the west (thousands of ft. in the sky,) was something that i couldn't identify. it was a very clear night and these 3 objects shown very brightly which was what caught my attention. what we both saw  a moment later was what looked like 3 planes circling around each other which, in itself, was strange enough, that they were that close to each but while i sat at a traffic light a moment later (lots of traffic on this road now and couldn't pull over since i was caught up in the middle lane) watched these objects now turn themselves into a triangular shape..Sideways, to make it easier to visualize, and was so surprised at seeing them turn into a triangular pattern that i pulled into a parking lot to see more of this (and of course didn't have a camera with me, neither one of us could get a shot with a camera phone, too high in the sky) but then they seemed to disappear. we weren't scared by what we saw just amazed at this very strange \r\n \r\ni immediately drove out of the parking lot, drove my daughter home, which was another 5 mins..She lives on a rural road, very dark, wide open so you can actually get a panoramic view of the sky, and in this case, we did..The same 3 objects we had just seen were now back again, but this it was rightside up triangular pattern..We were watching them for a few mins..They didn't move just stayed in the same spot, but as we watched i caught another object passing by on my right..This was indeed closer, maybe 200 ft. high from where we were standing that we could actually see it pass going towards the east..3 white lights across, with a red light flashing directly underneath, and of course listened for any sounds coming from this object..There were no sounds, floated right past us...Heading towards the east of where we were, then disappeared..Didn't have time to get my binoculars so just watched with the naked eye..It was pretty awesome but was disappointed that i couldn't see any type of structure just the lights, but all in all it was an interesting sighting. \r\n\r\n this all happened in the span of about 15 mins...The 3 lights were still in the triangular shape but it was just too cold to be outdoors so headed

comprobar con las fechas en que yo v��� los objetos)estaba jugando avent��� el bal���n hacia arriba, cuando volti��� pude ver con la luz de la luna 3 objetos redondos o esferas en formaci���n, en mi experiencia siempre he tenido un buen razonamiento para distancias, temperaturas y velocidad y tomando de referencia la antena de celular que se encuentra a un lado de la casa los objetos sobrevolaban el area unos 350 metros e iban a unos 150 km/hr e iban en una direcci���n sur-sureste.\r\n\r\nla segunda vez que pude ver otros objetos parecidos fue en otra parte de la ciudad, los datos exactos son: septiembre de 2006 a las 5:55 am la hora que sali de mi casa para ir a la universidad,al salir de mi casa y cerrar la puerta voltie al cielo y pude observar a 5 objetos en formaci���n en una direcci���n este-sur a la misma velocidad de la anteriores este caso fue muy importante para m��� porque la distancia desde el suelo era menor unos 250 metros, las pude observar mas grandes.\r\n\r\nla tercera ocaci���n fue 2 semanas despues iba caminando por la calle que siempre ha estado oscura y se aprecia mejor el cielo, a lo lejos se ven las luces de la ciudad, iba caminando mire hacia el frente y pude ver a lo lejos una especie de burbujas que en la parte alta estaban mas concentradas y abajo habia menos se movia muy rapido yo calculo unas 200 burbujas se movian en una direcci���n similar a la anterior.\r\n\r\ny la cuarta ocaci���n fue 1 a���o despues en 2007 iba por la calle llegando a mi casa, y en el cielo pude observar un cilindro como ustedes lo catalogan girando con una luz amarilla abajo y una roja arriba, a unos 600 metros de altura, el cielo estaba despejado se podia ver muy bien pero a diferencia de los demas este se movia mucho mas r���pidopor la distancia no pude calcular esa velocidad, e iba de este-sur.\r\n\r\nposteriormente en la ciudad de puebla y cholula se pudieron observar luces rojas arriba de la piramides de la ciudad de cholula as��� como otros avistamientos, actualmente se dice que cay��� una bola de fuego en uno de los municipios de este estado.\r\n\r\nno me importa si creen esto yo se lo que v��� de hecho antes no me imaginaba nada de

discern a distinct helicopter type sound.  they they closed in close enough that i was able to determine that this was a training flight of helicopters from the jrb/nas fort worth.  i videoed the original event and can barely discern that these were aircraft from the beginning of my viewing event.\r\n\r\nthe total time for the event would have been 5 minutes for the original sighting and approximately 10 minutes for the subsequent event.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

red lights moving in formation low across the horizon.The unusual thing about this was first that they appeared to be flying in a single line formation at the same speed on the same course for as long as i could see them.Even with a great deal of private air traffic in this area i have never seen air planes flying in formation before.The second thing that stood out was a lack of white light that you would normally associate with a private air craft.I did not see any strobe or green light only red,while other aircraft were in the same vicinity and showing both red and green lights in addition to the common strobe.I was not close enough to hear any sound or determine a shape,the objects must have been at least a couple of miles away.While i cannot say this was a ufo sighting it was certainly unusual and i would like to know if any other reports have been made.","distance":"Over One

so the lights showed up well.  they looked a bit like tail lights on a car but up in the sky.  there were also some small blinking white lights that appeared when the red lights had gone off.  we saw the same lights a couple of years back, in the same spot.  do not remember the date but the time was about the same - somewhere between 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm.  when we stopped to look at the lights, they went out.  we started driving again and they came back.  our sons girlfriend, who is staying on the property, said she has been seeing the same lights.  my husband made the comment \"look how fast they are moving\".  i didn't see them move because i was alternating between the lights and making sure my husband didn't hit anything while driving and looking at the lights.  in trying to keep our 15 year old calm - we didn't make a big deal about it.  he wouldn't go back outside by himself after we got to the house.\r\n\r\nthe time before when we had seen them there were more lights, maybe 5 or 6, that just hung there then split and left in different directions.  this time i only saw 2 red
