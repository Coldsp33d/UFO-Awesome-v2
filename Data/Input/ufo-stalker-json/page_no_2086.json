States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Event location: family farm about 2 miles north west of cowley, wyoming\r\n\r\ni was a 27 year old mother of  three small children.  i was sleeping and began dreaming of an airplane, it was flying closer as the sound grew louder until it flew through the window.  the dream was so real, it startled me fully awake, then slowly came to the realization the sound was still there.  from our farm looking west, b-52 bombers could frequently be seen flying quite low in a north-south direction.  what i was hearing was consistent with a large group of low flying heavy bombers directly over our house going east to west.  \r\n\r\ni went outside and stood on the steps looking up and to the west.  it was a moonless night and the only lights were the millions of stars seen in the clear wyoming skies.  i could detect a smooth flying motion overhead moving west, and the sound remained a constant deep droning/humming sound.  i continued to watch still thinking it was a large number of large airplanes, but i was curious why they would be flying in such close formation so late at night and in the middle of nowhere. it was unusual, but thought they must be moving a fleet to the west coast following the end of the vietnam war.  \r\n\r\ni wondered how many there were as i could not distinguish individual shapes, so i began looking intently for indications of wings and lights that should be at least on the tips.  i could detect no wings, no lights, no silhouette of a wing shape.  all the while the massive object continued slowly on its westerly trajectory.  there were no lights either on the craft or in our yard to help illuminate to assist in giving a better indication of size, color, material, shape, and distance.  \r\n\r\nas i continued to watch, a large square portal came into view.  it was in the underside of the craft and illuminated with a soft florescent light.  over the years, my memory has become a little fuzzy on whether the color was green or blue, but it was a very pleasing color to the eye, not harsh and i lean to it being a pretty blue florescent.  the light made it easy for me to clearly see inside the portal.  \r\n\r\nwhat i saw was an immaculate mechanical room.  there was what looked like a large boiler with pipes connected to it.  everything was the same color, but the shapes were very distinct and familiar.  very earthly.  i continued to watch as the portal slowly moved out of sight.  it was interesting that the light was obviously very bright and illuminated a large room, but did not extend outside the craft.  after the portal passed from view, i could no longer detect where the portal was.  there was no glow of light emanating from beneath the craft.  i continued to watch, and after a few moments another portal came into view.  the light was the same and the room���s contents appeared to be identical to the first room seen.  another mechanical room, with an identical ���boiler��� and connecting pipes.  everything i could see appeared identical to the first portal.  \r\n\r\ni continued to watch trying to see any details that might be visible, but it was so dark the shape was determined more by the absence of the stars.  it was long and cylindrical, there were no sharp edges.  i had a clear view to the west for about 15 to 20 miles.  the craft was so close it shut out all of the night sky as i looked north and most of the night sky as i looked west.  it was very low, but not able to determine exactly how low, and traveling very slow, but not able to indicate how slow except that i was able to get a very good look inside the portals.  so, maybe between 5 to 15 mph.  again, there was never a change in the sound, it was a continuous deep, humming or droning sound.  i never changed my opinion about it being consistent with large airplanes flying over head.  it was flying level in a true east to west direction.  i never saw the beginning or end of the craft.  what i did see was larger than a football field, but did not see the craft in its entirety.  there were no unusual odors, no unusual wind movement, and there was no disturbance of animals (cattle, dogs, etc.) that i was aware of.  everything was silent except the sound indicated.\r\n\r\ni started to become uneasy, even a little frightened and decided to go back inside.  my children were sleeping and i was just beginning to understand that what i had been watching was very extraordinary and there was nothing in my reference that explained it.  i sat quietly in the living room, did not turn on any lights to look at a clock, and just waited for it to pass. i did not look out the window, i did not want to do anything to bring attention to myself, our home, my family.  i continued to hear the sound for sometime after i went back inside and was relieved when the sound finally ceased.   i do not remember that the sound faded away as planes would as they went into the distance, rather it just stopped and became quiet.  i do not know the total duration, but it was several minutes from the time i first became aware of the sound in a fully conscious state to when it finally ceased.  \r\n\r\ni did not tell anyone about this experience until some years later.   i looked for something that would explain what i had seen in logical terms.  i married a retired air force pilot with thousands of hours flying time and over 4 million air miles.  we attended many military air shows together, and i would look for anything that resembled what i had seen.    over the years i never saw anything remotely like what i had seen years earlier.  my husband bill was the first person i related my experience to, followed by my children after they were grown.  i have also since told a couple of my siblings.  i told my brother after he related an experience he and my mother had with light orbs following them on a deserted highway traveling late one night in wyoming.  \r\n\r\nthis is the experience i had as i remember it and choosing to report it officially while the details are clear.  it occurred on a moonless summer night, approximately 29 july 1976, probably after midnight.   i am positive of the year, the month was most likely july, but may have been june.  my young brother was in the hospital in billings montana when this occurred.  the window of possibility is indicated below.\r\n\r\n\r\nnew moon in may 1976 - 29th  - 1st quarter june 5th\r\nnew moon in june 1976 - 27th  - 1st quarter july 4th\r\nnew moon in july 1976  - 29th  - 1st quarter aug 2nd \r\n\r\n\r\ncredibility factor:  i was 27 years old at the time of the occurrence with 3 small children.  i remarried an air force officer and pilot with a distinguished career.  i am a college graduate with high honors.  my career was in finance, accounting and government finance. my work titles were assistant treasurer for a local large municipality and executive director of a consortium of cities and counties where i managed millions of $$ in federal funds, and management analyst.  i have been a long time contributing member of my community and believe, well respected. \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

a loveland, colorado business owner in his 80's, a conservative wwii vet who fought in the battle of the bulge and is the least likely person you'd think would ever try to put on a hoax. i was amazed when i brought up the subject of ufos one day and he told me his story and went to his desk and pulled out a picture he took of a formation of ufos he saw. i examined the picture and it was a genuine photo on kodak paper, obviously aged a bit but still in very good condition. with his permission i scanned it at high resolution and am including it with this report.\r\n\r\nhe recalls he was flying west with a friend near idaho falls, id, just west of yellowstone park in spring 1959, he couldn't recall the exact month. the plane he owned for years is called a \"moonie\", aviation buffs would know what type it is, and i assume that was the plane he was flying. the time was midday, he estimated it to be between noon and one o'clock.  \r\n\r\nhe said they were flying at 120 mph at about 10,000 feet when his friend commented on a formation belown them crossing an unidentified lake. after watching the objects for a few moments they realized the objects were far too big to be birds, being visible from that altitude. \r\n\r\nhe got his camera out and snapped 2 pictures, one included here and the other which i inspected which he said showed the objects banked on edge but which were virtually undetectable in the photo so i didn't include it with this report. shortly afterwards, the objects shot upwards and ascended to their altitude in a matter of seconds, circled the plane twice, shot off into the distance and were lost to sight in a few seconds. he said they looked like silvery discs with no insignia or other detail, and estimated their speed at 8-900 mph. they continued on their flight path and landed at their destination without further incident.\r\n\r\nhe did tell a few close (he thought) acquaintances but the story got out and for a time he got quite a bit of ribbing and abuse from other pilots. however at a local pilot's club meeting shortly afterward, the president of the club who had the respect of their group mentioned that if this man said what he saw then you could take it to the bank. this being 1959, a man's word carried a bit more weight than today and the abuse stopped. he never saw anything like it since but he swears the events happened as he told them.\r\n\r\ni think this is an important photo, as it's one of the few (or only) pics i've ever seen of a formation of ufos viewed from above. the objects are visible in the large photo just barely below and to the right of center. the blue area on the right is the windshield strut and the glare arc on the left is from the sun off the glass. the second photo is a closeup of the objects.

i said i dont know but it aint an aircraft.The object was moving very slowly,rotating and not gaining height speed and height remained constant throught.This was during peak hours at the station so it was busy with returning commuters and obviously two guys standing at the entrance one taking photos of the sky caused other people to look up.In the end up there was about 15 to 20 people standing watching this even the shopkeepers came out of their shops.Most people were saying ufo with the odd people saying weather balloon or aircraft.It was definatly not an aircraft and i think weather balloons are teardrop shaped and not chrome coloured and the height remained constant not rising.During the 15 mins we were watching this i took about 25 photos (some blurred) but i remained taking photos until it was gone in the distance.When i got home i downloaded the photos on my computer and was telling my wife all about it the first photo is when i got outside and is one of the first pictures i took the second picture is one taken as it was dissapearing into the distance and the third is the second picture zoomed in to reveal some strange black shapes near the object that we didnt see when the picture was taken.I would love to know peoples thoughts on this and i can be contacted at andymcnaughton@ntlworld.Com or if anyone wants to study the original photos please email me and ill send them","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21833,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.6067839,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-02092010-0005","longitude":-71.3637138,"occurred":1243563780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1265756843000,"summary":"Strange chrome coloured orb","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/21833_submitter_file1__DSC01006.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/21833_submitter_file2__DSC01023.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/21833_submitter_file3__DSC01023(1).JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":256,"locationName":"Chelmsford, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:150368"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Algona","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Paul hicks field investigator iowa. i am creating this report for the witnesses. tom said his sons were not interested in reporting. 2008, i have no info at this time on date or time. tom winkel's two sons were driving on hwy 18 in in separate cars. mark and eric. one was 1/2 hr behind the other. tom told me they were 20 miles east of algona, kossuth cty. colored lights were seen and phone camera photos were taken near britt, ia. britt is in hancock cty. so i don't know the location at this time. i have not talked to the sons yet. i have the photos on power point and can't copy. i asked tom to resend the photos as an attachment.  ph 2/9/2010 ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21832,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.0791263,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02092010-0004","longitude":-94.226029,"occurred":1196409600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1265754722000,"summary":"Colored lights along highway. multiple witnesses. photographs.

daughter noticed it and asked me what it was. i stated that i did not know. we watched it while waiting to turn right and the object continued to decrease in altitude until i was able to distinctly see the shape. it was cylindrical in nature, sort of hazy in texture is the only way i can describe it. at this time the object was approximately 100 to 1500 feet high. it had very bright lights at either end. it was moving rather erratically with in a small area of the sky. by this time i had backed my car up and parked on the side of my street. a passer by noticed me looking in the sky and what he saw was enough to make him also pull over and exit his vehicle. by this time my daughter was very upset and almost panicked, tears and all wanting badly to go home. i soothed her and got back in my car and proceeded to the gas station on the corner of bristol and memory lane with the excuse that i had to get gas. i pulled into the gas station, went to the window and informed the gas station attendant (whom i know. they are of middle eastern descent and not prone to outlandish things. they came out of the office and viewed the object with me. they stated \"oh its a balloon oh wait no its not\" at this time they exclaimed \" looked it split into two\" by this time the object had gained altitude and become motionless. at this time a plain white jet was observed by all partied flying very close to the object. the gas station guys said look at the jet. during the time that we watched this object it went from 2 lights to one very bright light, very bright. brighter than landing lights on the wheel gear of a plane. the white jet buzzed the object a total of three time all the while there was no other aircraft in the sky. by this time by daughter was totally freaked out complete with tears and shakes so i proceeded to go home. i watched the object in my rear view mirror while driving. it got brighter than pulsed several times and faded from view...

some kind of altered state, and i do not use drugs. i grabbed a wrench and ended up pulling out one of the two dental bridges i have in my mouth. the front tooth underneath this bridge was black, nacrotic, dead, and majorly infected. i located the source of my infection with no knowledge or suspition prior that this was the source. i was unordinarly calm during this whole experience, i remember feeling very strange.\r\n\r\ni began sensing a presence in my apartment. at times i would get smells of flowers, or something very rotten. my animals also reacted when i sensed this presence, the cats by going into the bath tubs and begining to scratch at the tub. a behavior i've never prior experienced them doing. and my dog would begin to cry. the hairs on my arms, and goosebumps would appear and what feels like some kind of alert altering of my nervous system.\r\n\r\ni became very sick and was throwing up all over the place. i was going to the doctors often, and have documented that i appeared in altered states, and also some phenomenon of my ears turning real red and hot. several times while sick and vomiting, i began feeling what i can only discribe as balls of light or some kind of energy going into me. i could physically feel an impact with my body, and then radiating out from where i felt impact this tingling that i had with my nde, started again and would spread out all over my body from the source of impact. the pain and vomiting would immediatley subside. many times while driving to and from the doctors i was in a heightened like state and sensed for some odd reason non-human craft in the clouds. i would literally see them hiding in the clouds, and felt there presence.\r\n\r\ni then had my first physical experience in which i still have a scar on my body. it was evening and i was alone and my left ear started getting really hot. the it becamse uncomfortably hot. i felt an alter in consciousness, like something strange happened to your nervous system. i was unnormally calm dispite the fact my ear was now literally being burnt. i looked in the mirror to find one sopt on my upper left ear was bright red and spreading heat out and literally burning through my ear. i went to the fridge and grabbed some ice, which was just melting into water and began crying. i really didn't know what to do because i've never expereinced or even seen such a thing before and whos ever heard of someone walking into the hospital with something unknown burning through their ear. that when i heard a male voice say \"don't like that heat do you\"... and not long after a female voice say \" hurry up and go home, t, t, t...\" now i'm freaking out, i grabbed a bowl of water to put my ear in and laid in my bed doing the only thing i knew to do, which was to pray for help. i then heard a male voice say \"i would love to help her\"... this was a different voice than the first, i heard what sounded like harp music and this phenomenon stopped. i still have the scar on my left ear from the burning. i've never told anyone of this.\r\n\r\ni was here alone again one evening when for the second time ever in my life, i heard male voices coming out of nowhere in my family room. it was if they were speaking together, and in some language i could not understand, it was not english. the next morning i packed my bags and got in the car and just started driving. i felt i didn't really care where i ended up so long as it wasn't in my apartment. while driving i drove into some kind of dense fog. i began to feel funny again, and began praying for the lord to light my way. my entire car filled with light and everything around me for about 10 feet. in my stomach i had the feeling you get when you ride a rollar coaster, almost a feeling of being lifted. the next thing i knew i was still driving, but it was if everything around me had changed. i remember i kept asking myself, what happened to and where were all the people an animals. as i continued driving, i witnessed now in the clouds colors, changing cloud colors, it was beautiful i remember thinking. i was unusually calm during this entire experience. while driving still that night, i witness bright blue stars in the sky that seemed to float downwards out of the sky and turn into extremely lite up vehicles in the oncoming lane. at this point i wasn't surprised just unnormally calm. i don't remember how long i was gone or driving for, i started out in indiana and ended up in kansas where i went into a church and they called my mother who flew out and drove me home. i never have fully told anyone entirely what i experienced.\r\n\r\nit was shortly after this that i was driving in south bend. i got this overwhelming feeling of love, compassion, and empathy not only for the earth but of people that swept over me. i felt funny again, and the hairs on my arms and goosebumps appeared. as i was driving and looking out something poped right in front of my face, which i can only discibe as some kind of energy vortex that took a circular prism shape, i was shaking and that tingling began all over and as i continued glancing out the window i noticed over the intersection of 23 and ironwood drive 2 hoovering bhuge balls of light probably 100 feet above traffic. i again was abnormally calm, during this whole episode. shortly after this incident, i started seeing heiroglyphics hidden in things we naturally see everyday. i have saved by picture some writing i have begun doing in what i looked up to be arrymaic and bishnupriya manupari. \r\n\r\ni don't know whats happening to me, and i can't explain everything but i have had experiences with laps in time and one other experience where i was driving and my car stalled out on the freeway, everything just stopped working. a police officer picked me up, but it all felt strange again. i was tranfered to another car as he got a call of another car going off the road in the same vacinity. i was taken by another officer to the gas station and back to my car. when i got in my car everything started up again just fine, but i had only been gone for about a 1/2 hour and it was 2 1/2 hours later when i glanced at my clock. \r\n\r\nthe last experience i can remember of significance was i was going to get in my car , to go to the doctors as this is when i was throwing up all over. my car would not start and i just knew something was in my car with me. i did not speak this only thought it, when i immediatley heard a vocal clicking sound i have never heard before, that scared the crap out of me over my left shoulder right behind me. i sreamed \"please don't hurt me\" and i felt something slam into my body and go into me from my back. as this happened i screamed, and that tingling sensation exploded from entry on my back all over my body, it took away the pain i was experiencing along with all the vomitting.\r\n\r\ni have while driving as of late still go in and out of weird states of feeling. one time i experienced all of our trees starting to die, and i felt incrediable sadness concerning the earth and our environment. the trees remained dormant in my vision for some time, until they just seemed to reappear one day when i thought i could live in a dying environment no more.\r\n\r\ni went even to a priest a few weeks back to try to talk but its easier to write this than speak it. but i did let him know that i kept smelling burning bodies, and seeing mass graves around. this appeared to me a week before haiti was hit by an earthquake, burning and burying bodies in mass. i just cried when it came out. i thought was i was sensing was going to happen here.\r\n\r\nlike i said i can't explain any of this, just thats its happening. i would say all the same under lie detector or hypnotherapy. i believe i may be an experiencer and thats not something i want very many people to know, it frightens me at times, least i frighten anyone else.\r\n\r\nthank you for listening , i'm glad i could finally get this out.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21823,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6859913,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02082010-0012","longitude":-86.2422066,"occurred":1234944000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,
