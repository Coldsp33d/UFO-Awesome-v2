to nearby pond mountain every saturday evening in the summer months to view a strange situation that nobody has ever been able to explain. pond mountain is one of the tallest peaks in the appalachian mountains and is very secluded. \r\n\r\nmy friends father was a preacher and he commonly held outdoor sermons in a field near pond mountain. the congregation spotted red lights, off in the distance, rising into space every 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nwe would go to this field every saturday night and sit in a field atop a knoll just off of the dirt road and watched the red lights rise vertically high into the night sky. they couldn't have been cars or vehicles driving up a mountain because the lights continued to rise up into the stars until they dimly faded out of sight. the lights would launch every three minutes (to the second) and would continue to do so for hours. there was no noise associated with these lights...They were just small red lights rising into space.\r\n\r\nupon returning home after one night of viewing, i was riding in a car with my friend. we topped a hill on the way back home and a huge glowing green light came out of nowhere and blinded my friends father to the point where he had to stop the car. we didn't hear any noises with the lights and the lights disappeared as quickly as they appeared. everyone was visibly shaken and my friends father turned to ask if we had seen the bright light. our hearts were pounding as we told him we had witnessed it as well. we sat and discussed what it could have possibly been (swamp gas, hunters spot lights, helicopters) but couldn't agree on what it might have been. we never returned again...As we felt endangered.\r\n\r\ni left the area upon graduating high school and returned 20 years later. i was telling one of my childhood friends of the sightings and he had something to add. he explained that he had witnessed those same lights and returned several times during daylight hours to investigate. he told me of a brick outhouse looking building just off the road in the woods near the area where we used to view the strange lights. he said he watched two u.S. government vehicles park near this small structure and the individuals would enter the outhouse and not come out for a full day. he suspected it was an elevator shaft leading to an underground facility.\r\n\r\nafter hearing what my friend had to say, i suspected it may have been a top secret military project...But i don't know.\r\n\r\nmaybe you can combine this with other stories and conclude what this mystery was/is.

inside now because the neighbors get sort of upset when dogs are barking, while looking at this object at same time. all of a sudden it stood up and could see greenish colored eyes on it. i got scared and yelled at dogs to get in now!I looked back up and this being was now flying in air towards me and flew along sideways and stared at me and flew away.I was scared and dogs were too.Next day it was back to normal.Evening came around and i was still rather shook up about the day before.About 11pm that night i took the dogs out a little earlier hoping they would sleep till morning .It was and errie feeling standing out there. i looked hard but didnt see that being across the finger from me anymore. i looked up to skies and it was very clear. so clear that the sky looked really strange .I looked harder and started to notice that there was a line of an object in sky almost the size of a football field above me in the sky .As i looked more closely i noticed that the stars on the inside of this black lining were brighter than regular stars. what i was actually seeing was a massive ship attempting to camoflauge its underbelly as the sky. i stared a little more and then a sharp instant pain entered my abdomen.I immediately felt my mind very confused and it was telling me to go back inside now or else.I cannot explain what happened at that moment .Only can tell u that 2 weeks later was in hospital with total with major complications almost dying from  massive bacterial infection) and almost died.Had to be off 2/1/2 months off of work and havent been the same since.Cant remember

back outside i tried to focus on the objects but i was to shaky so i handed them to my sons friend.We were all screaming and laughing that we couldn't believe what we were seeing.\r\nas they started to go behind the tree line we ran to the coral area in front of the house to continue watching them.One of the spheres shot off back towards the east disapearing as the other four continued steady and equal distance on to the north/west- towards  austins bergtrom airport. they slowy just disapered. right before they vanished a white prop plane was traveling near and behind them to their south. the plane must have seen them. we heard the plane but no noise from the objects.The plane seemed to have been traveling faster than the spheres.\r\nthe funny thing is one of my son's friends was a sceptic until this afternoon. he even said that he wished he a gotten a picture for the news.\r\nit is 2 hours later and we are still excited and talking about the event,especially since it was a daytime

to get some food. we took the dogs out in the back yard, and were looking at the clear skies, the stars were really bright. we stayed out for a couple of minutes, and noticed all sorts of planes, low and high altitudes, doing their normal airplane-stuff, like going places, or practicing for something. nothing unusual at all, until my wife asks, \"did you see that strobe next to orion?\" at this time, 6:40, orion was in the southeast skies, about 80��� or less. it strobed again, and i did see it, it was near orion's bow, almost directly south of us, again around 70-80��� up. it seemed blue, like a xenon strobe, so i conjectured that it was probably a high alt. airplane, going west at assumably 30-50,000 ft. my wife tells me \"it was just going the other direction though...\" as i've now seen it strobe about 4-5 times, i am noticing the path is strangely unpredictable. i tell her i am noticing its wandering as well, it has no predictable motion, and just flashes 9-10 seconds apart, like clockwork, but shows up in random nearby locations. i ran inside, grabbed the handycam and tripod, and caught the flash! by the time i'd actually gotten the camera set-up, it had moved back southeast towards orion's head (i don't know if that funny-shaped triad of stars above his shoulders is supposed to be his head, but that's where it was at this time). i thought for sure i wouldn't be able to get it, but i did! it's not too exciting, it's a 9-10 second strobe wandering around, it looks yellow on film, i had to use night shot to increase exposure, and it discolored it from how it visually appeared(blue). since i have 20 minutes of really good video, with lots of reference stars, and a sporadically stationary camera, i'll stop describing the event and let the video do the talking. here's what i think...It was not a satellite, they either move, or they don't, and this was jumping all over...I couldn't keep a close focus w/o it jumping off frame repeatedly. it was not an airplane, they can \"orbit\" at many altitudes, i see a c-130 doing it almost every night over our airport around 5-10,000 ft, sometimes reconnaisance or surveys are done this way...But this wasn't \"orbiting.\" it had no circular or straight line path, just complete randomness. not to mention, i've 'caught' airplanes flying cross-country w/our handycam, you can always see nav lights w/the strobe, even way up there. i thought maybe it could be an elaborate prank, a signal strobe hung from a balloon could maybe do that, but i'd think w/ our recent weather pattern (frontal passage), a balloon wouldn't stick around for 30 minutes w/out blowing away, or blowing up from depressurization. it wasn't a meteor, or an asteroid, i've seen hundreds, and none of them have ever taken anything but a deliberate staight-line path, and quickly. perhaps the gov't has some top-secret super-manuever craft that jumps from place to place aimlessly w/ no sound at high altitudes, but besides that being silly in function, it's not so secret w/ a bright blue strobe on it. after filming it for an exhausting 20 minutes, we decided we'd go eat our now cold fast food. my hands were getting tired chasing it back and forth across the sky anyhow. when we finished our food, i went back out and it was completely cloudy. i made a dvd of the handycam video, i'll send it in (that would take way too long to upload it).","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

was moving slow.  i would like to tell you that i was able to understand its path of direction but i lost site of the object a few times because of tall buildings and trees as i was driving. it wasn't

trees. i was around 13-14 year of age now i���m 26. i never thought in my life i would get the chance to see what i have seen that night. i have seen ufos on tv and books but never this close and the feeling of that night still in my mine to this day. i told family members but they don���t believe me. i don���t really care if they don���t because i know what i saw. i���m happy that it was me. if i could go back in time to that night i would have woke up somebody like my mom and maybe just maybe people would believe me. it happen like this... i don���t remember the exact day or year but i think it was (june of 1995). i remember it was a warm night around 2am. the first thing that i heard was a loud noise high pitch sounds (like a earthquake) with a high pitch. i thought it was an earthquake cause it did the same effect like in the movies. pics on the wall was moving and the floor was shaking. but something was different about this suddenly it stop. i felt light somehow something i my head tells me that there something over the house. i didn���t worry too much because that wake me up and i needed to pee. the sounds lasted about a min not long so i woke up and started my way to the bathroom which was about 8 feet way around the comer. as i was taking a piss i heard a scratching sound coming from outside the bathroom window there was a tree about 3 stories high and the ufo had scratched the bottom of its ship to the tip of the tree branches. that caught my attention i look up and there it was a disc like shape ufo.  the ufo had a light at the top and several lights on the side there was no sounds (nothing period) coming from it.  the thing was flowing in mid air and moving at 1-3 mph and what���s special about this was. it was searching for something.  i don���t know what but i know it was searching for something because there was an extra light on the bottom of the ship and it was moving. as the light on the bottom was moving i notice that there was spot light on the ground as big as the ufo when the light(bottom) of the ship was moving  the spot light on the ground was moving also. so i know that it was searching and not just flying by. there was no light beam coming from the ufo at all i remember for sure this was the most amazing thing i ever saw in my life.  this ufo was big about 30-35 ft wide.  the thing that shock me the most was there was no sound coming from it as it was moving away at 1-3 mph. i watch it flow away and i told myself is this real did i just saw a ufo. i been watching sighting of ufos on tv  and some are close to what i saw that night but the lights are different in a way that i don���t think it���s a real one. you can see the lights on the side of the ship. well that���s  my encounter with the ufo thanks for reading and i hope to see one more before i died.

(10:20pm est) i believe that is 9:20pm central time in texas.  the towns i can see on our maps for these mile markers are millett and gardendale, tx.  if you have anyone else call in or contact you about this sighting we would be appreciative as he is freaking out about what he thinks he actually saw as i said before, he is a non believer until now.\r\n\r\nhe thought it was an airplane until it started moving in all different directions as it got closer.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":21785,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.0203969,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02052010-0009","longitude":-102.3801456,"occurred":1265433600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,   Star-like,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1265438701000,"summary":"Saw flashing and extremely quick motion in many directions and then gone.","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Gardendale, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:150973"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lima","country":"Peru","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I���������m sorry, i could write the  story  in english but i might left important information out, that���������s why i���������d rather write in spanish.\r\n\r\nera aproximadamente mediodia, estaba en un campo descubierto, en una zona rural en las afueras de lima  capital del per���������, mi objetivo era fotografiar varios angulos de una propiedad agricola, dispare la camara cerca de 50 veces en diferentes direcciones, pues queria tener fotos panor���������micas desde diferentes ���������ngulos, conclui el trabajo y me fui a casa.\r\n\r\naqui existe la creencia que esa zona, asi como otras en el peru, es una zona caliente, es decir  que es comun ver ufos (ovnis) , yo la he visitado muchas veces sin ver nada especial, hasta que revise las fotos que tome y encontre cosas (naves, creo yo) que no vi en el momento en que dispare la camara, no habia ruido ,ni gente que me molestara, como es campo abierto no habia nada que me distrajera, ni siquiera habia nubes (estamos en pleno verano) pero lo que me parece dificil de entender es porque no pude verlas a simple vista y tampoco oir nada.\r\n\r\naparecen varios objetos (ufos) de  varias formas  en grupos de 2, 3 y 15 (dos cigarros rodeados de 12 esferas negras) las formas: esf���������ricas negras, largas tipo cigarro, o lanza, otra en forma de disco y uno con forma de pescado ( visto de perfil)  bastante rara.  sospecho que fue cuestion de suerte, pero intentare fotografiar m���������s y con mejor resolucion.\r\n\r\nles enviare solo una foto , si pueden revisarla veran en la  parte central derecha, sobre los cerros, el ovni en forma de pescado, en la siguiente toma, aparece 2 o 3 kilometros mas adelante, pero en esa misma toma aparacen dos objetos m���������s: uno directamante encima de mi y otro casi imperceptible en el fondo, el de la flotilla lo guardo para despu���������s.\r\n\r\nme parece que son gente seria, a pesar de esa razon, prefiero ir paso a paso. muchas gracias por su atencion.
