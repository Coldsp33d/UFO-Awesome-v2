(with at least one three foot smaller \"scout\" ufo. it changed our lives. hers for the worse, and i have had some terrible nightmares over the years, but i feel lucky to have had the experience. one question it answered positivly, was that i would see  it again someday. since donna and i grew up together, and i knew she was our senior valedictorian, and i was the senior class president, we had some credibility, but did not want to tell anyone. i am now on disability and plan to write a book about the whole story.  i thought the ufo was here for her, due to her high i.Q., until about five years ago when we got together for the first time in years, when she told me she knew all along that it was here for me. i guess i am the one that it suggested telepathy to and with. we both always sort of doubted what happened, a sort of denial, but every few years we go out to eat and see a movie, but the conversation inevitably ends up with us reliving that night and talking for hours about it. i am sending this report to mufon now because i recently had cancer and want to tell it before i die. i'm cancer free now, but i had a taste of mortality, and it sucks.\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21783,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.6940961,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02052010-0007","longitude":-97.3352448,"occurred":120207600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1265423634000,"summary":"Girlfriend and myself on motorcycle observed ufo observing us. had telepathic communication for hours. three foot diameter smaller orb followed 500' behind us. orange with other colored lights circling it on larger ufo.

to the right and above the constellation orion because he had seen a flash there.  sure enough, the next time it flashed i saw it as well.  a few seconds later there was a third flash.  these flashes were no brighter than the stars in orion, with the intensity seeming to vary somewhat each time. the color seem to vary each time as well.  i detected amber, green, blue and a grayish white at various times during this sighting.  my brother began counting between flashes, \"one-thousand, two-thousand, three-thousand...\" we found that the flashes were almost exactly ten seconds apart.  after many flashes i detected that the position of the flash was now changing slightly with each flash. over the course of one half hour the flash moved from a position directly in line with the three stars in orion's sword, above and to the right of orion's belt to a position still above but to the left of orion.  by this time, the brightness of the flashes was quite dim, although they were definitely still detectable. we then carried our stuff into the house, coming out about a half hour later to check on the anomaly, but the flashing was no longer goin

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am a pilot, fairly scientific and very techically inclined. the most unexplained phenomena i have ever observed follows. at the time, i was about 17yo and had been flying hang gliders for\r\nabout 5 years, was expert in meteorology, as well as very observant and knowledgeable about sky\r\nconditions. it was a very clear day, sometime between around 10:30am to perhaps 13:00, gauging from the southern altitude of the sun.\r\nthere were no cirrus clouds or any clouds of any type, and the sky was a high pressury pale blue, not bright blue, although it was quite bright. i was indoors perhaps watching tv.\r\nearly in the summer, sometime around 1976-77, my mom called me into our living room which had a large picture window on a second story with a clear view of the northern sky. i am not sure why, but she had noticed some objects (about 5?-never actually counted) that appeared fairly small to the eye at a range of what appeared to be 5-15 miles and an altitude of about 3-5,000 feet at about nnw about 5\" at arms length above the horizon. at first they appeared to be birds, because they were 'darting' about. but after watching for a minute or two, it was baffling because they were not moving in any pattern any bird could or would fly. i would estimate the objects to be possibly the size of a medium size tv(difficult to estimate), but certainly larger than seagulls. watching further, there appeared to be greyish, and metallic qualities to them. keep in mind this was over 30 years ago, but i remember it fairly clearly. i cannot remember if i actually saw reflected 'glints' from sunlight, but the appearance at the great distance was that of metal. as i recall, it appeared to be like crumpled balls of aluminum foil, but not as shiny. the distance, altitude, shape and composition was difficult to ascertain, being at some altitude in the sky with no close reference to gauge by. i do not believe they were seagulls, because that was my first impression, but there movement was far too erratic to be seagulls, and they seemed to be solid with no evidence of wings, as well as motion that seagulls could simply not accomplish.\r\nbut the pattern of movement was jerky and sometimes circular, initially suggesting birds. but further observation showed the motions to be quite unnatural. being a pilot, i considered perhaps that it was a dust devil at altitude with debris picked up from the ground. but, i dismissed this with the irregular motion which was sometimes quite linear, and sometimes with fairly high accelleration, immediately changing to a circular arc both in horizontal and up and down directions. i have seen thousands of dust devils, and many, many debris objects caught in dust devils, but the objects would move horizontally, and sometimes upwards diagonally, and sometimes in curved motions, from my vantage point several hundred feet in any direction, an possibly if my distance estimate is correct up to 1000' laterally; the motion was unnatural in that the vertical and horizontal motions were of fairly high and incredible (way beyond a seagull or debris) accelerations, beyond what a bird could accomplish and sometimes with sharp angular vector changes, which would suggest a significant direct force, but these motions were confined to an 'area' where the multiple objects stayed within a rough group, but with no apparent connectedness, except that they appeared similar and none departed from the 'group'. they also appeared to remain at a fixed altitude and did not rise or descend, but occupied an area about the size of the tip of your little finger at arm's length.\r\nthere seemed to be enough resolution that there were no wings, as that of birds observed, but that the objects were solid bodies with no moving parts, and appeared to be metal, but the shape was undeterminable. in conclusion, having observed thousands of aircraft, dust devils, birds and other things, i still cannot determine what the objects were. we discussed what we were seeing, and because it was indeterminate and difficult to focus at the distance, we became bored and stopped watching at some point. looking again in few minutes, i was unable to spot the objects again. at the distance, unless you had it pointed out to you, you would not have noticed on casual observation, because of the fairly small size against the sky. the key points are that there were multiple objects (5-9?),\r\nthe motion of the objects was very irregular, but confined to one area, and their motion had sharp changes in velocity and acceleration, and appeared metallic.\r\ni observed the objects in detail, but due to the distance, i am still puzzled as to what we observed. my mom passed away, so she can not offer testimony. i know that i definitely observed something, and any conceivable explanation in my mind does not satisfy my observation.\r\ni have not had a reputable avenue for reporting this observation, so now i submit it to your independent database of observations.\r\nsee attached sketch diagram..","distance":"Over One

airplane coming straight and that's why it seemed to be moving slow.  \r\n\r\n then i could tell it was getting closer, and i even made the comment to my husband, \"if thats an airplane it's awfully low.\"  i had looked at the clock and it said exactly 8:45. my husband i both sat and watched it and it was taking forever for it to get to us, considering it was so close to begin with...I looked back at the clock and it was 8:48 and was just getting to be almost directly over our car. my husband got out and went on inside the store (he said he thought it was strange, but he's not really interested in this kind of thing) and i sat in the car and still watched it. i rolled down the windows of the car and there was no sound at all...Even though it almost directly above the car and i could tell at this point that it was a black triangle shaped object. it was just hovering...Not making a sound, no engine noise or anything. it was really eerie to watch it just gliding along completely silent. it was still moving really slowly and as it banked (sort of like the jets do in the air shows) and got further away, i looked at the clock again and it was 8:51.  i watched it till it got far enough away that it was hard to see. it was 8:58 whenever i stopped watching. \r\n\r\n i had my cell phone with me and wanted to take a picture of it, but for one, i've never taken a picture with my cell phone and didn't want to try at that moment to figure it out. also, i was in total awe of this thing. it was so pretty and so huge. i really didn't want to stop watching it, and except for glancing at the clock a few times, i just wanted to keep watching...When it 'banked' to turn it was incredible. it was just gliding along completely silent...My husband estimated it to be

an orange sphere come from over the horizon, to the west, and travel in an easterly direction along the line of the coast. as it moved towards us it seemed to change to a south easterly heading and move out to sea. as it grew fainter another sphere appeared from the west and followed the same course. over a 25 minute period we observed 5 spheres do this and another 3 came directly overhead, from the north, heading in a south, south easterly direction and also heading out to approximately the same area of the sea. the 3 that came directly overhead made no sound and seemed to be at about the same height as a light aircraft although as it was dark it is hard to be precise. friends i have told have dismissed these objects as chinese lanterns but i do not believe this for 2 reasons: firstly, at one point i observed one of the spheres overtake another slower moving one. if these were lanterns drifting in the wind, how could one be moving so much faster than another? and secondly, the 3 that came from the north originated from a completely different direction, many many miles away from the 5 that came from the west and were travelling on a different bearing also. surely this would not happen if they were drifting in the wind? from what i saw, i believe these objects were travelling under their own power and all seemed to be heading out to the same area of the sea where they grew fainter and eventually dissapeared from view. before this experience i had no particular interest in ufo's but what i saw felt 'other worldly' and i only regret i didnt have a camera to capture it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

at night.After driving about 2 miles,i noticed a red-orange cylinder shaped object about 25 degrees above the horizon to the north.It was slowly moving in a westerly direction.Trees passing by often obscured my vision of the object.When i got to a point where i could see the object clearly,i had an idea.I stopped the truck and flashed my headlights on and off.Suddenly the object winked out and quickly came on again.I flashed my lights again and once more i got the same result.The object seemed to be about 4 miles away.I had to stop observing the object because i was about to be late for bible study.Two weeks later,which is tonight,i went to bible study,but i didn't see anything unusual in the sky.We didn't have a meeting last tuesday night.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21753,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.3666098,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02022010-0012","longitude":-88.694916,"occurred":1263955500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Mississippi","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1265178578000,"summary":"A
