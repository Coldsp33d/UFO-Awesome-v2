east direction. our first thought was an airplane, so we didn't think much of it. as it got closer, it looked as if it was flying really low for an airplane. we couldn't see any of the normal blue and red lights on it, which of course got both of us wondering what it was. i started talking about it to the guy on the phone. he said he had also seen it from his location not more than 5 minutes ago. we watched it as it passed over us thinking it might be a helicopter, but it had no sound at all coming from it. as it got a little past us it blinked from a white light to a red light that lasted for maybe two seconds and then disappeared. we have asked a couple of people if they were aware of any night missions in the area that night, but nobody from our location knows of anything. we are both in

any stereo typical unidentified craft. i couldnt see the dark/obscured circle in the middle. it seemed like it was flying using the glowing cylinders of light that were several times larger than the dark caft in the middle. the largest thing about the craft/object was the two wing-like cylinders of bright yellow/white light(this was at 8:30am the lights were brighter than the suns light). the sun was at about 35-45 degrees in the opposite direction,just starting to be seen over the trees. i was driving south down oak grove road rd. north of howell michigan. i was between marr rd and barron rd. i looked south west over the field between marr&barron. something brighter than the days light & white snow around me drew my attention upward over the field.  i will draw  a pictures using my key-board now oooo()oooo. imagine the o's are one complete cylinder of bright light. while the ()'s are the dark/obscured middle craft. it was a circle flying on wings of light basically. also the whole craft was connected as one entire craft. i know what you are thinking the picture oooo()oooo looks like a plane with wings and fuselage. with faa lights under its wings. except there was no wings at all or sound( it was very close,less than mile). and the lights where several times larger than a whole 747 passenger jets wings. the lights where yellow/white and solid, two giant long cylinders of solid light. no flahing or anything. also the conditions where clear(not a single cloud) and sunny. i cant think of a single light that would ever be that bright,with the sun as high and clear as it was. the light actually made me look up toward it immediately. with white snow on the ground and sun up,nothing shoulda given off enough light to draw ones eye to it suddenly. i saw the object for maybe 30 or more seconds before my line of view was blocked by tree's for less than 10 seconds. when i reached the next field i shoulda been able to see it over. it was gone completely. maybe the 1st angle i had seen it at was the only one it could be seen in,somehow. because not even the local mediflight helicopter could descended or flown away with such speed. i am so angry with myself for not pulling over immediately and taking pics,i was pressed for time. going to work. i live close to the local airport and know the sights and sounds of all the local air-craft. this object was much too large to even land at our local airport(small jets only). so there is no reason for any large aircraft to be flying that low in this area. it was about at close to the same angle of the sun(35-45*),except instead of south east it was south west. it wasnt higher than 2000-3000 feet,like a helicopter comming in for descent. i didnt witness the craft move at all. i had a passenger who also witnessed the object. i have never seen anybody else ever either take pics or draw a ufo that looked even remotely similar. also the ends of the \"light cylinders\" looked symetrically curved like and oval or the letter o. like something invisible was holding/containing the light. also i shoulda been able to hear a fixed wing prop/jet plane and helicopter that close. no sounds at all. the object beween the two cylinders of light was dark/shadowed. it was the shape of a perfect circle. maybe the color itself was black or very dark? no other shapes of features could be pulled of it. just the two light cylinder,enclosing the circle craft between them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21745,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.6119252,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02022010-0004","longitude":-83.9194952,"occurred":1265042100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1265144031000,"summary":"A

few months in the skys over my neighborhood in massapequa,ny. last night my friend tom and i were in his car, parked on a side street around the block from plainedge high school. we were bored and having a conversation and a bright ligh cought my eye in the passenger side mirror. i looked at it throught the mirror for a second and realized that it was not a car head light or a light on someones house. i turned around in the car and told tom and he also started watching. it was headed for us comming from our \"6\" as a pilot would say, i'd say mabey a few 100 feet in altitude. when we both confirmed with each other that this was strange we both got out of the car. this is where i'm looking for answers, the object started to bank toward the left, mind you very gracefully and silently, note how i stress the silent because as a young man who watches alot of military channel and discovery channel, and i've been to a couple air shows here on li, i've never seen something fly silently other than a glider. all of the objects i've seen in recent months are silent and it's starting to really scare me. so when it banked the 1 light turned to 3 not a v form but more of a triangle. the object kept pretty strait after the initial bank turn or i'd estimate about 20 degrees or so. the is a fair amount of ground light in the area we were but there was no real outline of the object othere than the lights and it had to be colored black and it definatly didn't have a traditional tail like most planes. i didn't take my eye off the object until it was unviewable due to tree cover, we were parked facing north and the object appeared in the south and went out of view in the north northweast. i don't think this was a traitonal aircraft unless i can be proved otherwise, i'm always open for a feasable and resonable explanation and that is why i'm contacting you. if these things i've been seeing lately aren't alien space craft then what are they. i will tell you that my neighborhood and long island in general is having a heroin epidemic, could these be dea stealths or something i am trying to be open minded but my father said that that's crazier than thinking it's aliens. i don't know what to think anymore all i want is a reply and i invite you to let me discribe in person what i'm seeing, i'm seriously thinking about buying nightvision camcorder because too many people think i'm nuts because everyone is so nieve and never allows themself to think out side the box. it's been a weekly or even multiple time a week thing for me that's why i'm starting to get scared, your help would be appreciated.  -mike from massapequa,ny","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

met the larger craft.(the larger craft was gigantic,and resembled a huge saucer with yellow lights)then i got angry with what i was seeing and i went into the woods to challenge what i was seeing,and i lost all of my memory after this,and i'm am having a hard time discerning the truth from the actual event.To my knowledge is the truth.I vaguely remember the rest of the event but to my knowledge i was able to make it back to the house,i was very tired and i remember making a phone to the rcmp to come and investigate.And i remember now that my head was in severe pain.I then went to check on the children and they were resting peacefully in my daughters bed.Then i moved the children to my room because i was scared and didn't know what was going on or what was happening.I rested with them until the rcmp arrived at around 9:30 pm that night.I gave them my report and they we're going to keep a surveillance on the house for the remainder of the night.Because i was so distraught from what i witnessed and experienced.The rcmp came with a camera and took pictures of the area where i made the sighting.The rcmp told me they believed my story so they did a perimeter check but did not enter the woods.They took pictures of the surrounding area but found nothing.Then tea and coffee we're offered to them and we conversed about the event.It seemed as though they believed me.While the rcmp were there the lights flickered on and off again.But the power was kept.And then they suggested an electrical problem.Then the rcmp returned to their vehicle,wrote up a report and left.At that moment i locked all doors and windows,took in the dog and cats and went to bed for the rest of the night.Which was around 10:30 pm that night.And that night was very quiet and nothing to my knowledge happened after that.And when i woke up and i was feeling strangely happy not knowing why.That is my story\r\nthank you\r\nthis is all true and happened in the fall of 1990 in eastern canada.Nova scotia,cape breton.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"01:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path

a ufo because i never seen anything so orange in my life.Started to pulsate a bright orange and slowly moved along the land line and then it just turned itself off.I tried to get it to turn itself back on by waving the light back on and off,and nothing so i turned the light off.Then i yelled into te air \"you not kidnapping me you evil reptile bastards\".And to my amazment i felt as if it really heard me.Then while i was heading back into the house the object reappeared for a second and moved at the same speed it came into view then dissapeared.It went over the tree lines at incredible

were too bright for a plane and wondered why a plane would be flying this far from the city as we are in the countryside surrounded by hills. i continued to watch it and all of a sudden it changed direction in a 90 degree angle. as it seemed quite low i was listening for sound but heard absolutely nothing and it is a very quiet still night. i noticed also that the lights got no dimmer as it changed direction and seemed to be the same brightness all around it. i then watched it travel very rapidly over the hills still very bright. i saw this from front, side, and the back and the lights stayed the same brightness at all angles.\r\n the moon was full and bright and situated in the northeasterly direction.\r\nthe lights on the object were brighter than the stars and it was not a reflection of the moon as the lights on the object were too bright.\r\n\r\ni was in a bit of shock after i witnessed the whole event. i then called my husband out after the event, as while i was watching the object i didn't want to move or make a sound. i was in awe as to what i had just seen and described the whole thing to my husband and we went through a list of things it could have been ie.. plane , helicopter, space debris, satellites but none of those applied as there was no noise and too low in the sky for satellites or space debris.  we both feel i just witnessed a ufo

noticed this unusual size \"star\" with a nice mag but thought nothing of it.  however, considering the brightness of the moon i took a second look through the lens of the camera.  i then took the photo.  then i picked up my binocs and looked at the \"stat\" again.  the item was brightly colored with red/blue.  but i wasn't concerned!!!  i only thought about the coating on the lenses and the possible effects it would have on the image.  maybe i missed a great opportunity.  now i think i did because i have the 8\" telescope and tripods for cameras to record this item.  i think i blew it.\r\n\r\ni picked up the camera and shot additional frames of the sky for test purposes, but i didn't shoot at the image.  my intent was to experiment with the camera and lens to actually be able to take a photo of a ufo.\r\n\r\ni cam back into the house and continued to get ready for my trip to town.  i looked up and the item was still in the same place.  but, nothing unusual because it seemed very distant.\r\n\r\ni made my errand and didn't think much about the \"star\".  \r\n\r\nlast night (jan30) i began to think about other reports and colors mentioned.  so this morning i looked at the frame again.  \r\n\r\nin the image you can see the diagonal light which indicates movement of the camera for .30 sec.  around the frame you will see other diagonal items (stars) which verify the movement.  my camera is very heavy for this kind of freehand attempt.\r\n\r\nthe original image was shot in canon raw (.Cr2).  this image is about 20meg in size so a smaller version is uploaded.\r\n\r\ndownload it, blow it up 800% and go figure!  i'm not claiming it to be unidentifiable (ufo).  i sure has the colors others have mentioned.  \r\n\r\nthis is the second report i have

middletown to go to the subway to get food when we saw what looked like 2 headlights in the air next to a radio tower on call road. we thought well thats kinda weird. as we drove by we noticed it was a shiny silver greyish triangle shaped craft with lights at the points. we drove past and it just kinda hovered there like it didnt notice. it was so close to the radio tower that it was almost against it. awww stuck we decided to drive by again a few times. the last time we drove back toward it being young and dumb i sped up and went into the oppsite lane heading toward it. when i seemed to notice that we knew it was there and we trying to get its attention. the craft started weaving and bobbing eradically in the air in a zigzag pattern and began to rise. when we turned around again the craft to of across the sky faster than anything i guarantee manmade could go. hitting the horizon in a matter of seconds. so after our fun messing with the ufo we decided to finally go eat. not really knowing what to think about what we saw. when we left the subway heading back to new middletown we could see another wet of lights above the cornfield in the initial area of the radio towers. we also noticed that there were about 30 people in the gas station parking lot sittin on their hoods and next to their cars watching the object hover in the air. it was at that point you really know your not nuts and other people see what you do. when we tried to get closer to it after leaving the gas station it moved away from the roads this time. these sightings when on for at least 3 days. no one really said anything on the radio or tv but tons of people saw them. even i skywatcher i know saw serveral of them over cities all over the area. finally after about 3 days the black silent helicopters started showing up. flying around with no lights on. the only way i even knew they were there was because you could see their outlines in the light from the nearby city. we also saw a very big craft fly over boardman in the night time. it was huge. like another sighting i read about it was the size of a shopping mall and silent. there were alot of weird things in the sly after that. large fireballs honestly it looked like the back of a star destroyer from star wars. like a row of big firey engines. those could have been fire baloons i guess after all the hype someone probably thought hey would play a joke or it was attempt to cover up the other ufo's. but i will say i get chills up my back still from thinking about this. haha, all my house lights are on now. it's scary. and even the old timer that lived by the towers said they show up once in a while. when i told him about them he said \" there back again\" they show up about ever 10 years or so hover around and then the go away again. so i still have my eyes in the sky waiting for them to come back. besides how many chances do you get to chase a ufo with your car.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

a very bright star changing colors. it kept my attention.  there were other celestial objects in the picture, planets, and probaly a star. there were even planes in the area. i live down the street from the airport and i have all my life, so i'm used to seeing aircraft of all kind.  this was different.  it was just like a star flickering different colors, frm white, red and blue. at first it seemed as though it wasn't moving, then it shifted directions going south then moving closer toward my direction.  i immediately ran upstairs to tell my neighbor to witness the event.  he came out and seen the same thing i seen.  we witnessed a triangular craft with lights on all three corners and one in the middle.  the light in the middle appeared a lite blue.  the triangular craft was flying with the two bottom angles moving foward and the  one angle on the back. each corner had a light with the one on the back glowing red.  the front two on each corner were white.  it flew over with no noise at a normal speed.  i could clearly see the triangular shape of the craft as it flew over. the object flew to the east and we lost sight of it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional
