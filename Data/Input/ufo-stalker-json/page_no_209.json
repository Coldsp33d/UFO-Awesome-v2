dog for a walk so she could pee. so i took her to the end of the street which is usually where we turn around and go back home, but it started to rain. both of us love the rain so i decided to keep going. we walked about 10 more minutes down to highland park and just sat at picnic for a while, just enjoying the rain. that was when i started feeling this weird sort of fear as if there was some predator watching me from the woods. eventually the fear grew too strong and i got up and speed walked away. from there we went down to the lagoon (a retired sewage pond which had been recently drained) and i decided to walk all the way around it but the fear still went on and getting stronger. i could have sworn something was stalking me. so i just bolted. i ran as fast as i could for as long as i could but being as fat as i am that wasn't very far. when i stopped to catch my breath i looked around to check for predators and saw nothing, until i looked up.\r\nwhen i looked up there were two triangular shaped (for lack of a better term) flying machines. they were a dark sort of hazy gray with a faintly glowing red dome on the bottom and three bright white lights coming off of each corner. the two of them circled each other in what appeared to be a very well organised. i stood still and stared at them for approximately 3 minutes (i found watching them very calming) until one of them stopped and suddenly i was engulfed in a white light. i could not see anything and i was frightened out of my whit, but then i suddenly calmed instantly (i want even out of breath anymore and the light went away and by that time both of them were gone. \r\ni thought nothing of it at first and just speed walked home, but when i got home it was 3:17 am (5 hours after i left) from my perspective i thought i had been gone maybe 45 minutes.\r\nthe next day while at work i kept getting memory flah's of being on a platform in and all white room surrounded by tall naked blond people. i also had memory flash's of of being released from the platform and trying to mingle with the tall naked blond people who i suspect to have been nordic aliens and they all looked like they were scared of me and one of there hands glowed blue and slapped me in the face. for now that's all i remember but every second day or so i get another memory flash.","distance":"101-500

(plus or minus about 50 mph).  by the time i could use the binoculars, the front of the object was not visible due to the angle.  the 'fuselage' was square, and i estimate it at 6 ft. high & 6 ft. wide & about 24 - 30 ft. long, overall.  the tail was a tapered, convex cone shape comprising approximately the last 15% of the fuselage.  there were no wings, although there was, on the starboard side, what appeared to be a very stubby wing box root protruding less than a foot along the top edge of the fuselage approximately 40% back from the apparent front end.  there were no windows visible at all.  there was no propeller in front or rear, no other 'pods' or engine nacelles, no emissions, no visible exhaust, no vapor trail(s), no nothing.  i heard nothing from this object.  it's flight path was absolutely straight & level, without variation.  there were no other flight control surfaces, whatsoever.  it's appearance never varied in the level of (apparently) reflected light.  it was always brilliant white, with a very narrow, discernible vertical darkish line at approximately the rear of the stub wing box root area.  this dark stripe did not appear to be a shadow.\r\n\r\nas far as my 'feelings' go, this is not my first ufo sighting, just the first that i'm reporting (i'd love to sit face-to-face with someone about my first sighting - - it was spectacular!!!!!).  i don't scare easily and i was not concerned about this sighting in the least.  i'm as rational as it gets.  after the sighting i went another mile down the road to the local mcdonalds and had breakfast.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object as it receded into the distance, pretty much out of range of the binoculars that i had, and i had to get going, anyway.....\r\n\r\noverall, i'd never have stopped to look, if i didn't think the brilliant white reflectiveness was unusual.  i'm not unfamiliar with commercial jets, military aircraft, corporate aircraft and aviation in general.  what i saw was none of the above, nor was it some homebuilt experimental craft.\r\n\r\nit was, in my opinion, unidentifiable, flying, and an object.\r\n\r\nif you have photographs of this particular object, or one(s) like it, i'd love to see it, or them.....\r\n\r\nas an aside, i have a decent video camera, which, after this event, is now in the car with me at all times!!

minutes, all of the smaller objects returned to the large central orb and seemed to enter it. then the large orb descended into the woodlands around the reservoir. i could see the orange light flowing

(s) began considering a logical explanation - maybe drones which i entertained as a possibility. and then i saw a 5th one of the same moving much lower and then it quickly changed direction and disappeared as it ascended out of sight. i have no doubt that these were not drones.\r\n\r\nthe incoming cloud front changed shape at the edges and took on the form of an alligator so i snapped a few photos. it wasn't till i uploaded the photos to my mac book that i saw the large neon green disc hovering above a nearby building. i took the second photo right after the 1st and the disc had moved a a good distance away in such a short period of time.

lee's summit missouri.  i observed a blue beam of light going perpendicularin the sky.It was there my entire ride home as i live in a rural area. i decided to send this after a story popped up on my facebook thread this morning, after i saw the location. my experience happened within 20 miles of the cigar shaped object seen on the 19 of june in blue springs missouri.It stayed the same my entire drive home. i was driving alone at the time and i took the pic while driving down the hwy.I was completely in awe as i am always watching the sky. i saw a ufo about 5 years ago in the lone jack area at 11 at night but was unable to take a pic when i turned around it was gone.            \r\nafter taking a few pics i had to turn off hwy and went home. by this time it was getting dark. it was not there the next morning.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":84522,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0378364266005,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06212017-0007","longitude":-94.25775153667053,"occurred":1497470400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1498032283000,"summary":"Looked
