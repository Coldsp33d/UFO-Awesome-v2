a pasture west of the ranch house at 9:00 pm talking about our purchase of the 600 acre ranch he had for sale. we noticed a row of bright lights off to the west at treetop level and my wife making the statement,\"it's not a plane because there are no flashing lights.\" we watched without speaking as the craft drew closer moving directly towards us a a very slow speed. when it was about a mile away i noticed the craft was huge, i mean it was gigantic and coming straight for us. as it passed directly overhead i was in disbelief and wonder as it blocked out the night sky. there was what i would describe as a round or circular gondola that lowered from the center of the underbelly being 20 to 30 ft. in diameter and coming out of the bottom of the craft about 10 to 15 ft. it is a part of the craft not seperate. it appeared as if they could raise it back into the craft or lower it at will. the gondola was glassed in with many seperate panes of glass 4 to 6 ft wide having a metallic bottom and 3 to 4 ft of metal at the top. the glass panes allowed us to clearly see the individuals in what resembled a control room atmosphere that comprised the interior of the gondola. the occupants of the gondola were humanoid in appearance but i was struck by the fact they were all the same size being thin and slightly long limbed as they moved about at what looked like control panels or monitors of some sort. i sensed a sense of urgency in their movements but cannot put into words why i felt that way. they seemed completely oblivious to our presense as thy went about their duties. the craft slowly moved across highway 279 continuing east at treetop level. we stood speechless for a moment and **********broke the silence with, \"did you just see what i just thought i saw?\" we said we had but we were all in an awed stupor of what's going on , our normal, safe, uneventful lives and world had been violated by images we were having trouble getting a grip on as our minds raced with so many thoughts. my wife said, \"it's going to crash!\" but as we waited in expectation of a terrible fireball and explosion, nothing happened. my wife and i do not share this event with others because we do not wish to be considered whacko's. but we saw what we saw! i am giving you this information to assist you as you compile information because i saw a gentleman ridiculed on fox news network by good people who just had no way of understanding what they had not seen for themslves. my wife and i are 66 yrs. of age, retired in a gated golf resort on lake whitney. we are affluent, respected members of our community and are willing at any time at our expense to take a lie detector examination. a sketch will be provided upon request. i do not wish to be contacted by a hoard of people and this is the reason i am supplying this information to you. i will co-operate with you and anyone who represents you. this is why i am checking the no box for third party contacts. i understand from others

and i were driving up a mountain road on a very clear night and the moon looked brighter than i had ever seen it before. as we passed a house we saw something in the air that was completely still and very low.  like the georgia entry, this object had a bright white center light with blue white and red lights flashing around it.  as we stopped to watch it, it started flying away from us slowing so we turned the car around and started following it and as we did this it took off flying very quickly away.  we went back down the road as fast as we could and went to open fields to try to see it. we saw it still flying away from us, then it stopped, turned left and we watched it fly away for awhile.  as we went to leave we turned around and we saw another one flying over the mountain top and as we were watching this one fly either another one appeared or the one that we thought flew away had come back and now two of the objects were flying toward each other right above the tree line.  as they got close to each other they stopped.  both of them had bright white lights on the front and were facing each other, then all of the sudden both lights turned away from each other and pointed directly at our car and started moving slowly toward us.  at this point we freaked out and drove away to my friends house. we stood in my friends driveway and could kind of see them in the distance.  we went inside and hung out about an hour. little did we know this was just the beginning.  we left my friends house with him being very skeptical of our sighting but when we came to the fields again we saw another one, we started following it and when we came out where the tree line ended we saw at least 10 different objects in the sky all blinking colors and moving around, some of these were very close too.  as we drove closer the 4 closest objects started flashing a white light and moving away from us, as we got closer the white light got brighter and brighter until it looked like a sliver bright light flashing quickly.  we again freaked out and drove to my house.  when we got to my house i called the cops to see if anything was going on, if helicopters were looking for a missing person or something, and they said nothing was going on in the area.  as soon as i got off the phone, it is about 1120 now, we see about 6 of the objects in the sky above my house flying around, then we hear a loud noise and we could feel a vibration and three large bright orange circles appear from the tree tops in a triangle, they fly quickly over my house and disappear in the horizon, as soon as that was gone one of the ships flew above my front yard and a bright light started growing from the, i'm assuming, back of it. it stayed still as the light beam grew longer and was changing different colors (blues, reds, purples, yellows, everything) once the light beam was at least 100+ feet long it swooped over my house. my friends and i ran from the front to the back yard and watched it fly close over head, and as soon as it passed my over my house it let go of the light beam and the beam seemed to fall and turn into smoke that fell right above our heads and disappeared, as we saw this falling we shut the door and went inside. after all this happened, we called the police again to see if anyone saw anything and they said that they had a few calls of people reporting lights in the sky. i hung up the phone and we didnt see anything else really.  i felt very strange, i dont know if it was from them or from freaking out, but at one point i felt very sick and the letters on my computer screen started moving and we all felt very paranoid.  i was completely sober this entire time.  everything we saw was clear as day.  my digital camera wouldnt work when i tried to take a picture of them, and my video camera wasnt charged and everytime i took it out there was nothing around. i called the cops today to see if anything was reported about last night and the cop who had been on duty since 730 am said he had not heard one thing.  after i read the ufo sighting in georgia that happened the same night with the same objects, i knew something either very exciting or very scary had happened.  there was a small orb of light that was significantly brighter than the rest of the stars that was far in the sky above my house that i caught on video, and on the video you can see the orb change colors some, and it stayed very still while everything else was going on. i will try to upload that footage later","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

a few minutes after he walked outside, he called me and told me that there was something like a ufo in the sky moving around and that i needed to come outside to see. \r\n\r\ni put on my bathrobe and walked outside to my friend. i had a baby monitor receiver in my robe pocket at that time, and when i walked out into the yard, the signal received some interference and i had to turn it down so that the noise from the interference would stop, which is rather unusual.\r\n\r\nit was a really clear night, and the stars were very bright. my friend pointed up to one star and told me to watch. i asked what i would see and he said that it had been moving around the sky erratically and that it had blue and red lights moving around it from time to time.\r\n\r\nmy roommate also came outside to watch for a minute. at first the object did nothing. my roommate then went back inside stating that he thought it was an illusion from looking at something for too long. at first i thought the same thing but i had a feeling in my gut that it was more than just an illusion.\r\n\r\ni kept watching this \"star\" and soon it appeared to be moving erratically, but in a small area. it seemed to move to the side and down, then up again; rather slowly. then i witnessed what appeared to be small/thin rays of red and blue lights radiating from the object in a circular motion (as if it was shining blue and red flashlights while moving in circles). the lights only lasted a few seconds at a time and then would stop. \r\n\r\nafter a few more minutes of this, i got very nervous and decided to go back inside. my friend stayed in my yard for about another 2 hours watching this object. at some point, he states that up to 5 more of these objects started moving in the sky. he said that they would move towards and away from each other, as if they were dancing. all appeared to have the same red and blue light beams every few minutes. \r\n\r\nat one point, my friend said that he got chills and goose-bumps and felt as if something were about to get him, so he got into his vehicle and drove to his house across town. he has since stated that he felt as though \"they\" knew he was watching and took notice of him. once at his house, he could not see the object(s) anymore. after he was inside, he says that he got a feeling as though something was right outside of his house waiting for him.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

but, i'de be willing to do a \"lie-detector\" test to back up my belief in whatever it was i saw.\r\n i have no idea wether anyone else seen it or not, seems we heard some clatter of sightings on a radio w/in a short time of that, but i do remember that we discoused the matter and desided not to make an official sightings-type report to any place at the time. i figured that i probably would just be thought to be \"nuts or something\" ! as it was, idaho ranchers/farmers did'nt take too kindly to \"long-haired\" men, especialy ones from \"california\", at that time.About a year or so later i thought i was seeing another such sighting off of the california coast, near san gregerio beach;but, it soon turned out to be a blurry hellicopter light -\r\nbeam, though the engine must've been well mufflered - as it ran fairly quiet,yet not completely silent as the \"real\" sighting event.\r\n well, i hope i've amused someone if nothing else ? i seen a program on a pbs channel and heard the name mufon, looked it up on our pc and thought:\"why not ?\" besides, this can finally be my telling of this story to people who'm may not think i just made-it-all-up or went \"crazy\" ?

get fresh air because i wasnt feeling very good.  as i went outside it was a clear blue night with the stars very visible.  as i went around my house i noticed about 10 to 20 miles away in the southwest, a pulsating light with many colors. it seemed to dissapear and reapear, up and down closer to me and then further away.  as i watched i got a wierd feeling to look up.  i then spotted above a very dark but bright orange orb of light. \"what a strange star.\" i thought.  then it bolted away then hovered in another area, directly over my house. i would say about 2 or 3000 ft. up.  as i watched there seem to be white orbs coming and going around the orange orb at light speed.  i was so scared by this sight that i ran in the house to get my girlfriend.  we went back out and i showed her the first pulsating light further away.  she gasped in disbelief! we stood there for a couple of minutes cuz i couldnt see the other one.  then the other reappered out of no where above my house again. it seemed to be flashing lights and then dissapered and reappered while hovering.  my girlfriend gasped and and said \"nooo!\" then ran into the house. i stood in amazment at what i saw.  she begged me to come back in and i did so.  after fianlly calming down i went back outside.  the orange light was gone and the one further away had moved to the complete opposite side of town. it had moved to the north east side. still about the same distance.  i then noticed possibly a c-130 flying at very low altitudes. it was accompanied by a airplane releasing chemtrails at a very low altitude.  thy sky became cloudy in what seemed a matter of 30 minutes.  i went back inside very distraught at i what i saw.  around 5:45 am my girlfriend got up so i could take her to work. i could not sleep.  we got in the car and as we pulled out we noticed in the northeast sky 2 pulsating flashing lights.  as we drove down the block one light began to move upwards and towards my town.  my girlfriend begged me to hurry and leave.  amazed i drove about 6 miles southbound to her work.  as i pulled up to her work i noticed the flashing light had made its way very close and could be seen moving eraticly and flashing multiple colors.  i then decided that i had to find out if i was really as crazy as this was making me feel.  so i headed eastbound out of town towards the country to get a better look. as a traveled a very dark road i looked up and rolled down the window. i was in complete shock and horror at what i saw.  i slammed my brakes and parked on the shoulder. i got out and stood in awe.  what i saw next was straight out of a sci-fi movie.  there was a widespread chemtrail cloud. in it and above is what seemed like thousands of orbed lights. they seemed to be moving with the cloud. silent i stood in horror.  out of no where i saw what looked like a triangular shaped ufo descend really damn close to me. i could see three distinct orange lights.  and what seemed to be scribling on the underbelly edge.  it hovered and zipped in bursts several times before i completely freaked out and got in my car. i did about 90 mph down this road to a right down a access road by the highway to the nearest convinence store.  the clouds and the fleet where gone! i went inside got a water bottle. as i left i asked the clerk if anyone had come in and reported seeing anything. he stared at me and asked \"what did you say?\" he could see the fear on me. i told him never mind and left. as i walked to my car i saw the same orange orb about 2 miles to the west. it looked directly above dyess airforce base. it hovered and pulsated. dissapearing and reapearing several times. the clerk then came outside to \"see what i was looking at.\"  we both stood in silence by my car as we watched the orb pulsate and hover. moving closer and further away. at a closer look you could see white orbs zipping to and from it.  finally i left and watched this ufo the entire time.  when i got home the orb had moved closer to my house. i decided to get a closer look so i went to my backyard. i looked at my clock and it was around 6;50 am.  the sun was starting to light the sky. i observed the sky over my town light up with activity. everything from the large strobbing orb to white orbs. diffrent ufo's at diffrent altitudes. what looked like a c-130.  a chemtrail jet.  bomber sounds that could not be seen.  there seem to be a explosion of activity!!  exhausted and petrified i went in to the house. laid down and finally went to sleep. i can only say that what i saw will forecver change me. there here now.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

while i saw very bright white light that got brighter and brighter, hurting my eyes.  after, 5 miles of watching it we pulled over and got out of the truck and watched the light all the time it was light a streak of lightening.  after, about 5 minutes we got back into the truck and drove to dundee (all together 14 miles) the light was visable the whole time.  we pulled into our driveway and watched it from the tail of the truck for about 2-3 minutes. the entire time it was visable it seemed to be moving evenly with the truck at about a 30 degree angle in the sky.  at the time we went into the house it had dissappeared.  the brightness of the streak caused my eyes to water and the light would intesify.  my husband said that as it got brighter it changed color.  his distance eyesight is better then mine.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

thought maybe it was the north star, but it seemed even brighter than that. chalking it up to a star, i closed my eyes for a couple minutes. i opened them up again & looked out to see the bright light had moved up and over the trees. i then realized it couldn't be a star because of the distance it had moved in that short of time. so i figured it must be an airplane. i kept looking at it then i noticed the faint blink of red & green lights. i noticed that it hadn't changed it's position in the sky since i had been watching it over the trees. as i continued looking at it, it finally moved in some small circular motions, then stopped. then it moved in an up & down motion, then stopped. even when it was moving, it stayed in that same general area, but always stopped right back where it started. i woke my husband so he could look at it too, but he had been horribly sick with a stomach virus, and wasn't really awake, and he never looked out the window. i started getting freaked out & scared & forced myself to roll over and stop looking at it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":21698,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.1045596,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01282010-0009","longitude":-80.239016,"occurred":1264500420000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

that thawed away, we had fog like i've never seen in our area before.  this past weekend, it felt like spring, nearing the 60s.  but now it has gotten colder again...And we are anticipating a bigger snow storm.  our dog is an english mastiff (big dog!) and for some reason became spooked and barked, and looked toward the door.  he rarely barks.  so, i stepped out of my house for a cigarette, as i normally do.  the barometric pressure was high, thus no clouds and all stars.  i love it when it's like that...You can see every star.  so, i looked over to my neighbor's house to see his heat exhaust go straight into the sky.  that always looks so neat, but two objects just over his garage caught my eye.  from my view, they \"looked\" like they were over his garage, but were actually about five miles away.  i look into this area every night.  there is a flight pattern for the louisville international airport, but these objects were lower and stationary.  they almost looked stationary like stars, but the lights were bright orange and other lights were flickering at times.  i'm a ufo enthusiast and thought, \"i'm finally seeing it!\"  i thought no one would believe me, so i bravely woke up my sleeping fiance.  she wasn't too happy, but she humored me and got up to look out.  in the back of my mind, i kind of assumed they'd be gone, but they weren't.  she saw them too.  she still told me that i was crazy, but got my iphone for me.  i snapped the attached picture.  the objects stayed for about 10 minutes until the bottom one gently flew off to the left, or direction-wise east towards louisville.  the top one stayed for much longer.  in the picture, you can see my neighbor's house.  there is a utility pole in front of his house with a bright white light on it.  but just to the left of the pole are the two objects.  they made no sound, but remember, i'm about five miles away from them.  \r\nif these are not ufos, my theory is that they are military helicopters training for urban warfare.  fort knox is about 40 miles south of where i live.","distance":"Over One

bright this sucker was.  then he started watching it as it went out of my vision and he caught it.  and as quick as we had seen it. he went crap it disappeared.  then he said i dont know what that was

noticed a black chevron-shaped object with five huge, bright red disc-shaped lights underneath moving noiselessly over the house. it was dusk and the object was about the size of a 727 traveling at about 180 mph at an altitude of about 500 feet. having advanced knowledge of conventional and military aircraft, i realized that this object was neither of these because all five lights were blinking on and off simultaneously. in other words, they would all go out for one second and then all come on for one second. i used my cell phone to call my mother in nj as a witness to what i was describing. i told her i was seeing a ufo and was going to follow it with my car. my son's house is on rt. 512. the object followed rt. 512 for about one mile. i trailed it with my car and as rt. 512 makes a sharp right, the ufo went straight and i watched the object fly off over the mountains until it was out of sight. i remember being fascinated and thinking that this was definitely not something from this earth. i also recall being amazed at the large size of the lights and their bright red color. it was my first ufo sighting and i was thrilled. oddly enough, my son told me that he had seen the same black, chevron-shaped object over bangor, pa only a week before in broad daylight. he said the red lights were off because of the time of day. he told me that he was afraid to tell anyone for fear they would think he was crazy. i remember thinking that a lot of people must have seen this object on the same night that i had seen it because we were on the main street in a small, densely populated town and the object was in plain view at dusk, flying low right down the main street. it was still light enough to see it clearly. it reminded me of the sightings of the phoenix lights and it looked just like them, except on a smaller scale.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line
