make me first consider there to be a tower or smoke stack i had forgotten. as i got closer i realized the lights were moving toward the i-90 thru-way. i was able to see some structure. it was as if there were two nearly straight flying wings (objects \"wings\" were only slightly swept back). the tips of the wings had the lights i initially saw and the underside had a dimmer light of the same color. the underside light appeared to be windows like from a wwii bomber. a yb-35 was the closest thing i could think of. i passed nearly underneath with no audible engine noise. as my initial thought of tower would suggest, i would guess they were 1,000ft up and 200-500 ft across. the height is well defined by my changing perspective as well as the speed, which was too high for a normal lighter than air, perhaps at or slower than a landing commercial jet. the two were in a formation that would make it look like a flying rectangle or diamond if not as close as i was. i lost sight because i was past the lights and they were moving off by the time i realized this was strange. very strangely there were no headlights i could see behind me and the closest car ahead was a ways out, but that is likely unrelated. sorry i should have stopped and tried to get a fuzzy cell phone pic. \r\n\r\nthe exact cross road from google maps is i-90 between buckley and warner.\r\nthe object(s)

evening when she said \"dorene what is that?\" when i looked up to the left in the sky id guess 30 miles out traveling south to north was a cluster of the goofiest looking lights i had ever seen.  they were clustered together like one big one then to the right of that big red light was a few small ones then a big bright red one again and it floated erratically across the sky, liz and i were screaming in the car at the excitement of seeing such an odd shaped lighting arrangement when all of a sudden 2 bright white lights shot out the back of the red lighted thing then disappeared.  we watched the cluster of reddish amber looking lights change shape a few times like it was spinning or morphing always changing not like a normal craft, which blinks the same continuously  til it was behind us instead of in the front of us as it turned into a star and stayed stationary a few seconds then we lost sight of it as it just blinked out.  we again started screaming in excitement at what we had just seen.  i have become very interested in ufology in the last few years and believe we are not alone, and what i believe we saw was not of earthly origin.  it felt ..........Strange, surreal because it was not your normal run of the mill airplane.  i also would like to add that at the time it was drifting across the sky south to north one plane flew right by that thing then there were a few more planes in the sky at the same time and usually in south dakota there is never 4 or 5 planes in the sky at one time and i would know i have lived here for 4 years now and watch the skies

in and out from it, some coming in at top speeds also many other where cicluling around the main object. the size of the main craft was about a quarter mile across.After watching the craft for about 20 mins, it slowly lifted into the sky and them in a flash it disapearred at light speed. i also had my mother and a freind with me at the time of this sighting. it was definately not from this

8:55pm  :\r\n\r\nmy date  had pointed out the constellation orion while we were walking up her sidewalk.   we were then looking upwards towards the eastern sky when 3 dim but distinct white lights forming an equilateral triangle flew overhead at high speed on about an 80 degree easterly heading.   no outline of a craft was visible.  the lights each had appearances more like that of illuminated rings rather than being solid, and the intensity of each ring was about that of a medium star that is easily observable.   if there had been street or yard lights nearby, they probably would not have been visible.  i definitely feel that they were all on one craft of some sort as they did not vary in distance or orientation to each other at all.  as for the size, the palm of your hand would have covered them all with your arm extended. the diameter of each ring was approximately 25% of each leg of the triangle.  they had already passed overhead when we spotted them at about 75 degrees above the eastern horizon.  i���d estimate that they traveled 30 to 35 degrees of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds before we lost sight behind the trees and roof.  the wind was calm and we heard absolutely no sound.   this craft had just went out of sight, when we spotted a single ring of light of the same magnitude and speed following a parallel path slightly to the south.  it may have been slightly larger than the other rings.  or lower?  \r\n\r\nmy initial gut feeling was that these lights were traveling at an altitude in excess of 10,000 feet with a speed in the thousands of miles per hour.  i have no way to know what the actual altitude was, but they did not appear to get smaller or less brilliant as they passed, so that indicates to me that they were of significantly high altitude.  \r\n\r\nwhat appeared to be an airliner was almost directly overhead shortly after the rings and the lights on it were much brighter and the speed was slower by many many times.  the temperature was 12 degrees and the stars were bright and crisp, so even thought they were dim, the rings of light were very distinct and stayed at the same intensity for the brief time they were visible. \r\n\r\nadded 1/27/10:  my date read the above and agreed on everything other than she said she thought the rings were visible at least 4 seconds.   i  feel the speed could have been  15 - 20,000 mph if the airliner speed was 600 mph.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

between 18 to 20 degrees west above the mountains. at first i dismissed this as a planet, as it looked as if it was stationary.  the time was about 6:48am and in fort collins, this is during civil twilight where the sun is 6 degrees or less below the horizon. (sun rise is at 7:08am).  i was about to dismiss this object and turn north to go home, when i had to stop at a red light.  i lined up three points using my bronco, a tree for line of sight, just to make sure that the object was not moving.  i watched it hover for about 10 or 15 seconds, when i noticed that it was indeed moving very slowly. at first, i thought that this was my imagination, but the object started to accelerate, and i knew it was not a planet.  when the light turned green, i did not turn north, but went through the intersection and pulled over as fast as i could. i got out of my bronco, and watched for about 30 seconds.  the object moved about 1/3 the distance it was from the ground in about 4 seconds.  it accelerated very quickly, and then disappeared.  still assuming that this might be a jet that was reflecting the sun light, and possibly approaching my line of sight until it turned, which would look as if it were hovering, and then accelerating, i went home and crunched the numbers. this is what i got:\r\n\r\nthe altitudes of most commercial jets are about 30,000 feet.  if the object was 18 to 20 degrees from my line of sight, that would make it 16.61 to 18.32 miles away from me.  i went to fort collins airport, and found the visibility for 7:00am, and it was 10 miles.   this indicated that the object was close to double the distance for visibility.  with the sun hitting an object, one might still be able to see it, so i calculated the speed.  it the object moved 1/3 its altitude in 4 seconds, then it would be traveling close to 2400 feet per second, (rounding off). this equates to 1630 mph, which commercial jet cannot do.\r\nmy conclusions suggest that unless this was a military craft that was reflecting the sun and traveling directly into my line of sight, (which made it look like it was hovering for over two minuets), and then shot straight up at a climbing rate of 1630 mph,  then it is something unique.  lastly, if the object was indeed moving at a velocity of 1630 mph, and was coming directly at me for over two minutes, then it would have covered a distance of 54 miles, which would have brought the craft over my head in less than 60 seconds, which it did not do.  i would be interested if anyone else saw this object from another direction so i can get better numbers. please email me at bking@rams.Colostate.Edu.\r\nthanks, \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":21681,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5939302,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01272010-0007","longitude":-105.074473,"occurred":1264603680000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1264621496000,"summary":"Very bright object  hovering, then shot off very quickly.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Fort Collins, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:152796"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Hays","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving my daughter home from school. she says to me look daddy, a round plane with bolts!

i would like to say i have taken a quite inaccurate date of the sighting.In 2008 i had being on my way to waterford city to spend the night at a mate's house,my father had been driving me to the town which is almost half an hour drive approx from my parents home in kilmeaden.\r\n\r\nas we drove alone the main road(n25),around ten minutes or so from our departure,my father had noticed an extremely bright object making it's way over the hills where i could only describe had been coming from the area of ardeenlone heading northwest, as the sun had being setting at the time and this area was a usual route for the rescue helicopter to make it's way to the mountains nearby,my father and i,whom at the time were still sceptical and puzzled at the lack of any sound coming from such a loud aircraft,had put a logical explaination to what we were seeing and said that it must be the helicoptor with the reflection of sun striking from it and at such a low altitude.So we kept driving as normal to our destination.\r\n\r\nnearing my friends house by ardkeen just under twenty minutes later,i recieve a call from home, i answered and it was my mother on the other end in a frantic state,saying my younger brother had seen a ufo,now in all honusty some of my family including myself are firm believers in ufo's and are sometimes very gulable to the fact,but never to the state where i recieve a frantic urgent almost upsetting phone call over something seen,except for this circumstance.My brother who is also a very crediable withness who always looks for a logical explaination for event's like this,had been frantic about this happening and could find apsolutely no explaination for it,once i had asked him about what he had seen i was amazed.\r\n\r\nhe described the object as being the shape of half a cone(from bottom end up),it was completely metallic (which explained the strong reflective shine my father and i had seen as it flew towards the sunset),it had two lights on it,one was a consistant white light at the bottom right and a blue light that flashed in sequence halfway up the side, the craft made a small low frequency buzzing noise, and the craft did not spin or rotate in any direction according to his view, he had also described the scenario to me from where he saw it, his account of it is he had been out the front of the house when he had noticed it in the neighbouring field to the north of our house heading in the same direction we had described before hand, he said it had been so close it had him scared as it was at estimate of five to six hundred feet from him and hovering upward, as he watched the object hover at a slow rate, he then said it moved at an acute angle at incredible speed over the nearby mountainous forestry to the east where it stopped suddenly and hovered downward behind the trees and wasn't seen afterwards. i had went to the forest the next day in hope to find a landing site but could not estimate the area of it's descent and so no finding. this is no hoax, it's a true account i swear to you.\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

before i met her i did amateur astronomy for many years. we like to watch all kinds of celestial phenomena and particularly enjoy watching iss transit because it is so big: quite an impressive sight.  my wife and i were watching the iss transit over our house yesterday about a little after 6:00 pm. the sky was clear and the temp was about 61 degrees. the iss appeared in the north western sky headed to the se. as the iss approached it's maximum elevation an orange red dot with the apparent diameter of the head of a pin held at arms length suddenly appeared. it was in the same part of the sky as iss which had come from the nw and was now falling away toward the se and the object was separated from the station in the sky by about 20 degrees. it was going from south to north. it was about magnitude +1 because although it was bright it was no where near as bright as iss which was about -3. also iss looked golden in color and was really shiny reflecting the sun's light off its solar arrays. this thing was a somewhat less bright orange dot moving at about the about the same apparent speed as iss and not blinking or making noise of any kind. we were thrilled to see what was apparently another spacecraft (which appeared to be) moving in low earth orbit over our house at the same time as the iss. the object moved approximately 15 or 20 degrees through the sky and disappeared. it winked out just like someone turned off a light switch. the whole sighting lasted about 4 seconds if that long. we were both really puzzled. that shouldn't have happened. if the object was in orbit we should have observed it for somewhat longer than 4 seconds. this did happen at sunset which might explain the orange glow of the object. objects in orbit frequently look orange at sunset or sunrise because they are reflecting the colors of the sunset or sunrise from above the atmosphere. it didn't look like pictures of \"iridium flares\" i have seen either although those are pretty cool and last about as long as this did. still iridium flares, which occur when sunlight reflects off the solar power arrays on orbiting iridium satellites, do not look like orange dots. they appear grow bight then disappear. still i checked the heaven's above website to see if any were  visible from our house at that time. none were scheduled for our area until the next day. we discussed the possibility that it might have been a fireball but fireballs look like fireballs not like a round, orange, something-or-another in orbit. the color was wrong for a fireball too. they are

thing....The iss passed into the umbra going se. what we saw couldn't have disappeared into the umbra because it disappeared when it was almost overhead. if anyone else saw this i would love to

girlfriend and i were walking home from the nearby woods to my house just at twilight. as i passed a small clearing in the trees to the east i saw two bright stars in my peripheral vision just as i walked passed a tree that obscured the view8 that seemed odd. i stopped my girlfriend and we walked back a few steps so i could see it and point it out, there was a line connecting the two \"stars\" that started to fade. these were low on the horizon just above a hill. i never noticed any bright stars in that direction, and definitely not two so close together and so intensely bright. within seconds of looking at it, the line of light that was connecting the two 'stars' began to fade, much like when the flash for a camera leaves a bit of a visual imprint in your eyes for a short while after seeing the flash. after that the star on the right side faded in the same manner, the the star on the left side faded shortly after wards. it happened fairly quick, less than a minute i would estimate. we had no idea what it was and continued to walk home. \r\n\r\na strange thing about it was that it was almost like we had forgotten seeing it and it was hours later while we were at home i suddenly thought about it again. my girlfriend and  i said nothing to each other as to what we both saw, only  something along the lines of \"what is that?\" - i asked my girlfriend to describe to me what i saw to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me and she described exactly what i recalled and described.   \r\n\r\ni have no idea what it was, i live about 35 kilometers from ramstein air force base and see aircraft occasionally in the area, but this was definitely not any sort of plane, jet or aircraft i have ever seen. it made no sound and didn't appear to move other than just fading away in 3 steps. \r\n\r\ni also recall the sky being very clear that night and the moon was near full and already out, but still a bit of light in the sky from the setting sun. \r\n\r\nattached is a photo i took from the exact location of the area where i saw this occur, the photo was taken 25 january 2010 so the trees are much more bare now and not obstructing any view of the sky as it was in the late fall.

the window it was very close to the window just hovering made no noise and had no lights my mom describes the shape as a boat it had a circular shape on the bottom and a shape of a boat it was silver she says as the color of rain clouds. the object was about 400 feet from the window and she saw it for about 4 to 5 seconds she couldn't take her eyes off of it as she was looking outside she noticed that there was no cars as she was going to call me and my husband to see this object it disappeared some clouds was forming around it an it disappeared.  the strange thing about all this was that i had been dreaming about aliens every single night it might sound crazy but it seemed in my dreams as if i was talking to them.  i told my husband about my strange dreams but never mentioned anything to my mom.  now we do live in the same house so it���s kind of hard to believe that i didn't tell her but i didn't so after a whole week of dreaming about aliens every single day the morning of my mom sighting she came to me and told me of what happened that night and then i told her about my dreams.  it was really strange because i have been dreaming about it and she basically confirmed what i was dreaming about.  now it takes me a lot of guts to actually post this message but i think if there is anything out there it is worth to have as many evidence possible.  even though this has happened to us i am still a skeptic because i didn't see the object i just had dreams so like they say seeing is believing so until i actually see it then i will believe it. my mom is convinced that there is aliens because she has seen it twice in brazil, once in miami which supposedly they placed something in her ear that is what she says and that she saw them and she describes what they look like and here in wisconsin so she is convinced that it is true that there is something out there.  my mom request if possible that you could see if there was any unidentified objects reported here in wisconsin on that date or any radar date because she is convinced that it will show because she says this object was

the 1970s.  upon her sighting i directed her to talk to the ufo society in st. louis (wash u. based?).  she did go and pick out the type of spacecraft.  sadly she passed away due to cnacer in 1978.  i have seen ufos several times in this life but i wanted to tell her story.\r\ni was on active duty in the army (vietnam era) so i was not present. i recieved a call from her on or about this date.  mom was frantic about this event.  she was never a believer ever in ufos.  by phone and later by excamining the area she told me the following:\r\n\r\nat 6am she always walks her bulldog named ladybug. she lived on geyer rd. just north of woodbine in kirkwood in an apartment on the east side of the road.   she told me she walked out of her sliding door onto the enclosed rear patio to walk her dog in between her apartments.  apartmemnts are about 30 feet apart and the patios back up to each other.  so this area is very secluded in this time of day.  she walked ladybug out of the gate and told me she saw this object scarcely 6-10 feet away, sitting motionless about 4 feet off the ground.  she hinted that she almost walked into it. kay told me it was a grayish color with windows in the front and portals in the sides. it seemed to her to be about 10 feet across and about 20 feet long.  it was silent and never gave off noise.  mom told me she was startled and scared but was also curious.  so she stood watching it for several minutes. finally, fearing that perhaps \"they' were maybe going to abduct her or worse than that, ladybug, she backed away from it with ladybug and went inside her apartment.  it left and she never saw it again  \r\n\r\ni remember that for the remaining years of her life she always kept a kodiak instant camera next to her bed and carried it with her when she walked ladybug. i have always felt afinity with extrerrials since i was a small chld.  i have my reasons.  i can't help believing that her health condition had something to do with \"their\" visit.  not for bad, but for good.She was diagnosed with cancer not long after and even went into remission for awhile.  i am certian she knows the truth about the visit now...","distance":"20 Feet or
