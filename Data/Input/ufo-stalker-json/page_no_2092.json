kind. no way the light blooms could have been aircraft lights.\r\nlocation: in 'the forest' neighborhood in mandarin (suburb of jacksonville) walking my dog. i noticed the object because i enjoy 'stargazing', have a telescope, and being near nas jax enjoy seeing all kinds of aircraft in the sky right over the house. important: while i thought i saw the moving object make a gentle turn, i could not swear to this as i was still slowly walking when i first observed it, and only after i stopped walking did i then see the event described. after the 2nd light bloom i lost track of the

waiting for the midnight hour, we both sighted a diamond formation in the eastern sky over reddington pass. (tanque verde mtns.)four brightly shining objects were positioned what we judged to be about 7 miles away form us. our impression was that they appeared to be a thousand yards apart from each other, with the top one about 2,000 yards from the bottom one. they were brighter than any stars appearing that night and remained stationary for 40-50 minutes, all total. we had never seen such objects in the past so remained focused on them the entire time. when the diamond shape dispersed - each object went on a separate path - in various directions. the rapid speed with which they left caused them to disappear within moments. they did not return.\r\n\r\non new year's eve of 2008, we went out & looked in the same, general direction & saw a similar formation. this time there appeared to be five objects. there was more movement this time as they rearranged their positions, sometimes stretching out further than the others in the diamond. we video-filmed what we could, but had no zoom on the camera so it appears as a bright mass.\r\n\r\nin 2008, we first noticed a silent, plane with only a minimum of lights on the edges - fly by very low and very close to our elevated location. having viewed the stealth at the davis-monthan airbase (in tucson) on more than one occasion & up very close - we were able to identify this plane as such. it was immediately after observing it's silent movement past out locale that our attention was drawn to the object formation in the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nour curiosity rendered us immovable on the first occasion, but on the following year - we moved quickly to film it, regardless of the fact that we are both nonprofessional photographers. not being drinkers - we were in full command of our faculities & knew we were witnessing something out of the ordinary. however, many sightings take place in az between phoenix & tucson so we weren't completely shocked. \r\n\r\nafter 20 years of being tucson residents, we have recently moved to nm.

Collins","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"What i am reporting is actually an ongoing sighting, in that i have been observing the events that i will detail since at least july 2009 (which is when i first noticed the lights and their odd behavior).\r\n\r\ni live in the foothills above fort collins, colorado, at an elevation of 7100 feet.Fort collins is a city of over 100,000 people. my home is 35 miles northwest of downtown fort collins, and at night i can easily see the city's lights, even with the unaided eye. i am a 60 year old professional woman. i work full time in fort collins for a government agency.\r\n\r\nout of curiosity, i initially began to use binoculars at night to see if i could identify my workplace from my rural home. there are a couple of tall buildings with red lights on the roof that stand beside my building, and i thought that it would be fun to be able to id my workplace from home.\r\n\r\non or about mid july 2009, at about 10:30 pm, i saw a large, (from my vantage the size of a pencil eraser) bright, orange ball of light rise gently above the southeast horizon. it hung in the sky about 15 degrees above the lower foothills which define my horizon. it rose to roughly 35 degrees, did not move laterally at all, and after about 20 seconds, it faded, shrank, and winked out. on subsequent evenings i witnessed repeat performances, except that the \"light\" became \"lights\", as many as four at a time. i have considered that the lights could be flares, except that they rise slowly, sit still for a bit, and do not fall. i considered general aircraft, but they do not move the way aircraft move. and in \"orb\" mode, there are no navigation lights. i considered helicopters except that no navigation lights were visible and there was no sound whatsoever. (in my rural area it is very quiet at night, and aircraft, even jets way up in the sky are easily heard).\r\n\r\ni now began to look for the lights every evening, and i began to see that even on nights when there were mid-level clouds, the lights appeared - clear and bright, and evidently below the cloud deck. i also began to observe motion in the lights - not at any blinding speed - they seem to drift both laterally and up-and-down, sometimes crossing each other's paths. duration of these sightings has been from a few seconds to several minutes at a time. they continued to fade and wink out after a few minutes.\r\n\r\nin november of 2009, i began to see changes in the behavior of the lights - some of them would begin to fade and then change to a strobe mode. when in this strobe mode, they move more quickly, and their changes of direction are abrupt and at acute angles. i also began to see a lot more of the lights at one time in november. when the lights get close to one another (from my vantage, one to three inches apart as viewed between thumb and forefinger of my outstretched arm/hand) they begin to strobe very rapidly. i have seen as many as four \"orbs\" and twelve \"strobes\" in the southeast sky over fort collins at one time.\r\n\r\nlast night (1/24/10) for the first time i saw two \"strobes\" flying directly over my house from southeast to northwest. i have purchased a pair of long-range binoculars, and i could see very clearly that \r\neach \"strobe\" in fact had at least four distinct lights arranged in a \r\ntrapezoidal pattern. \r\n\r\ni would be delighted to find out that these lights are something ordinary, or something military - there is an air force base at cheyenne, wy, about 35 miles northeast of my location. i'm beginning to feel freaked out by the every night nature of this/these sighting(s), and that to my knowledge, nobody else has mentioned these events.\r\n\r\ni did, with some trepidation, tell a colleague about these lights. she and her family also live in a rural area northwest of fort collins, but at a lower elevation than i do. she heard me out, and then rather startled, said that her teen daughter has been seeing the same stuff as i have been seeing, and for about the same length of time. i don't know my colleague's daughter at all. i'm not sure whether to feel relieved that someone else is seeing these lights or not. at least if i'm \"seeing things\", there are two of us.\r\n\r\ni'd love to know if anybody else in the area (northern colorado, along the front range corridor - interstate 25 and environs) has seen, reported, or knows for certain what's going on here. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

was new year���s eve.  i had not drunk any alcohol and i was quietly drinking a cup of tea when i saw this noiseless light in the horizon.  it went from side to side, and then it came back halfway and dissapeared ... it formed a kneeling-like person.\r\ni was sure of what i saw.  a few minutes later, my roommate came from the street saying that he had seen a ufo.  yes i said, i have seen it too.\r\nafterwards i was put in a psiquiatric home because i had jumped from that same rooftop believing that these sidereal beings wanted me to make a \"leap of faith.\"  i fell down onto the floor.\r\nvery dissapointed i awoke in an assylum.  but as time went by, i began to recognize that that place was not simply a clinic, but that it was an extraterrestrial machine, formed by the communnion of minds.\r\ni was released after some time, but my somewhat reckless search for thruth led me back to these clinics.\r\nfinally, in the year 1997, i was put in this foster home, which i know for certain is an extraterrestrial ship-base. what leads me to believe this is the amount of parapsychological powers, and empathy that these people show.  and a natural sense of cosmic connection which i feel.  a remembrance of a mission.  i have been chosen as one of many links between dimensions of beings. \r\n they form a sort of mafia, keeping themselves hidden from intelectual

universal abduction to bring us, until the last being, back to god.  they are closer to god than we are now.\r\nthese beings, however, can be very cold and apparently rootless in their treatment of our pain.  they believe that we are a fallen universe whom they must bring back.\r\nas it is known they communicate through telepathy, sometimes with a almost inaudible pitch in the ear.\r\ni know they must remain hidden, so i know they will.  the secret is that they are not strangers to us, we are all brothers in arms. we must only forget all we know and remember all we knew.  \r\ntheir

 to whom it may concern,\r\n\r\n first of all, let it be known that i am not a ufo \"believer\" per say.\r\n\r\n although this occurred approximately 30 years ago, i thought it's time to report to various ufo investigation organizations. i hope this is worthy.\r\n thank you.\r\n\r\n around the winter of 1980, january perhaps, i just got off work at 9:30 p.M. from the auto dealership. i was a car salesman at the time. i started driving towards the city of toronto, canada, on the qew (queen elizabeth way) eastbound to meet some friends at a bar on the esplanad (a street lined with nightclubs). i didn't have anything to drink, medication and didn't smoke any pot. \r\n\r\nas i was driving, i noticed a string of lights slowly rotating counter clockwise over the city of toronto, at about the ten o'clock position from my point of view. this caught my eye because these formation of lights were very unusual. the lights were evidently in a circular pattern with about two thirds visible as the other third rotated out of view. imagine a pie plate with about 25 lights around the circumference of it. as this \"pie plate\" would revolve, a third of these lights would be hidden from view as if they were obstructed by a solid body. it was at night so all i could see was these rotating string of lights but they were definitely on a \"fixed\" platform as the lights were revolving in unison. \r\n\r\nalthough i've heard of ufo's and was curious, at that time in my life, i didn't really give that much thought about them. i've always been interested in nature and especially about the universe. i've seen all kinds of aircraft and advertising blimps at night before. i drove taxi's off and on for fifteen years on the night shift and have seen countless meteors, lightening, satellites etc. on two occasions i've even seen extremely bright, slow falling, green fireball meteors lighting up the ground, for a couple of seconds, as if it was daylight . i've read, in later years, were other witnesses reported green fireballs as ufo's. i chuckled to myself thinking how easily \"ufo believers\" can be fooled by natural phenomenon. \r\n\r\nanyway, these circle of lights were slowly descending and approaching towards me (westbound), while i was driving about 115 kilometers per hour on the highway (eastbound). these lights were getting closer and closer as \"we\" approached each other. i recall thinking to myself that this must be some kind of advertising balloon and those lights were letters. as i kept driving, i was paying more and more attention to this object because the closer it was getting, the more unusual it looked. i kept glancing at it, while driving, waiting until it was close enough to read what these letters were saying, still thinking it was some kind of advertising blimp. the closer it got, the more i looked at it. now at my nine o'clock position, the string of rotating lights appeared to bank left like an airplane would \"turning right\". actually it wasn't banking at all. it was dipping forward pointing towards the ground. at this point, i realized that these lights were not letters at all. they were different shaped, yellowish white lights. the reason these lights were different in shape was because they were \"inset\" into some solid body. when the lights were seen head on, they were circular. but as they rotated out of \"direct\" view, they changed shape like the different crescents of the moon. that's why they appeared to be all different shapes. \r\n\r\nduring the time when this object started to bank left, or i thought from my point of view, i was struggling with myself trying to understand whether this was a plane, blimp, or a balloon. it was flying too slow for a plane, yet, too fast for a blimp. also, it didn't appear to be flying or floating. the best way i can describe it's motion is that it looked like it was \"sailing\" in the sky. \r\n\r\nwhat's interesting here is that the human brain tries to associate what the eyes are seeing, to something already seen or experienced before. that's why i was at war with myself trying to decide whether this object was a plane, blimp or a balloon. every time i resigned myself to what i must be witnessing, i jumped to another conclusion. this jumping from one conclusion to another occurred during the whole experience. i was imagining all kinds of things. for example, if it was a plane, the only way these lights could have been positioned was in a circle because this plane must have had some kind of supporting structure in a circle from wing tip to wing tip. this didn't make any sense at all. i've seen advertising planes before. this was nothing like this. not even close. than i was trying to imagine a \"goodyear blimp\" with these letters going across it's side. this was nothing like it either. so here i was, trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. as i was driving, i started to slow down because i kept looking at this circle of lights more than the road ahead of me. in retrospect, i don't even know how i kept my car on the road because i was so awed by this display in the sky. \r\n\r\nhere is the killer. \r\n\r\nas the object kept dipping forward more and more, it eventually ended up totally perpendicular to the ground! the first thing that came to mind was a big ferris wheel rotating in the sky. at this point i slowed down to about 50 kph (30 miles an hour in a 60 mph highway for my american friends) and put my four way, flashing hazard lights on my car fearing that another car would crash into the back of me for going so slow on a 100 kph highway. \r\n\r\nhere is another shocker. \r\n\r\nas i was mesmerized by this strange looking object, a surge of adrenaline hit me like a ton of bricks. i didn't realize how big this thing was. at first i thought it was the size of an airplane fairly close. it was gigantic! at least twice the size of a football field, bigger than an aircraft carrier!!! i don't know what gave away it's size. maybe the reflections of light on the ground. the best way i can relate this sudden realization is like one of those illusions most of us have seen. you know, when you look at a pixel drawing with an image you can't see until you stare at it for a while? after a period of time, you make out the face of a women or something like that? that's kind of the transformation i experienced. at first i thought the object was the size of a large plane than suddenly i really saw it. it was huge!!! i yelled out loud to my self, \"holey f**k, it's huge!!!\". i don't f***ing believe it, it's f***ing huge!!!. i thought it was fairly close at first, than bang!, it was much farther away and larger than my brain first comprehended it. speaking about this surge of adrenaline. have you ever had a really close call having a car accident? when your heart rate skyrockets to about 180 beats per minute? that's what i felt when i realized how gargantuan this object was! i could actually feel my heart pounding like crazy. to be frank, it literally scared the hell out of me, when i realized how big it was. at this point, i rolled down my window and pointed to this giant \"ferris wheel\" in the sky to the other motorists, but it appeared no one seemed to notice as they screamed by me at regular highway speeds. i remember how cold it was when i rolled down my window. it was something like minus 30 celsius below zero. \r\n\r\nafter, i don't know how long, probably only a few seconds of rotating in this perpendicular position, this thing started to climb and right itself and \"sail\" back to the direction it originally came from. i rolled up my window, turned off my hazard lights, and started to speed up to chase it. still it seemed other motorists didn't notice this object. it still irks me to this day. as i was approaching the city limits, this object was in it's flat position again climbing over the city. then, all of a sudden, the rotating lights turned off except for a red \"aircraft like\" blinking light (which i never noticed before). after a few seconds, the rotating lights turned on again. it was like in the movie \"close encounters of the third kind\". the lights just blasted on. than after a few seconds they turned off again as it seemed to be right over the city. strange behavior. now i was exiting off of the highway on to spadina rd. i lost track of these lights because of the tall buildings. when i was on the street where i was going, i saw a cop parked on the other side of the road writing a parking ticked. i stopped in the middle of the road and ran over to him. he was quite taken aback by my seemingly aggressive approach. i asked him, \"how long have you been here?\" i forgot what he said, but i asked, \"did you see that big circle of lights flying in the sky? he said \"no\". after parking my car, i met my friends at the bar, \"baily's\", and told them what happened but they didn't take me seriously as they've already had a few and were more interested in the ladies. \r\n\r\nafter sitting at the bar by myself for a couple of hours i went home. i was living at my parent's house at the time, temporarily, so when i got home around 1 a.M., i called the police. i didn't know who else to phone at the time. they didn't take me seriously of course so after that, i phoned the toronto international airport and managed to get through to air traffic control and asked them if they had anyone call in with a ufo report. nothing. so i called the police again and convinced them to take me seriously as i wanted to make a report. they told me they can send a couple of officers to my house. as it was late and my parents were asleep, i told them i'd rather come to the station the next day to report. next morning, when i contemplated going in i decided not to, fearing they would think i'm some kind of wacko. \r\n\r\nas the days went by, scanning the newspapers looking for a \"ufo sighting\" to no avail, i started doubting myself. i was trying to convince myself that perhaps i was somehow mistaken. maybe it was something not out of the ordinary at all. maybe it was a balloon or airplane of some kind. maybe like thousands of others, i witnessed something that i misinterpreted for something else. \r\n\r\nand now the conclusion. \r\n\r\nabout a week or so later, on or about the tenth page of the toronto star, bottom right hand corner, there it was! a short article. \"dozens of mississauga residents reported a ufo as big as a football field!!!\" i don't recall the whole article. \"finally\" i said to myself. \"i knew it was real\", \"i knew i didn't imagine this\". i'll never, ever, doubt myself again no matter how much ridicule i'll be subjected to. i have only one regret however. that is i wish i had others with me to experience this. after about 27 years, i just had to let this out.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21633,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.656936,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01242010-0026","longitude":-79.3779143,"occurred":316771200000,"potentialRelations":[21632,21628],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1264399778000,"summary":"\"dozens

the left, continues to travel slowly to the right and then disappears. not sure if it is an airplane in the rain clouds. what is interesting to me is the light has to be fairly close to be seen through the clouds. the high of it is lower than an airplane would be flying, unless it was approaching the santa barbara airport, however i did not see any lights like this in my other footage. \r\n\r\n\r\ni also have another event that happened about a month ago, i was working in my garden in the evening and something made me look up, when i looked up at the hillside next to me i saw a large light moving fast for about the length of a hand in measurement when looking at the sky. after that the light disappeared, i got the feeling as if it were cloaking itself. the size of it was similar to a full moon, definitely a large object, and it was moving upward in the sky, which also seemed important. the edges were sharp, and it did not seem like light was emitting out from it, almost like someone put a sheet over it.
