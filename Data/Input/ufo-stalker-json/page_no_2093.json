 to whom it may concern,\r\n\r\n first of all, let it be known that i am not a ufo \"believer\" per say.\r\n\r\n although this occurred approximately 27 years ago, i thought it's time to report to various ufo investigation organizations. i hope this is worthy.\r\n thank you.\r\n\r\n around the winter of 1980, january perhaps, i just got off work at 9:30 p.M. from the auto dealership. i was a car salesman at the time. i started driving towards the city of toronto, canada, on the qew (queen elizabeth way) eastbound to meet some friends at a bar on the esplanad (a street lined with nightclubs). i didn't have anything to drink, medication and didn't smoke any pot. \r\n\r\nas i was driving, i noticed a string of lights slowly rotating counter clockwise over the city of toronto, at about the ten o'clock position from my point of view. this caught my eye because these formation of lights were very unusual. the lights were evidently in a circular pattern with about two thirds visible as the other third rotated out of view. imagine a pie plate with about 25 lights around the circumference of it. as this \"pie plate\" would revolve, a third of these lights would be hidden from view as if they were obstructed by a solid body. it was at night so all i could see was these rotating string of lights but they were definitely on a \"fixed\" platform as the lights were revolving in unison. \r\n\r\nalthough i've heard of ufo's and was curious, at that time in my life, i didn't really give that much thought about them. i've always been interested in nature and especially about the universe. i've seen all kinds of aircraft and advertising blimps at night before. i drove taxi's off and on for fifteen years on the night shift and have seen countless meteors, lightening, satellites etc. on two occasions i've even seen extremely bright, slow falling, green fireball meteors lighting up the ground, for a couple of seconds, as if it was daylight . i've read, in later years, were other witnesses reported green fireballs as ufo's. i chuckled to myself thinking how easily \"ufo believers\" can be fooled by natural phenomenon. \r\n\r\nanyway, these circle of lights were slowly descending and approaching towards me (westbound), while i was driving about 115 kilometers per hour on the highway (eastbound). these lights were getting closer and closer as \"we\" approached each other. i recall thinking to myself that this must be some kind of advertising balloon and those lights were letters. as i kept driving, i was paying more and more attention to this object because the closer it was getting, the more unusual it looked. i kept glancing at it, while driving, waiting until it was close enough to read what these letters were saying, still thinking it was some kind of advertising blimp. the closer it got, the more i looked at it. now at my nine o'clock position, the string of rotating lights appeared to started to bank left like an airplane would \"turning right\". actually it wasn't banking at all. it was dipping forward pointing towards the ground. at this point, i realized that these lights were not letters at all. they were different shaped, yellowish white lights. the reason these lights were different in shape was because they were \"inset\" into some solid body. when the lights were seen head on, they were circular. but as they rotated out of \"direct\" view, they changed shape like the different crescents of the moon. that's why they appeared to be all different shapes. \r\n\r\nduring the time when this object started to bank left, or i thought from my point of view, i was struggling with myself trying to understand whether this was a plane, blimp, or a balloon. it was flying too slow for a plane, yet, too fast for a blimp. also, it didn't appear to be flying or floating. the best way i can describe it's motion is that it looked like it was \"sailing\" in the sky. \r\n\r\nwhat's interesting here is that the human brain tries to associate what the eyes are seeing, to something already seen or experienced before. that's why i was at war with myself trying to decide whether this object was a plane, blimp or a balloon. every time i resigned myself to what i must be witnessing, i jumped to another conclusion. this jumping from one conclusion to another occurred during the whole experience. i was imagining all kinds of things. for example, if it was a plane, the only way these lights could have been positioned was in a circle because this plane must have had some kind of supporting structure in a circle from wing tip to wing tip. this didn't make any sense at all. i've seen advertising planes before. this was nothing like this. not even close. than i was trying to imagine a \"goodyear blimp\" with these letters going across it's side. this was nothing like it either. so here i was, trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. as i was driving, i started to slow down because i kept looking at this circle of lights more than the road ahead of me. in retrospect, i don't even know how i kept my car on the road because i was so awed by this display in the sky. \r\n\r\nhere is the killer. \r\n\r\nas the object kept dipping forward more and more, it eventually ended up totally perpendicular to the ground! the first thing that came to mind was a big ferris wheel rotating in the sky. at this point i slowed down to about 50 kph (30 miles an hour in a 60 mph highway for my american friends) and put my four way, flashing hazard lights on my car fearing that another car would crash into the back of me for going so slow on a 100 kph highway. \r\n\r\nhere is another shocker. \r\n\r\nas i was mesmerized by this strange looking object, a surge of adrenaline hit me like a ton of bricks. i didn't realize how big this thing was. at first i thought it was the size of an airplane fairly close. it was gigantic! at least twice the size of a football field, bigger than an aircraft carrier!!! i don't know what gave away it's size. maybe the reflections of light on the ground. the best way i can relate this sudden realization is like one of those illusions most of us have seen. you know, when you look at a pixel drawing with an image you can't see until you stare at it for a while? after a period of time, you make out the face of a women or something like that? that's kind of the transformation i experienced. at first i thought the object was the size of a large plane than suddenly i really saw it. it was huge!!! i yelled out loud to my self, \"holey f**k, it's huge!!!\". i don't f***ing believe it, it's f***ing huge!!!. i thought it was fairly close at first, than bang!, it was much farther away and larger than my brain first comprehended it. speaking about this surge of adrenaline. have you ever had a really close call having a car accident? when your heart rate skyrockets to about 180 beats per minute? that's what i felt when i realized how gargantuan this object was! i could actually feel my heart pounding like crazy. to be frank, it literally scared the hell out of me, when i realized how big it was. at this point, i rolled down my window and pointed to this giant \"ferris wheel\" in the sky to the other motorists, but it appeared no one seemed to notice as they screamed by me at regular highway speeds. i remember how cold it was when i rolled down my window. it was something like minus 30 celsius below zero. \r\n\r\nafter, i don't know how long, probably only a few seconds of rotating in this perpendicular position, this thing started to climb and right itself and \"sail\" back to the direction it originally came from. i rolled up my window, turned off my hazard lights, and started to speed up to chase it. still it seemed other motorists didn't notice this object. it still irks me to this day. as i was approaching the city limits, this object was in it's flat position again climbing over the city. then, all of a sudden, the rotating lights turned off except for a red \"aircraft like\" blinking light (which i never noticed before). after a few seconds, the rotating lights turned on again. it was like in the movie \"close encounters of the third kind\". the lights just blasted on. than after a few seconds they turned off again as it seemed to be right over the city. strange behavior. now i was exiting off of the highway on to spadina rd. i lost track of these lights because of the tall buildings. when i was on the street where i was going, i saw a cop parked on the other side of the road writing a parking ticked. i stopped in the middle of the road and ran over to him. he was quite taken aback by my seemingly aggressive approach. i asked him, \"how long have you been here?\" i forgot what he said, but i asked, \"did you see that big circle of lights flying in the sky? he said \"no\". after parking my car, i met my friends at the bar, \"baily's\", and told them what happened but they didn't take me seriously as they've already had a few and were more interested in the ladies. \r\n\r\nafter sitting at the bar by myself for a couple of hours i went home. i was living at my parent's house at the time, temporarily, so when i got home around 1 a.M., i called the police. i didn't know who else to phone at the time. they didn't take me seriously of course so after that, i phoned the toronto international airport and managed to get through to air traffic control and asked them if they had anyone call in with a ufo report. nothing. so i called the police again and convinced them to take me seriously as i wanted to make a report. they told me they can send a couple of officers to my house. as it was late and my parents were asleep, i told them i'd rather come to the station the next day to report. next morning, when i contemplated going in i decided not to, fearing they would think i'm some kind of wacko. \r\n\r\nas the days went by, scanning the newspapers looking for a \"ufo sighting\" to no avail, i started doubting myself. i was trying to convince myself that perhaps i was somehow mistaken. maybe it was something not out of the ordinary at all. maybe it was a balloon or airplane of some kind. maybe like thousands of others, i witnessed something that i misinterpreted for something else. \r\n\r\nand now the conclusion. \r\n\r\nabout a week or so later, on or about the tenth page of the toronto star, bottom right hand corner, there it was! a short article. \"dozens of mississauga residents reported a ufo as big as a football field!!!\" i don't recall the whole article. \"finally\" i said to myself. \"i knew it was real\", \"i knew i didn't imagine this\". i'll never, ever, doubt myself again no matter how much ridicule i'll be subjected to. i have only one regret however. that is i wish i had others with me to experience this. after about 27 years, i just had to let this out.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21628,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.655946,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-01242010-0021","longitude":-79.3766843,"occurred":316848600000,"potentialRelations":[44257,21633,21632],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1264393596000,"summary":"\"dozens

air force base to the north (lrafb) and an arkansas national guard station. i am a fan of air shows and can generally identify an aircraft by the sound it makes. c-130 and blackhawk helicopters are the norm for this area, although we have an occasional visit by an a-10 warthog and once i heard the distinctive sound of an osprey going over. i learned that sound by visiting the marine corps naval air station at camp lejuene north carolina.\r\n\r\nthe day this occurred, i knew it was something unusual. it sounded to me like whatever it was was flying very low and i went outside to look. oddly, even though the sound was reverberating, i could not spot what it was and gave up after a minute of staring at the partly cloudy sky.\r\n\r\nthat evening, a good friend of mine called to tell me she had seen a trio of b-2 stealth bombers flying over north little rock, very high up, and trailed by something unusual that seemed to swing in a pendulum-like fashion behind the planes. i immediately suspected what time this took place and after she confirmed it, i wished desperately that i had tried harder to get a glimpse.\r\n\r\ni have known this person for over 25 years and i know her to be exact and meticulous in everything she does and says. \r\n\r\ni have heard a stealth bomber bofore, but never this loud. unless there was something unusual about the weather conditions that magnified the sound of these three planes, then there should not have been that much of a rumble from them at the height she was describing.\r\n\r\ni truly wish that i had taken more time to see what it was that was trailing them. perhaps that is the explanation for the loudness of the sound. i can tell you that it was so pervasive that i could not pinpoint a direction to look for them and knowing now where her vantage point was and where they actually flew, i can state that it was not anywhere near the direction i was assuming. i was searcing standard flight paths that the local bases tended to take. \r\n\r\ni would be most interested to hear if anyone else saw or heard anything ususual on that

from earth. i noticed it because it was, briefly, about three times as intense as the other stars in the sky. as soon as i noticed it, the light began to dim out and was no longer visible within a 2-3 second period. a moment later another bright light moved over us, this one much brighter, apparently moving faster, and apparently much closer to the ground. there were no other lights on it, and what

(non-alcohol music venue),i saw in the northern sky, a large glow of muted orange light. it was behind the treetops, and looked to be a few miles away. only the \"bottom half\" was showing, as a setting sun does when it sinks below a cloud, but it seemed perfectly stationary. the bottom edge was well delineated,perfectly round, but the top(if, indeed it was a sphere or disk), seemed shrouded in cloud. i walked along the walkway out front, finding a better place to see it between the trees, saying,\"what the heck is that? my boyfriend said,\"that's the moon\", whereupon i pointed to the actual half-moon, high, bright white, and to the left of us. i ran into the building to tell our host. he came out and said \"maybe it's the moon\", as did nearly everyone else who looked at it. my boyfriend said \"it's a planet\". i said. \"if that's a planet, we're in deep #%&*. it could have been mistaken for the moon, as it was just a bit smaller than the moon from our perspective. but like i said, the moon was already there. i was rather excited to be seeing such a mysterious thing, but nobody else seemed to be. one or two people sang the theme to \"twilight zone\" as they got in their cars and left, but that was about it. they all saw it when i pointed it out, though.  \r\n   we got in the car and drove around to find a place we could see it better, but we didn't see it from anywhere else. we came back to the building (it sits on a slight hill just barely away from the orange streetlights so prevalent here. in fact, i thought it could be one of those lights at first, but too high, much too large at the distance it seemed to be, and the wrong shape and not quite the right color). on the approach to the driveway, i could see the \"object\", and once we got up to where i had first seen it, i could tell it was in the same place as before. \r\n  i wanted to stay and see if this thing would move, or \"do something\", but it was late, so we left. i looked out the window the whole way home, and didn't see it again.  \r\n    could it have been an atmospheric reflection of the moon? (the positions/angles of the two objects wouldn't have matched in a reflection, in my opinion). could it even have been a large solid sphere reflecting the streetlights at the bottom and not the top?\r\n  oddly enough, i saw another sky phenomenon from the same place, in november or december 2009, a meteor, but not like any i've ever seen before, close and slow moving with twin tails, a bright spot in front and the trails were a golden color. i was the only witness to it that i know of. the reason i noticed the orange glow is that now i'm in the habit of looking at the sky from there after seeing the \"meteor\" back then. \r\n   by the way, my boyfriend is a real skeptic and even he thought the orange glow was bizarre. \r\n  i have had a few other odd experiences, dreams or sightings over the years, all different.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":21616,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.2275833,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01242010-0009","longitude":-70.9351184,"occurred":1264311000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Disc,   Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1264357766000,"summary":"Dusky orangehalf-visible orb or sphere in northern sky, very large, 1/4 inch at arm's length","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Weymouth, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:152919"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Mt.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While returning from work one evening in early 1979, driving alone toward west chester on marshallton-thorndale road, a road familiar to me, i suddenly came upon a huge, illuminated, silent disk hovering above a field to my left, maybe 40-50' above field and the scrub trees that bordered the field.  i had driven that road regularly over the previous six months and knew that nothing was being built in that empty horse pasture.  the section of road where it appeared was, at that time, just a dark, narrow, paved, 2-lane country road with no berm, and with no streetlights nor houses anywhere nearby.  there was no oncoming traffic.  it was in the dead of winter, at a time when it was already almost dark when i left work in coatesville at 5pm.\r\n\r\nit was my habit to listen to the car radio while driving home, so the radio was probably turned on to the philadelphia 24-hour news station.  but when i saw the huge round/oval \"thing\" hovering above the field, i was auditorily aware only of silence.  i can only assume that at some point the radio went dead, but i had no awareness of the radio sound disappearing at the time, probably because my attention was riveted on that strange, bright disk in the air.  all i was aware of was that that that \"thing\" seemed very close to my car, too close for comfort, and that for as huge as it was, hanging motionless in the air there, it was absolutely silent.\r\n\r\ni am very bad at estimating sizes and distances without having something nearby with which to make comparison, but i would say that the disk was very large, but smaller than a football field.  i could only see the bottom, and had no sense of whether the sides were boxed or came down to a > on the edge.  the bottom of the disk was so evenly illuminated that you could not see bright spots where bulbs would have been.  it was just a huge solid, glowing white disk.\r\n\r\ni couldn't be sure if it was round or slightly oval, because i was looking up at it from off to the side.\r\n\r\nthe strangest part of all to me was that, although the bottom of the disk (the only part i could see) was completely lit in a pure white light of comfortable brightness, it cast no illumination upon the trees or ground beneath it!  \r\n\r\ni don't recall whether i accellerated or decellerated to the t-intersection about a 1/2 mile ahead where i had to make a left-hand turn, but i think i held my breath as i got there and made the turn onto strasburg road heading toward the town of west chester.  i remember somehow feeling \"safe\" that i made it to strasburg, which was a much more heavily travelled street than marshallton-thorndale road.  i do recall driving very slowly after i made the turn, crawling along so i could look at that field to my left from the vantage point of the other road.  but what i saw was -- absolutely nothing!  the field and the air above it were completely empty.  in a matter of a minute or less than a minute, the \"thing\" had disappeared, evaporated, gone.\r\n\r\ni continued my journey home, each mile of the way feeling more and more relieved to have \"escaped\" unharmed.  at that time ufos were not a big item in my life.  i had heard about them but wasn't sure if they were real or just figments of overactive imaginations.  i had never read much about the topic and was, quite frankly, not interested in them.  i had never imagined previously that i would ever have any type of encounter with a ufo, because i never thought about them at all.  however, immediately when i saw the disk, i thought it was a ufo from another planet.  it was the silence of it that seemed so unearthly.  \r\n\r\nmy overall feelings during the encounter were ones of excitement tinged with fear.  afterwards other emotions emerged, mostly embarrassment.  there was also a little bit of pride that i had been somehow chosen to see this revelation.  however, i told no one, not a single soul, about this experience for several years.  the main reason for my silence was that my work was in the mental health field, and i did not want to be seen or teased as \"crazy\" for talking about such an experience.  and, in addition, there was no one in my life at that time whom i felt deserved to learn about this special encounter.  \r\n\r\nthis event happened such a long time ago -- 31 years ago.  i've written here every possible aspect of the encounter and all my feelings about it.  it was a momentary event in my life, probably less than two minutes out of what is now going on 70 years.  but it did make a strong impression upon me.  the reason i looked up your website to tell you about this tonight is that this evening i just listened for the first time to a member of mufon on the renseradio.Com.\r\n\r\ni don't mind being contacted by a mufon, but i really don't want to talk to others about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

was the first night that i was there after having rented a cottage for the whole season.\r\nafter having finished unpacking, i said to myself, now, i am gone to rest now and have a look outside, and then i told jokingly to myself: '' to see if i see some ufo ? ''\r\n\r\nthen i open the door to look outside, and then, right away, i see a huge ball of fire crossing at the speed of a meteorite from the right to the left of the sky, crossing the whole horizon in a split second, and following a perfectly straight horizontal trajectory !!!\r\nit left behind a bright fiery trace in a perfectly straight horizontal line that persisted a few second after the fireball like ufo had passed and continue behind the trees. \r\n\r\nthat was quite a starter !\r\n\r\nduring this summer of 2009, there was innumerable ufo showing almost every starry night . \r\n\r\nit started very progressively, every night i went to the circular landing area on the side of the road. after a few weeks of no ufo at all, then some started to appear, here and then, but in a very discrete and dissimulated manner. \r\n\r\nthen, night after night, there was more ufo that the preceding night.\r\nwith the many groups of people who came visit the matawini site for the first time in modern history, as i had expected, the ufo sighting would amplify. all these people where to some degree spiritually and ufo aware.\r\n\r\nthen, this progression in the number of sightings continued to the point, that every clear and starry night, there was an almost constant flow of ufo appearance, between 12 to 20 ufo appearing every nights, with a great variety of type and manner of appearance and behaviour. at a point, i had to go to sleep, but it certainly would have continued far in the night if i could have stayed outside all night. \r\n\r\n2012 countdown clock of ufo  over matawini site:\r\ni saw again the same 2012 countdown clock of ufo that was described in the book blue star prophecy of miriam delicado, and that i saw in montreal a few years ago.\r\n\r\nit was almost exactly the same, a series of 6 ufo's started to appear one after the other, in a perfectly precise circular configuration representing the left side of a clock from the 6 to 12 hour. the first ufo appeared starting at the bottom and then a second one at the 7h position and another following at the 8h. then 9h. and so on until a 6th. ufo appeared in the top position of the clock for the 12th. hour, representing the year 2012. then, i saw another ufo crossing the sky in a straight line at great speed and leaving a trace of light behind. the direction and angle of the trajectory of this ufo in the night sky, was pointing exactly toward the circular ufo lift off area that is located further away on the side of the road, and that is located where the spherical stone appeared in a powerful lightning strike spiritual experienced that happened with my girlfriend as we were coming back from a visit to the sacred cave of matawini...\r\n\r\nthe very numerous ufo presence at the site, for the first summer,\r\ntells me that the galactic federation is now  very aware of the matawini site and may have followed closely all the new discoveries that i have made. \r\n\r\ni consider their massive showing during all the 2009 summer season indicates that the matawini site is now officially under the protection of the galactic federation of light. \r\n\r\nthis is some real good news. i now remember that i had foreseen this in my prayers and seed-visions for the future. often i have given the permission to the galactic federation to use the sacred site as a safe harbour for them, and that as an ambassador of the aware civilization of earth, i called for their armada to come in great number and use this sacred site as they see fit for their operations. they again have answered my call and prayers.\r\n\r\nufo farewell message received  the last night at matawini:\r\nthe last night at the matawini cottage,  just after i finished packing\r\nthe car and i was ready to go back to montreal, i then lifted my head to the stars and asked: '' will you come pick me at the matawini landing site before the hard times start rolling, so i can continue my mission after 2012 ?''  and then, right away, instantly a ufo showed up clearly as an answer to my question, a positive one.\r\n\r\nthen i asked: '' will you pick me up at the parc close to where i live in\r\nmontreal where a crop circle appeared when the blue katchina comet exploded in size,  if i am there when things start to go difficult and i cannot surviv, and again immediately another ufo showed, in a positive answer.\r\n\r\ni feel it is the best possible outcome so my knowledge about the important discoveries that have been made at the matawini site is not lost, and that they can be fully put to contribution during and after the ascension of 2012.\r\n\r\n(the 3 photos annexed to this report, are of some of the megalithic dolmens that i have discovered on the matawini sacred site during the 2009 summer season. these dolmens are very ancient, and have been sculpted and brought on the matawini sacred site by celestrials civilizations, advanced spiritual extraterrestrial civilizations during an ancient colonization area of this planet. )\r\n\r\n\r\nmay the great spirit sun shine in our hearts\r\n\r\nastraelia\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or
