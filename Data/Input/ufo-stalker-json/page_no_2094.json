was 12 years old, my brother two years younger, my cousin three years younger than me. as i put the games on the shelf, i looked out the window & my brother & cousin were standing in the front yard watching this light across the highway hovering over the woods/trees. i ran out to observe it too. our house was on one of the most busy highways. it had all the main traffic in the rural area..The truck traffic, everything, this was before the interstate was built,so traffic was always constant. taking mental notes of alot of the surroundings during this sighting, i noticed no traffic was going by & no neighbors were outside in their yards from our viewpoint. we three watched the huge light for quite a bit. i knew my parents were in the garage at that moment. my dad was working with some power tools at the time. he & my mom were having a dicussion. i ran to the garage & i begged them to come to see the ufo. at that moment, my dad was also mad because his power tools were not working properly..Power was going on and off. i screamed \"it's because of the ufo\"! not convincing them to look, i ran back to the front yard with my brother & cousin. we contunied to watch it. the object just hovered over the treetops, very low. as for distance, i cannot correctly say what the distance was. but the woods it hovered over is an area we had played in many times so it was close, & very visible from our front yard. the object was as bright as anything i had ever seen, orange/red light that was disc shaped. the size was huge, like a football field. it glowed very bright againest the dusk colored summer sky. it seemly had a pulsating effect to it, but no sound. we contunied to watch and suddenly the object just blinked out..So to say. in a snap, it all seemed to go to the center, to like a dot, then it was gone. we didn't see the object again. the length of time of the sighting had to be at least 10 minutes..Plus. this is all very vivid to me and embeded in my memory. i do not believe there was any time lost during this event. i remember during the event having a feeling like it may have been just for us to see.

anyone about. they are. on tuesday morning 6 35a.M. i stepp'd out for my morning \"pray'r\" walk. i have been doing this faithfully every morning since 2007. i walk and converse with the god of the universe. my dog, tiphani escorts me. i live right next to a complex of baseball fields. i always walk between  the fields. on tuesday, i look'd up toward the western sky and one of the large planets was position'd at 4 o clock in the sky. a traveling circle appear'd in the sky just shy of the same position and to the north. it travel'd right beneath the large planet and then disappear'd. at first it appear'd to fade in and out as if traveling through a haze but the early morning sky was perfectly clear.\r\ni stood still and watched it for about 35 seconds and when it cross'd beneath the planet, it disappear'd. i stood there and watched for a bit longer and nothing reappeared.\r\n\r\nthe thing that makes this sighting interesting is that \"first of all, i immediately thought i am going to observe this fully so that i can report it.\"\r\nwhich i did.\r\n\r\nnoting the height in the sky and the direction it traveled in-north west-to west.\r\n\r\nof course, when  objects disappear you can never swear you saw anything, there is no left proof.\r\n\r\ni continued my walk and pray'r time to the deep-dark woods where i kneel and pray to a sovereign supra-natural god.\r\n\r\non this morning, i experienced an odd vision-trance-awareness.\r\nwhere i kneel is a large hill that juts up from a low meadow of trees and a small creek flows at the base of the cliff.\r\n\r\ni kneel always with my back to the cliff and the small, babbling stream.\r\nthis morning, i didn't so much pray aloud as i was in motion to god. i raised my arms, i stretched them to the heavens and then dropp'd them to my side.\r\n\r\nin my mind, i was aware of a mighty presence of an angel shadowing my every move, when i raised my arms,he raised his mighty wings into the air behind me, when i waved my arms, he glided his wings in tandem with my movements. \r\n\r\nthe fantastical awareness is that this angelic being was so huge. it fill'd up a huge amount of space and simultaneously was not there at all.\r\n\r\nmagnificent was the presence.\r\ni knew it was sheltering me, providing me with security.\r\n\r\n\r\nthese things are never explainable or rational, they are.\r\n\r\nlater on tuesday evening, i was giving a young friend a ride home from a dinner, and we were traveling 70 mph. on i-35. i noted in my rear view mirror the presence of a car weaving eratically behind me.\r\nmy young friend was talking and oblivious. suddenly i re-focused on the road to my front and saw that all the cars on the interstate had come a dead-halt and i was within feet of crashing into the car before me.\r\n\r\nmiraculously, i swerved and the lane next to mine was stopp'd a bit more ahead and my reflexes braked and uncannily, i was able to stop my car in a miraculous short amount of distance.\r\n\r\ni was not scared.\r\ni was not in control.\r\n\r\nin hindsight, i think all of this is related.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

roofline of my car. by the time i had traveled 1/2 mile down the road toward a bend in the road, the object abruptly vanished. i looked around to see whether i had lost track of it, or it had moved. there was plenty of light in the sky (not yet dusk) and it was nowhere to be seen. no contrail, no object with perhaps the light facing another direction. there is no possibility that i missed it, the light was simply too intense. perhaps someone was perpetrating a prank and hung a mercury vapor lamp on a balloon, however the sky was clear (only a few stratus clouds) and there were no other objects in the area. the only thing i noticed was a pair of short, vertical black smoke contrails to the w that i had not previously seen. however, these were in a different part of the sky from where the

by us, it's huge and flashing all kinds of lights.\" \r\n\r\nnow he doesn't believe in aliens and ufo's like i do so i assumed he was teasing me. so i didn't bother to try and look to his side cause

to bevmo and on the way home i took ave 51 instead of 52 and i saw it. it was the hugest ufo, very close to the car. it reminded me of a mothership or something due to it's size and all the lights. that turned on and off almost in a sequence as if communicating. i lowered my wondow and drove about 35 cause i was in awe. there were a couple cars pulled over and i wanted to pull over but the fact it was so close freaked me out. then all of a sudden in a split second it was super up high and then we reached a blockade and there were cops and other people that turned us down polo rd. i kept looking in my rear view mirror trying to see it. then when i turned down ave 52 to get back home i saw it but it was much further away, past the polo fields and then it just vanished.\r\n\r\nnow we know what we saw, and it was something we will never forget. it left me out of sorts and it made chris a believer. it was about 9 at night and even though it was dark there were lights around and i could see it's saturn like shape. the light were huge and some would turn on in a sequence and then they would go black and others would start up. and not just one color there were many flashing. i felt a strange vibration or humming. but then again i was driving and it could've just been me. till today i still feel like i saw it for a reason and i now have no doubt that they are out there. i kinda felt like i was meant to see it. like somehow i picked up on where to go for it to show itself to us.\r\n\r\ni know it's strange right????","distance":"21-100

me form your office. i received your mailings and reported several of my sightings to an attorney beckman in manchester ct, as well as the mufo director in miami, (who was very nice) i contacted your director in tn in 2008. i also attended a ufo member discussion in ft myers fl in 1994 where symbols and my encounters were sent up for review and found to be of some merit, \"i was told anyway. in short my family has been haunted by ufo���s our entire life from the time i and my younger brother were abducted in 1966. i have for the past 20 years tried very heard to talk with mufo and or of someone that can help me. if there is any doubt, i will cover any and all expenses to uncover and or solidify what i have to seen. i can recall the inside of the craft, i watched a fire ball the size of a vw come out of the sky as almost nothing then burst into a ball of fire, and only 50 yards above the ground and then turn on a 90, pick up speed to a good 70 ��� 100 miles an hour, rise up to clear a 2 story home and then dive into a wooded lot to simply vanish. i have seen cigar shaped ufos, hover over our car with my grand-mother and friends, a boomerang shaped ufo that first showed it���s self like the moon before intensifying and shooting directly to the ground in a seconds time and not 100 yards from me in glastonbury ct. my brother and i were taken from a farm house in sheffield mass in 1966 - 1968, more than once. i remember a tall guy/? in the huge helmet, on board, two operating boards that looked like it had brail on the top of it, there was screen were they showed me images, of a lake, water and willow trees, they were trying to tell me somthing. i can also tell you about the day we lost a good 4 - 6 hours while with my brother, mother & grandmother to find my granmother confused and walking around in a daze in a near by store down the street, and my mother out cold in the front of the car. hair will rises on my arms when i here the sound of peepers like you here outside in the trees, it's a sound from that night. my son wakes up with nose bleeds, as he has for years, steet lights pop weekly, i still have the feeling i have seen something of importance as a child, and i'm drawn to look up, at the right times, too see a ship. there have been numerous times i have known them to be near me, i can not put dates to it, nor can i separate this added mush,(if that's a word) and if that makes any sense. i can however remember pretty clear the first few times i was with them, i remember standing outside the craft, the two consoles, the hall behind me, the wall that showed the images, the guy in the space suite to my left, the one (gray if you will) that was also standing next to me and the other gray next to my brother about 12 feet behind me in a hallway to my right. i drew the symbols and had giving them to this group i attended in ft myers i still remember some of it. similar in the way of a few crop circles but simple and only a few lines and dots apposed to circles. i would like to add, my father was a mayer in ct, my mother ran a raido station, i was with entergy power & honeywel, with that said my father did not like to talk about this do to his position with the city,he has passed on.\r\n                               vipontv@gmail.Com\r\nlocations:\r\n\r\n1/\tsheffield ma: abducted w/brother, showed images,
