around 1 am central time, i saw a line of light about an inch long in the sky above my apartment building bast the clouds.  it interested me because it was a straight line of light too far to be a reflection.  i initially mistook it for a comet.  after thinking about it i went back out to see if it was still there.  it had dimmed, but also brightened as i looked at it.  so i came inside to get a camera to see if anything would appear on film.  after it flashed, the light in the sky got really bright, and a distinct shape appeared.  along the shape, another light flashed at me.  next thing i know there is a new star in the sky.\r\n \r\ni'm writing to document, not to be a crack or quack.  i'm serious about what i saw and it really shook me.  i know mufon investegates this sort of thing,

sands naval base. at the time i was in school in the town of kekaha, kauai. we was called out of class to observe humpback whales spouting out near the boey. i observed a flash out of the corner of my eye towards the direction of barking sands naval base. beings my dad was in charge of security of the base, i especially took note of the flashing. normally that would not be abnormal to see activity beings it is a naval base, but somethign about this struck me wrong. i waited till dad got off work to question him as to what happened. he got home at about 16:30 or so, and i immediatelly questioned him about the activity. at first he remained hesitant about what happened. after much prying i was informed from him that at that time a u.F.O. had appeared between the islands of kauai, and nijiau.The object showed up on radar and immediatelly contact was attempted through radio to no avail. upon no response the base commander dispatched 3-f 14 tomcats to intercept . the f-14s formed a triangle around the object, one on top, another on the side starboard side, and one port side of the object. they then started forcing the ufo down towards the water in the attempt to make it surrender or communicate, to no avail. finaly they forced it down in the channel between the 2 islands to which it sank to the bottom of the sea in about 12,000 feet of water. interestlly enough about 3 days later a soviet salvage vessel showed up and tried to (drag) the bottom of the sea to snag the ufo. it was unable to get it, and recieved offical protests from the united states government, due to the proxemity to u.S. territorial waters. besides this i dont know anythingmore about the occurance.   i will though  say i know more about other occurances, personally, and from my dad on other military contracts. i am former u.S.N. honorablly discharged, and believe in homeland security, absolutelly. this particualar incident occured a long time ago and no classified material was disclosed. i have personally seen 2 u.F.Os in my life and my mother has seen one, up close and personal. literally withing 20 feet or so when she was younger. in her case the u.F.O was cigar shaped and landed in a close by wheat field, near her home at the time. it stayed their for a while and left fast. it fried the wheat clear donw to the ground. my dad was just beggining in the fire fighting field at that time and had access to geiger counters, when he heard what happened, that day after getting home he got a geiger counter and went out to the area of the ufo. the geiger counter was off the scale. the reading was highly radioactive. will submit this for now, i know of more but truthfully i am afraid. my dad is eaten up with cancer atm, and afraid i will cause him trouble , disclosing this info.But i feel i owe it to him atm, he has held this in for a long time so am merelly disclosing it for him, (without his knowledge), thanks

it approached the car it rose slightly and came up over the drivers side front fender, glowing brightly, and passed by my open window within five feet of my head at eye level. i looked directly at it but could see no surface detail at all, only the bright glow. it passed my window and i jerked my head around to watch where it went and it continued the same wavy motion following the road behind me from whence i came, continuing on, following the road until it went around a curve out of our sight.  there was no sound at all. i estimate the speed it was traveling to be about twenty five miles an

standing there i looked up at the night sky, which was very clear with a lot of stars being shown.  there's a military airfield near by, and often times at night airplanes can be seen flying over head, and it helps pass the time watching them.  on this particular occasion i had saw what i believed to be just a normal airplane flying over head in the distance, slightly above where orions belt would be. \r\n\r\nwhat made this object different than any other ones i saw was the rapidly changing color of light.  it had a stark bright white color to it, but you could see it change colors very rapidly (kind of like a flashing led) between red first, blue, and than green.  as i watched this object i saw it clearly go from just moving straight across to going down almost like a slant, following orions belt.  it vanished momentarily, but i could still follow it by the faint flashing light.\r\n\r\nit had than made it's stop near a radio tower that stands right across from me. the radio tower has a series of red lights that will flash on and off in order to warn incoming planes.  in this particular case the object which i saw was \"standing\" near the lowest point of the light, which is rather odd for something that would be an aircraft, not to mention it was just sitting there.\r\n\r\ni watched the object for approximately 15 minutes as it just stood there, flashing it's colors very rapidly.  at that point my break was over, and i figured it was just a star, or my mind playing tricks on me, so i headed back inside.\r\n\r\nafter that night i continued to watch the sky, trying to see if i could find the object again to assure my self that it was in fact a star, how ever i had no such luck spotting it again.\r\n\r\nthe reason i am just reporting it now is because i wanted to make sure it was not a star, and also because i was listening to a podcast that had reported similar events in other

saw a very bright glittering orb and then looked at it with binoculars. it transformed into a moving cord swirling and whirling rapidly in different directions, flashing brilliant light as it moved. after awhile, it stopped moving and transformed back into the sphere and under it you can see a rectangular form with spots of light on it. by naked eye, this looks like a vertical tail below the orb. i have watched these orbs since 6/27 every clear night i can. they are all over the sky in all directions. they cloak major stars and planets and appear in their sky positions. examples are jupiter, mars, betelgeuse, rigel, syrius, middle star in orion belt. the orbs react to my putting attention on them (esp. gratitude/love) by beginning to stir and move. i can see their movement with the naked eye and it appears sometimes to move 1-2 inches back and forth which must be a vast distance in space. they are the size of a star so they are quite a distance away. a cloudy night will hide them so they are higher than the earth's cloud cover. they seem to all be in 3 colors: white, orange or multi rainbow colors.  mars & betelgeuse are orange, rigel is white and syrius is rainbow colored. their light is brighter than the stars and it often flashes, so it catches the eye. i speculate that the rectangular shape below them might be a type of ship.  they all have that configuration.  i live in a small town (6,500) south of i20 near the louisiana border. barksdale afb is approximately 75-100 miles east of here. i have some digital photos of the orbs and even some videos. they are not expert quality as my digital camera has only a 30x zoom and the photos do not capture the beautiful bright light of the orbs. i don't know what type of video camera would be able to photograph them adequately.  i speculate that the forms they take could be hyperspace language (jim sparks & stewart swerdlow websites). i wish i could videotape the movements in order to break it down into frames and study them to see what the sequence of shapes might mean to someone who reads hyperspace. once i was attempting to photograph them and for some reason, the orb did not want me to do so.  my battery would go as soon as i tried to take the first photo.  i went through several batteries and it continued to blow them so i stopped trying. other times, the orb seemed to accept my photographing it and would move and swirl rapidly while i was taping it.  i definitely feel there is a connection when i put my attention on them.  i am very sensitive to energies and i only feel positive energy from them.

told me it was standard practice.\r\n\r\nas i watched the stars just start to come out that cold blue sky, the missile pads are well let to the north and patrick afb to my right is lit up as well.  i continued to watch the the helecoptor with it running lights on shinging down on the capsule crew below it, when above the helecoptor i saw an increadable fast light what i thought was a star at first

my binoculars.  it was fantastic! at least i thought since i was 15 years old.  no sooner had the helecoptor started for cape canaveral when i looked to my right and saw two jets with full after burners on from patrick afb heading for the helecoptor with the bright ball of fire following it.  as fast as it took me to turn my attention back to the activity out in front of me, the jets were gaining on the bright ball of fire, and it took off straight up like a flash of lightning and the jets were climbing after it.  i was amazed at how fast that fire ball went up and away, it was like the jets were just being toyed with.  during the incident some one had gone and called patrick afb military up and as we started to leave the beach and not one person spoke up about what just happened. an mp vehicles from patrick afb pulled up and took statements from everyone who was watching the whole thing.  this type of incident happened over the years in coca beach many times and just

objects. and i saw very mean men in blue uniform like a soldiers but there were not us army but some kind unknown fearful-evil secret \"organization\". i fund later on davick icke web site very similar photo of a man in blue military look a like uniform and david desribed it as \"secret military\".\r\n\r\nit is good that there are brave people -mufon that are searching for the truth. \r\nmy deep feeling is that all these objects that people see they are made not for the good of humanity. people must be very aware of those objects and they must run away very fast from them with the prayers on their lips.\r\nplease, continue to do research as you do. \r\nit is nessesary to warn people about possible great danger that is coming sooner or later for the whole humanity.\r\nplease do not put my testimony in public. my english in not that good.\r\ni do not have any proof for it. you can just add to your record because it is true what i wrote. i am very religious catholic and i would like to give this testimony to help to prove that these flying objects are not imagination or halucination-but they are real.\r\n\r\nwith a great respect to you,\r\nmay god bless you and guide you to find the truth, that possibly would save lifes and souls,\r\nvioletta kos","distance":"101-500

and invited me to see the planet jupiter and its close proximity to the moon.We stood in dark facing west.She  was explaining that a night or so before, the sliver of moonlight was even thinner and the planet was even closer.The moon was approx 40 degrees off the horizon in the southwestern sky and the planet was left of the moon at approx 10 o-clock.Both of us while looking in that direction saw an object appear [to the right of the moon]that could be at first thought called a \"shooting star\".We agree that it could be described as falling to the horizon for 2-3 seconds,the diameter of two  stars, and the brightness of an incandescent light fading to orange.Holding my thumb out at arms length over the moon,i would say it appeared at 1:o-clock and disappeared [dropped to the horizon]at 5:30 at approx. two hand widths to the right of the moon.We expected to hear a crash and it to be found between otsego mi, and lake michigan.\r\nmy wife's impression is that it didn't disappear as much as fade out and she detected a silhouette continuing to the horizon.I thought it was a re-entry capsule and the crescent light at the bottom was just like an artist rendition of a re-entry capsule.There was no trailing light or \"tail\".View time 3 seconds.\r\ni assume we're not the only people that saw it.What ever it was.It was impressive.That's not to say that the new moon and jupiter aren't a great opening act.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

on about oct 21 2009. i was leaving for work at about 5:25 am. it was rather cool,and the sky was very clear. all of the stars lite up the morning sky. as usual i looked for some of the more common star formations. i easily spotted the big dipper. the problem was,there were what looked like two other stars right in the middle of what i would call the pot. i couldn't remember there being stars in the middle? not noticable anyway. if you held your hand out towards the stars. they seemed about 2 inches apart. then one of the,ok i have to say it! ufo,s moved very fast about another 2 inches from the other,and stopped. the first ufo moved very fast to about where the first had been. the first ufo moved again. this time at an angle away from the first move. the second ufo seemed to being trying to get close to the first. for again very quickly it moved to the location the other had been. then the first ufo took off very quickly increasing speed until it vanished. the second ufo took off as well following the first. until it's speed made it vanish as well. did anyone else see it? i'am 47,no mental problems,and work as a millwright.Let me know.
