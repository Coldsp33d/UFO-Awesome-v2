it was beautiful outside. nothing was out of the ordinary. when covering all the land over on the farm we continued to walk through the woods back to the house, no flash lights. when we were about 200 feet into the woods i noticed a very low flying object. i immidatly thought it was a plane because i saw three lights in the shape of a triangle. but this craft seemed to hover. it moved slowly, and quietly. what was strange about the craft was the sound. it sounded like a clean burning engine \"from out of this world\" like a fan on low. but the feeling it gave off was different. as if standing infront of a loud bass amp on full blast. pretned that this bass amp was on so loud it made your stomach turn vibrations could be felt in your feet, your ears, your eyes, your chest. but no immidate sound was around. just as if we were laying on a generator or something. it moved quietly infront of us, but behind trees. in a small clearing in the tree line all of our discriptions matched to perfection. the craft had three somewhat large white lights on the bottom of the craft along with one red, plasma like light in the middle of the craft. and it also looked like something was hanging out of the bottom, like a large tube (large in width, not length) the very front did not have any navigation lights, and there were no green lights. the verry back of the craft had 3 small white lights extremely bright surrounded by blue (this is very hard to discribe) it moved toward a local highway then it slowed down dramatically and turned toward the feilds in which we walked through, it could still be heard in the woods echoing everywhere. this was not our first experience with .. what we like to camm them \"our friends\" but we were in complete shock, as i saw that same looking ship or craft on tv hours before, talking about a triangle shaped craft in illinois in which 4 or 5 people saw. we lit up a cigg and walked home trying to think of plausable excusses for it. none were found.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

north little rock. i was standing between the gas pump and my car under the awning covering the pump area.\r\n\r\ni began hearing a loud, and i do mean loud, constant low bass noise coming from the sky. i stepped in a northerly direction to get out from under the awning, which was blocking my view of the sky and looked up. i continued looking at the sky for a minute or two and did not see anything.\r\n\r\nthen i saw 3 aircraft flying about as high as i think the human eye could detect them. they were triangular in shape and flying in a triangular formation. they were dark green or gray in color. i'll continue with the story in a just a moment. i need to digress briefly.\r\n\r\ni told my husband about what i had seen when we were both home late afternoon. he went to the computer and showed me various images. the image of the b2 bomber looked similar to the 3 planes in formation.\r\n\r\ni was curious about what the 3 planes were, but they are not the subject of this report. what was following them is the subject of this report.\r\n\r\nright behind the 3 planes was something i couldn't exactly determine the color of. it may have had a silver reflection to it, but at the altitude these 3 planes were, it was difficult to get a lot of detail. the weather was partly sunny with some clouds in the sky.\r\n\r\nwhat i found very strange about this whatever that was following the squadron was its pattern of flying. it was flying north, just like the 3 planes. however, it was moving back and forth right to left, left to right as it flew north. the movement reminded me of a pendulum on an old-time clock. imagine the lowest point on the clock's pendulum as a dot and then follow that dot as the pendulum moves back and forth. that's about what it looked like. the loud roar continued for several minutes after the 3 planes and the whatever were out of sight.\r\n\r\nthis is not the first ufo i have ever seen. i remember the event very clearly but don't remember the exact date. it was about june 26, 1992, could have been july.\r\n\r\ni was driving south on college avenue in fayetteville, arkansas. i was stopped at a stoplight just north of downtown fayetteville. i believe i was next to washington regional medical center on the right and across from evelyn hills shopping center on the left. it was pouring rain. visibility was maybe a mile or so. it was dark and cloudy. this would have been about 7:45 in the morning. i was driving to work.\r\n\r\nthere is a row of hills/mountains visible to the south when you are stopped at this stoplight. i saw something oval-shaped. it would have been gray or silver in color. the most striking thing about this object is that the bottom half of it looked like it was illuminated with a bright white light. remember what the weather is like at the time.\r\n\r\nthis thing was flying se so smoothly, it was like it was on invisible rails in the sky. there were no reports of anything in the news about it. again, years later my husband showed me some ufo films on tv and there was one that was exactly like what i saw.

rd., toward empire ave. as i was driving i had the radio off and i was talking to myself like usual. i suddenly knotice a white scuffle in the sky to the left of my view through the front window. it was a calm day no wind. in my mind i automaticly thought it was a plastic bag (white grocery store plastic bag) flying through the air.  as i aproached the stop sign at live oak. my eyes caught view of it again as i relised it was not as close as i thought it was. quickly my mind did a flip and i stopped at the stop sign and really looked. it was a cloud in the blue sky all by itself and it was making a swirling motion. it was as though something was comming into this demention from another. it was static in motion, it was kindof bouncing around like it was struggling. after about maybe ten seconds of watching it do this a shape appeared out of the swirling clouds. it was the same color of the white swirling cloud. it was large and had pointed ends to both sides. walnut shape and as large as three air force cargo plane, like the kind i usually see flying in the area from travis air force base. to me this was like a flying city. it came down from the atmosphere. the swirling cloud disapated. the disc flew at speeds i've never seen before before. it travel a distance of over 50 miles in less than a minute. i was stopped in my car at the stop sign but i started to travel forward because someone drove up behind me. i drove slowly toward empire road and watch it. above me was blue sky but where the disc headed was cloudy off in the horizon. the clouds where getting pinkish but where still white from the setting sun. as the craft headed toward the clouds i came to the stop light at empire road and i just stared at it. the disc came to a full stop right before it came to the cloud and then entered it slowly. i never saw it again but i wish i had a camera phone then. i was very amazed at how it cloaked itself with its environment. i later told my family they laughed but knew i was serious. but its not the only time i've seen strange things. my feelings when i saw it was i knew what it was and i then relised alot of the stuff i've been hearing is true. after i saw it it didn't really change me it was more like a matter of fact and i went on with my life as normal. it is what it is a whole lot of stuff i don't know but would be fascinating to know. i would send a sketch but don't have computer capability. the disc flew toward stockton in my opinion, stange because they always seem to fly that way.

to go to the grocery store about a mile from our home. as i was pulling up to the grocery i saw something that i thought was a helicopter because it was hovering over the ditch in the back of the store. i thought it might be a police helicopter but then it did a 90 degree turn and started moving slowly above us. i am not good with distance so i asked my daughter if she thought it was a football field up in the air...She said \"no\" it looked like it was 1/2 football field up in the air so that would be about 50 yards then.  it was the size of a normal fixed wing passenger jet but this had an extremely thin fuselage and there were no markings and it just glided overhead with no sound. i don't know how it could glide because it was so big and then it took off and started to fly through the neighborhood and then i started to drive in the direction it was going.  as i spotted this thing though i called my husband and he said \"do you see what i see?\" i said how could i ... i was at heb and he was on our block which is about a mile away. he was seeing the exact same thing over our block.  anyway, i followed the one that i saw for about twenty minutes and then went home.  as i was going home i saw four of them just hovering in the neighborhood in a stair stepped pattern.  i realize that since i live in a military town that it was probably some sort of military exercise.  we have had friends mention that they have seen similar aircraft at various times and have been just as freaked out as we were.  the strange thing though is i called the police, the airport, local radio and television stations and none of them were interested.  four of us saw this thing so i know it isn't something i just dreamed up... not to mention other friends have seen it too in other locations.  i cannot find anything that looks like it on the internet.  i had my phone with me but didn't even think to take a picture of it because i was so blown away.  i now keep a camera with me in case i ever seen anything remotely like it or even remotely strange again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21503,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.4314819,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01152010-0007","longitude":-98.4879982,"occurred":1109577600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1263584918000,"summary":"White
