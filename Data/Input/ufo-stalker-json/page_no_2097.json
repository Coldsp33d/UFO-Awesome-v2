the town of quartzsite, az when i spotted a group of lights several miles to the west and 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon moving eastward towards us at a fairly high speed, and descending. at first i thought it was probably a commercial airliner, it seemed to be at the right altitude for such, and within the normal east-west corridor for flights between phoenix and the l.A./orange county areas. but when i noticed that it seemed to be descending, i watched as closely as i could while driving, then noticed that it seemed to be approaching faster than an airliner could, and growing larger in scale rapidly. it was shaped like a wide triangle, one long edge and two shorter angles, the bottom surface dotted with bright blue/white lights. when it reached a point directly to the south of us at a distance of a couple miles, and 1000' to 2000' agl, it slowed and made a shallow bank towards us to the north. it stopped and hovered about a mile or less to the south of us at or below 1000' agl. we strained our eyes to try to figure out what it was as we passed along the freeway until a hill to the south obscured our view. i noted that we passed a freeway sign \"8 miles to quartzsite\" during the sighting, so that placed us 8 miles east of quartzsite, westbound on i-10 at approx. 2:30 am nov. 26, 2009. \r\n it was a cold, clear desert night, unlit highway, about a quarter moon so billions of stars were visible. we had left mesa az. about 12:30 that morning, and i noticed that orion was visible the entire trip at about 45 degrees above the horizon, moving from east to west in the southern sky as we proceeded toward california. when the object came to rest and we lost sight of it because of the hilly terrain, it was to our view, just below orion. i will never forget that sight! we were excited. the entire sighting lasted around 8 minutes, most of which i concentrated on explaining it away and rationalizing what it may actually be. possibly lights on communication towers we may be approaching, on top of hills, or a hillside mining operation. but when we passed it, i really felt we had witnessed something out of the ordinary. \r\n on my return trip two days later (during daylight), i remembered to watch my odometer and at and around 8 miles east of quartzsite i scanned the small foothills to the south and found no signs of radio towers or visible mining operations. i truly believe my wife leonora and i witnessed something special that morning. i have done a few online searches trying to find if anyone else reported seeing this, no luck. i know there were truckers on the road with me that could not have missed it. please, someone tell me you witnessed this too!!!\r\n\r\n thomas caswell\r\n retired medical imaging engineer\r\n       ","distance":"Over One

and the female neighbor stopped talking and told me and her other house hold members to look up at the sky. she pointed up at a star-like circle shaped object that was blinking bright white and would fade to where it was not as bright. it was the brightest thing in the sky. my first instinct was that it was a plane. but as we kept watching it, it would only move up a short distance at a time. it has been up in the sky for about an hour now, moving into a diagnal direction. we first noticed it around 8:53 pm. we were debating on calling the cops, but we never did. i have two photos of the object. i came back outside at approximatly 9:40 and the object was still in plane site, but moved a ways from where we had saw it to begin with. i emmediatly called the neighbors back outside and we continued to watch it for about 10-15 minutes. we noticed that the object would flash white, blue, and red colors. i continue to go outside and it is still sitting in the same place as it was the

saw a bright (more than one light) just above the tree tops. i felt a little fright. i thought at first that it was a small plane going to crash, but almost right away i could tell how slow it was going and that its movement was level with the ground. i stopped my van and watched it very slowly move just over the houses. i could not hear a sound. then it stopped dead still. it looked funny, not like a plane... it must be a helicopter.. it was very still... just hovering over a house. a white light shined down like it was looking for something. i thought if i roll down my window i could tell if it was a helicopter. i knew even before the window was all the way down that it wasn't a helicopter, it had no blades... well , no tail at all. it looked flat on both sides and round in the middle when it was comming toward me, but from what i think was the side (it seemed to move in any direction) it looked like a rounded off triangle, fat near the middle and close to the frount.\r\nas i rolled down my window it moved from a stand still directly around from me, it didn't turn, it just hovered straight across moving close to me. i didn't hear a thing as it moved over me a little and very close. i could see under it, it had two large yellow strips on teh underside. it stopped and started to rotate as if to turn what i thoguht as the front toward me. it made a swishing hydraulic sound as it did staying still except for turning. as it turned, it tillted up slightly. it may have been rotating to move... it moved what i thought was sidewaysstraight ahead very very slowly. it was a solid craft, no wings or propellers. two large red lights and a string of brilliantlu bright white small lights (around the sides). i'm not sure if the small lights moved or its rotating made it look like they where flashing around the craft. i watched it and it stopped over the retirement village and hovered. i couldn't hear the swishing noice as it moved away. my van was still running the whole few minutes. the area was on one of the gsp airports flight paths, gsp is only a few miles from teh retirement village. it was going in the direction of the airport but very low and slow.\r\ni was so close i could see it looked metalic. it has indentations or seams on teh bottom, maybe for landig gear? or how it was put together... \r\ni don't know what it was but i see 747s, prop planes, every kind, landing at gsp 3 or 4 some hours; never saw anything like this! i've seen the small planes turn into the flight path and look like big white lightsmany times, but this thing stopped then came over to me and stopped again, hovered , rotated and made no sound until it rotated. then i'm sure no one in teh houses below it could hear it, even that swishing sound was very low. a plane or helicopter that was hovering would have blown out every window in these houses it came directly over 3 or 4 houses, no vibrations, no air movement.\r\n","distance":"21-100

(as it appeared).  as i observed the object, it did not appear to be travelling away from or deviate from it's hovering position..It hovered for less than 2-3 minutes before it slowly ascended and travelled in a ne arc, which ended in a se flight path.  we reentered the car and continued to drive se, when at the object reappeared briefly over the ridgeline several miles se of it's original position.  my son thought that the object instantly vanished, but i could not verify the observation as i was driving. we lost visual contact with the object when it disappeared over a ridgeline. \r\n\r\na few minutes later we met a friend and explained what we observed.  she stated that one of her family friends claims to have witnessed a similar sighting 5-10 years ago in the approximate same location.  our friend agreed to have him contact me to discuss the incident and have a laugh...\r\n\r\ni did not take any cell phone photos or videos, as it was too cold and my cell camera produces very low quality photos.  i considered contacting the local law enforcement agencies, but considering i am an attorney and have political/judicial aspirations, i did not think it wise.  \r\n\r\nas an aside, my son and i maintain an interest in ufo's, watch all ufo programs and documentaries, which may predjudice the value of this observation. however, my son and i observed something odd, that did not appear to be an aircraft, did not emit sound and was not shaped like any aerodynamic aircraft we are familiar with. interesting, exciting and disturbing.  i would like to learn whether any of the other witnesses travelling northbound on kilby rd. reported similar sightings?  i know that several cars slowed to observe the craft.

about 11:45am and my grandfather and i decided to eat lunch. so we were out on his porch facing an easterly direction, enjoying the weather when we both noticed a plane flying through a long dark streak that was almost a puplish color and was straight as an arrow going for miles. there were few clouds in the sky and and you could see this streak against the blue sky but it was cutting through one cloud like a knife. we noticed the airplane, which i believe was a comercial jet, flying through it so accurately that the aircraft's contrail was actually covering the streak up as it flew through it. the plane was flying through the streak for miles before it made an abrupt turn as if the pilot realized it was flying through something and was trying to get out of it and the plane disappeared behind a mountain. however i have seen many commercial aircraft flying over my house and my grandparents house and rarely do i see them make abrupt turns like that. i found it very odd. after the contrail had covered most of the streak there was little left to see and we decided to take a ride into neighboring fallbrook. i later returned home and explained what i saw to my family and they all agreed it was very strange and had no explanation for it either. after witnessing it i felt i saw something very unusual and maybe it was something i wasn't supposed to see. i was purplexed as was my grandfather. after recalling what i saw i have a few theories what it may have been but i am very unsure as to what it actually was. my first thought was it could have been a worm hole but why would it be cutting through a cloud? another theorie was that the streak could have been left by a ufo that may have taken off very quickly as i have heard of ufos punching holes through clouds but i have never heard of one leaving a dark streak that remained for a number of minutes. my third theory is that it was some sort of military experiment as my grandfathers house is just outside of camp pendleton and there are constantly a number of military aircraft flying over head but if this were the case, i could not even begin to explain what they are testing. it was by far the strangest thing i have ever seen and i can't explain what it could have been. unfortunately we got no photos of it as we were mesmerized by it and the camera on my phone is horrible and that is all i

while we were on the road i noticed several large planes and a few smaller ones flying eastwards. i know they were planes because i could make out the outline of them and they had flashing red lights on them. my mom dropped me off at home with my brother, then she drove back to work. i noticed that there were still many planes flying overhead, so i decided to go into my front yard to watch. i felt kind of nervous while watching the planes, due to the fact that i've never seen this many in the air in this area, and because they were all flying east. i texted one of my friends about this and they said that around 900 troops were being flown overseas, which relieved me because i thought that maybe we were being invaded by another country. as i continued to watch, i noticed a an aircraft to the southeast that was hovering in the same place, occasionally moving in quick fluid circular motions. it was a bluish white color and looked like a pulsating fireball. i watched it for a few minutes, then called my mom over the phone to tell her about the object. after i put my cell phone away, i called my brother out to come look at it. he was fairly suprised but, because of the cold, he went back inside. afterwards, i noticed that these three orange orbs, that i previously thought were street lamps (they were stationary and fairly close to the ground), to the north of the blue object started moving slowly towards eachother. after they came close together, they quickened their speed and circled around eachother for about a second before they flew apart and formed a large triangle, which appeared to even have an outline. i stared at the object for around twwenty seconds before i ran back inside the house to find a video camera, and tell get my brother to come outside to watch with me. when we got back outside the triangle with the orange orb points was gone, but there was another solitary orb higher up in the sky. while i tried to figure out how to get the camera to work, we noticed another blue fireball a bit farther to the west from the first one, and at a slightly higher altitude. i gave up trying to work the camera, and looked up into the sky to try to spot the triangle again when we both noticed that there were actually several large triangles high up in the sky. the lights making the points of these triangles looked exactly like really bright stars, and there appereared to be much smaller and dimmer lights flying back and forth between the points. some of the triangles suddenly turned and then stopped to point in another direction. both me and my brother were getting scared so we went back inside. after a few minutes, i came back out by myself and looked up again and saw another star-like object with several other ones around it, and from the outer ones to the center one moved those very dim lights i saw moving in the triangles. these objects, like the others, seemed to be connected in a way to form a much larger object, but this one repeatedly changed it's shape by moving the outer lights around the center one. i stared at it until i started getting scared from all the triangles in the sky. i don't really remember much after i went back outside except for when i looked out the windows at around 11:00 and noticed almost all of the objects have gone, which made me feel safe enough to go to sleep. the only object remaining was one of the orange orb.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"04:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

but then it started to move. at first it was in one spot, then seemed to rock back and forth.  i told him to go get his telescope, and he set up on the front porch.  meanwhile i kept an eye on the object.  it would move slightly, then back. once he was set up, i went out front.  he couldn't get the object in focus, but looking through the telescope you could see its lights were changing colors, like a rainbow disco light. it was moving slowly. you could tell it was moving because it was behind some tree limbs in the distance, and we used that as a point of reference. i was thinking, \"holy crap, what the hell is that?\"  i thought maybe it was a helicopter, but it was moving very strangely.  i got my telephoto camera out, but that didn't do any good either.  it was so cold out we decided to go in and watch through our bathroom window.  it was then that the object seemed to be moving back and forth, and upwards at the same time.  then it would go back down, side to side, etc. it was moving unlike anything i had seen in the sky before.  there were also three smaller lights below it that seemed to be moving in unison with it, but that part may have been my eyes playing tricks on me.  we were starting to get dizzy from watching it so intently, so we curled up in bed with a movie. after about a half an hour he went back to the window to go check on it and it was gone.

middle of no where.  in the past, i have seen silver lights that blink another red light, that look very similar to the traditional airplane. but sometimes i think that they are going way to slow to be a plane because they seem to be not moving at all. one time i even witnessed a solid ball of red light traveling  low to the ground at a high speed. these experiences all take place from me looking out of my huge half circle window on top of my other 4 regular square windows in my room, so i really have a good look at the sky. it is very dark at night & i can see plenty of stars.\r\n\r\nmy best friend & i were studying for our final examinations for college & in the past few years, i have enlightened him to the idea of ufo's being a part of reality.  i have watched every discovery channel show on ufo's & spend many hours on the internet researching ufo's.\r\n\r\nbetween 6:50 & 7:30, my mother, sister, my good friend & i , all witnessed something truly once in a lifetime. i would sacrifice my left arm to go back in time & record the event with the most expensive hd camera money can buy. \r\n\r\nas my good friend & i walk back into my room after eating dinner, my friend says, \"there are 2 of the blinkey things again.\" (he has seen them before at my house every now & then). as we watch them move from left to right, we see another coming from the same direction. it is easy to tell that they are moving because we can use the stars as points of reference. then we notice a couple more moving in the same direction, and all of the sudden we just keep seeing more & more coming. there were as many as 10 visible at once but they mostly came in groups of 3-5, 1 right after the other. i got my mom & sister so they could see why my friend & i were screaming \"wtf!\" at the top of our lungs. we witnessed 5 of them moving in 100% unison at 1 point were they were not blinking red, but looked like silver balls of light. they looked to be very far away & when i looked at them through the binoculars, it looked as if the red blink was traveling across the edge of the object & changing color as it dispersed around the craft. the red blink looked as if it would go through the entire color spectrum as it made its was to the but end of the craft, then it would blink again & again.\r\n\r\nwe all stayed glued to the window as they just kept coming from right to left. we saw at least 50-60 within the time frame of watching them. in the middle of the time frame, i grabbed my deer spotlight that is very strong & went outside in the freezing cold to watch them.  they all went at the same speed & went from left to right until they were too faint to see. once outside with my friend, i randomly pointed at 1 of them to the far right, that was moving to the right. my friend then says, \"i think that 1 turned around...\". i kept the light pointed in it's direction & it indeed look as if it was getting closer. ***it continued to come towards us & i kept the light on it, it was still high up but it was much lower than any of them. there was a 2 second time frame where i had a perfect view of the bottom of it as i was directly underneath it...This is when the both of us said \"it's a triangle!!!\" at the same time. it flew directly over us and we watched it until it was out of sight.  this triangle shape was only visible with the help of the spotlight, but it was not close enough to actually hit it with the light but it illuminated the area underneath it & for an instant you could see a dark equilateral triangle with 3 white round lights equally spaced apart on the underside. it was a very distinct sight when it was right over top of us & it did not make a single sound, nor did we hear any other sounds coming from aircrafts. latrobe airport is about 7 minutes from my house & i know what a plane sounds like coming in & going out of the airport. the airport is very small and not that active to where i could think that maybe i was just looking at planes. there were just too many in such a small time frame. i know what planes look like in the sky but i will say that these all looked very similar to planes from afar but they definitely were not. there were too many of them flying too close to each other to be planes. i have lived here all my life. also, my mother was very scared.\r\n\r\nafter the very low ufo was out of site, we went back inside because it was very cold, but we went straight back to the window. i then made a phone call to my friend who lives in greensburg, (very close to latrobe) who dose not believe in ufo's. he answered & i told him to look out his window & to look for blinky lights in the sky. the moment he got to his window he said \"yeah i see 2.\" his next remark was \"they are flying close to each other.\" this person still dose not believe in ufo's & did not believe much of my story which i told him the next day in school, but i believe he was seeing some of the ones that have already surpassed my point of view. i did this while still watching them from my window in my room.\r\n\r\nnot to make my story sound any more unbelievable, but the next night, at the same time, it all started again. they came from left to right & once again i watched them the entire time & saw 50-60 individuals total again! this 2nd event was only witnessed by my sister & i this time. i also called a neighbor who lives up the road from me on a big hill & he instantly noticed them too. final exams were next week and i had so much studying to do, but i just could not pull myself from the window because i kept on spotting them. each time 1 would go out of sight, i would notice 2 more to the far left & some of them looked as if they were stationary.\r\n\r\ni emailed stan gordon the night of the 1st event but he never responded. i have been thinking about the event a lot because someone else must have witnessed this occurring & it bothers me that this was not on national news.  \r\n\r\ni am 19 years old & i am currently a sophomore at saint vincent college,  majoring in environmental science. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

when i smoke.This night, i walked out front about 10:00-11:00 pm to smoke.And as usual, i was looking at the stars and sky, whe i noticed 6-lights in a formation moving across the sky from east to west.The thing that caught my attention was that there were no flashing lights or sound. all aircraft have flashing lifhts and sound from the engine. but, this had none.The formation remained the same as it moved across the sky.The light's were bright but didnt seem to be emitting any beam, they just seemed to be lights like a star, with no direction.I did not see any craft because of the darkness, but the lights were  very bright. iv'e seen alot of comercial aircraft go across the sky , and knowing how high and how fast the fly, i would judge the speed of this at 3-4 times the speed of a comercial craft ,if it was flying at the same height as one 300-350 mph at 30,000-35,000 ft. but as i stated,,it made   no   sound     which i cvan here jet wash from jets a great distance away.  if  this was flying at a height that was too high to hear it   then  the speed would be considerably greater than that of anything i have ever heard of flying today..I have watched satilites fry across the sky just after sunset when the sun still shines on them and they look almost like a star moving  very fast  across the sky. and would estimate the speed of this to be close to the speed of a satilite. it resembled to triangles with 1 point facing west and 1 point facing east. t i dont have a lot of computer exprience, so i will show you best that i can..As i said  i saw 6 lights so you will have to imagine the shape of this without the lines    just lights at the points   <  >   at first i thought it might be 6 military jets flying in formation and the sound would follow shortly behind as mant times the craft outflys the sound, but no sound ever came and the speed was very fast,copared to a commecial airliner. as i said, they had no flashing lights as all aircraft does and if they were far enough away to not hear, then the speed would have been rediculus fast.","distance":"Over One

little odd not to see anything at all, no stars, no clouds. just black. then i looked further toward the east, and noticed that there were stars in that direction. then i actually saw stars, first one or two, then several, then more and more, blinking to life in an organised way. like, blinking to life in turn. and then i realised that something huge and black was floating across the sky and was blotting out a very large slice of it. then i began to see the shape of this enormous black object, it was easily several times longer than the sports field, and three or four times wider. i saw that it had its own lights that were just about the same brightness of bright stars along its two leading edges. i didn't count how many of these lights there were but would guess 9 or 10, maybe more. as the object flew/floated overhead, heading west, it blotted out other stars immediately in front of it and they blinked out, just as the stars to the east were blinking on when the craft's end passed. \r\nit was an extraordinary couple of minutes. it may only have been one minute, but it seemed like it went on for a very long time. i was shocked by several things. 1) that it was so absolutely enormous. it was like watching a battleship, or a mountain, float in the sky. 2) that it was absolutely silent. 3) that it did not suddenly fly off as soon as i had seen it. 4) that it was flying across a major population area, a major city. from it's line of travel it must have flown straight over the top of the observatory at toowong, and also the university of queensland. 5) that traffic did not come to a screetching halt 6) that i myself, in spite of seeing something that crashed against my ideas of reality and everyone's ideas of physics, just simply was so casual about it. i didn't tell anyone. all my thoughts about what i had seen became sort of anaesthetised in a sense. 7) then as i watched it \"float\" silently overhead, as if to accentuate the fact that it was real, and was a single object, it slowly rolled over in the sky as it flew. it looked like it rolled, but it might also have been folding its leading edges toward its spine. it was so matt black i couldn't make out any detail other than its triangle shape. and i could only see its shape, really, by the acres of stars that it was blotting out above it. \r\ni would guess it was travelling at a height of about 1500 feet to maybe 2500 feet. it felt close. \r\noh... and i can't remember how i lost sight of it. that is point number 8.

highschool. it was still daylight, the sun was going down. the object was easily larger than east highschool's football field, it was rotating and disc-like in nature. the object was clearly divided into two distinct sections, a smaller top 'half' sitting atop a larger bottom 'half'. the sections appeared to rotate opposite of each other (ie, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise) in \"half rotations\"...They would rotate halfway in one direction and then rotate halfway in the other direction, independently of each other in a smooth, consistent movement. this 'rotation' was evidenced by three sections of pulsing lights (top, mid section, and bottom) and may have simply been the sequence of the lights and not actually any structural rotation.\r\n\r\nthe lights were pulsing and very large. the lights were yellow, red, green, and blue with yellow probably as the most prominent. as we drove down walnut grove, approximately 100 to 200 feet, we passed the tree line

would hover over the lake of the ozarks. one ball dropped in the woods like a falling star. i called my husband then very concerned. i got out of my car to see better and i could go no further on the

we walked back home, even though i wanted to stay and get a picture. when we got home, i showed him two bright lights that looked like stars hovering over a cove. we could see them from our deck overlooking the lake. he said they were stealth planes. they flared up and took off, they then returned and when i shined a flash light at them they completely dissappeared. can stealths turn off their lights like that? these last objects were completely different than what i had seen earlier. the later were farther away in the sky, the first objects that looked like fireballs were close by

said i would take him up as i don't drink and i could drive.  i was mad at him and we was going up our drive way and i stopped as i saw the fire truck of the guy that lives across the street and i saw his red and blue light and was thinking fire or a car accident then just above his truck i saw these real big bright lights (it was almost like seeing football stadium like lights) and my mind could not wrap around it as it was to low and going the wrong direction and was way to slow. and i kept thinking what is wrong with this.  and i kept thinking this is not  right.  and i kept thinking what is that and i tried to get my husband to look and he was so drunk he did not see it.  it looked like it was just sort of floating slow and it was right over the houses like right there i looked at my dash board on my truck and the radio still worked so nothing happen to them and as it got to my side of the truck i rolled down my window and i was thinking what flies in the shape of a triangle and i kept looking and i could see it front to back and side to side and under it to the top and i was thinking no frame no engine noise no wings and no propeller and then i knew what it was it was a ufo and it was right there at about 11 at night and it just kept going real slow and as it got passed i was still looking at it and i still could see the the front and sides and as i looked at the back it was dark but i could see nothing and i also noticed it was following the power line and my husband said lets go or the store will be closed. we have two bases not to far from our house, one is call ft.Richardson and it is at anchorage.  that one is the air force base and the other base is the army base.  that one is called ft. elemendorf  just out of anchorage. i think this ufo was so low that no one could see it on radar. i have lived by two different air ports and and i have been to air show and i have seen and heard jets as they fly to the side of our house and also army helicopters that fly over our house and i have seen the stealth bomber and also the concord and the jets at the airport and we have float planes that fly around.\r\ni've also seen a parachute glider and a parachute glider with an engine that you sit in. and also twin turbo prop plane so i really know what i saw.  i did not tell anyone because i did not know who to tell and as i guess i was the only one to see it.  i told my mom and and she believes me and i told my friend and she believes me. i also told the guy i was working for, who was an airplane pilot at the time, but he didn't believe me because he doesn't believe in ufos. the only other person i've told of this was my son and he doesn't believe me. i don't care who believes me or doesn't, i know what i saw and i hope this helps you guys out at least a little. it was right there and i saw it, no mistakes.\r\ni didn't want to think anyone to think i was crazy so i kept it to myself until i saw mufon on the history channel on 01/13/2010. i tend to watch all the ufo oritented shows anyways before and after my experience. \r\nthis is all true as far as i
