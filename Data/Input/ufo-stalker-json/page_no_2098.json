and that the airplane flew close to it. after the plane left, the light started to move slowly to the west. when it started to move, it changed from white to blue. my dad said that it is nothing like he had ever seen. the blue light changed course to thee south rapidly and for awhile the blue light disappeared. my dad was telling me that it was not a satellite, a plane, or a comet. we kept looking at the sky then another plane flew near, then i saw three dim blue light shaped as a triangle. as the plane flew south the triangular shaped blue light flew east towards dallas and then rapidly in a second, the lights turned white and disappeared. i ran inside trying to get my camera ,but the battery was low. i ran back on the driveway at i looked north if i can try to see the light for about 20 minutes ,but the lights never reappeared.\r\n the first sighing was a white light that stayed in the same position then it started to move west. then turned blue and turned to go to the south an disappeared.\r\n the second sighting was when a a plane passed from dfw airport flew over head to the north then three blue dim lights moved toward the east which came from the west which looked as if it passed near the plane. after 3 seconds of looking at it, it disappeared.\r\n non of us can identify it.I will just tell you it was not a comet because comets cannot disappear, they can't change

the sun was setting when i noticed a bright orb in the sky. unsure what to make of it i stood observing it for several minutes trying to figure out what i was looking at. i knew it wasn't a star since we live in a suburb in the san antonio area and we have a pretty good view of the sky every night without the glare of city lights. it began to float very slowly to the left so i ran to grab my camera and took a picture. soon after it faded rather quickly and i lost sight of it so i decided to keep the blinds open to see if it reappeared. about an hour later it reappeared further away with the same intensity but then faded and began to blink similar to the lights of a plane, red, white, blue, green, yellow. it flew very slowly across the sky continuing to blink and then two more similar objects appeared around it. my husband arrived home from work and i told him about what i was seeing and he observed them with me. we just stood trying to figure out what was going on. we phoned our neighbor who lives one street over and she told us she could see them from her front yard. over the next couple of hours they would appear and disappear from starlike objects that would glare up brighter than any of the stars around and then blinking colored lights flying across the sky. the strange thing is that this has happened every night for the past week in the same area and as many as 5 will appear at one time, each slowly fading out. i keep my camera handy but they are not easy to take a clear picture of.

driveway. i was looking at the stars like i do most nights, and i noticed an odd pulsating or twinkling light off to the west, towards ithaca new york. at the time i thought it might have been an aircraft with it's landing lights on. i went inside to grab the camera, a fujifilm s5000, thinking i might be able to get a good picture of it. i zoomed into the object under maximum zoom, 10 times optical and 2.2 times digital, and proceeded to use a pine tree to somewhat stabilize the image with near zero success. i took several pictures of the object and one video over a span of 15 to 20 minutes. \r\n\r\n    i brought my father out who also saw the object, commenting it was probably a plane. i'm an avid flight simmer, rc pilot, and looking forward to a career in aviation; needless to say i have a good grasp of what planes and helicopters can and can not do, and what colors are used in aircraft navigation lights. from what i can see from my pictures the object had lights or various blues, whites, yellows, reds, and greens. blue is not used in aircraft navigation lights, nor could a mix of any of the colors that are used result in a blue light. during the sighting an airplane did fly by, a very common occurrence in my area of upstate new york. i could clearly see the airplane's anti-collision strobe lights, the object looked nothing like those. there are no cell phone or radio towers in that direction that are visible from my location.\r\n\r\n   during the 15-20 minutes i watched the object though both the camera and with my own eye it never moved, it just kind of hovered over the hill (i'm sure it was some distance beyond the hill, but it looked like it was over it to me). it continued to pulsate different intensities of whiteish light and sit right where it was for the duration of the viewing. at no time did i feel at all like i was threatened, more an intense curiosity of what exactly the object was.\r\n\r\n   at about this time, roughly 6:45pm, i headed back inside to try to warm up, when i headed back outside about a half hour later the object, which had stayed still for nearly 20 minutes, was gone. i have never seen anything like it before.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":21462,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3556286,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01122010-0016","longitude":-76.2007636,"occurred":1263177000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

skies these days , i looked at the cresent moon and yelled at alicia to look, i asked her if she saw the flashing star on the tip of the cresent moon and she did, we pulled over on the shoulder of the road and i told her to start taking pictures. i called my girlfriend whom i was going to give her a ride to work too and told her what i was seeing and to go look at the moon. i asked my daughter if the flashing star looked red to her and she said yes. we drove very slow down the mountain and i took pics with my cell phone too.When we got down to the bottom of the mountain the star appeared to be further away from the tip of the cresent moon and it was a white star. i went to work and looked out on the back porch and there was a star still further away but i think this was a normal star.My first thought was a ufo because i have had some unusual sightings of unexplainable lights since april of 2009 and several years ago too.The red flashing light was on the lower tip of the crescent moon. i dont remember any certain rythm of flashing.At times i thought it was flashing white. we pulled off the road a couple of times to get pictures and being a wooded area we only had full view here and there. when we got to the bottom of the mountain and down the road a ways , i asked alicia if the light appeared further away from the moon and i think she agreed, i was still very excited. i dont think my friend could see anything . i will call her today and get her details because i feel the need to start writing this down in a journal. i cant download pics now but we do have them on our phones and camera. i havent had a good look at the pics on the camera because i was very tired yesterday and rested all the

periods and was witnessed by myself , kids and neighbours. we all reported the incident including to nasa in the usa but could not get any action. these ufo's were intelligent with no doubt because they would be flying across the sky at a rate too incredible to be man made.They zig zagged and played with each other and were in the sky doing random tricks. what surprised me was the sighting was above and near the air force base and there was no reaction. we begged the media to come down but they showed no interest. what also surprised me was that these ufo's were flying well below cloud level at times and were roughly the size of a small aircraft. the craft's as sometimes there were up to 5 ufo's at one time were a 3 dimensional disc with an orb at the base which appeared to hang below the object but not joined to the disc, the orb was a very bright light. the crafts shone light and had no colour.  i am commissioned as a youth missionary through the church and my family are christians. this account is true in every aspect of what we witnessed. i have aspergers syndrome and i am very sensitive to movement in my peripheral vision, the movement of the objects in the sky caught my attention almost immediately. at the time i was outside praying. when i first noticed the object it soon became apparent that it was intelligent in relation to it's movement and too fast to be anything man made, i know this because jumbo jets going to australia fly over head and takes a couple of minuets for the plane to disappear over the horizon where these objects could fly across the sky as far as i could see in about 2-3 seconds. so i knew almost instantly what they were or were not. my reaction to this was that they were probably evil and possibly related to the objects mentioned in the first chapter of ezekiel in the bible.\r\nthe objects at the end just flew and disappeared out of sight. how ever they always appeared from the  direction of the pot formation of

about half a minute later he saw it again in the same place.  he continued watching and about a minute later he saw it a third time and he watched for another five minutes and it did not repeat.  that was sometime in the first week of august.\r\n     a couple weeks later, my husband was again looking into the sky but south this time, around the same time of night as the first sighting.  this time when the flash happened it was the same but perhaps farther away.  it is hard to say what distance though because it was very high up, like a star but much brighter, and bigger.  but the second one seemed \"deeper\" somehow.  this time there was only two flashes about about 30 seconds apart roughly.\r\n     about a week of hearing him talk about it and we had had a bar b q and evening was getting on, this probably getting towards the end of august, it was mostly dark and my brother says, \"i think i just saw that light your husband was talking about!\"  and he proceeded to ask my husband if it was real bright and white, and he said yes, and my brother pointed to where he saw it, towards the north but almost directly above us, and we all looked and almost a minute had passed since he first said he saw something and then it lit up again and my brother, husband, and i all saw the second flash and to me it looked very white but also metalic, like the old strobe lights with the silver behind the light that would give it that silvery glare.  and it was very bright and bigger than a star but somehow looked very high up like the stars.  my brother said it looked like it was still in the same place, then after about 20-30 seconds we saw it again in the same place, but we watched for a long time and did not see it again.\r\n     then three or four weeks ago my husband came into the house and was excited.  he said that he saw the same light again, this time closer in, but still not close, meaning still looking like a too large and bright star, but not as \"deep\" as the second time, but about the same as the first but this time in the southern part of the sky.  he saw it flash four times this time and it did not move in the sky.  it was right after dusk and there were not very many stars out yet but there was one brighter one in the southern sky and this flash was occuring directly above it about half an inch.  he states that the time passing between each flash ranged from half a minute to a minute and a half and the whole episode lasted about five minutes.  i went outside and watched with him for a few minutes but neither of us saw it happen again.  i called my friend that lives near us who also is an investigator for mufon and told her about it.  she arrived at my house within fifteen minutes and i showed here where my husband said he saw it and we watched for a while and flashed that area with a laser but to no avail.  we did not see it again that night nor since.  \r\n     we live in a very remote area in california and therefore have a very good view of the skies that we take advantage of regularly.  we see a lot of planes, many satalites, helicoptors...Even the space station and know how to recognize these types of things.  this flashing light does not resemble none of those things.  the strangest thing about it being the time between each flash being irregular, and also, that it does not move even after longer than three or four minutes.  i say three because the longest time my husband thinks it took was five minutes, but we all know how time goes when you are waiting for the pot to boil...\r\n     that is our account of the activities to the best of our being able to describe them without having actually written it down when it happened.  we will try to keep better details if we ever see it again though.  \r\n\r\n

rivera looking due west) on the night of sunday jan. 10th.  it appeared to have a striking resemblance to footage i have seen on your show (.  3 bright lights that appeared to be planes coming in for a landing, but when they started to hover in the sky we knew they weren't planes and when the intensity of lights began to alter while they formed a perfect triangle in the sky we knew that they were something we've never seen before. a perfect trangle.....\r\nthey all dimmed and left in the same direction at the same intervals.  2 lights reappeared on my way home and i pulled over to watch them for about 3-4 minutes and i still have no explanation. no noise, plenty of other air traffic to give me a reference.  i was basically shaking after the first time we watched them, unbelievable.  they were able to go from a dim light to easily the brightest thing in the sky in a matter of seconds. why did they form a perfect triangle? i've watched a good amount of ufo footage and the like and never, ever thought i would ever see anything like this in my entire life.  it was absolutely amazing because it reminded me very much of some footage i've seen on your show on a ufo in texas?  the speed of these objects when they left and the way they changed light intensity was crazy.  it's still very fresh in my mind, i'll never forget this. my friend found a report online that seemed to corroborate what we saw. (4 of us saw it, 2 at first). i watched them for maybe 5-7 minutes.  thanks and good luck with your show, it's starting to strike home with me now.  it's funny, it actually really didn't surprise me after i began to think about it. people have been seeing ufo's for a long time. i just never thought it would be this blatant and this amazing right here in pico rivera with that much light pollution.  thanks again for your time. i can give a word for word description of what happened at any time. the events will never go away in my mind, i hope someone out there shot some video.  \r\n\r\ni sent this to ufo hunters and just found your website.  the most amazing thing about this was that they were able to go from the intensity of a dim star to a light that was 10 times brighter than any helicopter or plane in the sky and they all left in the same direction.  incredible.\r\n\r\n1. i was standing on my friends front porch smoking a cigarette.\r\n2. i first noticed what looked like 3 planes coming towards us from the west, the intensity of light is what made me first notice it.\r\n3. i didn't know what it was, i asked my friend and he said it could be air traffic from lax, but when they stopped in the sky and and slightly reconfigured themselves to form a perfect triangle is when i became suspect.\r\n4. i think i've covered this.\r\n5. i was shaking, i couldn't control my thoughts.  i called my friend who has a similar mindset when it comes to these things and all he could say was \"cms/tg/pd]\".\r\n6. the 3 objects disappeared in the same direction, with it's light decreasing as it moved south across the sky and out of view. the last one got really bright for a period then went in the same direction as the other two.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":21446,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9908088,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01112010-0014","longitude":-118.094465,"occurred":1263110400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1263281577000,"summary":"3 u.F.O's in the night sky, changing intensity of illumination and creating a triangle with the other objects","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Pico Rivera, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:154311"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Coopersville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On sunday morning january 10, 2010, at 9:45 a.M. i was standing in my kitchen looking out the window drinking a cup of coffee.  the kitchen window looks out over a creek a woods.  i was watching a red squirrel moving from tree to tree when, out of the corner of my eye i spotted three white birds flying from west to east.  i was curious about what kind of bird i was seeing, thinking they were probably sea gulls.  i focused in on the birds and they weren't birds at all.\r\n\r\nwhen i turned my attention to what i thought were birds, i saw a dark grey triangular object.  the tips of the triangle were glowing with a white light -

there was a big black circle where the object had been. i called my wife and she got upset that i had gone back. i looked up on the internet about this and it lead me here to this site and now here i am reporting this to you. i do not wished to be called, i have a reputation and a career to think about, this is a very small community and very tightly knit, i do not want people thinking that i am crazy. the old power station is easy to find and so is the circle that the object left.  this was something that we will never forget.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":21440,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.3393072,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01112010-0008","longitude":-102.8518202,"occurred":1263103200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1263249540000,"summary":"A bright light that descended to the ground and left a mark","tags":["floating"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Grandfalls, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:154317"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Was driving, facing north. stopped at stop sign, saw bright blue object flash from left to right across the sky infront of us. was above the mountains, so it wasn't terribly near, but close enough to see. it didn't go in a curve or downwards as if it was falling. came out of blank sky, went in a perfectly straight line, left to right then dissapeared. i sat there and stared at it a moment then asked the other passenger if they saw it, she did too. we both stared around for a minute but saw nothing else.
