looked through my windshield to observe any clouds or stars and saw 3 lights in a row aligned with the interstate. the distance between each light appeared to be the same. hard to guess, but approximately 300-400 yards apart. i stuck my head closer to the windshield and noticed a 4th light closer to my vehicle that was not visible when i was sitting back, also about 300-400 yards from the next closest. the lights were approximately 400-500 yards above the ground. the lights were bright white. each object/light actually consisted of 2 lights. difficult to explain, but imagine a football laying on it's side and well rounded, not pointed. there was a larger oval shaped white lite on the bottom, then a gap, then a smaller oval white light above it. no other colors were noticed. no blinking lights were noticed, and no sound was noticed. i will number the objects from closest to furthest with 1 being closest and 4 being furthest for this report. soon after initially observing the objects, object 2 moved closer to object 3 and appeared to go behind 3 then suddenly disappeared. shortly after that, 3 disappeared. 4 remained stable. i leaned forward to find 1 again and noticed that it was even with my drivers window. it remained there for a short while, but due to the fact that i was driving, i lost visual contact with it after a couple of minutes. during the time while i was driving and looking for 1, i lost contact with 4. after thinking that they were gone, i spotted a new light 5(same characteristics as 1-4) on my right. same height, but a greater distance from me, possibly 1000 yards. this object was moving west faster than i could keep up (the others 2-4 appeared to be at the same speed as me, and 1 appeared slower than me, i was traveling at 70mph). when i turned on highway 69 north in beaumont at 8:20, that moved the object behind me and i lost visual contact. i do not believe thess objects to be planes, helicopters, weather balloons, tower lights, flares or glare. i would be much obliged for an explanation of what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

of 'black triangles' literally in my front yard. i realize that yeah, i should've reported each and every sighting, and i had planned too, but these reports take awhile to fill out and ive seen them so many times ive become used to seeing them. i'll look at them and laugh out loud and watch them until they fly away and put it aside. they always look and appear the same way; a very bright yellowish/white/amber light in the distance and once they reach a certian distance the light dissappears, leaving only an odd triangle craft that slowly hovers across the sky. the belly has a multitude of red, white and blue blinking lights in a strange almost eye-like pattern. the only noticible noise is a low humming or buzzing sound, kinda like a transformer or a power station. ive seen these things so many times that its honestly funny; ive seen one slowly crawling at an altitude of 200 ft. shining some strange searchlight into the pine trees across the road. ive seen 4 of them flying almost one after another across the night sky. ive even brought friends/family to my house to see them, most leaving saying \"what the [cms/tg/pd] dude, why show me that, thats scary!?\" and becoming firm believers. tonight was different . . .\r\n\r\n just like the first time i saw one, i was taking my dog outside to potty. immeditally i saw the bright light in the distance and recognized it as a triangle. i chained the dog up and as always i stayed to watch it fly over. but i was soon shocked (my cigarette litterally fell out of my mouth from awe) by how vastly different it was; firstly, the sheer size of it. atleast 300+ ft. across (typical triange i see is 90-100ft across)and the dazzeling lights which were vastly different from regular triangles. unlike other triangles, the bright light on the front didnt go off; it was clearly visable that it was a collection of 3 amber/white lights on the front. because it was pitch black outside i was unable to clearly define the outline of it, but i was almost directly under it with a small side view. tons of white, red, blue and one green light, some blinking rapidly others staying on. since i am limeted by my frugile human memory, i really couldnt describe the exact formation on the lights but there where a lot more than any typical triangle. \r\n\r\ntwo other huge differences where the clearly visable outline of some kind of 'cargo-bay' on the back, almost like the kind you'd find on a milatary jumbo jet used for dropping and loading cargo. there where 4 whitish lights of the corners of the 'cargo-bay' and a noticible slant to it. the other difference was . . . i want to say 'rabbit ear' protrutions from the sides of it. like if you took a regular black triangle and put two 'z' shaped wings on the top/side of it, thats what youd have. on the tips of them there were elongated ovals, like a small jet engine. the usual humming noise and soft roar probly caused by the massive displacment of air it caused. ive already ruled out the jumbo jet idea and the possibility of it being a v-22 ospery, simply because ive seen v-22's in action; theyre loud and not this big. altitude of 500-600ft, moving south-to-north.

iridescent or sparkling. it was larger than the moon and smaller than my hand at arms length. it was also absolutely silent and left no trail behind it. i watched in utter amazement until it was out of sight. as soon as i got home i told my father about the u.F.O. i had seen. well, being 14 or 15 years old , i'm sure that he took my story in with a little skepticism but he listened to me politely

the local beaches, and the canyon i live in. i have seen this orb before and on occasion two of them in formation, so i keep a look out for them. they are really fascinating and i have been taking video of them for over a span of almost six months now.  the first sighting was in september of 2009. i in the loft of our barn and i looked out the window and saw a very bright light flying over our ranch. i yelled to my brother to look and then we both ran downstairs and outside to get a better look. i was awestruck, it must have been only 3-4 thousand feet off the ground, a brilliant blue and whitish orb with an aura around it. i could instantly tell this was no airplane or helicopter, it was also totally silent. i ran in to get my little hd sanyo camcorder and as i got back with it seconds later, i could not get it to turn on! i have used this camera a good deal an know how to work it, and the battery had just been fully charged. i believe it somehow jammed the electronics in it. any how i have canon xl1s and i have gotten some really great footage of these things. for some reason they always fade out or dim away after a few minutes. i have also sighted them in high orbits. they are definitely drawn to something here. it is also my belief that these are quite possibly coming from the depths of the ocean. they seem to come in waves, appearing for five to six nights in a row and then gone, they are always at different altitudes and headings. they generally have a steady course and heading, i have on occasion seen them dip and back track, both i caught on film.  the time my brother and  i observed two orbs in formation (also from a ridgeline facing the ocean) they flew right over us perhaps at 8-9,000 ft. they were more of an amber color. it was a rather ominous feeling when they were right above us, then they shot straight up into space-fading out. i have a freeze frame i took off  a video with the xl1s where the orb flies by a airplane. i zoomed in on it and enhanced some of the color tones. it is some what pixilated but you get can see what it is. ill be keeping my eyes open here on the west coast =)","distance":"501 Feet - 1

of the aircraft that are coming in at night do not have any lights on to prevent insurgents from attacking them during landing. the sw light moved back in forth in a slow motion, but also appeared to hover from time to time. another light located to the se hovered over a mountain pass at an altitude of about 25-30k feet. the third light was over the mountains just to the e of the base. i did see a pair of f-15s go up and begin patrols, but made no effort to intercept the lights. a kiowa helicopter was also flying around, but this was more likely as part of the base's standard force protection

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I'm pretty sure this was in 1984 when i was just 12 years old. it was about mid summer, but i can't remember the date. it was quite a while ago. back then, i lived in howell, mi.\r\n\r\ni was a clear night, with only a few wispy clouds in the sky, and the moon was almost full. it was a perfect night look look up, and i was always fascinated with the night sky. i knew that by the time i was an adult, we would be up there with our flying cars, commuting back home to mars from an honest day's work here on earth. well... that's what was supposed to happen, right?\r\n\r\nsanta, i think he went by the name \"dad,\" around that time, had given me a telescope for christmas. it was the best gift ever, or maybe second to the jetfire tranforming robot that i found under the tree as well. \r\n\r\nit was around nine, and the sun had just set with still a bit of orange on the horizon. i had set up the telescope in the five-acre field between my home, and the home of my best friend, ricky, then went to his place to have him join me for a little moongazing.\r\n\r\ni knocked on the window outside his bedroom, but there was no answer. so, i climbed, like we did, to the balcony of the upper floor to see if anyone was home. it's a good thing we lived in the woods and they were used to monkeys climbing on houses, i guess.\r\n\r\nricky's mom came out and told me that he had left with his father to pennsylvania to visit family, and wouldn't be back for a couple of weeks. so, we ended up talking for a few minutes and then i caught something from the corner of my eye in the sky to the north.\r\n\r\nmaybe one degree south of the treeline from the perspective of the balcony of her home, i saw 12 to 16 neon orange v shapes. they seemed to be substantial, because as they moved they would block out stars that they would pass under. i looked at ricky's mom to bring it to her attention, but she was already staring up at this display. \r\n\r\nit was a shock at first, and we watch with interest for 20 minutes according to her watch. what we witnessed were these v shapes assembling to two locations in the sky, pointing inward, and then joining to form two discs, like slices of a pizza. the assembly farthest to the north had merged without trouble, and simply hovered in the sky without sound, and perfectly still. the grouping to the south came together for the most part, but one of the vehicles was moving awkwardly and seemed to be having difficulty joining with the other craft. and this is what we were watching, and discussing the entire time.\r\n\r\nafter that 20 minutes, i had asked her if she had a camera. we simply didn't have the presence of mind to consider a camera at the time. who would want to go into the house and miss a moment of this anyway? she said she had no film for it, but after a while, decided to go inside and look for some. \r\n\r\ni stayed there on the balcony and watched, until she returned. she said that she had no film, and then asked me where they had gone. i looked from her to the sky, and they were gone. just like that. the entire display lasted maybe a half hour, then was gone the moment i looked away at my friend's mom!\r\n\r\nit was an amazing night. after talking for a little while about what we had seen, i went back home. my mother was irritated, and informed me that it was midnight. she told me that she went to get me, but i had just left my telescope out and was nowhere around it. i thought that was impossible. there was no way. i could not have been out for more than an hour, being generous. there was just no way i was gone that long.\r\n\r\never since then, there are other things. dreams.. curiosities.. i can't be certain, but i think somehow, i know how those things work. i know something else, too. something rather useful. well... i guess it's all moot. who is going to believe a nobody like me? my own wife never believed me! and this is not my only sighting. and i'll never have the money to explore the information that's been wedged somewhere in my mind. but if i could, this world would be forever changed. i wish i could.\r\n\r\nbut i can tell you this. difference waves. from the smallest particle, to the workings of the brain, to the mystery of consciousness. it's all a highly complex orchestra of difference waves. even space itself. all you need to transmute anything from one form to another is the difference image of the result you're looking for. i guess this is why thought affects things in reality to some degree. the brain is a difference wave processor, not the digital device that medicine compares it to. science doesn't realize this yet. so they slam particles into each other with the effect of a musician beating his guitar against a wall, and consider everything in the universe in terms of ones and zeroes. but it's neither a one nor a zero, yet also both, as well as the infinity in between.\r\n\r\nall images exist simultaneously. all possibilities are present. and we can't understand why people have such widely varying world views. it's because we're all seeing something different, and trying our best to come to a consensus that we can call reality. unfortunately, violence and hatred seems to be our tool of choice.\r\n\r\nmaybe i was supposed to act. maybe i was given a gift and squandered it. if so, i apologize to all of you.\r\n\r\nhm... but maybe now is the time....\r\n\r\nmaybe i will teleport that water molecule someday soon.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21420,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.6104252,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01092010-0014","longitude":-83.9264752,"occurred":461476800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

two, spaced, in the middle.  as it contined to bank, i saw a row of small red lights under the two center white lights and then a second row of small red lights on the belly.  i absolutely could not

were on i-10 eastbound, driving \r\n70-ish, in abnormally non-existent traffic for a friday night. when we were a couple of miles past the davis hgwy interchange, i noticed a light twin airplane passing overhead and to my left, going south, low in altitude (200-300 ft) presumably for landing (as we could see landing lights and gear extended). this isn't unusual, the traffic patterns frequently pass over for that particular runway. but, a bright ring of 10 or more amber lights behind/beside the plane startled me, thinking someone just launched a ring-shaped fireworks display in dangerously close proximity to this landing plane. as the plane continued, apparently ignorant of these lights, the  mystery lights seemed to shut off, and disappear rather quickly. i quickly asked my wife if she had seen these \"fireworks,\" as she was in the front passenger seat of our jeep wrangler. she said she had not, but as i started to describe the lights as we continued down the road, they reappeared, as if they \"turned on\" with a switch, still to my left, above the trees, but at least 1000-2000ft from where i saw it last. it seemed as though whatever it was, it was moving at least 80+ mph, since it reappeared slightly ahead of us, and we were going e @ 70 mph. my wife saw it this time, and agreed it did look like fireworks (in shape and color), only to watch it disappear seconds later again, instantly. we were now a little confused, knowing it was not a plane, blimp, flares, or a mobile fireworks platform. as we continued east, and are struggling to say anything further, it reappears again, instantly, and it is now apparent that these lights must be fixed to a solid object, and are flashing at an interval of a couple seconds on (all of them), and then off simultaneously for a couple seconds. it was apparently tracking to the east-south-east, heading towards the bay and beyond. as the interstate curves to the north approaching scenic hgwy, the object crossed over the lanes, and because of its altitude and direction, my wife thought it would hit the ramada inn. it passed over though, still blinking its amber lights rhythmically, and we followed it on the off-ramp to scenic highway. when we got to the traffic light, my wife frantically pleaded that we go south on scenic and follow it. i just sat and stared as it continued east-southeast over the bay, apparently unable to speak or drive, or follow my wife's instructions. she asked me several more times, and i instead turned north to go home. i don't know why i didn't follow it, i wished that i had, but something majorly psycological was computing in my brain, and refusing to accept what we knew we just saw. i had never seen a ufo before, but my life has not been the same since. i just wish they'd come back again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

to go to the petrol station to get petrol as it shut at 2100. driving back into my street i noticed a red/orange coloured light in the sky quite near jupiter in sky as it was a very clear cold night, i called my wife out to look at it as i thought it was so strange looking,she came out and we began to observe the object which after a few mins and dicussussions of what it might be as at first i thought it may be an airplane as we live under the flight paths of both the george best airport and belfast international which i discounted because of the colour of the object and no flashing navigation lights, it suddenly started to rise very quickly into the night sky, i turned to my wife who was still looking at the quickly deminishing object and missed the best bit because when i took my eyes off the object my wife seen it shoot off at a fantastic speed to the north/west.Could it also be noted that this is now the third sighting of these kind of lights in the sky in the last 2 months, the first a single light orange coloured orb on holloween night and 2 weeks later multiple lights in a formation of sorts totaling 6 again orange coloured
