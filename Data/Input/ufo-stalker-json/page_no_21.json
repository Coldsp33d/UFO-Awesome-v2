visit my boyfriend in southern california and did not want to drive during the day because i just wanted to get there already because i knew the drive would be long. i left around 10:30pm and got to the spot i spotted these lights at around 11:20. funny thing is i had downloaded some podcasts to listen to on my long drive and i love listening to conspiracy ones so i was actually listening to a podcast at the time of this event, the title of the podcast was \"where are all the aliens?\" so i was driving on the road listening to the podcast and out of nowhere i see a light come through the trees as if a helicopter spotlight was searching for someone. i immediately turn off the podcast and look around as i am driving. i look up in the sky and start slowing down but see nothing, no plane, no helicopter, nothing. i did not even hear one noise. so i keep driving and see to the left a barn with a porch like lamp on the side of it and that was not enough light to make that big cast of light so i cancel that out. i keep driving about 30 more seconds and i see the light again, i am telling you this light was so huge and big it could not have been a flashlight, barn lamp, or car lights because it was 11:20 pm and all that was to the left of me was mostly farm land. i keep thinking it is still a helicopter spotlight so i keep looking around but can not see a thing in the sky. so at this point i am a little freaked out, i decide to try and call my boyfriend and the phone call would not go through, it would just say called failed without even ringing. i once again keep driving and saw the light once more, this light was not as bright as the first two times but still looked like a spotlight. by the way on the side where i kept seeing lights was mostly trees and farmland. i did not see anymore lights after that but did have a eerie feeling the rest of my night driving. i felt like i was being watched all throughout my drive through sweet water road. that road is very lonely and has lots of trees and rocks on each side and it was just not a good feeling driving through that at night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":90654,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.98575080000001,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03092018-0001","longitude":-119.1629309,"occurred":1519860000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1520563794000,"summary":"Driving

late 1950s. we were in a very rural area where most people did not have electricity near us. we had a perfect view of the bay with no fog or clouds most of the night hours that season.\r\non our first sighting we had just come home from saint john from visiting our familty. it was dark and no moon the first sighting. \r\ni have mapped out using google maps where we lived and where we saw our first sighting.\r\nit was my father, mother, brother and sister who witnessed this sighting and none of us knew what it was.\r\nbeing from that culture we had heard numerous ghost stories of the maritime area and we grew up with that mindset.\r\nthe object had 3 to 5 lights on it with changeing colours and blinking on and off. we knew it was not a plane, jet or helicopter and because of it being at least 100 feet over the ocean it could not be a ship.\r\nthe oject moved only slightly for at least one hour, to the point we were getting bored. it did leave and traveled s.E. over the water and went into the bay.\r\nwe had numerous sightings after that as well as the fishermen telling stories of what they saw numerous times while lobster and cod fishing as far out and 5 to 10 miles.\r\nim 66 years old now and all of the people and family members are gone. but that being said not one person ever took photos of any of their sightings.\r\ni just heard about a documentory that showed how the canadian government ask the american navy to help study these sightings in the 50 and 60s.\r\ni would be interested in learning more about what we saw.\r\ni live in las vegas now and in the 1970s we wittnessed ufo's in the skies are vegas but nothing ive seen in nevada was as close as these sightings.\r\nit is my theory that the reason for so much ufo sightings is our tides at the bay of fundy are the most extreme in the world. we have as much as 50 feet difference from low tide to high tide. as well at most of the bay of fundy is not over 300 feet deep which is perfect for marine life to reproduce.\r\ni am a disabled viet nam veteran and am getting ready to retire. i would like to learn more about what you do.","distance":"Over One

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At time of sighting, was dwelling on brixton dr. in extreme ne quadrant of amarillo, tx.  was outdoors in rear yard of residence in early afternoon, prior to my kids' arrival back home from school by bus, engaged in activity of jumping on trampoline while facing north.  day was seasonably warm in temp., do not recall noticeable wind, sun was approx. 45 degrees off of horizon to ssw, and regional sky cloudless, with exception of single, smallish, white, \"oddball\" cloud noted to extreme north.  personal past experiences had made me a bit more interested/aware than most of things in the air around me, and while maintaining caution towards landings during jumping on trampoline, would periodically glance idly about the sky around me, to see if any aircraft could be seen, especially with the nearby proximity of amarillo international airport few miles away from my position, to the ese.  glancing quickly around me while jumping, i noticed something traveling in the air approx. 1.5-2 miles to the east of my position, that i took at first, quick glance as a common commercial passenger airliner.  with quick glance at object, had noted there was something \"unusual/not right\" about its appearance, causing me to do \"double-take\" glance back at object, whereupon noticed that object did not appear to possess wings, or tail structures.  realization caused me to stop trampoline jumping activity, and brought object under intense observation.  object was initially at approx. 15 degrees off of the horizon (approx. 30 degrees, when nearest), at estimated altitude of approx. 3,000 ft., on a nw trajectory course, traveling at speed normally associated to commercial airliner travel speed while slowly gaining altitude.  no associated noise or smell detected throughout incident, no detected reactions from area's scattered cattle present, and object seemed to always display linear trajectories & consistent speed.  initially, watched object travel from the point to my east, to a point to my nw, with the object  approaching to within approx. 3/4-1 mile distance, when passed point to my ne, with total uninterrupted initial observation time of approx. 3-3.5 minutes.  object appeared as large, round-ended, material construct of cylindrical shape, composed of metallic exterior with appearance/coloration of dull, aged/weathered, non-reflective aluminum/magnesium, with estimated length approx. 80-100 ft., and diameter of approx. 20-25 ft.  object appeared to be moderately covered upon its exterior surface with seemingly random arrangement of mostly square & rectangular \"panels/patchworks\", of dull, flat, darkish, brick-red/red-brown coloration (maroon?).  while had object under such observation, , specifically looked for conventional features found on normal aircraft, but detected no wings, no tail structure, no engines, no contrail/exhaust trail/turbine thermal heat-ripple trail, no landing gear, no windows/portals, no doors/hatches, no copula, no gondola, no exterior lights, and no exterior lettering/numbers/logos.  while observing object, experienced growing sense of unease & confusion as systematically failed to detect any conventional features upon it, as well as a growing \"sense\" that the occupants/controllers of object were \"aware\" that had them under observation, and were somehow \"reading my thoughts\" throughout the incident.  when object reached a point to my nw, and appeared intent on continuing onward away from my location, i derisively dismissed the whole thing as \"b.S.\", figured inability to detect conventional features upon object \"must\" simply be due to my particular angle of observation, as such are only the type of things read about in newspapers/magazines, or sees on t.V.  disregarded object and took eyes off it for approx. 10 seconds, while i resumed vigorous jumping activity upon trampoline, again.  after approx. 10 seconds of jumping, complete inability to detect anything conventional about object gradually weighed heavy enough on mind, that cast suspicious glance back into area of sky had last seen object, and was fairly shocked & astonished to see object had apparently \"reversed course\", and was now headed in opposite direction, towards where had been first spotted, without having swung around wide in normal aircraft \"turn\", as object appeared to keep the same side oriented towards me, throughout incident.  realizing such maneuver would be impossible for something conventional size of commercial airliner, immediately stopped trampoline jumping activity again, cursed self for missing course reversal being executed, and again brought object under intense observation for similar period of approx. 3-3.5 minutes.  observation results were just as confusing as before, although again sensed object's occupants/controllers had intensified their own awareness of me, perhaps being unfamiliar with function of trampoline, and may have \"surprised\" them enough with such, to reverse course and pass by again, for \"2nd look\".  when object reached approx. location where first seen, again derisively dismissed whole thing as b.S., although not as \"confidently\" as before, and repeated process of taking eyes off the object for approx. 10 seconds, while again resumed trampoline activities.  unconventional nature of object was weighing even heavier on mind, and after jumping again for brief period, glanced with trepidation back towards where object last seen.  was bit stunned & dumbfounded to observe had again missed witnessing a course reversal executed by object, stopped jumping activity again, brought object under intense observation once more, with mental determination not take eyes off again, in case executed another course reversal, until could no longer see/detect it.  with this last course reversal, object appeared to have adjusted its course trajectory somewhat, and now traveling in direction more to north, appearing to slowly, gradually increase altitude as progressed.  had sense that object's occupants/controllers were aware of my thought determinations towards witnessing course reversal & continuing observation uninterrupted until lost to sight, as object never thereafter executed another course reversal under observation, and object now seemed to head towards the one small, oddball cloud formation in region, in extreme north.  had object under observation another approx. 7-8 minutes, until lost in distance to unaided eye, prior having reached distant cloud.  cloud estimated at approx. 10,000-15,000 ft. altitude.  when first sighted, object passing over/near then-recent \"ground-breaking\" efforts towards multiple, new texas department of criminal justice sites/buildings.  in area proximity is also pantex plant, where u.S. was dismantling \"surplus\" nuclear weapons during time period, from treaty with u.S.S.R.  several weapons storage bunkers evident around plant area, and object may originally in area to \"survey\" new construction sites.  almost immediately thereafter incident, developed sense of dread/foreboding had attracted unwanted \"attention\" by phenomenon, and quite soon thereafter began noticing signs/evidence of possible abduction activity involving my kids, as

used to play when i was around eight or nine years old. one early evening, i am working my way down the road, heading home after leaving a friends place. i had my head down, looking at my feet as i walked, while keeping the curb insight out of the corner of my eye. the challenge to this game however, was to try and guess how far i had walked, and how close i was getting to my house without cheating by looking up. when i finally stopped and lifted my head, i realized with a smile of triumph that i was standing right in front of my house. we lived in a one story, back split house with an open carport, were the front of the house faced east, and the back faced west. the house was also perched on a rise that over looked the rest of the neighborhood to the west. \r\n\r\ni remember feeling the low suns warmth on the right side of my face as i stood there in the street as it began to set. its warmth drew me, i remember closing my eyes as i turned and faced west into the suns direction so i could bask in its comforting orange glow for the moment. turning my head and looking east, i noticed the night’s zenith approaching; i loved this time of the evening, i loved the way you could track the night’s zenith moving across the sky back then. i remember wondering at that moment, if i looked strait up, maybe i would be able to see the first star of the night; i use to like wishing on the first star at that age.\r\n\r\nas i saluted the sky to block the sunlight while stretching my head back to look strait up, i noticed the first bright star in the sky directly above me. i remember thinking how lucky i was, as i took a moment to search the rest of the sky above me for more stars, but found none. now i am sure, i had only taken my eyes off the star above me for only a brief moment when i scanned the rest of the sky. nevertheless, before i could finish assembling my thoughts that were beginning to materialize in my mind about what wish i was going to make, a bright object about the size of a quarter held at arms length was there above me instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore i had time to express my amazement, a huge oval object over twice the size of a house, materialized directly above me, it was floating silently just above the height of the tv aerials, which most of the homes had, back then. it had gone from the size of a quarter to the size of the monster that hovered over me now, in the blink of an eye, without making a sound. \r\n\r\ni could not stop my legs from shaking as i stood there paralyzed with fear, i was scared shitless and amazed at the same time, and i could not move as i studied the mirror like surface of the object that had stopped to look me over. it was the first and the last time that i ever remembered experiencing, involuntary body movement. i also remember hearing in my peripheral, the lawn mower that had been going across the street, stop. it was then; that i realized i was not as alone as i felt.\r\n\r\nmy eyes were glued to the object, and it felt as if time stood still. i could see the whole neighborhood reflected off the curvature of the crafts mirrored surface. the roof of my house was inverted in the objects reflective surface, with the reflected tv aerial, looking like it was close to touching the real thing. what made the whole experience even more surreal was the memory of seeing the sun setting, and the sun setting off the westward rim of the object; it was as if i was watching two sunsets, which is an image that has been burned into my mind, to this day.  \r\n\r\nit was a huge egg shaped mirror. those were my last thoughts as i watched it slowly begin to float away from me, silently moving north up the street, while finally gaining altitude as it flew over my school before disappearing from sight.\r\n\r\nas soon as i was able to move, i went running screaming my head off into my house, freaking my mother out, she thought at the time i had hurt myself. at first, she refused to believe the incident as i told her. we had a running joke going on in the family back then, where she would tell my brother and me that she was from outer space. my mother thought at first that i might have been influenced by her stories, until she heard the incident reported on the radio. i do not think she was ever able to bring herself to believe the personal nature of the experience that had happened to me, as i had described it to her back then. what adult truly listens to a kid with the same level of belief that they would have with another adult. \r\n\r\nover one hundred people saw this object, including my teacher mrs. davis from the school i attended, and it also made the news on the radio as well. it happened in scarborough, ont., canada, about a mile south of the ctv television station. i was eight or nine at the time so this incident took place in 1963 or 1964, i cannot remember which.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100
