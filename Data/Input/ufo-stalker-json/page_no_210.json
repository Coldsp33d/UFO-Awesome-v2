moving and immediately grabbed my attention because of it's size and color. i had no idea what to think when i first saw it. possibly a bomb? possibly an astroid? shooting star? \r\n\r\nit kept going it a straight motion. the best way i can describe it is with force. it wasn't moving around or doing any horizontal/vertical maneuvers. it was blasting straight into the direction of the ocean right over the hills of woodside. being so early in the morning there was only 2 or 3 other cars headed in my same direction, and they all were noticing spectacular light beam as well. i took a few pictures with my iphone. \r\n\r\nthe weirdest part was how the light beam suddenly seem to change from a fully intact stream of light to a circular object leaving a trail of circular \"poofs\" of where i'm

44 year led females. we were camping alone at dry lake primitive campsite, located in the smith river national recreation area about 16 miles due east of crescent city and 10 miles southeast of gasquet. \r\n\r\nit was a very clear night and we were sitting around the campfire looking at the stars and seeing lots of satellites flying around. there seemed to be an unusually high number visible. i was looking off to my right (south, as measured by the compass app on my iphone) when i saw a diamond shaped formation which was close together. by close, i mean if you extended your arm and then opened the space between your thumb and index finger no more than two inches then this formation would fit within that space.\r\n\r\nit was diamond shaped or triangular with a leader and two lights on either side trailing in chevron formation. there was a light on either side below forming the triangular/diamond formation. about 7 lights in all. they moved in unison and didn't break formation. as they came closer, the trailing lights faded out much like the satellites we saw were doing as the sunlight contact made them fade. i don't think the fading was caused by unnatural causes.\r\n\r\ni pointed it out to everyone and we all saw it cross a big portion of the sky until it was due north and farthest overhead. it wasn't flying directly over head but was at about 70 degrees above the east horizon. ( again, i measured this on my iphone app using a clinometer)\r\n\r\nthe back lights first faded then the other ones faded also when they reached the highest point in the sky. . before they faded i looked to make sure it wasn't a solid object with lights. i saw stationary stars behind the formation as it passed them which indicated it was a formation of separate objects. \r\n\r\ni didn't take a picture as it won't show well on the iphone. soon after there seemed to be a brief aurora that turned the sky reddish. i don't think that was related nor were the other satellites but there sure were a lot flying around that were visible at that time. nothing indicated these were more than some strange formation of objects but it seems highly unusual that these 7 objects were in a unison formation like they were. they flew a straight line pattern. \r\n\r\nthere was nothing else flying in the sky at the time when these appeared, no satellites or airplanes. the air space here is very quite and the visibility was incredible, the night sky was so bright. i have included a picture drawing of what we saw. \r\n\r\nall we did was joke about it and say how cool it was as it was clearly flying at the level of satellites and was not a threat to us. it was just crazy.\r\n","distance":"Over One

not blinking. i guess i thought they could have been government craft. they usually \"fly\" slow, making minor trajectory changes here and there. sometimes they blink at me when i \"speak\" to them or mentally acknowledge their presence. \r\n\r\ni've noticed lately that they will appear seconds after i think about them and react to my words/thoughts. i once saw one 6 or so feet away around lunch time. i almost wrecked my car, i was so in awe. \r\n\r\na couple days ago, i requested a \"demonstration\" from them, and one appeared. i followed it with my new binoculars and it split up into multiple lights before blinking in a strange pattern in the sky. \r\n\r\ni've also had a \"handshake\", of sorts. i would really like to speak with someone about my experiences in more detail. \r\n\r\ndr. greer's ce5 protocols seem to be working for me. \r\n\r\nalso, they have allowed me to introduce certain friends to their beautiful presence. \r\n\r\nplease contact me. i feel a little isolated and would like to speak with someone from mufon. \r\n\r\ni was hesitant to submit my report because of the obvious dangers, but i have a feeling that these entities have my back, for some reason. \r\n\r\nplease contact me. thank you for listening.

orange orbs flying towards my friends and me. they stopped and hovered then left. okay so with that out of the way, lets start from the beginning. \r\n\r\nit was later on in the evening as described above and two of my friends were with me in front of my parents house, just hanging out and relaxing, doing what teenagers do on summer break. let me also state that no alcohol or drugs were involved. my friends and i were never into that stuff at an early age. it was a warm clear night, and the town was alive, mainly due to the carnival about 4-5 blocks down at the local church. some neighbors were out lighting fireworks and you could hear the great time from the carnival even from that far away.  you could also see the ambient glow of the lights from the carnival. nothing like the blinking or strobing lights from rides more like the steady glow of white generator lights in the night sky. \r\nmy two friends (boy and girl) and i decided not to go to the carnival that night and just relax in front of the house and chill. two of my other friends left us and decided to see what was good there that year. about 30 mins after they left, my neighbor three houses to the east was lighting off fireworks, but none of them took off lol, they kept miss firing into the neighbors yard to the southeast of my house. 10 mins go by and he goes inside, i looked up in the distance and saw some orange lights way up high. thinking they were fireworks from the carnival, i gave no mind to them. \r\n\r\nabout five minutes go by and i look up to see more \"fireworks\" from the carnival (to the south) and the same orange lights were exactly in the same spot as before (or so it seemed from that distance). i kept my gaze on them to see them explode, but they never did. as i kept my eyes on them i noticed them getting bigger. they were traveling towards me (south-north). without looking away i yelled to my friends to see if they saw what i was seeing. they said yes but paid no mind, thinking they were fire works. as they drew closer they descended to about the height of the run of the mil power lines, not the huge ones, so about just below tree top level (around 50ft.) i could now count them and there were 10-12 bright neon orange orbs. somehow still thinking they were fireworks i got nervous and thought they would explode to close to us. i yelled back to my friends to look and they stopped what they were doing to look.\r\n\r\nthe orbs were flying in a v-shaped formation, when they got as close to us as they did, they stopped right over my neighbors roof. the orbs changed formation to a straight line running east west (so perpendicular to the way they were traveling). the orbs stayed there for about 2 mins, during their hovering (what i consider communication) they started dancing in and around each other for about 10-20 secs. after their brilliant dance, they lined up again same as before and slowly started flying towards us, over our heads and as they passed the roof tops behind us, they picked up speed and were gone just like that.","distance":"21-100
