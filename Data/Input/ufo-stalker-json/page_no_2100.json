about the odd things before he had gotten into bed earlier, and went to the bathroom. i decided to look out side to the east...Towards magalia,ca and saw what looked like a star coming towards our home. as soon as i realized that it was not normal it seemed to stop,then i wondered ifmaybe my brain was just flooded with melatonin; and as soon as that thought crossed my mind the star seemed to come towards my home again. i started getting quite scared and even got nauseous. and instantly knocked on the bathroom door to tell my husband. he then looked out the window and said he saw a star. i looked again and the star seemed to be moving from side to side, kind of wavering around in the same area. my husband looked again and said it was probably a cloud passing over the star and that why it appeared to be moving. i looked out the window again and the star was gone and there were grey clouds out in the sky but i wasn't sure if the clouds were where i had seen the star.

road, which backed onto hartsholm country park below.  \r\n\t \r\n harts park, lincoln.\taround 3 miles from lincoln city centre is hartsholm country park in lincolnshire uk.\r\n \r\ni used to have an open mind about ufo`s in those days as i thought that we the human race must be very arrogant as to believe that we are the only living thing in the universe with intelligence.\r\n \r\nconfirmation that intelligence does exist elsewhere in the universe was proved to me that night 02/01/2000.\r\n \r\nroutinely i would walk the dogs every night up a path which leads from birchwood avenue to the edge of hartsholm country park, the path ran around the back of my house in tudor road.  the night started off as a normal every day night until whilst walking up the winding path i stopped and let the dogs off the lead, this was as we were reaching the end of the path which leads into the park, it was common practice for me to let the dogs run into the woods to do their business while i waited for them at the end of the path, there is a street lamp there and on this occasion the filament was red instead of orange.\r\n \r\nwhile i waited not thinking about anything in particular i experienced a severe pain in my temporal lobe, it felt like the worst migraine that i have ever experienced before, i put my hand up to my head and i felt compelled to look up as if the pain was coming from a direction, and when i looked up i could not believe what i was looking at, i saw a huge bright white light, and it was blinding to look at, it was the brightest whitest light that i have ever seen, i was ridged to the spot in shock, and i felt like my mind was being read, i remember feeling very angry because without my permission all that was in my mind was stolen, mind raped is the best description that i can give.\r\n \r\ni began to fight back mentally and i cursed it with every thing that i could from god and jesus through to mary, then all of a sudden it just shot straight up at an indescribable speed and became a star, you remember the old black and white televisions when you turned them off the picture would reduce to a tiny dot, well that is as close to the speed that i can get.   \r\n \r\ni stood there still ridged to the spot when my dogs suddenly appeared, i did not even hang around to put the leads on them and i ran home as fast as i could, the dogs thankfully arrived with me unharmed, i ran because i was afraid that it would come back and get me.\r\ni told my partner at the time and we agreed that we should keep it to ourselves.   \r\n \r\nthe following day at around 15:00 in broad daylight, i decided that my partner and i would have fish and chips for tea, so i took a walk with my german sheppard dog down to the chippy, which was at a shopping precinct called the forum just off birchwood avenue, when halfway to the chippy i felt that compulsion again to look up and there through a gap in the clouds was this huge black triangular craft with lights very dimly lit, the lights where fuzzy and distorted to look at as the clouds passed under the strange craft, the colours omitted was red and green, i watched in shock as cars went down the road and the drivers not knowing what was hovering above them, school children walked the pavement on the other side of the road blissfully unaware.\r\n \r\ni didn���t raise the alarm, i don���t know why but i just watched, then another thick cloud passed underneath it, then another gap appeared and there was nothing to be seen, it had completely vanished.   i hatefully got to the fish and chip shop, said nothing to the staff apart from ordering my meals and got home as fast as i could.\r\n \r\non arriving home i told my partner and she was surprised but very understanding, we talked all night and agreed what we had before, to keep it to ourselves.\r\ntwo weeks later we had a neighbour come over for dinner, and as the night progressed the wine flowed and bill my neighbour who worked for boeing aircraft manufacturers on their breaking systems at waddington airbase, i told him myself what i had seen. he listened intently and said, \"you should have mentioned it before as i believe someone else reported seeing a ufo to the lincolnshire echo\".   i still have not seen the report that���s if it exists at all, and it would be great if it does then it would confirm my sighting.\r\n \r\nthe houses in area that i lived in called doddington park are mainly occupied by raf pilots and personnel, i wonder if that has any bearing to my sighting, i myself am not connected to the raf, i am just an ordinary civilian.\r\n \r\nyours truthfully\r\n \r\nash\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n

of 2008 i decided that i would make it a practice to go out every night and look at the sky in hope to find it and it was cloudy a lot so i waited for it to clear then finally a few weeks later on december the 18th i seen it and when it flashed it was a pure bright white light and as i observed it i could see the flash going back into a say oval shaped object  and as it went up the object the light would go out from behind it. this light was clearly contained within an object.I could see it well enough that i could see like some sort of compartment where i thought the light might stop and then it did stop about maybe say two thirds up the object then where the light stopped i could see the oval shaped of a form of some kind of compartment where the light did not seem to extend it self.

when i observed two aircraft that appeared identical to each other, flying side by side at the same speed. both aircraft had a vapor trail immediately behind them, however, one aircraft was pulling its vapor trail with it so that it didn't change in length. the other aircraft left a vapor trail that stretched into the distance from where it had been. i was very surprised to see that one of the aircraft was pulling its vapor trail along with it when the other one wasn't so i pointed it out to my fiance. i had never seen an aircraft pull its vapor trail with it. a few weeks ago i woke up in the night because i realized that what i probably saw was one aircraft being reflected on the surface of something i couldn't see. it was a bright sunny afternoon with few high cirrus clouds. the reason the vapor trail appeared to be pulled along is because it was at the end of a reflective surface. whatever was reflecting the other plane had to be huge because the whole aircraft and a good length of its vapor trail was fully reflected. there was no mistaking the visual event we witnessed. there is a military base nearby where central command for the middle east is headquartered so we might have some kind of top secret (invisible) aircraft in the area i suppose; but i can't imagine us having one as big as this one would have to be.
