mountains, blinked out of sight.  the plane pursued it until then and flew in circles after it disappeared.  my mother and i were very excited and amazed by the presence of the spheres.  i was pretty sure they were ships and not made by our military.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

was my first time in bumpass, va, we were staying at a lakehouse and we were sitting right next to the water. the surrounding area is predominantly woods and there are many abandoned houses, planes, and cars lying in random fields. my boyfriend said \"look at that shooting star\" and we all turned around. we knew it wasn't a shooting star immediately because by the time you turn around to see one it's usually gone, but the object we saw in the sky was visible for 3 seconds (my boyfriend says 4 seconds because he was the first to see it). it was also obvious that whatever it was, it was inside the atmosphere, and at least (i'm not good with distances) a mile away. after the 3 seconds i saw it, it disappeared behind the tree line. it looked like a glowing, blue, slightly oblong ball. it moved in a horizontal, slightly downward motion across the skyline. it wasn't floating, or falling, and didn't even seem to be flying the way a plane does. the best word to describe it was it seemed like it was driving. everyone around the campfire saw it, 8 of us were adults ranging from 19 to 60, 3 were teens and 4 were kids ranging from 6 to 9. the campfire was not obstructing my view of the object. when i saw the object the first thing i thought was \"that's not a falling star\" and the second thing i thought was \"that's a ufo\". i remember being completely surprised i saw one on vacation, i remember wishing my dad was there to see it. however, i never thought \"oh maybe it was fireworks\" \"maybe it was a spotlight\" like some of the other people around the campfire. i said to them \"that was a ufo.\" they laughed but they stopped guessing what it was. i just felt like i knew it was a ufo. everyone around the campfire then agreed: 1) they had never seen anything like it

reported in the ocala star banner the next day. however, i had never pursued any information about it.\r\n\r\non may 14, 1978 at night, i was coming home from ocala with a girl friend.I was driving down an unpaved isolated road where i lived when i had an encounter with a craft. all i can recall of the event is that my friend and i were standing, leaning back against my car looking up at a craft. it was a hazy experience. i remember looking at her profile and  thinking that the light was so bright that i could see tiny little hairs on her nose.I recall feeling like i was moving in slow motion. i can best describe the craft as reminding me of giant tinker toys. it had round pod like compartments connected with large cylinders.  it had green, white and i think red lights (looked pinkish) anyway the colors seemed to look like muted and blurred neon lights. i think that it was no more than 20 - 30 feet away from us. i do not remember getting out of my car or getting back into my car and going home. the next morning i said to my friend, off-handedly \"do you remember seenng that last night\"? her reply was yes. and that was the end of the discussion. the event seemed dream like and i had no impulse to talk about it further with her, nor did she with me. i vaguely remember something about my friend's face looking like it was sun burnt, but don't recall if my face was burnt. \r\n\r\ni remember seeing this object hovering silent and still above us and i remember being outside my car and everything else is a blank. my research of this event corresponds with the sightings at the pine castle electronic center. so for any other reports of this sighting, i will attest 100 percent that this craft was there.","distance":"21-100
