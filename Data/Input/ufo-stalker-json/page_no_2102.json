overcast, but as the night approached the clouds gave way to partial clearing and you could see some stars. i was sweeping snow from my front walk and driveway when out of the corner of my eye i saw what i thought was a formation of geese(not knowing if geese fly at night) i turned to look and realized i was looking at a inverted \"v\" shaped object maybe the size of three commerical jets. the object was illuminated by beautiful amber colored lights spaced evenly around two sides of the inverted \"v\". the object was cruising lower than any plane i had ever seen and there was no sound coming from the object other than a wisp of air being displaced. i realized the object must of flown unnoticed almost directly above me as it was on a southeastern course. i watched the object for about 25 seconds before it did disappear into a cloud. i watched for about five minutes more, but i did not see it again.\r\nthe inverted \"v\" was not a solid triangle shape, the back of it seemed to have 90 degree fins which also had the amber lights, but i am not absolutely positive about this.\r\ni immediately told my mother what i saw and the next day my uncle. my uncle ask me if it could have been a sleath bomber, but i have seen the sleath and the answer is no. i have told no one else for fear of being thought crazy and thought long and hard in telling mufon! \r\n\r\nthank you for your

louisville kentucky for business. facing the plane, i sat on the right side of the plane just ahead of the wing next to the window. once we reached cruising altitude, i started reading a book.I became increasingly bored and looked outside my window. i noticed a sphere about the size of a compact car approximately 200 feet off the wing of the plane.\r\n\r\nit was dull in color. an unpolished metal nearly exact in the image of a very large ball bearing, it was perfect in it's spherical shape. always looking for a logical, scientific explanation to anything paranormal first,i assumed it was a tiny bubble in the glass of the window or ice on the glass of the window. i studied it for about a minute and was astonished when i witnessed it move behind a small cloud.\r\n\r\ni immediately looked down the aisle and noticed many other passengers were looking outside the window at the object as well. i looked at the object again and noticed it never swayed, dove or maneuvered at all. it was very static in it's position. this made me skeptical. how can any craft fly alongside another craft and never move, in any manner from it's present position? anything in flight is always fighting the physics of the atmosphere every second i.E. barometric pressure, wind, air pockets, friction, etc... \r\n\r\ni looked for an explanation. maybe some strange tether to a weather balloon or refraction of light on the window? there was no physical explanation. it was what it was. my mind raced as i tried to understand how something so non-aerodynamic could possibly create lift. i looked for some sort of glow or exhaust or any type of radiation to explain it's terrestrial origin. nothing. it sat at one position with no presence of any mechanical movement. it appeared as if it was observing us, though there were no visual ports or windows. \r\n\r\ni didn't take my eyes off of the object as i knew i was witnessing something extraordinary and oddly beautiful. i, for the first time in my life was truly in awe. we traveled into a thick cloud formation. i witnessed the sphere pass through a patch of thick cloud and never resurface. as soon as it appeared it was gone. \r\n\r\nhere is where things got weird. i looked down the aisle to hopefully catch eye contact with someone who was witnessing this event and could discuss this. what i witnessed next shook me to my core. all other witnesses, approximately 20 plus, just leaned back into their seats and continued reading their books, newspapers and laptops as if nothing happened. why was i the only person who felt as if i just witnessed a magnificent moment? whether it was a higher intelligence or something we created, it was a beautiful moment. \r\n\r\ni reflected on this for several minutes up to the final hour of our flight. once we reached our terminal,i had totally forgotten the entire experience. how could this happen? how could i forget an experience that shook my entire core and being? several years later i started to slowly recall my experience. why did the other passengers not even have any sign of expression on their face after the incident? why did i totally forget the entire experience until many years later?

video. \r\n\r\nmy family was traveling eastbound on i-20 on the evening of 1/2/2010. it was approximately 7:40 when i noticed a very bright object towards the south. i kept traveling east bound and watching the object at our 1:00 position. it was producing red, green, and white lights and was pulsating. i told my wife to look out the window and watch this light.  as we continued down the road the object moved towards our 2:00 position. after watching it for five or so minutes my wife decided she didn't know what it was and nor did i. i decided at this time to pull over at a rest stop at exit 390. my wife kept an eye on the object and it was now at our 3:00 position. we stopped the car near the entry of the rest stop. my still camera and video camera were packed in the back so i jumped out. as i got out of the car my wife said that it disappeared, but she was able to get a great visual of this object. i was disappointed, but for some reason i still scanned the skies and as i looked towards my 11:00 (northerly) i saw an object coming straight overhead. it had red and green lights on the tips and a white light in the middle. i waited a second because i thought it was an airplane that might be headed in the direction of the light we saw, but as it came closer i saw that it was a triangular craft.  it was flying between 200-300 ft.  i immediately jumped to the back of my car and grabbed my still camera and took two shots- one without the flash and one with. the object went directly over my head. the best shape i can describe it as is the shape of your typical triangle highlighter. the edges were very rounded. the tips of each end was a light. one side was solid green and the other side solid red. the front was a solid white. the white light was not very bright and i could see the contours of all the lights very clearly. it was not your typical bulb lights, but a solid and smooth light that was actually the ends of the triangle. each corner of the triangle was a contoured light.  however, the white light in the front of the craft did not cover the entire nose. i did not hear a single engine sound out of the object. the highway could not have drowned out any normal aircraft since it was not that high. the object absolutely displayed it's lights like a normal airplane to anyone casually looking, but i was able to get such a good look at it there is no way it was anything \"known.\"\r\n\r\ni checked my still camera and the pictures were horrible. i then scrambled to retrieve my mini-hd sony camcorder out of the back of the van. by the time i got to it the object was just over the small tree line out of my site. i jumped back in and drove up to the exit of the rest stop. i jumped back out and walked south (which would be my 3:00 position originally). i stopped near the access road and was still able to get some footage of the craft which now looked like a pulsating light. i've posted all the videos i shot of this object here. you can view them in hd, but they don't compare to the object as it flew over me.\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=gvxq5sb8kyo\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=5jh3pbodueq\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=ie80_goc2kw \r\n\r\ni was still kicking myself because i didn't pull out the video camera first so i decided to see if i could head back west and catch up to the object since it was not moving that fast. i drove approximately 3 miles west on the access round south of i-20 and then turned south towards stephenville. i was 1 mile south of i-20 when i stopped and got back out of the car. it was very dark since the moon was just starting to come up. i looked west, but could not see the object any longer. as i looked around i saw the moon rising and i then noticed another flashing light south of me. this starlike object was moving very slowly at first heading in a north east direction. it quickly picked up speed. a tree line was blocking my view, but it's trajectory should have allowed it to come through the other side of the tree line. it never did. that video is posted here:\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=7ncyxfurbe0 ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with

driving over to my mothers house to take her to the store i was driving down a backroad , nearing the stop sign on acton lane, off in the distance was a very strange looking object in the sky, it was moving in a very strange pattern, it would move to the right very fast then to the left very fast then straight up and then back, it continued to do this for about 7 minutes i did not know what this thing was so i just went on to my mothers house which was about a mile.I picked her up and started driving her to the store, i backed out and pulled to the stop sign by her house and there was the same object  up close now flying right above the tree tops and moving very slow.This object was very large, it was about the size of a football field, it was sort of oval shaped, metallic in color, it had no windows, no lights,around the center had lipped edges thats how close the object was to us, it made no sound, and the strangest thing about this object is it had like a black tube looking thing coming from the bottom center about half the lenght of the object, for some reason i felt as if it was searching for something.And i knew this was not something from our world.Then the following night i go back over to take her to the store again around 10 pm as we are pulling out from the same stop sign we see a lot of lights in the sky fling in a strange pattern that i have never seen before, they were flying at an average speed and we watched them out of sight. now the funny thing is when we got back to her house we were watching the news and the news castors were making jokes about the flying objects or lights flying over andrews airforce base and making jokes about them being ufos.I will never forget this event and it will always be very clear in my mind. i will also send a sketch

lake erie on 12-26-09 at approx. 9 pm. hovered silently then moved slowly over the lake heading west. stopped again over head and vanished.\r\n\r\n this occured while i was laying on our boat pier the night after christmas watching the stars on a super clear calm night. i was talking to a friend on the phone who later helped me recall the details i described to him and the length of time it took place.  i remember nervously joking on the phone with him as it was happening that i was all alone in an isolated place and what if they just decided to \"beam me up\", that was when it slowed to a stop for the second time directly over head paused for a second or two and then vanished.  i made a half joking comment to him about wondering if they were listening in to our phone conversation before taking off.\r\n\r\n it lasted only a few min.  but the occurrence was so amazing because there was almost no wind blowing on the beach and the lake was super calm, yet the object did not have any sound like the rest of the planes that i was watching that night flying over the lake.\r\n\r\n there was a lot of air traffic in the sky being the day after christmas and this was coming from an odd angle and in the opposite direction of the other planes. also it did not continually move at times or have the right color lights or right blinking sequence of lights like a regular aircraft.  plus the shape was a triangle with no apparent row of lights along the widest bottom part. it looked flat black and was solid so as to block out any stars it passes over.\r\n\r\n i was lying very still for over 15 mins. on the pier just enjoying the beautiful clear night's sky before it first caught my attention in the corner of my eye.  i just continued to lay there in amazment while describing it to my friend on the phone. he told me to take a picture but i figured that by the time i brought up the app on my iphone it would be gone and i figured the phone wouldn't get a decent picture in the middle of the black night sky with no flash. plus i was kind of shocked and could only watch and tell my friend what i was seeing  i might have tried if i had my regular digital camera with me but it all seemed to happen so  fast, i just couldn't take my eyes off of it while it was happening.\r\n\r\nit was so distinct, i'm sure i wasn't the only person to see such a strange sighting over the lake. i don't know if this had anything to do with anything, but right after it disapeared, clouds rolled in and a dense blanket of fog rolled onto shore from the north off the lake. the temp dropped sharply with the fog appearance and the rolling cloud cover although it had been crystal clear for the 3 hours i had spent there.

bridge, i noticed a small light, about star size, was following us. at first i thought it could have been a satellite or a plane. we drove to the nearest public library and parked, and noticed that the light was still following us. this made us kind of concerned and curious, so we followed it to the tacoma waterfront. \r\n\r\nacross the water, just above the horizon, was a bright light,

mo. old started flipping out...So my husband got up and started to walk her in the aisle.  out of embarrassment i started to stare out of the window.  i noticed a series of orange lights that were pulsating in a sequence.  at 1st i thought it was christmas lights or an airport.  it started in a foresty area and at 1st i thought it was much smaller than it was.  but the lights started to go over highways and malls and then i realized that the size of the lights were about the size of a car.  there were five of them and they stayed in the same formation.  i guess the craft was invisible because i didn't see anything but lights.  every once in a while in addition to the five lights i would see a line of lights that kinda looked like this ..................\r\nit almost looked like as it was skimming over the ground that it was like a surge of energy would brighten up as it traveled.  i watched this go on for about 10 minutes. it traveled parallel to the flight path but was nearly on the ground and i was however high up commercial airplanes fly.  it wasn't scary, i'm not scared now.  i'm not even sure it was anything.  the only reason why i am reporting this is because i mentioned this to my friend who i just left in florida that we got in okay told her about it and she told me to report it. several times i looked away from the lights and told my husband what i saw seeing and he thought i was crazy.  but every time i looked back i could see it again.  it went away simply with no warning just the lights stopped pulsating and i guess it was gone.

there were some pockets of clear spots. i park my car, at the store. the other people around me were rushing into the fred meyers to hide from the rain and cold, cars where driving past me as well. there was a high feeling of stress area) i saw a flash of white light more in a searching pattern. the ship flew over the fred meyer store and i only i saw the ship clearly for a around 10 seconds it was thin and shape was like cigar, the color of the ship was black i believe; or a very dark color on the ends of the ship there was very bright white \"search lights\" that were scanning the air.

to understand what happened to me in 1989. i was renting a 2 bedroom condo in north dallas. i had a roommate, carole. also who stayed in the bedroom directly across the living room area from my bedroom. i was walking out of my bedroom around like 1 pm and i turned my eyes to the right as i was going through the doorway and i hear this \" pop \" sound and i see three tiny(maybe like 3 or 4 inches in diamater) greyish-metallic spheres fly right through the wall !!!!....I have like 21/10 vision up close and i was maybe like 2 feet away so i could see them so clearly. they were also flying in an elliptical pattern and i could see that the \" popping \" sound was them literally expanding and contracting the wall as they went through it !!..I could even see that \" doppler effect \" colors kind of pooling on the surface of the spheres..My roommate carole was coming out of her room too ans saw something but she was like over 10 ft away at least....I only saw them for less than a second and they were gone so they must have been going very fast...Ok now fast forward to the present. i was in my bathroom and brushing my teeth...After taking a shower....And i hear that \" pop \" sound again coming from the other room in the living room area which i have converted to my bedroom too and the bedroom i use as like a storage area kind of and that's where the barhroom is....So, anyway that night or the next night(i am not sure) i was walking out of my bathroom into my living room/bedroom area and i see these two perfect symmetrical cirles on my carpet in front of my bed !!!...They look like \" crop circles \" and one even has what looks like a star map inside it and they are very close to the same diameter of the spheres i saw in 1989 !!!..I wasn't going to report it then i remembered that crop circles can have radiation left behind and i am wondering if these are emitting some kind of toxic radiation.....Could u plesse come and use a geiger counter to check them out.......I have enclosed photos  thanks cici leah campbell","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am not sure why i never reported this, but i will do so now.\r\n\r\ni believe it was around 1998 in the early fall, maybe september (might have even been 1999.  i am judging this about the relative grade level i was in school at the time).  i was driving with a friend from the minneapolis-st. paul area to rochester, mn along highway 52 with his step-father on a sunday evening before dusk (maybe 5:30 - 7pm).  it was not yet dark out, but it was not 100% light still.  objects outside could still be made out though very well. \r\n\r\ni was enjoying some peace and quiet on the car journey by looking out the window and thinking.  looking out the window of the car, i all of a sudden saw a fairly large dark triangular shape flying above the car.  it was either black or dark gray in color (since it was dusk out, i couldn't tell you the exact color other than it was dark -- near black in color).  if i had to guess where we were, we were probably between cannon falls and hampton in minnesota along highway 52, driving south.\r\n\r\nthe craft was flying west southwest (a small angle south of what is the west horizontal line), or at least that direction in relation to the heading we were going on the highway.  since highway 52 is almost always south-north, i can only assume west southwest was the direction it was heading.\r\n\r\nif i had to guess at the altitude of the craft, i would say it was 150-250 feet above us.  it made no noise and i know this because the radio in the car was not on at the time, and nobody was talking.  whatever noise it made was masked by the white noise of the car driving on the highway.  i believe we were traveling at around 65 mph.  the craft was easily noticeable because of its size, how high it was above us, and how it made no noise.\r\n\r\nthe craft was fairly large in size.  i would guess the height (triangle wise -- geometry) was 300 feet and possibly larger.  on each of the vertex of the triangle was a differently colored light.  i remember one was red, another was green, and don't remember about the third and they were blinking slowly.  the craft was seemingly gliding and was going no more than 100 to 150 miles per hour.  i think also, not sure, but if memory serves me correctly the craft could have been very slowly rotating.  after it was over us, i asked \"what was that!?\"  my friend, i believe, was a little scared and brought up something to divert attention away from what just happened.  i am not sure if he saw it or just wanted some peace and quiet and to get home safely.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch the object until it vanished into the horizon and i couldn't make it out anymore (probably 45 to 60 seconds after it was above us).  my feelings were one of awe, because i am an aviation enthusiast and had never seen anything like this before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlet me say this:  i am an aircraft enthusiast (especially civil aviation) and can name the make and model of most aircraft flying 500-1000 feet altitude usually.  i believe in ufos and aliens, however i am very skeptical of 90% of the footage i see because of what i know about aviation.  what i saw this evening though was unlike anything i'd ever seen before.  first of all, i've never heard of an airplane that makes almost no noise.  this was not a b-2 bomber either as a b-2 bomber (1) wouldn't be flying in this area, (2) b-2 bomber's shape is not 100% triangular like this objects was, and (3) this object was much, much larger than a b-2 bomber.  the \"length\" of a b-2 bomber is only 70 feet and again, this objects was probably close to 300 feet.\r\n\r\nalso, the area we were traveling on i know very, very well.  i grew up in rochester, mn and have traveled that road at almost all times of the day probably 200 or more times in my life.  rochester is located around 50 miles south of where we were at the time of the sighting. to say i don't know the area i was in would be an understatement.  first of all, the area where we were had no structures around it.  it was farm land.  not many people live in the area.  there is a small regional airport about 20 miles northwest of where my sighting was (airlake airport in lakeville, mn).  the craft i saw, however, was heading a little south.  even if that is the direction of approach of aircraft into this airport, i have a few problems with it.  (1)  considering the size of this aircraft, there's no way it could have landed on this airport's only runway given this airport runway's length if it was a regular airplane.  (2)  we were 15 miles southeast of this airport and the craft was 150-250 feet high.  i don't know of any planes that would land at a regional airport, 15 miles outside on approach at 150-250 feet in altitude.  (3) i have never seen any aircraft in this area in my life at this altitude.  the only aircraft i ever saw at this altitude was maybe a few years before, it was probably 2000 feet high and easily a small turbo prop such as a cessna.  the only aircraft in the area i ever see are close to coates, mn which is 10 miles north of where we were because of a small regional airport in south st. paul about 5-10 miles north of coates.  however, this is very rare and the only large aircraft i see are north of the south st. paul airport and they are from the minneapolis-st. paul international airport, which is a good 25-30 miles northwest of my sighting.  i know of no military bases in the direction of travel this craft was heading.  the area it was tracing was one of very low population.  the only \"city\" it would have intersected in its direction of travel would have been mankato, mn which is a good 65-75 miles away.  the area is literally farm country and not many towns exist in the area.  any of them which do are very small in size and population.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":21307,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.5167913,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01012010-0018","longitude":-92.897724,"occurred":904613400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Minnesota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1262395069000,"summary":"Black triangle 150-250 feet above me","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":4140,"locationName":"Cannon Falls, Minnesota","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:154563"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2102}
