was out at midnight driving with my ex  who i despise. it was august 1995, a warm night, numerous small fast moving thunderstorms moving through the area. we decided to go driving in the country to see the lightning, i love tornadoes and storms.  we were headed east 2 miles outside of hartney, a mile over from my parents farm.  there was a storm approaching from the north east. it was moving pretty quick so i slowed down to watch it approach and there was some pretty wicked looking lightning.  i slowed the truck to a crawl as the storm went ahead of us and crossed over ahead in the sky. for some reason , i guess i was looking at the lightning, i looked up and over to the right, south, and right in front of this thunderhead there was this object in the sky.  i saw it perfectly.  the color was pewter, grey, it had a middle disc, one on top and one the same size on the bottom. i did not see any doors or windows.  but what i did see were three lights.  i must have watched it for a while because i had time to witness three lights and colors. the object was stationary and on the top portion of the craft a yellow light came on in the centre. it came on first, shone yellowish with the same intensity and went off. then on the centre of the craft in the middle underneath where the other light had come on a second yellowish light came on and went off. then on the bottom centre of the craft a beautiful purplish light came on, it increased in intensity brilliantly, and then went off. the thunderhead at this time had moved over where the craft was and it was gone. i tried to judge in my mind after how big it was and it must have been quite a size. something after i thought of was that when the lightning was flashing around it , the craft did not reflect the lightning.  the retard i was with did see it although he denies it now.  there was no hair up on the arms, no fear, no dramatics but i saw what i saw and i will never forget it. we got out of the truck and walked around and never saw another thing that

the stream in the valley. about 1/2 mile away from the farm. when his son awoke him and told him the sun was falling. his estimates the time the sun was falling until the actual landing of the craft was over 3 hours or even longer. so this craft took along time to land. once it landed his son told his dad...Theirs a ufo outside of his house. the father wakes up...Opens the door and sure anough a huge ship lands in the valley. it was so huge...It blocks out the sun and make the surrounding valley dark. the dad looks up and sees windows and ballonies all over this ship. he tells me...It was huge. tiny lights float down from the craft...Another light comes out of the ship and goes into the ground. alot of more stuff happened too...Like they are trapped in the house..While the ufo is right outside. the event takes forever. he even has time to call to his brothers house and tell him what's happening but nobody believes him. \r\nhe is scared...Along with his kids. the craft stay on the

at approximately 6:05 pm a green spherical object descend at some distance away toward the earth's surface. it was dark out with high overcast, but the visibility was very clear to the cloud cover. the object was observed for about 3-5 seconds. i observed it travel from the top of the passenger-side front windshield to the left on a downward trajectory following a straight line toward the earth's surface at approximately a 30 degree angle. this suggested a generally northerly to a southerly direction of travel. it took the stated short amount of time for it to go behind the tree line. my windows were rolled up during the sighting. there was no sound during its flight and no sound of any crash. nothing was reported on the news about any airplane crash that night or the following day. there is no airport in this general direction. the object appeared perfectly spherical and about the size of a green pea to a chick pea held at arms length. it was not possible to determine the size of the object or the distance to the object, since i had no points of reference. however, it was clearly below and in front of the cloud cover. the object was a luminous green colored sphere with the edges sharply delineated. the object's center appeared slightly less luminous and less green looking. it traveled faster than would an airplane and at a far steeper angle than would an airplane heading toward a landing on the ground. on this same road i have observed many airplanes, usually from my direct left, approaching manchester airport (east of me by 15 miles and behind my direction of travel). this object was totally different than the multiple lights of commercial airplanes. it appeared significantly larger, moved faster and dove steeper than any aircraft. it also looked nothing like a meteor, which can have a greenish color. the meteors i have observed tend to have a 'streaky' appearance as they leave behind a trail of debris and high energy gas and are not perfectly spherical, as this object definitely was. in decades of watching the sky i have never before observed an object i could not identify as an airplane or helicopter or some natural phenomenon. this object definitely fits the unidentified category. it was unlike any kind of aircraft or natural phenomenon i have ever observed.

other (white, red, white, red) in a roll in shape with a red blinking light in the middle or, possibly in the bottom area, when i thought it was likely an airplane, but i heard no sound whatsoever.\r\n\r\nwhat i was looking at, that was gliding so slowly that if it had of been some known aircraft; it would have fallen from the sky, seemed to me to be the rear end of a triangle-shaped ufo i have seen graphics of and some videos of from eyewitnesses.\r\n\r\nthese lights were not bright, did not give off a ���brightness glow��� nor were they hard to look at, yet they were soft in their illumination. \r\n\r\nthe huge object was almost hovering as it was gliding so slowly. i watched it moving towards the due south, and i know where the due south is from my front yard, having a compass watch that i calculate with every season, plus i know my star charts, being a former navy seal and navigator.\r\n\r\nthese four lights were perfectly round and did not blink at all: only the small red light blinked in an odd manner unlike the belly lights found on traditional aircraft that blink in a continuous series as a warning. i know this from having once worked for delta airlines as a fuel service agent. this little red light would blink real fast, and then stop, and then blink real fast a few seconds later, and stop.\r\n\r\ni was very awed, despite my past in witnessing and videotaping such oddities we call ufos, standing out in the 30f odd degree cold night air, as i truly believed that i was seeing the rear end of a triangle shaped ufo gliding southwards, ever so slowly.\r\n\r\nthe area where the large lights were located was a perfectly boxed-in area, or squared off with the lights within.\r\n\r\nnow, i had my camcorder just inside my house on the coffee table, as i had been taking footage of the very rare snow that we had gotten yesterday afternoon, 12/24/2009, for the first time since 1926, as the tv news had related. \r\n\r\nwhen my camcorder came to mind, the object had traveled farther away to the due south, although i thought i could get some footage of it. \r\n\r\ni decided to watch it instead, as if i had of gotten footage by that time of watching it for about four minutes, it would have been seen as simply colored lights that i described above in the cold night air, becoming smaller as it traveled slowly away. i remained very solemn and almost depressed, but soon made notes of the times and placements and contacted the county police and after seven (7) phone numbers; the faa was finally contacted and mailed off a requested report with the drawing. i was promised that radar of the area, day and times, would be checked and i would be notified of the results. i have not contacted the major media until all other possibilities have been ruled out.\r\n\r\nconclusion: this object was too huge and flying too low and silently to have been any known, earthly aircraft! because of the placement of the huge circular lights to the rear of the object; rule out any earthly aircraft. \r\n\r\nthese were not ���fixed winged lights��� that shine out in front of airplanes, as this object was heading away from me to the south, plus the fact of its slow rate of speed and freezing night air; rule out a horizontal hot air balloon of any type based upon little to no wind and the object was moving in such a fixed position that it did not vary even slightly!\r\n\r\ni affirm that the above is true and correct as i have described.\r\nrespectfully,\r\n\r\njason leigh\r\nhttp://jasonleigh.Org ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

drive in bossier city, louisiana. the receipt says i checked out at 6:43pm, so it probably took about 10 minutes to get to the area where we all 3 saw the object. in order to get home, we drive north on airline, turn right (east) onto \"linton\", then right again onto \"parks\". this road, \"parks\", is very winding & runs along the edge of a bayou/large man-made lake, \"cypress lake/black bayou\". we had just gone over the very small bridge on \"parks\" that goes over the water there (you can see this all in detail on mapquest using 5497 airline- zip 71111\" \"as the start & \"220 running deer lane -zip 71006\" as the end, although the road doesn't look near as winding on the arial view because it doesn't show the road blocks that are up now, etc.) at which point the road makes a very sharp turn & is flanked by a tall levy on the left (north) side & a swamp area on the other. in the distance ahead, above the levy, we could see a very bright \"star\" off to the left side of the horizon above the trees. it was very cloudy, with no other stars visible, i noticed. it was very still. i saw it, but said nothing, as my hubby is always on the lookout for ufo's & i do believe they exist, but unlike him, i don't like talking about it with the kids so much, as i think it might be a bit confusing to them. so, i just looked & said nothing, but then my 8-year-old son says, \"hey mom, look at that star over there; isn't it weird?\" \r\n \r\ni said it was pretty bright, at which he asked if i thought it was the north star. i told him i didn't think that it was a star, really. too big & bright. maybe it's a light on the top of an oil derrick or a really tall crane. (i'd never seen either there before, but there's been quite a bit of construction right in that very area were now driving through.) \"an oil derrick, that high???\", he answered, skeptically. \"i bet it's a ufo.\"\r\n\r\n\"oh, god. now his dad's got him all into that stuff too\", i thought. \"well, i don't know about that for sure. we'll see in a minute when we get up here.\"\r\n \r\nok. so all that transpired in about 30 seconds time, maybe, & the bright light was now directly ahead of us, i'd assumed it looked like that because of the sharp curving of the road, not because the light itself moving. it was so smooth & slow & level, it seemed. i was trying to not think of this as a weird situation with my kids! in fact, by now i was so dumbfounded that i only put together certain details that didn't add up to its being anything but a ufo/government craft until after it was over & i had time to think about it. because of the heavy road construction & short detour, the trees blocked it from our view as we passed the dam (clearly visible on the arial-view map) but i could see it as we rounded the bend & it was bright as ever & now on our right side & still up ahead, but it appeared to be much closer at this point, which was about 3600 feet from where we first saw it at the bend in the road. we kept traveling up the road at the same speed of about 45 mph for another 2000 feet or so, & the thing was still there as big & bright as  up in the night sky right ahead of us. so we are all just saying,\"oh my god!!! look! do you see that?!\", to each other, even though, of course, we all do. as i turn around the last very sharp turn on this road, it comes to a stretch of road that is very straight for about 1400 feet before ending in a \"t\" at \"crouch rd,\". (on the arial map, this will appear as a right-angle  some distance after the dam, which then makes another very sharp, almost-right-angle immediately after the first. it was this second turn after which we saw the ufo very closely) right when i made the turn, it was just there plain as day, about 4 stories(?) above the ground, very low. i saw the triangular shape & the flickering lights on the back & said aloud to myself, \"oh, that's just something from barksdale\", as it looked rather like one of those pointy stealth planes. but then i thought, wait- it's not making any sound & it's not moving either! to say that i was tripping out would be an understatement. i neglected to mention that there was another vehicle, i think it was a truck, behind me riding my bumper this whole time, & so as i thought of stopping for a closer look, i also was afraid they'd rear-end me. i knew there was a road coming up on the left, \"cypress village\", that never has any traffic on it, so i planned to do a u-turn & then stop to get a better view.\r\n\r\nit was all happening so fast! as i approached that road, we were almost under it & we could see the huge dark shape of it above with 3 round, bright lights in the middle in a triangle pattern, & with 4 smaller red & white lights in a row along the back end which were lighting up in a certain rapid sequence over & over. i can't recall if they lit up clockwise or counter-clockwise....At the very end before i turned, i had to lean completely up over the steering wheel & look straight up through the windshield to still see it. it was jaw-dropping, scary, yet amazing. i did the fastest u-ee ever on that street & by the time i had done the 180, it was far up into the sky appearing as a plane flying over might look. it was also going back in the direction we'd just come from rather quickly. i grabbed my phone & called my hub, as this would've been his ultimate dream to have experienced, & told him we were now following the craft back in the other direction. we stayed on the phone for the short time that we could still see it, way up ahead, & by the time we rounded the blind-spot detour this second, speedier time, it had vanished.  it was amazing that the phone worked, because that whole area, from that very first curve by the bridge all the way to some good distance up \"crouch\" is usually a dead zone, although there has been a couple of other times where it didn't drop my call. i was glad he got to hear what was happening at least. my son said afterward that he was shaking from fright, & my 5-year-old daughter isn't afraid of anything, so it was really just an adventure to her. :) i was quite shaken & feel as if i must be crazy, although i know & my kids know what we each saw that night. i sat in the car talking to my friend, whom i called right after it was over, & my son went inside the house, & unbeknownst to me, started drawing a pic to show dad what it looked like. (he's actually  rather good artist for his age too!) after i came in a few minutes later, i took dad into the back of the house to tell him all about it, & drew a very simple sketch showing the basic shape & position of the lights on it. shortly after that, my son came in & held up his much-better version of the same thing i'd drawn only minutes before. at this point, i'm still a bit confused about why it did that, & only wonder where it came from - space, or from the nearby barksdale afb. and who was in that truck behind me & where did they go? i didn't notice in the middle of my freakout....I'd like to find them & talk about it; surely they saw it too. also, i'd like to mention that we saw another mysterious light in the sky back in the summer this year. it was in south shreveport, on a piece of property owned by my boss on wallace lake rd. as i said, dear hub's always keeping an eye out, & i've gotten called away from doing dishes or other tasks to check out things that turn out to be planes, satellites, etc. on many occasions in the past. but this night, as we were out stargazing, we saw a bright light in the sky verrrryyyy far away amongst the stars which stopped & started a few times & then just shrank inward from a big bright halo of light to absolutely within maybe a minute's time. very odd, but this recent event tops it all!!! i'll try to send a copy of the sketches soon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":21276,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.6948677,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12312009-0005","longitude":-93.7418454,"occurred":1262141700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1262260538000,"summary":"Triangular ufo flying over lake & countryside in the early evening in nwlouisiana","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Benton, Louisiana","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:154621"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Oak Grove","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i notice the object in the sky it looked like a sun symbol but it flight and hovering.  and then by day break it was gone found the fuel by the highway in the morning.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"07:30:28","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21275,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0050073,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12312009-0004","longitude":-94.1293909,"occurred":1066127700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1262255429000,"summary":"The ufo looked like a sun symbol.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/21275_submitter_file1__fuel.doc001.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2269,"locationName":"Oak Grove, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:154622"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Lake Havasu City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I think the wierdest part of this experience is the moment before noticing the objects which came west-to-east from california. all the stars in the sky started doing small cirles rotating back and forth like the sky was shaking. \r\n\r\nthe objects appeared green from lake havasu city, arizona looking back at lake havasu california. the objects appeared to gain altitude, momentarily conjoin together, and then break apart again flying parallel of each other and directly over the lake and the edge of the northern part of lake havasu city. \r\n\r\nit was a friday night, so we could not have been the only three people to observe them in the night sky. the entire sighting lasted anywhere from 10-30 minutes. \r\n\r\nthe objects were turtle shell shaped and had a green florescent glow about them on approach from california to arizona. they were identical in markings, lights, shape, and large as 3 or 4 747's with no sound coming from them. they both had three rows of three rectangular color-changing lights underneath. in the back was one rectangular white blinking light. \r\n\r\nthe objects had what appeared to be rear exhaust systems, like i said, much similar to looking at a closed turtle shell. the objects were dark in color themselves, with a crude hard outer layer. \r\n\r\nno photographs of the incident were taken because we were all juveniles and not supposed to be out at that time of night unsupervised. we all had strange sensations of being watched at the time, and we all believed we experienced missing time, how much was never determined. \r\n\r\nboth objects continued flying parallel towards the east towards phoenix until out of sight. i have posted this sighting in here before and do not know why i am having to post it again, but have no problem doing so. i have kept contact with one of my friends from that night in lake havasu and he always tells me he has never seen anything like it again, and often forgets that it happened until he hears from me via telephone. \r\n\r\nmyself, since moving back to alaska, i have had countless sightings, some on film and some on video......I will be donating more film and video to mufon soon.
