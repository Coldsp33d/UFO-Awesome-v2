not familiar with the geography of the area.  we were walking on the golf course at the steele hills resort in late afternoon.  the golf course is at the rear of the resort and overlooks a wooded area sloping down a hill to a lake.  on the other side is another hill (mountain?) that is wooded.  i was taking photographs.  a fog began to roll in limiting visibility.  i could see only the outline of the landscape in front of me.  suddenly two large round light balls appeared and hovered over what seemed to me to be the body of water.  i was alarmed.  i began snapping still photographs and then realized i had video capability.  then i changed the setting to video.  the video clips are short; however they are video.  i had an eerie feeling and immediately told my husband that they were ���ufos.���  a man walked up to us and asked if i was videoing ���them.���  i told him i was.  we walked over to the lodge restaurant where we were seated for dinner.  we were seated in front of a large multi-story window that spanned the entire back of the restaurant and gave us an excellent view of the same scene we had been watching.  seated next to us were four ladies who commented that they had been watching the ���ufos.���  i then asked the manager if he had seen it before as they were still plainly visible in the same spot as before.  he said that he never had seen them.  i then took video clips of them.  when the video clips were downloaded to my computer i noted that they were shakey (i was shakey too!).  these were made through the window.  the others were made outside.  one video shows the two balls still hovering and pulsating vibrant colors.  another brief ball of light swiftly appears like a comet rushing directly to them and immediately disappears.  one of these video clips shows an outline of two faint balls directly behind the two bright ones.  the ufos then disappear.  the still photos i made of this event first show one snake-like white light.  the next ones shows two curved narrow white light rods.  i���m definitely no professional photographer and cannot say if the camera and/or me are responsible for the rod appearance and was so agitated i cannot really remember what they looked like.  i continued to have an erie feeling and did not want to be outside the condo.  this event has been on my mind since that evening.  i don���t have the technical expertise to analyze everything and determine if what i saw was ufo���s.  my gut feeling is that they were.\r\n","distance":"Over One

it went behind a cloud and never came out the other side. i did get a picture of the cloud which was not that big. if it was a plane it would be visible after going through the cloud. another thing i noticed was it seem to be slower than an airplane. there was no sound any of the time i spotted it. as far as what i thought it was when i first saw it and each time i saw it was that it had no wings. it was like usaf drone. but as i seen it each time i got dumbfounded as to how low it seemed to be flying low. when i took the pictures when it was right over head. it seemed much closer live then it does on the on the photos. i tried to blow it up and it just makes it a little fuzzy, but you can tell it has no wings. when i saw it the first time it was going in one direction and the third time in

Unknown","city":"Oshawa","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"     my wife and i had taken our dog to a field, known as ritson fields, in the north end of oshawa for a walk. ritson fields is a non lit set of fields consisting of three soccer fields and a baseball diamond. there are also two parking lots. one near the south soccer field and one near the baseball diamond which is also closer to the two more northern soccer fields.\r\n\r\n     as we were finishing our walk with the dog and returning to our vehicle to return home, we lived in the north end of oshawa at the time and have recently moved to courtice, both my wife and i saw an object flying at a very high rate of speed between an opening in two large trees on the north side of the parking lot. the really weird thing is that our dog even sat down and looked directly at the object as well. \r\n\r\n     what made us notice this was just the sheer speed and brightness of the object and at first we thought it was a fire work. the fact that we heard absolutely no sound led us to believe it was not a firework of any kind. also the trajectory of the object made it impossible to be a fire work. someone would have had to have been in the top of the tree to launch it in that direction and we were only approximately 50-70 feet from the trees. there was no one in the trees and again, we heard no sound. we looked at each other and then the dog and he was literally staring up where the object flew over.\r\n\r\n     the strangest aspects of this sighting were the speed of the object, there was no real discernible color to it, it was just very bright, fast and multi-colored. another very strange aspect was the trajectory. i have no military or ballistics experience but the only thing i could equate it to is missile like. not the shape really, the shape was really just like a light with a tail trailing, but the action and trajectory. it was like it was hugging the earth and curving around with the shape of the earth. other than that i really don't know how to explain it? \r\n\r\n     i really can't say how high up it was, but it seemed to me that it would have had to have been within our atmosphere. as i stated earlier, we only saw this object for roughly 3 to 5 seconds and it was between an opening in between the two tallest trees on the north side of the parking lot. we lost site of it after it went behind the tree on the west side of the opening. as i stated earlier, it was headed in what seemed to be an almost due nw direction. it seemed to be traveling in a straight line at an incredible rate of speed. i could not even guess the speed but i have never seen anything travel this fast before.  \r\n\r\n     i can tell you that after my wife and i saw this and looked at the dog, we looked again at each other and she first said to me \"that was a ufo\". to which i replied, \"i know\". funny thing is, if our dog could talk, i'm pretty sure he would have agreed with us. it was strange how he just sat down and looked up, just as we looked up.\r\n\r\n     this is not the only time i believe i have seen a ufo or ufo's. i have had another experience driving home recently but i will complete another sighting report for that tonight.\r\n\r\n     i know that some time has passed since the sighting has occurred, but my wife and i know what we saw and we know it was a real object. i had just never really known where to talk about it or think anyone would take us seriously. \r\n\r\n     i am a believer in ufo's and alien life. it, to me, is impossible for there not to be other life out in our universe or other universes. my wife was not quite the believer that i am, but she is now.\r\n\r\n

time, so i am reporting now.\r\n\r\ni worked as a courier at night in gainesville, so i drove around all night. in the area of ne 15th st between ne 23rd. ave and ne 39th ave, heading north on 15th, near 31st ave: first i saw a meteorite falling toward the earth in the middle of the night. i asked around and i found no one but myself who saw it. i looked in the newspaper the next day and there was no report. it was big and white fiery looking like a shooting star but much closer like it would land in or near the golf course on 39th ave., east of 15th st. i assumed it was a meteorite. i thought it would make a hole when it hit the ground that people would notice.\r\n\r\nsome time later, approximately two or three months later,i saw another shooting star/meteorite in the same location at the same diagonal heading to the earth exactly the same. very strange.\r\n\r\na couple months later, maybe three or four months, in the middle of the summer in 2005, i saw it a third time just the same. it looked white like a meteorite. but i had an experience that i can only describe metaphorically as my brain shifted gears. then i saw it was a cigar shaped object. glowing green like neon, with 4 yellow circles in a row that looked like windows. speeding down towards the earth like it might land in the vicinity of the golf course. maybe it would land farther away, but if so only a couple of miles. \r\n\r\ni am 5'10\" tall. holding my arm fully extended, sizing the object up between my thumb and forefinger, i would have my thumb and finger about 3\" apart. i was driving in the middle of the night north on ne 15th st. all three times i saw it. exactly the same location within a couple of blocks. heading down at a diagonal from high in the sky towards the earth. i saw it come out from behind trees, then disappear behind trees again, as 15th st is lined with tall trees. gainesville regional airport is on ne39th ave about 1 mile east of 15thst. but the object looked like it would land west of the airport, or northwest. it could not have been an airplane, because the object was heading approx. north or nnw. whereas airplanes coming in for a landing head either east or west to land on the runway. also the airport is closed in the middle of the night, unless an arriving flight is very delayed.\r\n\r\ni explain it to myself that the object was a craft, disguised as a shooting star. but since i saw it three times, on the third time, my brain was no longer tricked by the disguise, so i saw the true form and color. i did not hear any sounds any of the three times.\r\n\r\ni wonder what aliens are doing in gainesville. it is a provincial town despite the presence of the university of florida. i wonder why aliens would come to such a boring place when they have the whole world to explore. maybe they want to be near cape canaveral. i was a little afraid i would get in trouble for perceiving the true form, that somehow they would know i could see them, but nothing happened. i am glad they are not interested in me. soon after the third sighting i quit the courier job so i stopped driving around at night. my quitting my courier job had nothing to do with the sightings.

ago.\r\n\r\nin 1990 i was a 21 year old member of the us army xviii airborne corps stationed at ft. bragg, nc. \r\n\r\ni had recently arrived in saudi arabia as part of \"radio platoon\" hhc 426, 35th brigade, xviii airborne corps as an rto.  we were temporarily living in a tent city camp adjusting to the heat before we moved out to the desert a week later.\r\n\r\nwe were up late playing spades when i went outside to use the latrine. it was about 1:00 am. the sky was clear and the stars were bright. i don't recall the location of the moon. i remember how vividly bright the stars were from horizon to horizon due to the lower level of light pollution than i was used to in the states. this is why i often looked at the saudi/iraqi night skies during my deployment. when i stepped out of my tent, i looked at the sky not only to admire the stars but also to survey the impressive array of military craft that could often be seen flying. what i saw was totally unexpected. \r\n\r\ni saw, traveling from north to south, a large black triangle silently and slowly moving across the sky. no lights, just black. i really could only see it because it obscured the starfield behind it. it took approximately three minutes to traverse the sky and move beyond sight. the night was cloudless with no wind.\r\n\r\ni can describe its size this way....\r\n\r\nhold your hands out in front of you with your arms straight. form a triangle with the tips of your thumbs touching and the tips of your pointer fingers touching. hold this finger triangle up over your head and view it against the sky. \r\n\r\ni must have been high because i could make out no detail on the craft.\r\n\r\nit was not a b2 bomber. it was not a stealth fighter. i have not seen anything else like it. my father had been an aviation nut so i was fairly familiar with aircraft in general. \r\n\r\nthe only thing it could potentially be, if it was a terrestrial craft, would be the supposed stealth blimp i've heard of recently. \r\n\r\ni, personally, believe it was way too large to be any blimp. it had an opposing feel/presence. it's flight path was perfectly straight without any of the drift or pitch/yaw you see when observing aircraft in flight.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, i am the only witness that i am aware of. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

were in the truck and had made it about 5 minutes away from the house and was just starting to go around a sharp curve.  there was also a car behind us that must have seen the same thing but i dunno.  i noticed a flash of light out of the corner of my eye and thought it was the light on the large microwave tower that was in center of town about 3 miles away but i realized it was too bright to be that light so i looked in the direction it was coming from and saw a huge sphere of light about maybe half a mile away and about maybe 30 or 40 feet off the ground.  the light was flashing slowly, maybe like off for a second then on for a second.  when the light was on the object stood still and it was very bright, but if i'm remembering correctly it wasn't really emitting light.  like it was very bright when u looked at it but the ground and sky in all directons was not lit up, only the object itself.  when the light was off the object moved closer, but u couldn't see anything at all.  so i'd say the light flashed off and on maybe about ten times or so over about 20 sec each time moving closer to our truck.  the last time the object came on it was right above our truck and then it was gone.  everyone in the car saw the same thing.  i was very scared for a few weeks as were my step-dad and step-brother.\r\n\r\n\r\na few weeks ago a friend of mine who did not know what i had saw told

airplane initially. however, i then noticed that the object stayed pretty stationary for a couple of minutes and flashed very very rapidly. it flashed multiple colors (red, blue, white, green & yellow) faster than a fast strobe light. i then called my wife over to see if it looked odd to her too and to see if she saw the same thing. she confirmed that she did see it and that it was a strange sight. my wife turned away for a second and i then noticed that a small red light appeared next to the larger flashing object. the red light flashed on for between half a second to one second and then it turned off. there was about a duration of 5 to 7 seconds before the red light would flash again. the red light seemed to hover beside the larger flashing object, almost as if it were a craft all its own. after about 2 and half to 3 minutes of being stationary both crafts or light objects began to move slowly toward the north east. the rapid flashing of the larger object remained the same as did the slow red flash with the pause. the objects started at about 45 degrees above the horizon line to the north of tempe, az before heading north east. i eventually lost the objects when a palm tree and obstructed my view and they eventually were so far off in the distance that they were hidden by mountain. this event lasted roughly 4 minutes. typically when i look out my back window i see planes heading south, west or east toward sky harbor airport. this is why i first thought this object was a plane. it's actions and rapid blinking pattern was unlike anything i'd ever seen. i also noticed that the air traffic seemed to be pretty clear during the even but soon after it headed toward the north east air traffic seemed to pick up and was quite heavy. my wife asked if i thought it may be a helicopter but as we both watched it we realized that it certainly was not a helicopter. the red flashing light that appeared next to the quick flashing object wasn't there when i first noticed it. so i'm not sure if it came from the larger object or if it were hovering there without illuminating.

toward the car (rear of pizza place is a parking lot for apartments). i noticed 2 extremely orangish/white objects next to each other in the sky approx. 2 miles to the east. the apartments sit on a hilltop, and you can see very far to the east. the lights were slightly pulsating and brighter than any aircraft or other object i've ever seen in the night sky. i actually saw an aircraft north of the objects and they looked nothing like it. i was looking around the parking lot to grab the attention of others, but there was no one around that would have been able to see them from my vantage point. the buildings would have blocked their view and i wasn't going to yell at the only person i saw all the way across the parking lot.\r\n\r\nat first, the 2 objects were next to each other. then they moved away from each other and moved back together. next, they started making circle maneuvers in the sky as if one was chasing the other. next, one moved above the other one and then it ascended diagonally away from the other one. then, they both stopped maneuvering and hovered in place. \r\n\r\ni ran to my truck and drove up to the top of the parking lot to see if i could catch a peek of them again. by the time i got to the top of the lot, they were moving at a very high rate of speed to the southeast. i then lost track of them because of trees and other buildings.\r\n\r\nthese were definately in no way shape or form an aircraft or flares. there is nothing that i know of that can make perfect circles in the sky like they did. also, the lights slightly pulsated and were about 15 times brighter that any flare i've ever seen. we all know that aircraft landing lights can look bright, but these orangish/white lights were again about 10-15 times brighter than anything that is man made in the sky. they both were about 1/2 the size of a full moon in the sky.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, i did not have a camera with me as it was still in my bag at home as i had just returned from visiting family for the holidays. i do not use drugs and i rarely drink alcohol. i was not under the influence of any intoxicants when i saw what i saw. \r\n\r\nboth of my brothers described a similar event to myself and my parents a few years ago. they saw the same spherical objects (they saw 4) in a very remote area of maine calleds machias bay (near cutler, maine). i wasn't sure what to think, but i am now a believer as what i saw could not be anything that is man made.","distance":"Over One
