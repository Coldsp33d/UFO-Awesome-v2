event began in june 2007 at 9:23 pm. i was living in the city with my mom and was on the computer. a message popped up from my instant messenger with the words, \"agent...[censored]\" and \"blackoperations\", stating that someone would like to add me. i stared at it for a minute and felt amazed. thinking to myself, \"could it be someone 'in the know' who would like to talk to me? what is 'black operations'?\". i eagerly accepted the add request and opened a conversation window. the avatar displayed an emblem of, \"u.S. department of defense\" with a black background. i said, \"hello, agent...[censored]?\" the mysterious person replied and a conversation began. the \"agent\" told me about how i'm \"key\" to an \"event\" in the \"future\" along with a few \"others\". than the agent elaborated a bit about a person from the year 2036 by the name of, \"[censored]\" (not \"john titor\") and that this person was part of a special operations unit with \"c204\" equipment the team uses. the agent first advised me to walk away from this time traveler because, i'd understand when the time comes. later the agent asked if i met the traveler. i have not to this day. being so confused and amazed at the same time, i wanted to ask a lot of questions and was told that is all the agent was able to say. so i knew a little about the titor story and seeked others for information. a few days later after divulging what had happened, to \"titor\" experts, the agent contacted me and said i couldn't be trusted. there was another. i felt i had lost an opportunity to be part of a \"top secret\" time travel agenda because, after running a quick search on the agents name, there appeared to be a real world person. but was i being deceived or cleverly entangled with fact and fiction?\r\n\r\ni do not remember when i had sleep paralysis before or after june. but i do remember that i had to make a promise to myself to remember that what i had seen in my dreams was before finding an article on an alien abduction case from kansas of an artists sketch of proportional similarities. it was a grey entity with deep eyes and a vibrant garment on a dark and desolate landscape. i kept reminding myself that it was important to know that the entity was seen before i found a similar image. that it was somehow a credible description. but after finding the alien abduction story i couldn't read anything more about it because, \"earthfiles\" website had a subscription fee. there's more about these dreams but moving on...\r\n\r\nseveral months later, my mom and i had moved out of the city to my grandparents in a small community due to a bed bug infestation. it was winter. my first ufo sighting appeared january 18th 2008 at around 11:00 pm. i was watching t.V. and a red shimmering light reflected off the walls. i got up to the window and looked to see what it was. about a kilometer away, just across from the road leading into the small community, over the prairie fields, was a large hovering fireball moving north. it was flying low and looked as though it was melting light. i guess it was the way the light of the object moved or appeared... my mom was fortunately with me and witnessed the ufo. i wanted to take a picture of it but i intuitively calculated the insufficient time there was to get a camera. it would be gone. i pondered the idea of running out to it but felt it was not wise, especially for a first ufo sighting. it lasted in my view for a few minutes before dissapearing behind the row of houses.\r\n\r\nsometime around the 18 or 19th one night on my way into the city, white sparks dashed straight down toward the ditch. it evaporated before hitting the ground. now in the city, i looked to my left drivers windows to the intersection a block away and another stream of sparks fell down and evaporated just above the street lights. later on my way out of the city, on a service road by some crop fields, another stream fell within close proximity and view. i signaled the lite traffic to see if others from behind saw it. i don't remember if any cars signaled while passing by... i turned around and went to see if there was any debris or fragments but couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\njune 2008 at around 2:00 am, i was on the computer... an add request popped up in my new email and instant messenger. it was from the mysterious agent. i accepted it and a message soon after popped up, \"your beind watched. i have left my organisation and i just want to warn you to be careful.\". soon after, a white cargo van came by and i could almost see someone in it because, the interior light was on. now shocked and scared, i got away from the window and couldn't move. the van drove around a few times, beaming a bright light at the window. no one was up to see what was happening. i heard a door slam from the van and it eventually left. i awakened my grandparents and they didn't take it seriously.\r\n\r\nfollowing that day, as the days turned into weeks, months, i found myself attached to the night sky because, star-like objects kept coming and going. eventually... one night, a star-like 'spherical' object flew very close to me as it went over from above my grandparents...  at about 50 feet... it was no plane... it was about a meter in diamter. it was a ball of white light... an orb... than it started to illuminate into a bright gold color for awhile and returned to its 'natural' state of a star-like white orb. i felt at peace at the time because it was so quiet and it looked friendly somehow...\r\n\r\ni lost track of time for awhile and fell into depression. it was because of what was happening, continuously... being confused and left without any support or answeres. alone and unable to organize anyone or anything to obtain evidence or eye witnesses. every night these star-like objects would than immedietely \"flash\" as soon as i stepped outside on some random time and night. it was time synchronized... not only were these ufos responding to my presense outside but whenever i look at the time, it comes up with 11:11, 22:22, 3:33, etc...\r\n\r\ni have got videos of digital and high definition recordings of these ufos. \r\n\r\nin 2009 before moving back into the city, i had a very close encounter with a ufo passing over me and it was a blue orb....\r\n\r\nat my new place one night, a star-like ufo came over. these ufos continue to follow and be synchronized with my presense. but until recently, i don't bother to seek them out... they are there.\r\n\r\nit has also come to my attention that the mysterious organization has made contact with neighbors in that small community.\r\n\r\nthe question remains, what were the neighbors told?\r\ndo they know about the ufo activity? the truth of ufo phenomena?\r\n\r\nufo footage available upon request...\r\n\r\nthank you for hearing me out.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet,

tree that is two blocks over.  they were very bright and i never recalled seeing them before.  as i walked on side of my house i kept thinking about what it could be.  i was thinking maybe it is from the local playground, but i realized that the playground is about 3 blocks to the right.  i walked back to the front of my house by the door and kept looking at them.  they were very bright so i was thinking they looked like planets but they were too low in the horizon.  i kept staring at them trying to make them out.  then,  i could tell one was larger than the other.  the larger light started slowly moving up.  at first it was so slow it was like it wasn't moving.  i live near the airport so i was thinking it could be a plane or helicopter but it wasn't moving like one.  it was moving very slowly.  as it started moving closer to me i could see it more clearly coming over the house across the street.  i was totally fixated on it.  it was like a circle with three large lights in the center and an outer edge of a few lights but a tranclucent looking circle edge extended past the lights.  the lights now looked more off white in color.  i did not know what i was seeing.  i noticed the smaller one started to move as well taking the same path as the first one.  i ran inside to get my camera, and my cousin came out of the house with me.  by this time, the large one was gone.  i pointed out the smaller one and he could see it clearly.  it was moving more slowly than the first one.  i tried to turn my camera on but my battery shut it off right away.  i looked around for the large one but could not see but i did notice a red light moving oddly way up in the air.  it was too small to make out.  i am not sure about that one. the second object was now almost directly overhead moving to the west just like the larger one.  my cousin tried to record it with his phone but we could not get the image to record.  it was also shaped like the first but with only a single light in the center.  it was about half the size of the first one.  after it flew overhead, we could no longer see it because is started moving faster. neither object made a sound at all.  i am used to hearing planes and see them on a daily basis.  this was not on the normal flight path and made no noise at all. i know it was not a plane or helicopter.  it was moving like it was traveling more

 no, flares would have tails from their point of launch and these had no tails.  flares would also tend to drop--these didn't--and i would presume their light would last longer than the 5-10 seconds these lights lasted.  we could not come up with an explanation.\r\n\r\nsometimes two lights would appear simultaneously, or almost, and would be relatively close together.  the activity of the lights moved more towards the 12 o'clock position and some remained at the 1 o'clock position and always about two hand-breadths above the horizon.  we saw that there were others who were watching the lights from the isle of palms beach across the access to the inland waterway.  sometimes if two lights appeared, they would do a little \"dance.\"  they would like joggle around a little but not touch each other.  the entire show of lights snapping on and dimming went on for a good 15 minutes.  finally, two lights appeared and then the two split to make four lights and these four did a little dance.  this was at the 11 o'clock position.\r\n\r\nthen, from over my left shoulder, two jets flying close together and high in the night sky, zoomed directly towards the part of the sky where the four dancing lights had just been.  they were too fast to be private jets and it would be unlikely anyway that two private jets would be flying close together.  i speculated at that time that the jets had likely come from the air force base in columbia, sc, about 120 miles to the west, the direction from they were coming.  the light show ceased immediately upon the arrival of the jets.  we hung around for a while to see if the lights would return and they did not.  we did not see the jets come back, either.\r\n\r\nas far as my feelings, it was just kind of a head-scratcher, you know?  i did not feel like anything was trying to communicate with me or anything like that; i was fairly emotion-less, yet interested.  neither of us were spazzing out or freaking out; we were like, \"hmmm.  how about that?\"  naturally, neither of us had a camera.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":21231,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7665233,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12282009-0030","longitude":-79.8288578,"occurred":1061525700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South Carolina","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1262071795000,"summary":"Glowing balls of light","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":2321,"locationName":"Sullivan's Island, South Carolina","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:156370"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Lamar","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am not sure on the exact date or time, it's been a few years since i saw this. i didn't know that mufon existed for me to report the sighting to until i found out tonight.\r\n\r\nmy sighting:\r\n\r\ni'm a 30 year old white male. i work as a network administrator for a plywood company in darlington, sc. \r\n\r\nmy gf had adopted a yellow lab for me as a new-home gift to help celebrate our new home in lamar, sc. i am originally from maine and moved down here about 3.5 years ago.

home and went into her bathroom and called her boyfriend and told him about the event.\r\nthe next day, she saw an object that looked like a white balloon, but knew it wasn't a balloon because of the way it moved in a horse-shoe pattern. the object then turned a silver color. she said she received a telepathic communication that softly said, \"you forgot to tell him about the white light.\" later, she called her boyfriend and asked his if she told him about the white light, and he responded that he didn't think she mentioned anything about a white light.

lake and noticed some very bright amber lights to my left up over a hill that was there, i didn't pay that much attention to it at first because it is a very rural area and i thought it was someone building a camp or something and had some really good lighting.  i remember it was a very cloudy night after a rain with a really low cloud ceiling. i drove about a mile and a half and the lights started to go up in the sky.  needless to say i stopped my car and just watched, there were six lights in a rounded line really bright amber then they started moving all over the place. at first i thought it was one big thing and then i realized it was many things making many shapes in the sky. i then got a cold chill and headed for town because i got scared. i almost headed for home because i thought it was some kind of invasion but then the lights went back into it's original shape and took off for the sky way up high, because until then they were really low to the ground, probably not more than a few hundred feet. i decided to finish my route and looked up one more time to see this whatever it was being chased by some really fast jets. there was no sound.  i listened to the news for a few days after that and i did here one report from a couple down in mexico point new york, which is just a few miles from were i was. some of the other carriers saw it but we never tol anyone else because they all roll there eyes at you. so thats my story there are other things i have seen around that lake but people think im nuts so i keep it to myself.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21220,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.6442352,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12282009-0019","longitude":-76.0860345,"occurred":875602800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

top dead center of the sky in hopes of seeing both meteors from the leonid showers and also watching for satelites passing over [they do that an hr before dawn]\r\n\r\ni saw a very bright meteor pass from s/e to n/w near the top of the sky but at the same time, unrelated to the meteor, i noticed an egg or football shaped object float from north to south. it was metallic and gold colored. i observed the strip casino lights reflecting off the bottom as it moved further south. i estimate it's size to be 3x that of an airliner and flying at about the same height but a faster speed. i watched very intently as i knew when it got to the south part of town there would be no more bright ground lights to illuminate it. there were no lights coming from the object and it was silent.\r\n\r\ni'm guessing it was a secret usaf vehicle being tested from area whatever down to the edwards afb. later on that morning i rememberd seeing a photo posted on the old art bell ufo pages of the \"las vegas ufo\" the poster had an aol address is all i remember. the photo was exactly what i saw but my sighting was of the object traveling not like a football end to end but sideways. the

arizona..Approximately 74 miles outside of prescott arizona..At the base of indian hill..While working on cattle trailer and work truck in maintenance barn...I was called outside by three ranch hands and their families at about 9:00 pm in the evening on july 21st. 1985 -to look at object moving at snails pace over top of main house from the east.\r\nthat was over one hundred yards long triangle shaped with three huge bright blue lights on the bottom...With smaller port hole like lights all the way around object.  the object made no actual noise...And came to standstill right over main ranch house.  the cattle and horses became very quiet..Bunching up in corals and fields..As far from it as they could get.\r\nplus, the herd dogs-whom normally alert by barking-made tracks to hay barn and buried themselves in the huge stack of hay bails.  i went to my home and got my wife and our daughter to see this weird thing...While i gathered my family i retrieved my rifle and pistol..Along with my fellow ranch hands..And their familes...We stood there looking at this thing...My wife took pictures with our camera..While others snaped photo's too!\r\n\r\nthen without exception we found ourselves in our homes..Waking up (what we thought was the next morning)...But, it wasn't...(it was three days later)-our boss (the owner) paid us out tack and wages thinking it one date.  when we went to town...We discovered it was not the day we thought.  as we get paid regurly on a certain date and by approximately from 600.Oo to $800.00 dollars of groceries..All at one time...The local store keeps cash on hand to cash our checks (as by the time we get there the banks are closed.)  having to travel over rough mountain roads to end of pavement (as we refered to it)..About 44 miles over rough wash boarded...Pot holed..Dirt roads..Until you hit asphalt outside of prescott.\r\n\r\nthe store employee's had expected us two days prior..Showed us that days newspaper...(as we just starred at each other in dis-belief)...But, we weren't alone...Walnut creek station has four ranch headquarters located in tiny valley and one forest service fire jump fire-fighter's facility there.  at the base of indian hill surrounded by enscarpment like volcanic mesa's.  the store employee or night manager told us we were part of a stream of people who worked in walnut creek that showed up on the wrong day to buy our monthly stock of food...And the local feed store reported the same strange event.  as dusty ole cowboys and there familes came to buy tack..Cloths..Boots..Shirts...Barb wire...Ect.\r\n\r\nsince then the ranch hands wives moved into town houses..Pernmantly bolting down windows...Placing dead bolts on doors...Even inside bathroom doors..Bedroom doors..Buying pistols..And bigger meaner dogs..(their children affraid..And them..After finding strange marks on the bottom of the kid's backs and by the belly button ..Including themselves..The men strange marks near their knee's.  some of the men's wife's refused ever too return much less spend the night in walnut creek...Ever agin.  \r\n\r\nyou should note: we had rash of cattle mutalations..About same time..Mainly pregnant cows..The calf laying there still in the birthin' sack..But, the mom cut to pieces.  their rear end just gone..Eye's..Tongue..Guts...Just gone.  and hardly any blood.\r\n\r\nwhat was really strange we all seemed to just forget about it..Never discussing it..Until the flap over phoenix..Same kinda' craft..Appeared over prescott..Chino valley..Mayer..Heading northwest toward walnut creek.\r\nsince then they've been seen just about every year..Around the 21st. of july..Rain or shine. oh yeah- the digital camera's did not work -but -the old instamatic's picked up big blur...Shaped like triangle..!\r\n\r\nthat's about it..Perhaps you can explain how we lost that time.","distance":"20 Feet or
