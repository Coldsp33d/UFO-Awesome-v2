couldn't sleep. my son, who was about 11 at the time said \"look at that mom, what is that?\" he told me to look up and we saw a very quiet, no noise at all, triangle shaped object that blotted out the stars. it was really low, i could see the pine tree tops above it when it went over. it was maybe a hundred or two hundred feet above the power lines. the object looked as it was flowing like flag material in the wind. it is hard to describe. it's path was straight ahead. it moved pretty slow about 10 miles an hour. it went right over our house. when i mention this to my son he doesn't like to talk about it. i think it really scared him. it is nice to hear that maybe somebody else has seen this.  i thought maybe it could have been a hang glider when i thought about it later, trying to make sense of what we saw, but who would be crazy enough to hang glide over power lines at 2 in the morning? i don't remember how we lost sight of it. i think it just kept going the direction it was headed. i think we were in shock. i did drw a picture of what we saw that night to remember.  if i find the drawing i will send it to you.","distance":"101-500

were being invaded!  i was outside on a cold winter night and happend to look up to see if i could see a meter or satalite and saw the objects.  the objects looked like a satalite moving thru the sky but with change in direction and speed then suddenly stopping a taking off again.  the light of the craft gets brighter as it accelerates in speed.  the speed is fast (horizon to horizon in 5 sec.). estimated to be at 100 to 300 thousand feet in the air (way above conventional aircraft).  the next thing i noticed is that there were more of them. one following the other in a crooked single line fashion from one end of the horizon to the other.  they traveled a few seconds apart from each other. each doing there oun thing.  some did circles in the sky and some look like they were lost up there.  as years (yes. years!) have gone by i kept seeing them. not saying anything to anybody.   they don't stop there daily routine training.  reason i say training is i believe that is what is going on up there. upon watching these things almost daily (mostly at night) and on holidays and weekends , i noticed several strange things take place.  there is a craft that seems to spit them out one right after another.  like tracers out of a gun.  the have other craft that act like bouys to guide them on course and keep them in a type of airial track. these craft have a beacon flash. any of the craft get lost, they flash a beacon. some nights i see experienced pilots operating them doing fantastic displays of airial stunts circles sig saging direct reversal etc. and then the next night see pilots who have no idea how to run the thing.  formations of several can take place and they move across the sky like the blue angels.  i have tried to capture film footage, but special equipment is needed.  one night i tried to count the craft and stopped and gave up at 128.  i think there are more than that, but if it is a course or track i may have counted them several times over.  the course they travel is beyond the horizon to the east and they come form the north usually.  sometimes they have seperate courses.  my house seems to be at the dividing line between the two courses.  if anyone wants to see these things i live near fort mccoy and camp douglas air force base.  they are an amazing craft.  i would like some closure on this issue.  i don't speculate much but i feel someone is definatly hiding something from the public.  i'm pretty confident we are not being invaded.  at least by what i am seeing.  one more thing.  i have almost perfect eyesight and have had a doctor check my eyes several times over with no  problems and i know that what i see is real and i see the ufo's every single night i look up.  back in 2008 football season i went to see the packers play a lambough field in green bay.  i stayed a hotel about 40 minutes away from the statium and happend to look up and i saw them there too.  to be keen on seeing these crafs is to stare at a constellation for a while (2-3 minutes) so to adjust your eyes to the darkness.  stare at the dark part of the sky an soon you will see them come across the sky, note where they cross a star pattern and within a few seconds another will cross the same path.  if you can see the space station cross the sky with your bare eye you can definatly see these things.  they may be above your sky at night as well.  for all i know, across the whole world.  some sighting i have read and know of sound similar to what i see.  i have never seen these crafts up close.  color is only white.  the craft that spits them out i have only seen a couple of times and it appears to be a orange or red color much like a planet would be.  i sometimes mistake them for a star (especially when they are not moving).","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"12:59:59","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

bright light shinning in the family room from the sliding glass doors. (there are no curtains on this door).\r\nat first i thought i was seeing a full moon, but it seemed to be moving very slowly.  i got up and went over to the door and saw that it was a bright light that was moving very slowly toward my house.  as it got closer i could see blue lights on both sides of the large white light.  the blue lights were several rows of lights, top to bottom, which made a rectangular shape of lights on each side of the big round light.\r\n \r\ni stepped out on the deck as this object passed over my head.  it was very large, flying very slowly and making a very small humming sound.  not the sound you hear from airplanes.  i was spellbound by the blue lights.  i was raised in wichita kansas, which is the air capital, and i have never seen a plane with all blue lights!!!\r\n\r\ni went to the front door and looked at the flying object as it passed over and could see that the body of the object was dark gray in color (or appeared to be)  it also appeared to be triangle in shape with the bright light at the point in front.  the back of the object seemed to indent toward the middle a little.  not exactly boomerang, still with triangle look.\r\n\r\nthe next day i heard on cbs news tv station that several people in the western states had reported seeing a blue light streak across the skies.  they were told that they had seen a comet streaking across the sky. it was also reported in the news that people in new jersey had seen something in the sky, but they were told it was weather balloons.\r\n\r\nthe object was flying towards the atlantic ocean or bay.  i live 30 minutes from the atlantic ocean and 20 minutes from  the bay.\r\n\r\ni saw a similar object 38 years ago at 5:30 pm on my way home from work.  it was shaped the same and made the same low engine noise, but i did not see the blue lights that time.  i saw square lights all around the object in white.  they looked liked square windows.  but it had the same big round light in the front at the point and the body was shaped the same.  this object also moved very slowly.  in the paper the next day it was reported that several people and reported seeing this object to the police department in millville, nj.\r\n\r\ni feel this was a ufo.  i feel the first one was also a ufo. i did not try to take a picture, i was too interested in just looking at the object.  no one believes you anyway, so why try to take a picture.\r\n\r\n\r\ni don't know what weather balloons look like, but i do know this was not a balloon.  i know what i saw!!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21192,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.4939267,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12272009-0016","longitude":-75.0202513,"occurred":1232277540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

the event is unknown.\r\n\r\nduring the 80s and early 90s i was in the british army in an armoured recce, tank regiment. some time in the 80s i know that i was sitting in the troop rest room adjacant to the tank hangar, i wan't alone there were at least 3 other troop members in the room. i was sat in an old armchair, my first recollection is that we had all seen something very, very unusual to say the least. an event had just taken place in the rest room involving other (lets say beings) and that is all i know. we were all still sat around staring at each other in disbeleif when one of the others said 'you know that none of us are going to remember any of this'.\r\n\r\ntold you it is boring and uneventful. all i know is that something happened that day, we were all highly trained professional soldiers and not the sort of people who were inclined to panic or hallucinate, not excitable people. i don't know if any of the others have recollections of what happened or even know if they still remember that something took place, none of us ever mentioned the event again. becuase as i say there was only an extremely vague memory that something actually took place so nothing really to talk about.\r\n\r\ni expect that most people who actually do encounter something suffer from memory loss and so a large percentage of encounters must go unreported as there is nothing to report. i cannot say if this encounter were extraterrestial or paranormal etc... just something extremely out of the ordinary. i just hope that one day i can remember what it was we saw that day, as i am an

going on 6 years now my sighting happened around 10 years ago.Now i want to tell what we saw one night while fishing with my friend and high school buddy bill.At that time we had been residing in fairfield ca.,(less that 3 miles from travis a.F.B.)for around 30 years. i had been fishing these waters since i was a kid. bill and i had been fishing buddy's for about 5 years fishing the montazuma sloughs both days and nights frequently.The boat was bill's and always ran faithfully.One night around 10:00 p.M. we attemped to relocate to another spot but the boat would not start...We thought it was the battery(die-hard out of my 351 bronco) the battery didn't even have one charge for bill's 50 h.P. outboard. i looked up and noticed what seemed to be a aircraft flying at a altitude of about maybe 50 60 thousand feet but really moving. i ask bill what is that as bill and i observed the aircraft bank right at ninety degrees then not 2 seconds into the banking manuver come to a full stop,at the same instance backed up just in time for what appeared to be a shooting star then accelerating into nowhere at the blink of an eye. at this time bill and i heard a thunderous splash very close to the boat, it sounded like a truck hitting the water from a 1,000 feet up. bill attempted to start the boat,it started right away he grabbed his tarus 38 and i grabbed my .45 and we went home. i told my family about and let it go soon after. well about 2 years later i was watching a ufo special on the history channel, and saw my sighting!!! the veiw was was from one of the space shuttles and the person narrating stated that the military had attempted to shoot high altitude rockets(the shooting star that went by when it stopped and backed up).Well i believe that i know where it might have been shot down on public waters. say within 300 yards from where something hit the water at an incredible speed.............. we never saw the second craft,the ufo special showed two(2)craft and two(2) missile,s.We did,nt see any falling objects,but whatever hit the water did so at an incredible speed making it the loudest thing i have ever heard hitting the waters where we were fishing.The waters we were fishing in was between 10-15 feet deep but within 300 yards from where we were fishing the water depth drops off to approx. 324 feet,thats where i beleive the object hit.This area is very

around 2pm and blue sky. i made 4 similar photos within one minute. the camera was a 21 megapixel canon mark iii 1ds digital camera / 17-40mm canon l series professional wide angle zoom lens. all photos were taken at the camera's high resolution setting.\r\n\r\ni do not recall seeing the unusual white cigar or disc shape when making the photos. i may have seen it but did not actually take note of it at that time. i did see the white shape while reviewing the photos later in the day.  \r\n\r\nonly one of the four photos in the series, labeled 206i2322.Jpg, showed the unusual white shape. the photo which included the white shape was taken at 1/250 sec. the white shape was cigar or disc like, distance and size unknown, but was certainly up in the sky beyond the tree line, and oriented at 45 degrees. the other three photos, while varying somewhat in focal length and with smaller framed areas, did not show the same white shape. \r\n\r\nin close examination the upper end of the white shape seems to be more pointed than the lower end. when zooming in to maximum there is a very small circle on the top edge near the upper end which i take to be a spec of dust on the camera's sensor.\r\n\r\nwhen i first began to notice the white shape in the photo, it did not seem to be like any cloud i have ever seen. one of my first thoughts was that it could be a ufo with some kind of invisibility camouflage. it has also occurred to me that the object could have been moving so fast that i could not have seen it but at 1/250 of a second shutter speed my camera could record it.

friend to look up and see the thing. both of us couldn't fathom what it could be. it made no sound, it was just gliding over and went behind us. its shape was more like a hot-dog bun. as it moved toward north-east we kept looking at it and then the light was still visible from back side as well, it seemed the it was one continuous light surrounding it. it went out of sight because of buildings. \r\n\r\ni know it wasn't any blimp or ballon since blimps don't look silvery or have one long continuous lights surrounding it or a ballon which doesn't move steadily. i just didn't know

house was at the time to get my car fixed by a mechanic there in town the next day. i was driving by myself, but the cool thing about this event is that my good friend and witness was directly behind me as to give me a ride back home the next day after dropping my car off to be fixed. it was approximately 11 p.M. and as i was heading east near the lake odessa exit on i-96 i saw a yellowish looking light sitting right in the middle of the highway. at first sight it was approximately 1 mile ahead of my car. it was not an overpowering type of light, but was as mentioned a yellowish type of light. i figured it had to be a helicopter hovering very close or even parked on my side of the highway (i-96 is a two lane highway with a median between east and west bound). as i got closer, this light did not move and i remember saying to myself if i keep my 65 mph pace, i am going to run right into this light! i started to decrease my speed as i was now less than 400 feet from this now becoming a distinguishable object. it proceeded to hover off to the right side of the road at a still very low height. as i was now right below this now visable triangle shaped object, it had a series of blue lights around the triangle shape of the object. the actual size of the object approximately filled the two lane highway by the way. my speed at this time was no more than 45 mph as the object hovered to the right of my car. it continued to head to a line of trees that lined a farmer's field near the highway. there was no noise coming from the object at all. the significance of this story is that my buddy traveling behind me witnessed this whole thing and can attest to this event as well. another neat fact of this event is that the closest car heading west across the median slowed down quite a bit as i assume they were observing this object as well. i am just amazed how close i was to this triangle shaped ufo. it is like it wanted to see how close it could get to my car without having to make me stop from literally running right into it. to make this even more descriptive of how close i was, if i had a rock at the closet distance to this object and would have proceeded to stop and get out of my car, i likely could have bounced it right off it with a full out throw. as i proceeded to drive away i continued to observe where the ufo was headed. it now trailed my car as it also continued to make its climb higher into the night sky. i stopped at the first possible rest area and as i got out of my car to talk to my friend about it. i didn't even have to say a word to him as we approached each other and i could tell he observed the whole event as well. to this day we occasionally mention this event as it was such a surreal thing to have witnessed. of course i wish i had been able to capture a photo or video since the close distance i was to this object was incredible. i would have loved to talk to the car that saw this object as it was heading west. they had to be in awe of not only seeing this take place, but to witness from thier angle of how close i was to this ufo. i have always wanted to document this event, so glad to come across this format.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21182,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.7847564,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12272009-0006","longitude":-85.1383367,"occurred":832662000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1261921441000,"summary":"Traveling
