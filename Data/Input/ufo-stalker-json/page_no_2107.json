looking at me.  i ran home as quickly as i could, and when i turned to see it again, it silently took off over the trees. they moved in a breeze, but i never heard the sound of an engine or anything.

in the sky about the same altitude as the jets do when they make there approach to pontiac oakland airport. i wheeled back around and immediately got out of my car and started to stare at it for about three minutes not beleiving my eyes. there is no doubt in my mind it was a ufo. it was not a ballon or a plane or a helecopter. it did not move up, down or sideways. it remained moitionless for about 3 minutes and then started to go up at a slow rate. i had my camera with me because i always go to the park to photograph wildlife pictures. i snapped off 4 pictures.\r\ni have told a few relitives and others about this and they act if i am nuts. i have the 4 pictures to prove it. the ufo in the pictures appear smaller than what i remember it to look like in size. look at the enclosed pictures but do zoom in on them and see for yourself. i stared at this thing thinking that there probably was some kind of intelligent life onboard and here i am staring at it. after about 6-7 minutes, it gained altitude and got smaller so i went home in a hurry to get these oictures on my computer  to show to people.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

driver, coop was a passenger sitting behind me, and fee was the front seat passenger) when my friend coop tapped me on the shoulder, and said,\" hump what is that ?!\". i looked and i replied, \"man that's just a plane.\" coop again pleaded, \"no, man that's no plane, what is it?\" i looked again, this time slowing down in the car to get a better look. that's when i noticed that it was not a plane at all. i saw an object that had white lights going all the way across the front of it. at this time we all became very excited. we arrived at the 7-11, located on sherwood rd., in baltimore city, and we continued to observe the object, as it was descending towards us. i was so intrigued about this strange object, that i almost ran straight into the 7-11 building itself. i threw the car into park, and we all got out of the car and left the doors opened, because we were so excited. as we exited the car, we had noticed the object had spun around as to fly in another direction, as it did this, the object flew directly over top of us. this object was black(matte)in color, rectangled shaped, no markings on it or any noticeable markings of any kind. it was also very large and had what looked like a door on the bottom, with a bright blue light emminating from it. as the object passed over us, i had noticed that there was no sound of any kind coming from it, and that it had no exhaust or engines in the back of it. we all watched as the object slowly disappeared over several houses in the area. the strange thing about this event is that i don't know why it seemed that we were the only ones to have witnessed this event on this particular night, and the fact that my passenger fee didn't believe in ufos until this strange event had happened to us. to this day i can't get that night out of my mind, because i know in my heart that the object we saw was from another planet. i know it was not a govermental experiment because if the government has been hiding the truth all of these years, they would not subject citizens of this country with aircraft that could create mass hysteria!!","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

a garage and partial basement below, built into the side of a hill.  very secluded and wooded with a pond in the backyard.  there is no way that this could be lights from a vehicle in the neighborhood, because there are none, no neighborhood except maybe 1,000 feet away through the woods there are other houses, but no way to see lights on my back porch umbrella, which is where i saw them.  i was scared  because i knew that it was something unheard of.  it landed like a big clunk on my roof.  i was coming out of the bedroom from putting my pajamas on and it landed directly over my bedroom/kitchen area.  they are next to each other.  i went back in the bedroom and looked out of my bedroom window which faces east and is over the garage.  there was nothing there.  then i went to the kitchen window and looked out.  on my large umbrella, which was on my porch in the back of the house, i saw lights going around so that it made the umbrella appear to be twirling around, and very bright.  i was unsure what was going on until after it was all over.  there was no noise, absolute silence.  i was so scared that i called the police to come out and see if it was still there.  it had to be reasonably small because my house has an antennae on one side and a pipe for the bathroom on the other side.  my house is only 1,100 sq. feet.  the police came out with flashlights and their car lights, and i turned on the porch flood light too, but it was gone, thankfully.  i noticed some days later that all of my gas equipment was empty, a generator, lawnmower, leaf blower and snow blower.  all empty.  also, peculiar as it was, but a 100 foot extension cord and a rope were wrapped very tightly in small loops separately.  the extension cord was in the garage on the floor and the rope was over on the wall in the garage and both had been arranged in small loops.  go figure.  also, the car washers for my prius didn't work.  it appeared to be empty too, but it was over half full when i checked it.  it started working when i checked the fluid level.  go figure that.  later that night i called my friend about 70 miles away and she had another friend over who got a phone call from her son telling her she should see the lights over sand lake.  they were moving at unbelieveable speeds.  sand lake is about 55 miles from me.  this was all in the same night.  i didn't know you guys existed or i would have gotten ahold of you sooner.  then about a month later, the police called me and wanted to know if i would talk to somebody in new york city named daryl pitt about what i had seen.  he is a \"meteor tracker\" and said that meteors were in the area that night.  i waited for his call which came a few minutes later, and i told him this was no meteor, but a ufo.  he agreed with me.","distance":"20 Feet or

the living room; i got up to make a call but all of the phones in the house were not working. we went outside for a cigarette. it was dark outside and overcast. i live in a small suburb community a couple of miles from town, there are not a lot of street lights around here, so the street is not well lit. one strange thing that we noticed was that all of the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. we first saw the object to the right of us. at first the object was an intense neon blue light, bar shaped at first. the object would hover and cruse just below the overcast clouds line circling us, flying slowly and changing altitudes. its movements were smooth quiet and squared. the light would change its shape, having a few different light patterns on the craft. when the craft seemingly noticed us it put on a display of unnatural and impossible maneuvers; moving from a dead stop to unimaginable speeds in an instant, making 90 degree turns at high speed, then coming to a complete stop, all the while moving without a sound. i told my wife to get the camera so we could take a picture. she ran into the house to grab the camera but every time we tried to take a picture the craft would pulse and the battery power would be drained. then we would mess with the camera and it would come back on with battery power but when we tried to take the picture again, the same thing would happen. finally when the craft was at its furthest points away from us we could get a shot of it, three in total. when we captured it, the craft would react. with the first snapshot, the flash failed to flash, and the craft returned and put on a display of its maneuvers, then continued to circle us. the second snapshot again with no flash. the craft came right in front of us, banked its angle and exposed its shape to us. all i could tell was that it was pure black with blue lights. the bar light turned into several individual lights fading off and on. i could see that it was triangle in shape. i couldn���t easily see the shape because the craft was dark and i was too focused on the lights. then the ship would again start to circle us. still when the craft was close to us it would turn our camera off. so my wife handed me the camera to see if i could get it to work when my wife screamed, ���o my god look at that!��� i looked up at the craft; it had a beam of light going to the ground with a red orb returning to the ship. i didn���t get to see the whole event with the orb because i was looking at the camera but my wife witnessed the whole thing. the orb returned to the craft and it began circling again. i gave the camera back to her she got the third picture; the best one. the third time the camera flashed. the craft turned to face us and closed the gap of distance from where it had been, to where we were. it sat just above the neighbor���s house. we were looking at what i believed to be the front of the craft. the craft fired a pulse of light towards us and i could feel a surge travel through my whole body, and my car was popping as if the sheet metal was warping. then the craft began to circle again. we noticed that the phones were now working again and i was able to talk to my parents and franticly tried to explain to them what was happening. i thought we can���t be the only ones to see this so i ran across the street to get the neighbors outside to see this as well. i knew they were home and i could hear them in there. i was franticly knocking on the door and ringing the door bell, but no one would answer. soon enough a car was pulling down the street it was my wife���s mom. we yanked her out of the car to see it. then three minutes after she arrived home, the craft was gone. it disappeared in the overcast clouds. after all of this excitement i noticed that where the craft was flying it had opened a hole in the thick overcast clouds that took a few minutes to fill back in, revealing the night sky above. in total the event lasted about 30 ��� 40 minutes. this has been a very emotional event for me and my wife. we both had bad migraine headache for the next two days and my life has been permanently changed.","distance":"20 Feet or Less,

visibility out to at least 50 miles. it was quite bright outside as a result of the clear skies. out of the corner of my eye, i saw something silver-colored and highly reflective. it looked metallic. it was 4-6 miles out, and somewhere between 1000 and 1500 feet. keep in mind these are estimates. they were made the day after the sighting after reviewing local maps.\r\n\r\nwhat struck me initially was that the shape and reflectiveness made me think \"airplane,\" but the crafts' leisurely low speed bank then brought me to \"helicopter.\" i watched the craft intently for a few seconds, trying to compare what i was seeing to anything else i had ever seen. i noted the absence of wings and helicopter blades. there was also an absence of sound. i feel the lack of sound is an important point because aircraft regularly fly in and around the chehalem valley and are audible inside the house with he windows closed. \r\n\r\ni also noticed that the entire shape of the craft was not immediately discernible. the craft was so reflective that part of the craft was always obscured by glare. i could see however, that the craft had a rounded shape with either end looking roughly similar. the glare/reflectiveness seemed to move across the craft as a sort of slow pulse. the glare sort of looked like an intermittent silver doughnut or ovoid sphere pulsing around the craft. kind of. again i have no basis for comparison.\r\n\r\nafter about 5-6 seconds i looked around the dinner table to see if anyone was looking where i was. no one had looked outside and everyone else was engrossed in conversation. i decided against telling everyone to look out the window because i figured i was just looking at a silver airplane from a weird angle. then i realized the sun was on roughly the opposite side of the craft from the silver glare/reflectiveness. i quickly looked back out the window after no more than 1-2 seconds and the craft was gone. then i had a sinking feeling, like a sense of dread. no aircraft i have ever seen could have moved out of my field of view that quickly. i could simply see too much of the valley for an aircraft to leave my field of view that quickly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21155,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.2781732,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12262009-0016","longitude":-123.010935,"occurred":1261783800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

the cloud formation when i saw something flashing against the large cloud in  the background.\r\n  i watched for about a minute, then told the others who had their backs to it, they turned to observe the object also, i then decided to go to the basement and get my bionaculars with built in camera.\r\n  when i returned i saw that the object had moved to the southwest of us and just to the north of mcconnell afb. which is to our south.\r\nwe were thinking it might have to do with the military, i talked with a confidental source from the base and was told there was no military action they knew takeing place. even with the optical aid i could see no definition to the object it was just smooth and round, i then remembered to photograph it.\r\ni felt that the object must be powered because it was traveling into the wind. at least the wind on the ground was from that direction.\r\nthe object seemed to stay in that spot for about 5min then went up into a cloud formation and dissapeared. we watched until the cloud passed and there was nothing. even useing the bionaculars i could not locate it.\r\n  i told my wife i found that odd because it was about the same time frame in 1958 that my mother father and i saw a similar object just about fifty feet from our house which traveled west then abruptly changed directions went over our house and dissapeard into the distance. that object pulsated with light and was about 75 feet in diameter.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

northeast toward the southwest. i followed it from its emergence at the tree line approximately 8 degrees above the horizon, on this course until it dissappeared in the southwest at the tree line which was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. this was the summer of 1958.\r\n\r\nmy first reaction (probably in miliseconds) was that a missle test had gone awry, and i was seeing a \"loose missle\". but then i waited for the sound of a rocket motor or some kind of propulsion method and there was none. just silence. there was no contrail either. but what really stood out in my mind was the lack of airfoils of any kind or size. i thought it might be an airplane in a slight bank so that i was seeing it wing-on. but then there was no vertical stabilizer or rudder of any kind. during the entire 8 seconds i observed the flight of this craft i noted that it did not seem to be on a crash course with the ground.\r\n\r\ni had earned my wings in the g.O.C. (ground observer corps) and had a manual furnished by the air force which identified by 3-views and sometimes pictures, every known aircraft flying at the time. my station was 12 echo, an enclosed structure on the roof of the high school building in smithtown, long island, new york. we had a direct telephone link to what was then mitchell field at roosevelt, long island near hempstead. i put in 12 to 16 hours per week and we had to identify every sighting of anything in the sky such as location in relation to 12 echo, altitude, direction of flight path, approximate speed, any delay in the speed of reporting, number of motors or propulsion means, date and time, etc. i felt i knew the manual pretty thoroughly. i also knew of our latest missles such as the snark, bomark, nike, and later, the nike zeus, etc. i guess what i'm saying is that i was not a stranger to being critically detailed in knowing what was in the sky at any given time. but i had never seen anything like what i observed on that june afternoon.\r\n\r\nit may be of interest to note that i did not think i had observed a ufo for a number of years after this event. i just had to live with an experience for which i had no explaination.\r\n\r\non long island at the time we had grumman aviation and republic, also sperry gyroscope, and other defense companies, some of which were getting into jet aircraft and we experienced several crashes. as a 1st. lt. in the smithtown squadron of civil air patrol i had been on a number of sarcaps (search and rescue civil air patrol)involving some of these test flight accidents. \r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object as its flight path crossed over the tree line. it was cigar shaped, grey metallic, following a straight course, and was definitely not a meteor. i have never reported this to anyone but friends because i didn't think it would be of interest to anyone. however, recently i have seen some of the t.V. programs related to mufon and i thought i would make the above report to see if it is of any interest to you. anyway, keep up your good work.
