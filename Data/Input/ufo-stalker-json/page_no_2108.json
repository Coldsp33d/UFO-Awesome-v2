(this is why i was so stingy with the contact info above.  sorry.)\r\n\r\neverything i've just described happened within a number of seconds (all these movements, all these thoughts).  my heart was pounding.  what if these are aliens, i thought.  i got anxious and turned off all the lights.  i stumbled out into the dark living room, fumbling for my digital camera i had left in my purse.  i clicked it on and fumbled with my keys (still in my jeans pocked since i hadn't yet gotten out of my clothing) and stepped out, without jacket, onto the back patio.  my heart was pounding.  could i get a picture before they disappeared?  a few had seemed to blink in and out of existence before, as i'd watched from the bedroom window.\r\n\r\ni could see these ships (or whatever they were) flying steadily and slowly southward, while continuing to periodically lackadaisically rearrange themselves amongst their pack.  part hovering and part flying, it looked like.  i heard no sound other than a low hum, but couldn't remember the last time i'd stood on our back patio at night in the dark.  the low hum could be from machinery at the research complex just north of our property.\r\n\r\ni clicked the shutter release button, only to be dismayed that because it was so dark, the shutter stayed open a really, really long time--maybe 12 seconds.  no way without a tripod could i hand-hold the camera still enough to capture what i was seeing.  sure enough, upon reviewing the shot, it looked like just orange squiggles.\r\n\r\ni jacked up the iso/sensitivity to 3200.  but then the shot was, believe it or not, over exposed.  the sky was actually white.  and unfortunately, the shutter was still staying open so long, it was not possible to get a clear shot.\r\n\r\nin shot #1, attached below, please ignore the red and green lights in the right-hand part of the frame.  those are christmas lights from the ronald mcdonald house up at campbell and allen.  the *orange* lights (well, squiggles) are the objects of interest.\r\n\r\nthis is a relatively new camera.  i struggled to remember how to activate the video-taking capability, which i had never activated previously.  i clicked the mode dial all the way to the end and, sure enough, that was where \"video\" is located.  i mashed the shutter release button, hoping that would start recording.  the display was a little ambiguous.  i couldn't tell if i was recording or not.  and then the ships/lights/whatever disappeared.  they didnt' seem to \"fly away\" but rather just vanish.\r\n\r\ni was cold and went back inside. i spent a few minutes flossing my teeth and looked out the window again.  darkness.  and then another wave of the orange lights/ships appeared.  moving again in the same floating/advancing loose formation.  i went back to the living room, got my camera again and tried again with stills and video but it just seemed i wasn't getting anything. (playing both the videos on my computer just now, i see they each last only a few seconds and are just pitch black.  worthless.)\r\n\r\ni tried to tell myself it was just military aircraft and nothing to be excited over, or fearful about.  at this point, having searched the web today with the search string \"tucson ufo sighting 2009\" and seeing nothing any more recent than dec. 1 (which didn't match my orange lights anyhow), i am feeling pretty despondent.  am i the only person (over age five) who noticed anything in the night sky over tucson last night?\r\n\r\nplease e-mail me.  thank you.

driving into barstow from base. shortly after leaving the reservation we were west of and just north of the coyote dry lake bed. i observed a strung out,lazy s formation of seven yellowish/amber orbs along the northwestern edge of the lakebed,runing in an easterly direction which was off to my left. pulling off the right hand side of the road,we both exited the vehicle and started talking to each other about what we were looking at. we were both part of the ntcs alpha company operations group,\"observer controllers\" in that we were used as trainers for the units that rotated thru the ntc,and were expected to be able to acurately report,in detail,actions of the soldiers we observed. as we watched these objects,we went down a mental checklist of \"who,what,where,when,and what are we doing\" standard \"spot report\" proceedures,and a lot of things were unanswerable,such as,if they were producing light as we were seeing,how high were these orbs,as we could not determine any groundlit area under them.The orbs bobbed in position,floating up and down slightly,and seperating in distance between each other only slightly, and the soft curves in the lazy s formation changed little.We both cussed the fact that our binoculars were in the barracks,as we were hard pressed to determine the distance to them,we believed it to be no more than 1/2 mile,as well as we could determine from the terrain along the lakebed that we could see,and were highly frustrated as we couldn't identify what we were seeing.These orbs \"floated & bobbed\" in this position,with no seemingly purpose or direction until the orb in the most easterly direction moved away from the rest about 2-3 orb widths,and faster than i can describe,headed down from the group,towards the ground,and at the same time began to shrink in size until it winked out,at the same time it winked out, the remaining six blinked out completely,gone,zip. sfc grissett said \"lad,i think we'ed best be off now.\" when we returned later that night, i called range control at bycicle lake air field and questioned about any traffic at coyote lake, as that was off the military resevation. when asked about what i had seen,the nco on duty said,\"oh,them, they won't hurt 'cha unless you try and chase 'em and in the dark,lotsa luck\" when i pushed him about the lights, he told me they were flares, hogwash i said. he then asked me if i was military, and when i said i was an sfc with ops grp, he said \"sarge,they are flares and dats the name of that tune\". i was stationed there from '82 until '85 and observed the same orbs in several different locations, in several diferent fromations,and when reported received the same reply \"sarge,leave it alone,they are flares\".I spent over 24 years in combat arms and during tank gunnery, was exposed to hundreds of \"flares\" during night fireing, these were not flares.

on an acreage in northwest iowa, six miles from the nearest town.  at the time we were renovating the second level of our house, and my bedroom was the only room on that floor.\r\nthe encounter: one night, at approximately 2:00a.M. i woke up in a cold sweat, because the sound of someone in my room had woken me. living in the middle of nowhere, my room was usually very dark, but when i liked into the darkness, it was obvious that there was a small red light, blinking at a steady rate, much like a low battery light on a smoke-detector or record light on a handy-cam. the light seemed to hover about four feet off the ground and two to three feet away from my bed. the next distinctive thing i noticed were two thin cylindrical poles, in an a-formation under the light. the cylindrical poles were composed of a highly reflective ���silvery��� metal, much like aluminum. beyond this ���apparatus��� and light, i saw nothing.\r\nfor a moment i was frozen in terror because i thought that someone had broken into our house and was videotaping me. as i lay there, i had this horrible feeling that this had happened before. in a panic, i kicked at the apparatus. my toe made contact with one of the poles. it was hard, cold, and metallic. instantly, the light blinked out, there was a sound, like that of a power-drill, and the two poles snapped together (parallel with each other and perpendicular to the ground) and moved approximately two feet farther from me. it was then that i ran from the room and down the stairs (i used the west stairs, since the apparatus was between me and the rest of the second level) and into my parents��� room (which at the time of the renovation had an open view of the front yard). once downstairs, i heard footsteps going from my room to the master bedroom. there was a loud series of crashes followed by silence. after about thirty seconds, there a bright light flashed across our front yard. the origin of the light seemed be on, or near, our roof. the light moves from above our house and crossed southwest with astonishing speed and vanished. all the while, the ���aircraft��� never made any noise loud enough to be heard from the downstairs.\r\nconvinced that spies had broken into our house to video tape me, i woke my dad, and recounted the story to him. he dismissed the encounter as a nightmare and went back to sleep. the next morning, however, we discovered the east door to my bedroom was open. which was unusual because we kept it closed to keep my room warm, since the rest of that floor was drafty, due to the renovations . we also found the screen to the front window in the master bedroom had been removed, and a shelf of paint had been tipped over. i assumed this to be the source of the loud crashing, but more importantly, evidence that it was more than just a nightmare.\r\nfor years, i kept the encounter to myself and close friends, for fear of ridicule. i honestly believed the encounter to have been someone videotaping. until i watched a show about alien encounters on the discovery channel. now, i don���t know what to think about it. but i am not ruling out extra terrestrial involvement as a possibility.\r\n\r\ninteresting aftermath: since the encounter, i have been prone to sleepwalking. episodes have been as extreme as waking in a field or waking while driving. the most bizarre episode occurred when hypnotized at a school party, senior year. the hypnotist suggested that we were seeing aliens and ufo���s. he then suggested others would deny that the ufo���s were alien. when a friend suggested they were not alien, i became violent and had to be induced to the ���sleep��� state of hypnosis again.","distance":"20 Feet or

any more under its own power. there was no propeller. i could not believe what i was seeing. then again two days later, i was sleeping. i never sleep on my back, but woke up in the middle of the night

at the time. i remember my brother was watching a superman movie so, being bored, i decided to go outside for a while. out to the side of our house we had a swing set. i decided i would sit on it for awhile. i begun to sing to myself. after a few minutes i noticed something in the sky, out of the side of my eye. i turned to see a ship like i've only seen on tv. it was a ufo. \"oh my god,\" i thought. i had always wanted to see one to see if they were real but never in my life did i believe i would. the ship was saucer shape. the best i could describe it is like two plates enclosed on each other and a bowl upside down on them. it had lights (blue, red, and yellow or white) consecutively next to each other all around the edge of the ship, just like seen on tv. aso, like on tv, it had the white light circling around it. however,  i noticed the white light circling the ship was not actually touching the ship it was flying independently directly over the blue, red and white lights. lookingup at it the ship was spinning clock-wise while the white tear drop shape white light flew counter clock-wise. the ship was flying south bound and it seemed as if it was out of clontrol as it wobbled in the sky. it was flying slowly and i really wanted to examine it more, fearing that i would never get to see one again. i don't know why but i begun to mentally will it to slow down or stop and as i did, to my surprise, it did. the ship significantly begun to slow down right away. i don't know how this was flown be it with hand controls, buttons, or verbally at that moment i begun to believe that they are flown using mental control. this would make sence because if it flies as fast as they are suppose to and make the crazy moves they do it would make sense to me they are willed. i feel that by looking at the ship that whomever was flying it was in training. it seemed to me that because the ship seemed like it was out of control and by having me mentally will it to slow down and it did i feel like i was close enough to have a small influence on it that the person flying it. ti be totally honest i feel, knowing there is an air force base near the city we have to have another site with these machines hidden for military training and use. also because in thr same area i saw three different ufo's with other people with me to witness them enough times to be a coincedent. anyway, as the present saucer comtinued south it was headed towards a big tree. i decided as soon as i lose sight of it being behind the tree i would run and grab someone. i did. i pulled my brother out and pointed to the sky at which point he yelled out, \"holy [cms/tg/pd]! a ufo!\" it shot off at that point, south bound.

buddy frank up as i couldnt believe what i was seeing, as im telling frank whats going on 2 of em decide to slowly bank to the right up and out over the river foyle very slowly the cloud cover was kinda low and they just went up over the river and then up thru the clouds and got dimmer as they did so, now they didnt move until i got my phone out talking to frank the 3rd one just sat there as im explaining to frank it decide to do the same thing but in the opposite direction to the left, they had this round cut off teardrop shape and had the color of flame no sound came from these things nothin.\r\nall of em ascended up and over the river going to the opposite side but up thru the clouds and out of sight. i got the distinct impression that as i was watching them they was watching me!

plant. i am a graduate civil engineer and i was employed as an upper level engineer by an international engineering-construction company who had transferred me from the trans alaska pipeline to this nuclear power project in new jersey. i was on the interstate bridge that crossed the mississippi river driving east near sunset on saturday, february 14, 1976, in memphis, tennessee. this was the first time i had seen the mississippi river. as i was taking in the sights, i noticed a large \"structure\" in the distance that was slowly revolving and had slowly pulsing lights, much like a communication tower but it was too broad, it was rotating and it had multi-colored pulsing lights. that caught my eye. i was looking east at the \"structure\" away from the sunset so it was hard to see the mass of the \"structure\". the portion of the \"structure\" i could see was about a thousand feet above the ground. the \"structure\" (defined by a dim outline and the pulsing lights) made a precise vertical rise of an estimated 200-300 hundred feet and then a precise vertical descent of about the same distance. at this point i was straining to see what supported this \"structure\" that was making this precise movement. i could not see any mass or structural support under the portion defined by the dim outline of the \"object's\" mass and the pulsing lights. i realized then this was not a \"structure\" but it was an \"object\" and there was nothing supporting it. it then began an exact horizontal movement to the west for a few hundred feet and then an exact horizontal movement to the east. i decided to get off the interstate and get directly underneath the \"object\" to get a better look at it and to confirm to myself there was no structural support from the ground. as i was exiting the interstate, the \"object\" began an exact horizontal move to the west. the\"object\" moved slowly at first, then accelerated at an astonishing rate of speed toward the west until it disappeared from sight. the sun was still visible in the west. the speed of its departure was so quick that i was still on the exit ramp while watching it disappear in the distance. i heard no sound from its departure nor did i see any evidence of propulsion devices. i later performed a calculation to estimate the average speed at which the \"object\" departed. i estimate that the time it took to travel from a standstill until it disappeared from sight in the west was at least 2 seconds but not more than 4 seconds. the visibility was at least 100 miles and probably more. that means the average speed the \"object\" traveled in this distance was at least 90,000 mph and possibly 180,000 mph. if the visibility was 200 miles, these speeds would be doubled to 180,000 mph minimum and possibly 360,000 mph. the mass of the \"object\" was difficult to see when i was viewing it in the east and it departed so quickly that i only viewed the mass for a few seconds. however, this is what i saw. the \"object\" was disc shaped. i estimate its girth at 300-400 feet. the thickness at the middle of the disc was around 100 feet. i believe the \"object\"; to be circular at its girth as it was slowly rotating without any change in its outline. it had multi-colored slowly pulsing lights (yellow, green, and red) on its girth and elsewhere on the mass. i continued traveling on the interstate for a few more hours and spent the night a couple of hundred miles east of memphis, tennessee. i could not obtain a copy of any of the memphis newspapers to find out if the sighting was reported and published. i have not been back to memphis since then, but i always hoped to be able to return there some day and research the archive newspapers to read about the sighting. with the advent of the internet, i performed a search for ufo sightings on the 2/14/76 date to see if someone else had witnessed and recorded the sighting. the only information i found was about a ufo crash near cubatao river, brazil 2/14/76 recorded by ((a well-known ufo investigator)). at the rate of speed i observed the \"object\" to be capable of traveling, it could very easily have traveled from memphis to brazil in a few minutes. i tried to find out more information about the crash in brazil but to date i have been unsuccessful. i certainly would appreciate a response from anyone who (or knows of anyone who) experienced the memphis, tennessee ufo, or who knows about the brazil ufo crash.
