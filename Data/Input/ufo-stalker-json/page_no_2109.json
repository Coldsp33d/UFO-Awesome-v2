to take it serious, i'm a former private pilot so know most of the lights in the sky, theese lights are not from a normal known aircraft, i don't have video camera, and don't need it, the ufo or what we should call it shows up several times in a week, one night they hang in the skies for more than 3 hours, to me it looks like theese objects are \"talking\" to each other, if you are an expert on ufo's please feel free to contact me on mailadress           torbenfoxy@hotmail.Com      , because i would like to know more about theese light, at my place they allways shows up one and one, in 30 minutes they are making triangles and other shapes in the air, the altitude of theese objects is different, and sometimes they are very close to our property, i live out on the country, and have nearly 100 % free view 360 degrees up in the sky, my wife said i was stupid until she saw the show one evening, theese objects don't make any sound at all, and are changing colors in different speeds

half of an aircraft wing with a small fuel pod on the end. \r\nits flight path was northwest and straight and level. after a few seconds it passed beyond some trees and i attempted to turn on a side

weather was calm and quiet i live in a rural area and could hear and see cars driving a couple miles away. looking off my steps facing southwest i can see schriever afb clearly 15 or so miles away.About halfway between my house and schriever i saw two bright lights moving in unison. they were not very high in the sky and not moving very fast.They headed east and then turned south, staying an equal distance from one another which is what attracted my attention. i found it very strange that even though the distance between them was a mile or so the way they turned in unison seemed strange. as i watched them for maybe two or three minutes while they were headed east i thought, well maybe its common air traffic. there were no blinking lights normally associated with the air craft flying around el paso county. then i realized i heard no noise. i quickly called my wife and son to come look.They did. my son was hanging on the door jam looking when the door swung closed on his fingers. he let out a yell and ran in the house. my wife hot on his tail. that shortened their viewing time to 30 seconds or so. i took a step or two into the house and asked (is he ok) yes they replied. i stepped back out on the steps and saw them turn south. again no noise. on still nights i can hear planes at any altitude. i can even hear the lions in the lion refuge over the hill around three or four miles away roaring. that is an example of how quiet it is out here on the plains. anyway, they were silent. the lights grew closer, they were a mile or two off the ground and a few miles away and began to turn south. the way they turned in unison was unlike any aircraft i have ever seen. living in el paso county i have seen every type of aircraft fly around this area from the flight for life to stealth fighter and bomber. all air craft that low in the county have flashing lights or headlights on at night. these two lights were a constant white. even when they turned south away from me the light was constant. after that they flew out of sight behind my many trees. my son called my daughter on the phone a little while later who was visiting her friend about 6 miles to the south of me. he told her what we had seen and to my amazement she stated she also had been outside and had seen the lights. i have never reported anything like this before. i can barely type and i am a construction worker not a computer person. this took me forever to type with one finger. i feel this was a legitimate sighting and am typing this regardless. during the sighting i felt excited i knew this was my best sighting. after that i debated myself about reporting this. i believe the government monitors these reports and are well aware of ufo activity. i also believe disclosure may not be an option due to the fact murders have been committed in the name of national security in an attempt to silence the truth. for example what happened to the nurse who was the coroners girlfriend at roswell? i believe in ufos easily, i am from the star wars generation. i also am very intrigued by the jonathon reed case and believe his story. i offer my service to anyone interested in the truth about this subject. the ufo phenomenon is real. the crazy people are the ones who deny we live in a vast ocean of life in this universe. thank you mufon for giving the public a forum to discuss things like my sighting.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

looked up at about a 20 degree angle and enountered a bright white light with a red hue in the middle. i told the wife to get the camera and after going through a couple of different rooms she came outside with our sony digital camera. by then the lights were very close and very low and not one light but ten lights. there were six white on top in a horizontal row with four red below and six white on the third row all horizontal and evenly spaced. we could hear a faint mechanical sound as it passed over our heads about 75 to 100 yards above us at a slow rate of speed. i took three pictures as the lights passed but each one showed only two faintly white lights apart from each other in all three photos. i am not very good with a computer or digital cameras so since we had little to no proof we did not tell anyone other than our immediate family and friends. i showed the pictures to the family and they laughed but still believed we saw someting. the other day i was showing the pictures to one of my sons friends and he asked me to brighten the picture and when i did several more lights came into the picture. the immage still is not what we actually witnessed so i have no answer for what is there. the object passed over us from north to south very slowly and very low and the lights were very large with a span of over 300 feet. we could not see the outline of anything

over the city of hamel. there were 3 orbs or spheres pulsating in a triangle formation, the did not move but just sat in the same spot. the orbs were pulsating light, and all 3 were in sequense with the others. after one would brighten the others would do so as well in succesion. they remained in same spot for 3-4 mins from the beginning of me seeing them.. after 3 mins they all dissappeared at the same time. i have seen multiple other stange objects in the skies around my house, and i truely believe this to be a hot spot. total sightings in this area by myself is 7 to 8 different objects, spread over 2 years. have seen most activity in last 3 months.","distance":"Over One

280-80-72 interchange. i was the only vehicle visible in the area when a bright white light filled the cab of my pickup. the next thing i was aware of was  a very bright,focused column of light in my rear view mirror that almost immediately went out. i was also aware that there was a set of tail lights several hundreds of yards ahead of me that were not there the moment before. i have told this to a view friends and was dismissed as being full of it.  i had no ill feelings at the time nor any time since. i only wish to know what happened. i do not believe that we are not alone, i know it for a fact! i have had other unexplainable sightings in my life but never one so close, so apparently intimate.   there is nothing i can add to this, i just want someone who won't think i am nuts to know.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21083,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.4286456,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12212009-0011","longitude":-90.4609648,"occurred":1162800000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1261459646000,"summary":"Drove
