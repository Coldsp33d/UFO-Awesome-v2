work on an island, approximately 14 miles off the r.I. coast, called block island. the house i lived in was on a hill with its front porch facing south. the house, called langdon house, was leased by my employers for we, the hotel and kitchen staff. that evening there were only three of us home out of 13 other housemates. i, on the first floor, and two women on the second floor. at 8:45pm (eastern) i left my room, and to this day i don't know why i felt compelled to do so, grabbed a pair of binoculars and went out and sat on the front porch, facing south. it was mid to late june and still pretty light out. i remember this like i remember my own name. due south was a light, midway from the horizon line, that seemed to be pulsating and changing colors. at first i thought it was a planet or a star, but when i peered through the binoculars the light looked too close, and its colors too distinct. red, blue, green and white. i watched it for some time with binoculars. in fact i thought \"oh my god, this can't be what i think it is,\" when i heard a buzzing or a humming. i, still seated on the front porch, turned to my right and saw an object moving very slowly and seeming to hover at about 100 feet. it was vaguely triangular because it looked hazy, like orange translucence. but it gets even stranger. in the moment that it took to turn my head to the right, the evening light blackened and i could see no stars. just the light in front of me facing south pulsing, changing colors and the object moving round my to my right. right then and there i decided that i was not going to be the only nut witnessing this and ran into the house and up the stairs, where i found two female coworkers and housemates. i blabbered something about lights, my words travelling 80 mph. they followed me outside. when the three of us got back outside, we walked around the right side of the house where there is a driveway and a small side yard. the west side of the house. the island has virtually no street lights. there are no traffic lights. it is 7 miles long and three miles wide. outside it was dark. there were multiple objects, all orange and hazy looking. they were everywhere. hovering, bouncing. i also noticed that there was a light pulsating just like the first light i saw, only due north. the three of us saw at least a dozen odd shapes performing many different feats. during this not one person walked past our house. not one car drove past. not one airplane flew overhead. this was strange because the langdon house is on one of the only main roads on the island. less than a mile, sw, away is the block island airport. the only way on or off the island is air or sea. it was a weekend and its usually a busy airport. the event ended at 9:15pm (eastern) according to my watch that evening and according to a clock radio in the room my companions shared on the second floor. being keyed up by this nerve racking experience, the three of us walked less than a quarter mile down the hill to a local tavern, the yellow kittens. we left the house within fifteen mins if i recall correctly, after the event ended. when we got to the yellow kittens tavern the clock on the wall read 10:45pm. my wrist watch read 9:30pm.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21080,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1735454,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12212009-0008","longitude":-71.5850187,"occurred":740461500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Rhode

aldi's in pekin il, it was around in june 2003 close to the middle of the month, at the end of the field you had to walk through some woods to get to the store, we were talking about random things and then she asked me if flying cars are real. i had told her that they were not, and she proceded to ask me then what was in the sky. what she had pointed to was a a box like shape with several bumps on the bottom, it was dark grey but it reflected light off of it. the top part of this thing was rectangular with sloping sides. i grabbed her and ran to the tractor tires over by the woods and we sat there watching this thing, not move at all! it seemed like we sat there over by the trees for a while and then it raced away, much faster than a normal aircraft, so it went from not moving at all to zooming away. i don't know if anyone can judge how big it was but i can estimate it was about two or three inches across in the sky from where we were standing. there were several people that saw this thing over at the pekin housings, i don't know if any police were called. but i just sat over by the woods when we saw this thing, i was afraid that it was going to come out of the sky. i just

was woken up this morning at approximately 7.30 by a child, and as i turned over in bed i looked out the window  -  there was a bright light coming through it. the window faces west, towards biarritz (about (25 miles away). i realised i was looking at a very bright star, possibly the brightest star i have ever seen.\r\n\r\nthen as i sat up (as i had never seen a star there before) i thought the object consisted of two very bright steady orange lights together. i then assumed it was a plane taking off eastwards (towards me) from biarritz airport (though i have never seen this before either).\r\n\r\nthe lights (or object) rose very slowly, and i assumed that it was indeed a plane, coming towards me after take-off.\r\n\r\nslowly the lights started to move vertically upwards, and as they did so became fainter. within 10 seconds it had covered about 20 degrees of sky. within another 20 seconds it had covered another 30, all the while  growing fainter, indicating that it was moving further away  -  indeed, the lights or object diminished in size rapidly.\r\n\r\nwithin another 10 seconds it was gone in what i assume was cloud, though it was too dark to see if that was the case. there was no rooster tail or trail, and no noise (though the window was closed. there were no flashing lights, or other colours in the object.\r\n\r\ndid someone execute a missile launch in the bay of biscay this morning -  that is almost the only scenario i can see replicating these conditions ?  i am assuming it was a natural phenomena, and apart from a great sense of wonder and curiosity i have no other feelings. my over-riding impression was that this was an object at great speed. as it ascended i had the impression it curved slightly to the left (southwestwards).\r\n\r\ni have never seen a

eve in a friend's living room corner next to a bay window at my right side, when suddenly a beam of light shone through a heavy set of curtains at that window across the adjacent wall, the beam moving from end to end of that wall as though searching for something. at the same moment i could see a glare of light outside the house from where the beam originated, heading toward my backside, meaning the side of the house where the driveway was.\r\ni instantly had the thought of getting up from the chair but before doing so, felt the surrounding room air to be electrified and smelling like burnt electricity, and the hair of my arms and neck were standing out straight, and the room felt extremely cold, but not out of fear.\r\nthe lazy-boy chair started to levitate about a foot off the floor with me still sitting upon it, and it began shaking violently, at which point i jumped off the chair without tilting the recliner arm back to its normal sitting position. i turned to look back at the chair and it still was levitating and bouncing up and down, and then looked at the christmas tree at the left side corner of the living room entrance as its branches were moving up and down in slow motion similar to a bird flapping its wings, and as i walked next to the tree toward the living room entrance, the tree bent itself toward me and some of its branches tried to grab me, or so it seemed, as though by magnetism, so i hurried past it through the entrance and scurried toward the backside of the house hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever may have been outside.\r\nupon entering the rear bedroom, i noticed a circular silver saucer with a transparent dome outside the window hovering silently perhaps two feet above the snow about twenty feet from the house heading toward a ravine at the end of the lot until i lost sight of it perhaps a minute later.\r\nits size and shape was similar to a volkswagen beetle automobile; i did not see any occupant in the dome area but remember thinking that only small beings could fit inside, if there were any within; i also thought at that moment how un-earthly the ship appeared, like out of this world; i also noticed a plume of vapour at the rear end of the craft, but it seemed ethereal or ghost like; i sensed or feared a bit of danger at that point, something alien or un-common in nature, but it was a fleeting emotion.\r\ni would judge its speed at approx. 20 km/hour nearest the window area, and increasing to approx. 60 or 70 km/hour as it headed toward the ravine where i lost sight of it.\r\nten minutes later, there was a phone call from the hospital stating that the son of the people i was visiting had crashed his snowmobile into a road-side mail box; the mailbox ricocheted off the side of his helmet upon impact and hit his girlfriend straight in the face, killing her instantly as she was sitting behind him as a passenger.\r\ni related my sighting to the mother, father and daughters with whom i was a guest that night, but they could not digest my story with the sudden news they had just received concerning their son.\r\ni thought it best to leave the morning after, but my automobile had difficulty cranking which was odd considering it had always started easily in extreme cold.\r\nafter adjusting the distributor cap, i headed back toward sudbury but never made it with that car, as the motor seized half way there, the engine block being red like a tomato.\r\ni ended up taking a bus the rest of the way home.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

see a triangular craft flying overhead it had five huge whitish lights on it. it was traveling in a se direction at a very high rate of speed at a pretty low elevation. i witnessed this event approx 5 seconds before the trees obscured my view.   he recalls that there were also two very small lights, one on each side of the huge 5 round lights. the lights on this craft were a constant/ non-blinking, a pure intense white but not beaming strongly as in lighting up our surroundings or anything - but kind of like a bright white dome light in a car.  it was silent traveling se.  \r\n\r\nthis sighting location was close to dinah shore blvd.  did a follow up the next day by phoning a couple of our local police departments and radio station but no one had heard a word or seen a thing.  during my questioning, i did hear an interesting statement.  i was told by someone that he had only heard of one strange case of lights was the summer before.  an object the size of a 747 hovering had been seen hovering over the tims ford lake.  thought that an interesting tidbit!\r\n\r\njust amazed at what we saw!   we were stunned!  for some reason we did not even try to move after it got out of our sight

the car moreso, and as i was turning to look out the window to see what was going on i then was blinded by the brightest white beam or spot? light! it shown on me so brightly i couldn't focus and had to turn from it. then as i tried to look out window again the light on me seemed to get less intense backing off so i could see it . then after being able to focus, the light source got bigger as if someone had turned a switch on making it brighter (this time not blinding or blaring in my face), then bigger again as if someone had turned a switch a sec time to increase it. it hovered for a couple or so min right above the car i'd say approx 40 ft away: it was so close! it seemed to also be observing what husband was doing in office. then the light went back smaller, then smaller again then blinked out totally (the same way it had became bigger and brighter- it went out -like in sections). couldn't see any form of craft : was a slightly hazy night that night . no sound was heard for it was already noisy at location . when it blinked out i got out of car and tried hard to find it for about a min or so then off in the distance approx a few miles away (though i'm no expert) suddenly out of the darkness it lit up again one time then blinked out again. husband came out after it all had happened with a min or so. told him , family and friends about my experience but this time

it is listed as occuring on 6/15/94, but since that posting, i can definitely say this sighting was not in june.  narrowed the time frame, remembering that it was either right before my dad's or sis's birthday and this is, i believe the actual date - oct. 08, 1994.\r\n  \r\nduring this event, i tried to show no surprise or fear, all the while praying under my breath!  also not stated in the original report at nuforc is that i was listening to a gospel quartet - singing, trying out a little harmony. i can't remember the song but it was along the lines of 'you are not alone'! although i didn't mention this, nor my feelings in that report, all my family and friends can attest to this fact!  i felt like paul on the damascus road...And still to this day am unsure of why i was allowed to have this experience *and others*.   i did feel like it was intelligent. i was about to give up looking for it after it had blinked out on me.  when i finally was looking in the right direction, it pulsated on once lighting up - like saying goodby or something.  it then totally blinked out for good.","distance":"21-100

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Around 1989 i was working at a restaurant in scottsdale, az.  i was speaking with a customer and somehow we were on the subject of life on other planets.  i recall saying something to the effect of \"the odds are that there has to be life on other planets, due to the vast number of planets\".  \r\n \r\nanother customer overheard me say this and said \"do you really believe that\"?  i said \"yes, i do\".  he said \"next time i come in, i am going to show you something\".  he had a serious demeanor as he said this.  i had no idea what to expect.\r\n \r\na few days later he came in and had a brief case with him.  this brief case was totally dedicated to this ufo encounter he had experienced.  he showed me a map of arizona, where he had outlined the area that he had encountered a ufo in.  it was the roosevelt lake area, north of phoenix.  \r\n \r\nhe then pulled out a polaroid photo he had taken.  i stared at that photo for 20 minutes.  it is the most realistic photo of a ufo i have ever seen.  and it was very close up.  \r\n \r\nthe photo was taken from about 50 ft. away.  it was taken at night and the only light source was from the ufo itself!  it was so apparent that i didn't even ask if he had used a flash.  i was obvious he had not, so i just said, unassumingly, \"why didn't you use a flash\"?  his eyes got huge, and he said \"are you kidding!  they would have seen me\".\r\n \r\nthe reason you could tell the light was emanating from the craft was because the foliage to the left on the image was illuminated from behind.  the foliage was in front of the craft, from the vantage point of the camera.  the leaves were black, not green, as would be expected if the light source were from the camera.  you could see only the outline of the foliage, not detail, as one would see from a camera flash.\r\n \r\nthe craft was the classic disc-shaped kind.  it was gray and metallic looking.  the lower portion of the craft was concealed, due to a cliff overhang that it was hovering behind.  i would gauge the craft to be about 60 ft. from side to side.  the craft was about 50-60 ft. away from the camera-taker.\r\n \r\nthe most fascinating part on the craft was the light on it.  there was an orb, about the size of a basketball, that was circling the middle, most wide part of the craft.  the orb was pure white in color, with not a tinge of yellow or blue.  the reason you could tell the orb was circling the craft was due to the fact that the camera had captured a tail trailing the orb, as would a tail on a comet.  \r\n \r\nso i tell they guy, after freaking out on the amazing authenticity of his photo, that he has to show this to someone.  he said \"i plan to.  there is a professor/ufologist at asu that is interested in this\".  \r\n \r\nso i see the guy several days later and he said he had taken the photo to the asu (arizona state university) guy.  he said the asu professor also said it was the best ufo photo he had ever seen.  \r\n \r\ni see the guy several days later, again, and ask him what the asu professor guy is doing with the photo and such.  he starts acting really weird.  he wouldn't answer me.  i asked him again.  his demeanor was that he was pissed off.  he said to me \"i'm not allowed to talk about it\".  i said \"what?  what do you mean?\"  he said \"i'm not allowed to talk about it\".  he is really agitated.  i can't resist, so i said \"oh come on\".  he said \"i'm not allowed to talk about it.  two men from the government showed up at my door and said i am not allowed to mention this again, or i will diappear.  they took the photo from the asu professor and threatened him as well\".  \r\n \r\nsince then i have read much info on ufo phenomena.  interestingly, much of what i have read about mib, is that they appear at someone's door, as a pair of two men, to threaten the experiencer.  \r\n \r\nmind you, his experience was long before mib, the movie, came out, and mib became part of general consciousness.  i had never heard of mib at this point.  the internet had not taken off yet, so he didn't research the mib phenomena to add credence to his story.  he didn't need to anyway, with that photo!\r\n \r\nit now makes sense to me that these government guys take only the good photos, and leave the junk out there.  thus when the genereal public views the photos, they assume the whole phenomena is people's imaginations, or pranks.  they purposely allow the crappy photos to prevail.  \r\n \r\nif anyone knows who the asu professor may have been, could you please contact a mufon representative. i cannot imagine there were many asu professors/ufologists at the time.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21068,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4577571,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12202009-0007","longitude":-112.0706673,"occurred":571986000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1261354905000,"summary":"Two

print was found and a scan made 12/5/09. my father never mentioned seeing the object but when we returned to the states in 1959, i remember him being a friend of roger early who was somehow connected with project blue book. i believe the neg may have been given to early. i do know that from living in torremolinos, kids back then did not play with kites, model planes or paper planes. all the kids on the beach were poor fishermen's kids. my father used a nikon rangefinder camera, plus-x film and was shooting the fishing boat to use as a subject in one of his paintings. he was a famous painter (google: ben stahl). the exposure seems to be f8 or 16 @ 1/250 or 1/125 because of the frozen action of the waves in the photograph and the depth of field. it's not a blur of a bird, tear on the neg or delamination on the print. the print has a fold (visable on the picture across the horrizon). the surface of the original print is clean. i used \"unsharp mask\" in photoshop to bring the scan in better focus. this produced marking on the body of the object. note the shadows on the object are consistant with shadows on the man behind the boat. the man is shielding his eyes and looking at something down the beach, in the sky or out at sea and not at the object overhead. perhaps there were two objects? the object in the photogeaph has an odd perspective as it looks far away yet close over the shore line. also, note the disturbance in the air at both ends of the object. it also cannot be something on the lens as this would be totally blown out of focus. i've searched other photographs and have failed to see any other object with the same shape. bruce maccabee saw the image and could not come up with an answer as to what it could be. nothing in a camera, especially a slr, can produce such an effect. if something was thrown in front of the camera it would not have produced the \"air disturbance\" as shown - these are not developing streaks either. please let me

sleep. ten minutes later i woke up again and felt uneasy. i turned my t.V. on and went to the bathroom, fixed a glass of tea and sat on the couch for about 5 minutes. i don't know why, but i felt like i should just go back to bed. i turned everything off and got back under the covers, this was around 2:40. i woke up again and noticed that the apartment i live in with my grandmother was unusually bright inside. i also noticed that there was bright white light with a vertical black shadow in the middle like a light pole or a telephone pole coming in through my window. it was so bright that it cast a while silouhette if you will on the wall across from it. i thought that mabye it was just someone with some really bright headlights in the apartment parking lot. i tried to ignore it and go back to sleep. i got back in bed and i couldnt get back to sleep because of that light, so i kinda got creeped out and pulled the blanket over my head like a scared little kid, granted i'm 23. that light wouldn't go out and i couldn't hear any kind of engine hum from anything in the parking lot. i finally calmed down enough to doze off when the blanket started to be pulled off of me from behind. not as if someone was at my feet pulling, but rather behind my head and pulling. i thought it was my grandma and wondered why she just didn't pull the blanket off of my like a normal person would do, so i reached up and grabbed the blanket, and whatever it was that was pulling was tugging back. i became terrified and started screaming for my grandma. i was so scared but i couldn't get the words out. then, as i'm freaking out under my blanket, a small skinny grey arm, with a small skinny hand with really long fingers reached under and got a vice-grip on my wrist. i then blacked out. the skin wasn't grey like the sterotype \"grey\", but it was very dark greyish brown, mabye close to black. i don't know, i was too busy freaking out. i never saw a face or body or anything that night, just the arm/hand and a black out. finally when i woke up, i woke up in my bed. there was still a ton of light flooding the apartment. my grandma comes out of the bathroom and i got really mad and was saying \"mom didn't you hear me yelling?\" and she asked \"why? were you looking at the window?\". that question struck me as kinda odd. i was exhausted. i felt like i had just run a mile and was feeling kinda sick to my stomach. i finally managed to go back to sleep. my grandma was going to san antonio for a week the next day and i was home alone right after this event and i could not sleep. every light in the apartment was on and every door was wide open, i would even make sure the shower curtain was pulled back as far as possible. i still could not stay asleep. over the next few months and even this month i randomly wake up at 2:30 on the dot. this is the second time this year something like this happend. the first time was when i went to st. louis.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":21063,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6742867,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12202009-0002","longitude":-94.1313054,"occurred":1245490200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1261299351000,"summary":"Waking

looked up to observe the sky, not expecting to see antything. but i saw something up there. i couldn't exactly tell, but at the time i'd thought it was long, but as it slowly crept forth i realized it was more like a circle. my first thought was that it was a blimp, only no blimps ever glide over our small town- never. i stood and looked for a few minutes, and it stayed put almost the whole time. when it moved slowly i called my mother out of the car, and we called my grandmother. we saw several, 4+, strange lights in the sky. we stood there watching them for a while, and once they started to move more quickly we decided to follow them in our car. the whole time, both when we were outside and in the car, my heart was beating out of my chest, and i felt unsafe. for a while we followed just one, but then i noticed three, then four, then five. i can't remember how many, exactly, that i saw, but we were looking at different ones, all of them either speeding extremely fast or hovering in one spot. soon we reached thick woods, and some slipped out of sight. we drove around slowly for a while trying to relocate the brightest one. we finally found it again, only this time it turned around, and it headed straight back towrads our house. we followed it, then it went over some other roads, and dispaeered behind trees again. we saw another one fade into view, and we followed it for a while. as we came to a fork in the road, it moved beyond our reach. we watched it go for a while, its lights still visible farther away than would be an airplane's. it zig-zagged and did twists for while then slipped behind some cloud cover. moving onto the by-pass i finally saw the biggest one again. it was headed out beind us somewhere. i followed it all the way into town with my eyes until we hit the street lights, and i couldn't see it anymore. when we arrived at my grandmother's house, i couldn't even walk straight for my excitement and a bit of shock. all the while i couldn't believe that my routine gaze into the sky had brought on such excitement. my mind raced. all of a sudden it felt as if i was wrong. like my sureness and certainty had all been naive. but, i remebered how i felt and what i'd seen at the time of my sighting, and that somewhat kept me believing my own eyes. although this had not been my first sighting, it felt like seeing it for the first time as it seems, every time afterwards, that i was totally mistaken.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21052,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.9255748,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12182009-0014","longitude":-93.2806258,"occurred":1261193400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,
