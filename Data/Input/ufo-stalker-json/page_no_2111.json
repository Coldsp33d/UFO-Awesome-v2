wasnt. my house is only a few blocks  from there and my freind pulled off the main road. so i asked him if he would get back on the main road. we got stuck at a light for a while and i thought it would be gone. but as soon as we got back on the main road he saw it as well. it was two glowing balls of light. we drove more to the south and saw two huge glowing balls of light to the east between

right in front of us. i jumped out of the car to try and video it but as soon as we got there  it was two balls again.Then a dim third light illuminated on the front and it formed a triangle and

at the time also, so this sighting did not get my fullest attention sorry to say because this was extraordinary! i'm always looking up and on that day, i happened to see the most unusual and hard to describe object! it was white with a few appendages - at first. i thought it was very strange and told my friend about it and then had to check to see that the cat wasn't escaping over the fence. i was trying to convince who i was speaking to of what i was seeing, and after seeing the cat was ok i looked back up at the object. it had been and was hovering in the same ne position. what i saw next was that the things shape had changed and was changing. i then noticed that two other smaller orbs were either coming out of this thing or were coming from behind it because i had not noticed them before. i focused in on the biggest of the 2 smaller orbs once they came into view. this orb seemed to kind of change energy fields(?) because of its appearance like a forcefield around it, then rotated clockwise 3 times and in an instant darted downward angling to the left at a remarkable speed and then stopped (between but lower below the other two objects) and they all stayed in their relative positions. it was almost as if it knew it had my undivided attention! two more times this happened- the smaller objects darted in different directions/angles. i was excitedly on the phone giving this account to my friend but couldn't convince them of my not having a rational explanation of this event. at that time i decided to get my son from inside the house so he could witness this. i put my head in the door to yell to him then turned around but they were gone! i did some research on this and the closest thing resembling this sighting is the \"strange morphing ufo\" in mexico that is on youtube with the exception that my object was cloud -white color, and the orbs in my sighting were making some incredible maneuvers. please feel free to contact me if any questions. ps i also saw a fast moving orb near a commercial airliner an hour or two before this. time and date are approx. it was either oct 15 or the 16, 2009 between 14-16:00. thank you \r\n\r\nps the previous is an exact copy of what i reported to nuforc. \r\ni have to add that the mexico morphing object would seem like a hoax to me if i had not seen the same type thing !!(although i didn't notice any symbols).  also, i had left out of the report, when i noticed the orb rotating clockwise 3x, that i did glance away thinking it was my eyes and i turned back to it. this is when it shot down i'd say at an / angle and stop on a dime, which made me know it was not my eyes.  \r\n\r\nas far as my feelings go, this is not the first time i've experienced ufo's although it is the first for this type!  i was distracted (w/phone and cat) but i still felt in awe, wth etc. and made light of the situation but now i'm scared and curious.  also i add that the cat was on the fence trying to escape.  when i saw him he looked scared, and i was telling my friend i had to put my cat in before he was abducted and tried to make light of the situation and then said \"i'm just teasing -just teasing\". that's when the realization set in on me... i started to get scared even though it was day that thing was right up there 'looking at me' lol.  i put the cat inside, stayed close to the door, hollered at my son to try to get him , then turned around it was gone!   have been really freaked out lately and i wanna know wth, ya know?!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

changed course, i told my husband to come see without taking my eyes off of it and he said \"well, that is weird never seen anything like that before\" and as it moved in it's one direction we watched and it went a distance and disappeared into the atmosphere as though a door opened in the air that was not visible and the star like ship went inside and was gone.  this is the fourth star like ufo that i have sighted in one year.  i was not afraid at all, was very peaceful and when i have mentioned it to others they seem to not want to hear about it again.  i am sorry that i have not photo's but my memory serves me well.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21038,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.3829321,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12172009-0012","longitude":-119.0117425,"occurred":1256281200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1261114932000,"summary":"Golden,

happened one night at ftcky.\r\nthe 101 airborne.Div..Had a division exercise and about 28,000 participated. we received a radio call from division hq that we are halting the exercise and observe the sky for unusual objects. we have been notified that the object is unidentifiable. we were asked to mark our watches and monitor time loss. after the event we should examine our selves for puncture wounds in the nape of our necks and behind the ear lobes. not long after that about 1 minute a large object appeared in the sky  i could not see it at first. it appeared like all the other other stars.\r\nthe radio operator whom i will not reveal his name from long island ny. and the company commander a capt. who was my age 24 years old at the time, whom i will not reveal his name pointed out the object. it grew bigger and bigger and appeared to be approximately 2000 ft. up. one object turned into 4 maybe 5 smaller objects. they were discs and they came from the larger object. now i can't figure out if the larger object was a cylinder or a larger disc because of the angle and postion it was in. the smaller disc as i recall glowed green on one side and orange on the other.  they flew faster than any earth bound vehicle and could stop on a dime, a very sudden stop no coasting. these discs wanted to be seen obviously with bright colors and it appeared that the were flying in a pattern to triangulate the entire div. and then they stopped and spread quickly to various points. one of the silver discs stopped maybe 150 meters away from my company. i immediately asked the company commander, i volunteer to go forward and make contact. i will be peaceful and show no hostility. he said doc i need to get that cleared. he radioed division .Hq and they said proceed with caution make note of any markings and observe for any life forms inside.\r\nthe company commander  told me doc you don't have to do this. i said sir i have to do this we have an opportunity to meet someone from another world. i ran forward hoping this object would not leave before i could make contact.  i stood before this disc that appeared to be silver now not showing what  i will term its battle colors green and orange.\r\ni carried a 45 calb. pistol as i was a senior combat medic rank e5.  i was also wearing my battle dress to include the laser tag equipment used in training.\r\ni approached the first time and waved with my hand and held the position waving as the satellite with the man and the woman on it (voyager). i felt maybe some other life forms  had seen us from that satellite.\r\ni could not see any movement and thought maybe it's my gear. i ran back and dropped my gear at the capstan's. feet and told him to keep my 45 pistol i might be gone a long time and  tell my parent i love them if this happens. he said doc  you need to stay here , i don't feel good about this. i said sir if i make contact \r\ndo you want to approach me or do i bring them to you or do you send one of your lieutenants out. he paused as if he did not want to respond. then he said we will cross that bridge when it happens.\r\ni then jogged eagerly back to the silver disc and with 2 canteens in hand, some c rations in my pocket i offered food and drink to this flying disc.\r\nno response. i had no weapons on me. i was nearly defenseless and i recall while running out there the second time i new i was not going to get any help from the 90 or so men who were now in my background a 150 meters away from me.  it was me, against this disc. i also knew they would probably leave the others alone. my job as a combat medic was to protect the men on health issues and protect wounded from the enemy. i was 12 inches away from this disc. it was silver like flexible foil. it was quiet never made a sound and hovered about 5' (ft) from the ground . i stood 5'11 inches   186 pounds in those days. i was literally nose to nose with this disc.  i saw it to be flat on the bottom and contoured to the top with a small dome on top. \r\nno markings of any kind . i think i remember portals on the dome on top of the ship. i saw no one  i walked 3/4s around this ship.\r\nno contact. i looked onward to my company who seemed very far away at this point.\r\nthen i became extremely concerned in my sprit. what use to be courage almost  became fear and a warning, almost as if some one was talking to me.\r\ni was being told to leave quickly that this was not normal and i was in harms way. it was as if my sprit warned me perhaps god warned me, or may be something in the disc warned me. i then walked quickly around and then faced the front position that i started in  at the disc and  waved one more time. no response and then with some fear about me i jogged in a zigzag  pattern back to my company.\r\ni did not want the occupants on board to think i was scared or let them think they had advantage over me. i could feel a presence and i sent a i am not scared presence back.  it was for lesser words animal instinct being used by both parties in my opinion.\r\n  after i got back i said to the captain, i tried but they do not want to communicate and quite frankly i am scared sir. the company commander said to me you are not alone doc look around you. every man around us was praying to god. i knelt with one knee to the ground near the men\r\nfacing as bold as i could and prayed  'god make this thing  go away, this disc is not of good nature, protect us. not more than 5 seconds latter this disc moved back as i left it , dipped down moved like a  zig zag and straight out and up to the larger ship it went.\r\nall the other discs left at the same time.  \r\n   \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            we were debriefed by i believe by an air force capt. who said he was with information / foreign technology. he asked me if i saw any markings chin se or russian. i said no none. he asked me if it made sound, i said none, did i see anybody , no i saw no one.  \r\nhe said we saw a bonified  ufo and the discs were not of earthly origin.  he also told us that one of the discs halted an air force  c130 aircraft when it was taking off 2 feet from the ground at ftcky air strip. it drained the aircraft of energy and set it on the ground.  he also  said   \r\nthe gov. wanted to reopen project blue book because of the event. he then said he had no more time for us as he had to interview another  company that had an experience that night. i asked what happened and he replied to all of us that is not up for discussion here.  \r\ni asked the air force debrief if we could talk about this. he said we could to anyone for the rest of our lives. he said the us gov. was real interested in this event.\r\n  \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n \r\n      now, two weeks latter we were in the field training and one of the sergeants showed me with night vision goggles, \r\nyou could see for miles when the laser tag mechanism was fired. i said that's why they came down. they thought we had laser guns. \r\nits a good  thing i took off all my equipment. then the sergeant turned to me and said doc i heard a rumor that 3 men in another company were taken off of the ground and sent back striped of gear and clothing. 2 were dead and one got committed to the hospital crazy bin.\r\nhe also said i was either crazy or the bravest medic he had ever seen. \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

the window i saw something flying slow towards me. in my mind im like what in the world and i was thinking ok no this cant be happening right now. i asked my dad what is that? he said oh its nothing its just a blimp and i told him no its not. it was coming from north of us right when my dad stoped at the stop sign it stoped. my dad and i were frozed and amaze at what we are seeing. while we were looking at it. it was round and flat and it remind me of this ride that i really love called gravitron that had red lights all around it and they were not blinking or anything it didnt even make a sound. while we were still looking at it and in my mind im thinking i dont believe what im seeing there is no way that this thing that im seeing is a ufo no way! as we are still looking at and im thinking those thoughts in my mind it started to tilt towards us and i thought it wanted to land or something. i kinda wanted to go out and look at it but i was to amaze by it. i also didnt think about taking a picture of it i was thinking that it might not have shown in the picture if i did or it might have took off. my dad started to leave and he asked me to look back and see if i could still see it and i told him i could he asked me what is it doing now and i told him it is still tilting. we were the only ones out there and we were not post to be out there at that time it was past curfew of the hurricane. when we were on are way back we saw a cop and he didnt do nothing just shine is flash light at us. for about three nights my dad would wait outside to see if he would see it again. i thought my dad was crazy for doing that and i didnt want to tell anyone because i knew people wouldnt believe me. the only person i told was my best friend ashley she said thats what i get for not believeing in ufo's and the other person i told was my teacher. she probably thought i was crazy.

and i see a white figure in my neighbor's yard. i figure it must be a light, and i try to fall asleep again. it does't work. i think about what it could be, and i sumrised an extra terrestrial. for 30 minutes i was scared like hell to even get up, so i checked my cell phone which was on the table next to me to check the time. it was exactly 6:02. the event has gone from about 5:30 to now, for i currently see the objects while writing the report. i sit up, and i see the figures closer now, so i can make out what they are. bodies. paper white bodies in the distance. i stare at the figures longer. i see the figures blink their \"heads\" on and off, with no particular pattern, as if speaking to one another. then i see a third one come in. the order of the objects in the window is this fom me: orange figure far left, short figure middle, a slightly bigger figure to the far right. this orange figure is about twice the size of the other two, and is orange. i heard a great roam from the sky, like the cry of a low wailing engine. i figure it could be their vessel's engine, but i cannot see any crafts. i get up a little bit later to look out the window. i saw them oh so clearly. i saw bodies, two arms, two legs, heads, and on one of them i saw a seperate light coming from the one on the far right. it is square. it seems like a map. they blink their \"heads\" once again as if in conversation, and i turn on my computer to write this report. i am but 15, so i am scared shitless, shaking more than i ever have in my entire life, pardon my french. i talk to my friend and she says she wishes to see the figures as well, while i do have a webcam, it is too late. i look out one last time, and they vanish. i heard another engine sound, loud and clear, and then nothing. only the

traveling from southern california to the pacific northwest a week or two ago.  so i did my share to looking up because if you keep looking, you will see something.\r\n\r\noutside of my patio i shared with my friends, i was the only one standing outside in the dark i first noticed the ufo as a flashlight darting across the night sky.  i didn't know what i just saw at the time.  i thought it some f-18 or f-14 'cuz due west is san diego and pacific navy fleet or maybe aurora.  right in front at the high school(my apartments were right next to it) it appeared.  but i did remember the flash(ufo) folded something before me.  as if space/time folded!  it was a ufo!\r\n\r\ngigantic triangle with two lights in front above one other.  one white light and the other light green(i think). it was very quiet!  no sound, no one else but me outside too!  i wanted to tell my friends right away but i didn't want to miss out on what was happening here. \r\n\r\nslowly, it drifted due east from the el cajon h.S. and over the other rows of apartments (headed to ufo college, i wondered).  drifting w/o no sound or cars or people but me, i estimated length to be no less 100 feet long and maybe 40 feet from wing to wing at the ufos' greatest radius.  \r\n\r\nwhen the ufo started over the street, continuing to drift due east, i saw three exhaust ports in the rear.  no emanations of exhaust coming out.  so, the ports weren't being used.  the bigger exhaust port in the middle.  just as soon as i saw this ufo, it was gone in what i believe to be 30 seconds.  the distance i was to this thing was

viewed the first images sent back from ranger 7 in 1964. ranger 7 sent back over 4000 images showing life on the moon. nasa is a branch of the united states military air force. going to the moon in 1969 was not to land on the moon. it was for military observation, documentation and study of the highly advanced intelligents that resides on the moon. the apollo program designed to pacify public interest in the moon and the solar system. this presentation breaks the debunkers back. the information in these videos shows undeniable proof that n.A.S.A and the united states military as well as some other countries have knowledge that the moon is inhabited. this is why they have never been back. this video will also provide reasonable understanding that the recent lunar crater observation and sensing satellite (lcross) was another hoax only to cover the endless lies that nasa has been feeding the public. the lunar crater observation and sensing satellite (lcross) life footage had defects in the footage because they believe all people are naive and so dumb that believing that \r\nnasa is making progress after 40 plus years in exploration of the moon again. see the truth in these 3-4 presentations then i dare anyone who don't want to believe what is being told here to download the original and do the research. if you don���t want to do the school work, why go to school. many will not want to accept what they see with their own eyes, only because they believe the lie and are in denial. the evidence is undeniable.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":21028,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.9734888,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12172009-0002","longitude":-99.8921131,"occurred":-15958800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,

but only one flash at a time. all three had there own flash and all kept the same pace when it came to their intervals. the distance to each other stayed the same while observing 2 to 3 minutes untill they move past the horizon. there were at least 4 jets passing at the time and their blinking lights had that double red/white flash that i always see. i first i thought maybe helecopters becuase my

thought were airplanes, flying in a row.  as i continued to look, i realized they were pretty close together to be airplanes.  then i slowed down and realized all 3 lights were moving together.  i pulled over so to get a better look and to eliminate my moving as a factor.  i rolled down my window and was surprised to see that the 3 blinking lights were definitely moving together and realized that if they were on one object, it would be a huge object.  the lights seemed to blink in a series (1,2,3) it was also smoothly moving with no sound.  i watched it for about 3 minutes, then drove quickly down and yelled to my husband to get in the car.  we then drove back up to where it had been and i could still see it, but it was moving to the west.  we followed it for about 10 minutes out on the county road and he agreed, it was huge and unlike anything he had ever seen.  he was in the military and has a good background for identifying aircraft.  also, when i saw it originally the 3 lights were in a horizontal row, but a few minutes later when my husband was with me, the 3 lights were still in a row but more at a 45 degree angle to the ground as if turning.  there was also no vapor trail or heat signature, and it was a very cold evening.  i believe this is the same oject that was reported by a couple in o'fallon, mo last night at

from north to south, what made it stand out to me was that it traveled the entire distance of the sky or horizon. a few moments later another object or \"sphere\" the same as the first came out of the northern sky traveling south, but this object stopped in the southern sky and a few moments later two more objects traveling together stayed on the same path as the first. the object that was \"stopped\" now started to travel back north, then a very large and i hate to say it but \"cigar\" shaped object appeared in the north and was also traveling south. the second object that was now traveling north joined up with the large one for a moment and then it took off like a shot back on the southern path like the others. the large object stayed on it's same course. the large \"cigar\" or \"cyliner\" put off a \"glow\" more than a distinct light or group of lights. a semi truck that was traveling in front of me stopped in the middle of the road and the driver got out and came running back to ask if i had just seen the objects in the sky? he was quite excited as was i. it was quite a sight to see to say the least. i have asked around in the area to see if anybody else had seen the \"lights\" or \"objects\" but no other reports have come up yet. i hope to find some other people that may have seen the objects. maybe they saw them from a different angle and have a better
