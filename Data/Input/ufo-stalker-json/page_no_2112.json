(now in cook county) i stopped to take a photograph with my cell phone. i took a single photo, but i don't think it turned out well. i have attached the photo. the lights are barely visible in the

real ufo or something unexplainable. it felt really erry a weird feeling of belief. my buddy who first saw them went to get some binoculars and a camera. so it was me and my other friend looking out the window then out of no where one of the orange orbs just vanished, it was gone, just disappeared. it tripped us right out. so we went outside to look from another view, and i was yelling at my other friend to hurry up with the camera. we went outside and it was just us two who saw the first one vanish. i kid u not as soon as my buddy came outside with the camera the other orange orb vanished and dissapeared like the other one did. the objects did not move they were just sitting in the same position until they vanished. me or him have not seen anything else in that same area out the window since. after it happened i called one of my friends and was telling him about it and he said that a few months earlier around the same area my friend lives that he and a few others saw a

northwest of my car. almost immediately it was close enough to see that it was triangular in shape with flashing lights. as it descended i believe that the lights stopped flashing and it looked exactly like the often broadcast video of the \"phoenix lights\" except that it was not completely dark outside yet here like it was in phoenix when that video was taken. i have heard that the \"phoenix lights\" was caused by  military flairs, so i was looking for smoke coming from the lights and there was none. i also noticed that it was no longer descending and just hovering so i ruled out flairs. this entire part of the sighting from the time i first noticed it until i concluded that it was just hovering took probably no more than 20 seconds, if that. and then \"poof\" it was gone. the traffic light changed, i continued north on hualapai and there it was again outside my driver's side window, but only for a second and then \"poof\" it was once again ahead of my car but a bit farther east than the first time i saw it. i pulled my car over to the right lane, stopped, put on my hazard lights, grabbed my i-phone and tried to take a picture of it. it vanished once again right as i clicked the camera and i only got the fading of the last light and you have to look really hard to even see that. immediately, it was far away in the northwest sky, much lower than my first sighting. i decided to chase it down to get a good photo of it. i had to look down to turn off my hazard lights and when  i looked back up at where it had been it was gone. i drove up to the highest

caught my attention out of the corner of my eye and i looked to the right and up in the sky almost overhead was this \"object\" it appeared to be disk shaped,it had several yellowish white lights around it and 1 reddish colored light on top of it. the object moved very,very slow almost appeared to hover at times and the strange thing was it made absolutely no sound.When i say it was silent i mean the light breeze blowing past my ears made more noise than this thing did!\r\n  after watching this \"object\" for approximately 3 minutes in my driveway i ran inside the house and yelled to my

told me to run in the house and get the camera. i ran inside got my camera out of my camera bag and ran back outside. i turned the camera on to the automatic setting and proceeded to try and get

and don't do drugs and when i went to show him what direction it came from i said \"there it is\" and we both then witnessed this object (altitude was higher) about 800-1000'. my neighbor looked at me and said what is that? i said i was hoping you could tell me. he said it looks like it could be a military drone as he was an iraq veteran and seen them before. i said a drone? he said yeah, when they fly they make virtually no sound. he also stated that the \"object\" seemed awful big and was moving to slow to be a drone but was the only explanation he had.\r\nthe object then moved off in a

takes to be airborne.  this craft was in the hovering mode, and going aprox, 35 mph.  altitude could be judged, as it was slightly north and we had the old tower the adjoins the harbor where we were anchored to measure by.\r\n\r\nthe event started when i came on deck to a completely dark sky other than city lights which were to our east.  i was doing what all sailors do in the night, making patterns in the water. as i looked up towards the east as we were anchored on the fl. bay side, i noted an angled reflection which at first reminded me of geese coming towards the city. i decided right away that this was not a good definition of what i was seeing and realized that something was up there, coming our way.  i called down to my wife to get the binoculars and we both took turns watching the object, or at least what we could see of it.  what we could see was only the angled leading edge facing us and that was only because city light somewhat reflected off the surface which was matt gray and not very reflective.  all of the lower surface was completely stealth and was invisible.  it was only about 1200 feet up and so blanked out a large section of the sky. if i were to hold up a three foot yard stick at arms length, it would have been larger than that, it was massive. the leading edge was rounded and would have been 20 ft. or more high. if you extrapolate what we could see and then carry the shape out, it would have been triangular in shape, but in the stealth mode.  perhaps our military in this case. \r\n\r\nwe kept track of it for several minutes after this and it moved over the tower and over our harbor and into fl. bay. as soon as the city lights no longer could reflect, it became invisible, yet it blanked out the stars for a while and then we no longer could follow the movement. no sound was heard, but then there is a constant sound from key largo which never seems to sleep.\r\n\r\nthis type of craft has been seen about fl. by others as well as other states.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

stop sign and i noticed something up in the air. when i looked up at it i first thought it was a plane but then noticed no wings, no tail, no sound, no movement.\r\ni told my wife to look up at the sky and pointed in the direction of the object i had seen, but it had already vanished. this was all done in approx. 2-3 seconds, for as i made my turn it just disappeared. i looked at it for the 2-3 seconds while stopped, but as i looked to make the turn, it vanished.\r\ni am reporting this because of another article, 11-30-09 in california, that gave the very same discription of what i saw.\r\ni was very excited at first, but when i tried to tell some one they just looked at me with eyes glazed over.\r\ni am not sure if this is where i can ask about \"missing time\"? i had an expierence when i was 8 or 9, where i was in my nieghbor's backyard. he was called into the house, for something i can't recall, and i was sitting in the swing set. i was looking up and the sky and thinking that the clouds and blue sky were really nice with the sunshine of late spring early summer of '58 or '59. i remember looking up at the sky and thinking, \"wow, that is really neat!\" this was early afternoon. the next thing i remember is standing outside my house, in the flower bed, looking into our living room, with the sun going down and wondering how i got there and why was it getting dark! when i told my mother about it, she thought i had imagined it. nightmares and uneasiness about strange and wierd things have been going on for 50 years now and i would really like to know what happened to me.
