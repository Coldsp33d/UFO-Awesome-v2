States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were having a family/friends get together to celebrate a birthday. during the celebration two of my nephews and a neice came tearing into the house, screaming at the top of their lungs, saying that a plane crashed in one of the adjacent pastures. my brother, myself and about 3 others walked outside to see what was causing all the ruckus. \r\n\r\nwe didn't see anything out of the ordinary except a strange burning smell that smelled like burning mesquite. we didn't think anything of it since it was kind of nippy and someone could have been burning some wood in thier fireplaces. we told them to show us where they saw the plane go down and we walked over to the place they showed us. \r\n\r\nthe first thing we noticed was that all the dogs in the area were going bonkers. they were barking up a storm, like they were all seeing the same thing. \r\n\r\nthe area we live in is pretty much a rural community, unless you live in the city of monahans, many of the houses are set on large plots of land, usually 4-5 acres per house. although we can see the houses of many of our neighbors and we do have traffic on the road, you do get the feeling of being all to yourself out here. some of the land by our house is over run by wild mesquite tree's. only a small portion of the land surrounding the house is cultivated and cleared out. beyond the stand of trees runs a small barbed wire fence that seperates us from our neighbors, who i could see were home from the lights on in the house.\r\n\r\nwe walked around the edge of the trees, not wanting to really go into the stand at night. even though its technically winter, there could be rattlesnakes seeking shelter in amongst the tree's, not to mention that mesquite trees have some wicked thorns that protrude from them, they are razor sharp and quite capable of punching through a pair of jeans or boots and they hurt like hell to get out.\r\n\r\nas we looked around, we started noticing a sort of electrical charge to the very air around us. almost like the kind you feel when you approach a large electrical substation or a charged and active radio antenna.\r\n\r\nas we made our way around the trees, one of my brothers noticed some light peeking through the trees, i told him it was probably one of the neighbors leaving or coming home. he promptly told me that it couldn't be head lights because the light seemed too defused and not as concentrated as a car's headlight.\r\n\r\nwe moved around and as we cleared the stand of trees, we were shocked to see an oval shaped object hovering, maybe 4-5 feet off the ground. we stood there in total shock, and awe. i can only imagine that our jaws were probably on the ground. as we stood there watching this object hover there without a sound, i took note that the object was maybe about 30-40 feet from front to back, it was maybe the same dimensions around. the object seemed to be of a highly polished material that reflected the area around it. the reflection of the distant street lights from the surrounding neighbors properties seemed to reflect off the surface of the object. there was also a small dull glow to the object, barely noticable unless you were really looking, almost like an aura of sorts, a irredecent blue of sorts.\r\n\r\nas we stood there in total shock, my brother next to me expressing his disbelief, we saw two strange looking \"men\" appear from around the object. they at first didn't notice us, they were busy running around and gathering objects from the ground, from the trees. they didn't seem to notice us at first. they looked to be about the size of my oldest nephew, about 4 feet tall, but they looked very skinny, like they had no meat on their bones. their heads were large and their arms were long, skinny and hung down around their knee's. about this time my two nephews came walking up behind us (scaring the hell out of us). they saw the object and the strange \"men\" and in a voice that only a kid can project, screamed out loud \"what are those things!\".\r\n\r\nthats when the creatures turned and noticed us. the sight of these creatures was something that will haunt me till the day i die. it turned and looked right at us. it's eyes were large, almost like the eyes of a praying mantis, except they were jet back and wrapped around its head. the two creatures looked at us for about 7 seconds, not an ounce of movement, before they calmly walked around the craft, one right after the other. they disappeard behind the craft and we never saw them again. \r\n\r\na few seconds later the craft lifts up, not a sound coming from the object, no rush of wind, not even a swaying of the nearby branches of a mesquite tree. it rose quietly and hovered about 40 feet from the ground, and shot out like a bat out of hell. as it zoomed away, it started glowing and made it easier to track as it zoomed away getting higher and higher till it faded away. \r\n\r\nwe stood there in complete silence as we tried to make heads or tails of what the hell we just saw. my brother finally piped up and said \"should we call the police?\" after which, i burst out in laughter and replied to him \" and tell them what?\" my nephew looked like he had just seen the devil himself, which considering what we just saw i don't blame him.\r\n\r\nhe didn't want to talk about it, and after we made our way back to the house, he still didn't talk about. i tried to ask him about it yesterday and he basically told me that he didn't want to think about it yet, he was still processing what had happened to him. i was more than happy to leave it at that.\r\n\r\ni never really believed in the subject of ufo's or alien's, but after the events of this night, i'm seriously going to re-evaluate that belief.\r\ni know that i plan to keep my mind open, and start looking up towards the sky a little bit more from now on.\r\n\r\nthank you","distance":"21-100

miles towards san jose when i noticed on the rightside of windshield, upper, in the clouds a two lights that appeard to be hovering in and out of clouds, as i passed the lights i saw and they went out of my view, i got off 280 with the next turn off to investigate what i saw. i turned into a vacant parking lot but spotted the lights in the sky before i parked, i parked my vehicle, got outside my vehicle and looked up and there it was, it was 3 white lites in a triangular shape hovering at cloud level, as i looked through my binoculars, i could clearly see the lites were attached to some kind of aircraft, there was no sound, the object was very dark, i say the size of it was about the size of 4 to 5 regular 3 bedroom homes put together. i observed this object hover in the same area for about 30 minutes, i took a few pictures with this old pentax digital camera and only one pic came out that you can see something, i developed the picture at a camera store and its hard to describe what the camera picked up, but its something i have never seen in my life before, the camera picked up what my binoculars couldnt and its one weird looking thing. after about 20 minutes i got very uncomfortable cause i felt the aircraft was getting closer to me and got back in my car and sat there for about 10 more minutes and decided to quit watching this thing while i was ahead. as i got back on freeway, i felt a little confused as to why i got to see what i saw and got confused to the point that it took me probably a extra 10-15 minutes to get home because i missed a couple of turnoffs  on the way home. the whole ordeal  had me rattled pretty good. i dont think my heart slowed down beating till after a few hours after this event.I am a big follower of the nasa space program and have always been skeptical of alien existance and visits, but after last nite, i am 100% convinced with no doubt whatsoever that there is life elsewhere and that life is visiting

apartment complex, when i noticed a gleaming passenger jet, flying where i normally see them.  my attention was drawn to an object that looked like it was just sitting there.  amongst the clouds.  i  maintained my view of this strange cigar shaped thing, it was reflective and had what appeared to be three or more, large dark, circular shapes on the side of it.  that is what caused me to look harder at it.  the altitude  was in amongst the clouds, which i afterwards,  quickly confirmed through doppler to be 15,000ft.  i had the advantage of comparing it instantly to the passing jet.  i couldnt see the windows on the jet at that altitude, but this thing, had distinguishable dark round objects or marks on its side.  \r\nthe size of it at what i guess was its altitude,  made it larger than the passenger jet.  my question is: are there radar records available for 12:49pm\r\n13 dec 09?   i mean, something this large was seen and it looked rather close to the passenger jet that was heading north,  i was viewing this looking to the east.  again its altitude was high,  it simply vanished before my eyes!\r\ni think i saw it for all of about 2 minutes maybe. i dont believe it ever moved, as my vantage point afforded me the ability to remain still.  it was \r\nclear and not blurry or obscured, the skies were beautiful today, , cloudy,\r\nbut this thing stood out!  i dont get that.  i never took my eyes off of it. and it appeared to just vanish?  that makes no sense to me either.  can someone tell me what the hell this was?   i enjoy skywatching and am familiar with the planes that fly around south florida.  this didnt look like it moved.  i've ruled out just about everything except a balloon or kite, but the altitude would mean it was massive. i wonder if the plane saw anything?  thanks for any response.  \r\nsincerely \r\nkevin maurer ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),

was watching the planes come in to land at mccarran airport. the landing pattern was over my house. there were 6 or 7 planes in line to land. the last one was far brighter than the rest. i thought i was just seeing the landing lights at a more straight on angle. as the rest of the planes flew by, the last one stayed just as far out as when i had first seen it. i remember thinking \"it would be cool to see a ufo\", and upon blinking my eyes, the thing made about a thirty mile jump toward me,  i didn't believe what i saw. then i blinked again and it was only about a mile away. (as it made the jumps, i felt a wave or something pass through me. it was very strange.) at this point, it slowed down, and flew right over my head.           \r\n  \r\n  it was disc shaped, flying at probably, 1500 to 2000 feet. it had two rings of lights around it.One ring around the outside, and one ring closer to the middle. it seemed to be flying in a cloud or mist, and no great details could be seen. it was absolutely silent. when i realised what i was looking at, i ran for my car, to retrive a small telescope from the glove box. apon reaching my car, i turned to get a fix on the object, only to find it was gone.  i scaned the sky in every direction to see if i could see it, but it was gone.\r\n\r\n  i was totally astonished at what i had just wittnesed. i felt as though it had read my thoughts, and decided to give me my wish.( wanting to see a ufo.)\r\n\r\n  since then i have seen some other things in the skys over vegas but nothing as close up. i am curious if anybody else has seen this or something like it?

planes have tails!! but ok i personally think if i read this random post of a ufo report by a teenager i'd think it's a little dumb child trying to call attention, but i know what i saw.  \r\n\r\n**i alrealdy made a report, and in the last one i put that it happened around 1pm...Then i remembered that it was around 11 am because at around 1pm we were setting up the last round of tennis matches. so in this report i fixed it**\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":20977,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6741274,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122009-0012","longitude":-81.5133535,"occurred":1260086400000,"potentialRelations":[20965],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1260672969000,"summary":"Irregularly shiny and didn't have airplane features","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":6,"locationName":"Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:160724"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Pittsburgh","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving home w/ my girl friend comming down butler st. towards pittsburgh. it was aprox. 9:50pm thurs dec 10th 2009. saw a large triangular \"plane\" in the sky. it appeared to be about a 1000 feet or so above the \"strip district \" area of the city w/ was about a mile ahead of me. i am pretty familiar w/ ufo descriptions,..And don't feel that it was \"alien\"   it however appeared to not act of look like a plane that i have ever seen.  as soon as i saw it it seemed wierd.  the lights on it were very odd,....And it seemed to hover almost hang above the city. it looked as is it was moving way to slow for it's size. all the lights on it were white. and it seemed to illuminate the sky in front of it as if it had headlights comming from the top. from were i stood when i got out of the car it was about as large a a quarter in the sky,..And my view was then blocked by a building . i saw it come out from behind the building but it's flight was so low it was blocked then again by another building,.. i saw nothing of it after. i'm aware that it could be a military plane. everything i've ever seen on  tr-3b  however left me to believe that it was not that. i will include a sketch. it was dark however and the plane seemed to be the same color as the sky. the lights were very bright. i am an artist and have a very good visual memory,... i could tell you what it was i saw if i saw a picture of it","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":20976,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4431848,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122009-0011","longitude":-79.9917664,"occurred":1260511200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1260668231000,"summary":"Plane hovering above city.

 yeah most likely, but then i remembered a show i watched about quasar���s.   which i believe are black holes that emit a flashing light from its center.  but i was not alarmed or even startled.  i was wondering if i was really looking at a quasar, or was it simply just a satellite??   well, that���s when it started moving and my jaw dropped and my heart started to race.  i was so excited , i wanted to tell the world or start video taping , but all i could do was lay in bed with my head propped on my hand , for i feared i would never ever see anything like this again.  which i was dead wrong about!  but i didn���t want to stop watching , plus i just finished moving so i had no clue where my video camera was, and all i could think of was using my cell phone, but  i knew it wouldn���t get anything worth while. so i laid and watched. \r\n\t usually when i see them its between 10:30 p.M and 1:00 am eastern time.  they usually appear in threes, and only on the very first night was there ever more than three confirmed moving in the sky in one night.   these ufo���s seem to have intelligent operator���s.  i say this because i���ve went out side twice to try to see them better on the first couple nights but when i went out they became very still, and continued to remain still for 10 mins or so after i went inside my house. to be honest and upfront,  they look and in a sense act like star���s.  that���s the main reason why i said they had intelligent operators!  \r\n\t in due time these ufo���s ���glide ���as i call it across the night sky.  but they don���t only glide!  they make short, very  very  fast jerky movements at times.  i���ve seen them do u turns, complete vertical loops and double loops, and single and double horizontal loops! they do pointless maneuvers like,  right-----> left , right--------->left, right------> and i���ve seen them do 45 degree turns one right after another, they flicker but usually are the same basic colors of the stars, but the same three seem to keep appearing and one of the three is always a amberish color.  but they have a flicker effect to them that  always catches my eye.  i spotted the very first one only because it was flickering.  they make, what look like very short, fast, and erratic movements, but if your not watching that one target you would never see it moving, but on the other hand, if your only watching the one so called star no human alive would doubt me when it moves !!!  \r\n\t i���ve seen them slowly dim out, i���ve seen them flicker what seemed to be, at one another , and then start to flicker in sync.  when they flickered at each other and in sync the did it very brightly, and instead of a flicker,  they kind of flashed. but the night they flashed and flickered at one another and in sync was my first night.   that night i spotted one, then i  identified three, then out of nowhere three more showed up, and than i was watching multiple targets move at once, since at that time they all moved rather close to each other and grouped up, allowing me to see more than one move at once.  that���s around the time they all moved up in a weird fashion ���which can be described if asked���   the only time i could really count them was when they all moved weirdly up together.  they would dim down and disappear and reappear out of nowhere.  but when they moved up together , they all stayed lit up, allowing me to count quickly.\r\n\t \r\nbut the most craziest part is when a bright one, ���some are brighter than others��� shot out three more of these ufo���s .  one came out straight down.  then the other two shot out at a downward 45 degree angle , one on each side.   the climax lasted maybe, 4-8 mins  then if they didn���t dim down and disappear, they moved slowly out of the south east sky, and continued moving to and threw the south southeast sky, until i could not see them no more threw my window.   but , the way they move makes no sense, and the way they accelerate is unbelivablely fast!!  they seem to be able to stop just as fast as well!  \r\n\ti have a lot more to say but don���t want to ramble on.  there is so much to gain from what i���m seeing.  i can only hope you take me serious.  i would gladly upload the video i���ve got but my camcorder use���s 8mm tapes, but i���ve burned it to a dvd+r disc, but i cant get my computer to read it!!!!  i could mail a copy????? \r\n\r\nwhen i video taped i opened my window ���even though it was freezing��� and removed my screen and video taped while my camera sat completely still on my window sill. i also have footage that was shot threw a normal window screen.   the video is really convincing!!! \r\n\r\n\r\nnow, i love outer space and stargazing!  i just turned 29 this year , so for about 15 years now i���ve avidly looked at the sky.  and i wouldn���t be writing this, nore would i have lost any sleep the first night, if i had stopped watching  what i thought might  have been a quasar, ��� which didn���t alarm me until it moved!��� just one second before it started moving.  but when that star/quasar started moving, well���. lets just say that���s 3 seconds of movement i���ll never forget!\r\ni need more and better cameras, i need professionals to see this!!!!!!    please contact me!!!!!!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":20974,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.51972,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12122009-0009","longitude":-85.08,"occurred":1258959600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1260662250000,"summary":"They flicker and sit in the sky like a star.  but move like nothing known to man!

( it is a 8\" celestron c/s) my son, who was 10 at the time, was with me. we had both been out before, in the past , and had seen saturn, jupiter and mars several times, so we knew what those looked like. on this night, we were looking west, toward lake michigan, when i noticed a fairly bright, orangish star. i found it in my telescope and immediatly realised that it wasn't a star, as it was quite round. my first thought was that we were looking at venus, as i had yet to actually see venus in my scope. i went inside the house to check what planets were available to see. at that time, i had a program on my computer that would show the night sky on any given time and date. according to the program, venus should have been directly east of us, not west. i thought maybe it was mercury instead, but according to the program, mercury should have been under us, not visable for that time of night. all of the other planets should have been above or behind us as well. i went back out to look at it again and was shocked. now there were two orangish, round objects, one on top of the other. i asked my son to look in the scope. i said \"do you see both of them?\" he looked at me and said \"both? there's 4 of them\" i looked again and he was right. there were 4 round objects going straight up and down, like pearls on a necklace. we looked at each other for a minute, then i went back to the telescope. the objects started moving down. i tried to follow them with my telescope, but they eventually disappeared. we tried to make some sense of what we saw, and thought that maybe it was some sort of optical illusion caused by the atmosphere. we continued to look at other stars for about an hour, when i noticed a orangish object rising in the west. we thought it might be the same thing that we had seen an hour earlier, so i swung the telescope around to look at it. as i was about to get it into site, my son said \"it went out\". i looked around, and it was gone. i asked what he meant by 'it went out'. he said that it just went out, like someone had thrown a switch and turned it off. i still think it was probably some sort of illusion, and that somehow we were seeing mercury distorted by the atmosphere. but with all the recent reports of glowing orbs, i'm begining to wonder just what it was that we did see.","distance":"Over One

enormous glow of blue-green light appear from a domed object on the ground just above the surface behind the tree line- about half a mile into the darkness. it was spectacular! it lit up a large amount of our eastern visible sky. the light seemed artificial sort of like a welders flickery glow, but on a huge scale! i would say the dome itself was at least 100ft wide and a transparent light green color. the blue-green light- that emanated from the dome- spread up into the sky making a cone shape above the dome- with a width of over half a mile. it was so large that it frightened us. i had my video camera in the back seat but the battery was dead. i forgot to charge it before leaving my house! anyway, the the whole event reminded me of what a transformer does when it blows up in the

i was talking to my brother in the car on our way in the highway. my uncle was driving. my dad was in the passenger seat. we were near the airport and i was looking out the window and i see an \"airplane\" in the sky over some buildings to my right. i didn't tell the people in the car at first that it looked weird in a way. the plane, to begin, was very shiny. it reflected the sunlight more than i've ever seen any plane reflect. also, its color was a silver/gold that, again, shone a lot, and i never had seen an airplane of that color. it was also a little too long to be a plane. i thought it was a plane, thinking logically. that was until i noticed something...The object didnt have a tail like airplanes do. it didnt have wings either, which i thought i couldn't see because it was facing sideways towards me. it was just a disk with no shape whatsoever sticking out of it. it also had squares on it. it's hard to explain. it was like a quilt...The ufo was built with metal squares which i could notice. again, it's hard to explain. at that moment i felt like something squeezed my heart, just like you feels when you think you lost something very important or when you get really scared. i pointed the object out to the people in the car. i said \"look at that plane it looks so much like an alien!\"(except i said it in spanish). at that moment, a wall appeared covering the object, so they couldn't see it. it was a wall in the highway. i've seen many in highways in miami, and just at that exact moment the wall had to cover the object. by the time the wall was over, which actually was not very much at all because tehre was no traffic, the object was gone. like it never existed. i personally think it's impossible for an airplane to get to the airport, which was still not that close, that fast. maybe it was a plane, but i know what i saw and i'm sure it was not a plane. i wanted to draw a sketch of what i saw but i had nothing to draw on, and we were on our way to having a good time playing tennis so i didn't want to ruin it making a fuss about it. after that i didnt talk about it, and i still haven't because i'm scared my parents might think i'm crazy since i'm the only one who saw the ufo. i can't get what i saw out of my head. this is why now i decided to look for a place to report it. before this i believed in aliens, but i doubted it. now i'm scared. again, the \"obvious\" reason for what the object was is a plane since the airport was near, but it wasn't close enough for the plane to get there and land that fast. and also, the thing had no tail! planes have tails!! but ok i personally think if i read this random post of a ufo report by a teenager i'd think it's a little dumb child trying to call attention, but i know what i saw.

to whom it may concerne at mufon,\r\n\r\nis mufon now hiding the truth from the public?\r\nit seems i have had reports from people that mufon is now sending investigators around the web to site like youtube and making reports against the posters of any videos that have come in on a mufon report. this has not happened to myself, but it was brought to my attention, and after i investigated the claims, it became clear that they were true.\r\n\r\n they are getting yanked due to copyright infringement claims by mufon and a mufon investigator. why?\r\n\r\n this is a mistake on mufon's part. the sharing of information is paramount in the ufology community.Not only does it get the information out there to the people, it also may pass the eyes of someone that could shed some light on the sighting and have answers that normally would not come to light.This proprietary move on mufon's part is bold and a step into a dark and unwanted direction. \r\n\r\n could mufon have lost its vision of providing the truth about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and vehicles that are visiting our planet? this move is now putting mufon in the realm of those that hold tight to the cover ups and lies that have been perpetrated against humanity.\r\n\r\n could mufon have become what they once despised?\r\n is money more important than the truth now?\r\n is mufon now answering to a higher power and is now under their thumb?\r\n is mufon now part and parcel of the cover up and lies?\r\n\r\n any serious ufologist will agree that any suppressed information in a public forum like mufon is can be viewed as selling out to the wrong side of the playing field. this for myself is a sad day for ufology and is a step in the wrong direction. this has made me lose some respect for the organization as a whole. i realize it is does not reflect everyone but mainly the policy makers.\r\n\r\n for my purposes i will be copying this post and putting it up on my sites i visit so to ensure that if this gets deleted at least there will be a record of it. just in case more censorship is decided on against this letter of disapproval.\r\n\r\n thank you for you time\r\n slushpup

noticed some lights to the right of me coming from the trunk of a tree and then floating around in the tree tops. these lights were small like the size of a lime as they went up into the tree they either disappeared or become larger to the size of a grapefruit. this went on for a while. then one of these lights started to cross over the lake as it made its way across the lake it looked like an elongated tube. it looked like a tube of lipstick in its shape. it had a slight rounded almost oval head. it also had what looked like 2 appendages pointing down. these objects never had any flashing lights, blinking or faa lights. there was no noise. the lights in the trees were a dirty yellow color. the object crossing the lake was also a dirty yellow color with a muted hue of red at the top and had almost a silver mist around it.\r\n\r\nthen i saw a huge yellow light come from over the farmers field it verred coming towards me on the bank of the lake. i called my friend to come out.The light stopped over our heads and it was just above the tree top when it turned into 2 lights. again, there was no flashing, blinking, faa lights or nosie. this time it kind of looked like it was attached to something but we could not see. then in an instant the 2 lights went out over us and nothing could be seen except for a tiny red light that could only be seen with the binoculars.\r\n\r\nmy friend left me and i continued to watch. then i see what looks like a small ball of light fly from the ground next to the tree where i was seeing these lights. it flew out right over the lake only to be followed by 2 lights behind it that were in a perfect triangle formation. these ligts all looked the same. they had a small red head and a dirty yellow body. again no blinking, flashing, faa lights or noise. they flew out and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nthere were more of the small dirty yellow spheres either coming from the tree or going over the farmers field. more lipstick tubes of light also seen going over the lake. all these lights were so very low just a couple hundred feet. \r\n\r\nit was starting to get cold and i was having no luck with getting any cameras to work. it was so dark out but it was a beautiful star filled night. \r\n\r\nthen just about when i was ready to go inside i see a commerical airliner fly over my head. i was happy to see something familiar. then just as i turned the other way from the plane i see this red ball of light flying very fast towards the commerical airliner. i could not belive it. this ball was a blood red light was the size of a grapefriut. this ball of light was right behind the tail of the airplane and i thought it was going to crash into it. i was so scared. then the light goes to the top of the cockpit of the plane to what literally looked like it was going to sit on top of it. then it went to the left of the wing and thats when i ran inside.\r\n\r\nduring the time of when things started happening that night all the dogs around the lake started barking for a good 5 minutes straight. this happened at least 3 times when i was out there and it was very loud to where we made a comment about it. also, a dog from a couple houses down jumped into the lake and started swimming towards were i was on the edge of the lake. this was out of the ordianary.","distance":"21-100

but it was there long enough for me to see.  i did not report it right away because i felt did i see it or did i not see it. my pets did not allert to anything they just slept through it. but since then they have become more aggitated,and allert to things that are not there. i have had several encounters lately and i am beginning to worry.  (1) i was sitting in my living room.  (2)some thing just told me to look out the window.  (3)i was very curious why it had decided to show its self to me.
