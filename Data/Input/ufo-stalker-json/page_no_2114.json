be miles north of me but absolutely visible.\r\ni turned off my radio and cracked a window to listen for any noise, like a crash or something, and there was only the road noise.\r\napprox. 15 seconds

have been there much longer, i don't know.  \r\n\r\nthey were blinking quickly (not all would blink at once) amongst themselves in a predictable, synchronized pattern. they were stationary (in a group) for about 4 minutes and then softly moved off and disappeared. my daughter and i both witnessed this. the lights were small as stars, colored whitish/blue as stars. the lower level planes that were also in the sky seemed artificial and yellow compared to these ufo lights. \r\n\r\nthe planes were definitely lower and definitely planes. these synchronized lights were something totally different. i have never seen anything like this ever! i live in a semirural area that is surrounded by urban sprawl. we have some light pollution and lots of plane traffic due to the airports around the dfw area, but we can see the stars too at times. the only reason that these lights even caught my eye in the first place was the quick, rapid firing of the light sequence. otherwise i may have not seen it. \r\n\r\ni don't know why i looked up in the sky, but i was out in the barn feeding my animals and my horse nudged my face. she doesn't do this ordinarily and she did it twice tonight! i just  happened to look up at that second time that she nudged me and this light pattern caught my eye. \r\n\r\nthe lights moved off in their organized pattern and kept the \"light sequence pattern\" going as they gradually left the sky. they faded off in the distance slowly but they were gone in @ 30 seconds from the time that they began to move. the departure was gradual, but quick. i think that there were about 3 lights on one horizontal level, the end craft \"blinked\" diagonally upwards to another level, and then another  level began to blink. perhaps there were 6 in all? they seemed to be in a \"stair step\" pattern. \r\n\r\nmy daughter attempted to catch them on her cell phone but she did not get any good

20-30 minutes then resumed driving. again the small light was following. my brother and i stopped and got out of our car. as we approached the rear of our car, the \"single\" small light split into 3 lights,one above the other then all 3 darted off and out of sight.\r\n    we continued on our way. we then saw what appeared to be a small meteor fall and hit the earth not far from our location. we stopped, got out of the car and that is when we saw a large, disc shaped ship with multiple lights.\r\n     to make a long story short; for around 5-6 hours we saw 2 large ships which were stationary most of the time, otherwise moving very slowly. at times one seemed to be above the road and very much appeared to \"lift\" another vehichle up and into the darkness, at which time it and the vehichle lights were cut off.\r\n     there were 5-6 vehiclss which were out in the feild alongside the road, (on the otherside of fence). 2 of the cars, that we know of, had an unconscience person within.\r\n     one particular event which i thought to be quite fascinating, was one of the \"mother ships\", above the road in front of us and very low, (100-150 ft high), slowly flew away from us. we followed up the hill. it changed it's row of lights to one bright light on its left side & 2 lights on its right. it then flew out of sight, very slowly, over the hill. as we crested the hill, we saw the same lights on the ground ahead of us, as we approached we realized they were lights at a farm house. the ufo \"tricked\" us. they knew we were following and knew how to trick us with their lights.\r\n     for 5-6 hours we drove up and down a 2-3 mile stretch of road observing these 2 large ships, 3-4 smaller ones and an unusual, small cloud full of small, vein-like lightning.\r\n     at one point, toward the end of the event, my brother and into the dark. were standing together in front of our car, the headlights were on and in front of us about 10 feet or so were 2 umm, \"aliens\", or so we assume. they were probably 6 1/2 feet tall, wearing a light colored suit, one piece i guess, with a v-neck ( i think?). they slowly 'drifted' backwards away from us and into the dark. neither of us remember what we were doing prior to seeing them in front of us.\r\n     too much occurred that night to write here. this occurred about 15 miles east of ely, nevada on july 19th, 1990. wish i would have told you about it years ago. i wrote down the experiance the following morning, just after it happened.","distance":"20 Feet or

reported \"ufo's over ranch cordova\" on the 10 pm news. i ran outside\r\nand as i was running out the door told my mother. my mother came out with me. we lived at 2717 barbera way, right next to the cordova lanes bowling alley. we ran over to the entrance to the strip mall, next to the diner.\r\ni started looking around. i looked toward the se (toward the rancho seco nuclear plant and mather afb)and saw a formation of 3 lights coming toward us in a triangle formation at about 1000 ft. the object flew directly over us. it emmitted no sound and the object was solid. the\r\nappox size was about 40 ft at its biggest point. it appeared to have \r\n4 \"bluish lights\" in the rear, possibly an engine. my mother and i observed the aircraft until it dissappeared over the trees to the nw.\r\napprox speed was about 150 mph.The sacramento bee ran a front page story on this the next day, which included a map with the flight path.\r\nif anyone knows the exact date i would really appricaite this as i cannot remeber if it was in 1980 or 1981. the flight path took the craft over mather afb, rancho seco, mccellan afb, and beale afb.\r\nthank you for any futher information \r\n

1,000 foot altitude and was seen by me and significant other simultaneously.  we could see lights at the apex of the angles of the triangle and these lights were a dull yellow/white; you could see the structure of the underside of the craft and it looked like a starship as you might imagine in a star wars movie script.  the craft was totally silent and moving west to east at very slow speed, estimating at perhaps 15 to 20 miles per hour.  the craft continued east for another 1/2 mile or so -- still visible because the lights of the city were illuminating the object -- and it banked to the left (north) and then took off at incredible speed, estimating at some hundreds to thousands of miles an hour instantly and disappeared into the night in the north.  we were dumb-struck by the sighting.  totally silent, huge, isosceles triangle, structure underneath, lights at apex were not colored red/green or any real color than a dull dirty yellowish.  no visible means of power; no jets, no sound, no hum... nothing.  it had to be antigravity being that huge and silent.  and the speed as it took off was simply amazing indicating it was no blimp or other terrestrial craft as it appeared to defy physics at that point; from just barely moving to like mach 10 instantly and gone.  we filed a police report at the time.  police took report and that's the last we've heard of it.  it was absolutely clearly seen and huge, silent... not from here.  i would have liked to have seen radar records from the local airport of the time in question but whoever was piloting this craft had, apparently, no concerns about being seen so i suspect the craft was not visible to radar.  there is a military base in the same general locale but this thing was nothing like i have ever seen.  i've seen b-1 and b-2 bombers, etc., and f-114a jets, etc., and this craft was not any of these.  it was not an aurora or t3ba either... it was a ship like i have never seen and was not from here as best i

appointed contacted and ufo researcher sixto paz wells in the early 70s (a character you might already known), but \"dissolved\" years later by himself, he says, due to problems in forming several groups, but according to other serious reports, by dark money management  from outside, which created a problem for which the \"dissolution\" of the group was formed in more urgent action to get out

and even\" wonderful \"to some, but that in me has raised serious doubts, since that picture was just at moments when the group had a drought of experience. it was taken by one of the \"referent\" group (coincidentally just for him) on a field trip in this city north of peru, who claimed that when he took the picture, there was nothing in the sky, but then, the disclose, oh, god, he found \"such great surprise\": there in the sky (seeing photo, next to the branches of a tree) something like a brillant big object  heart-shaped. the photo can be seen on the blog of the group: http://www.Rahmatrujillo.Blogspot.Com/(this photo is the second and sixth image in descending order to run the computer mouse. the latter-the larger-is most suitable for analysis ). also, note that the outer contour of such a heart is composed of two colors: violet and pink (left and right of the observer). in group meetings irradiation we often work with these colors, which, according to the teachings of saint germain-symbolizing the transmutation and love, respectively. after such a photograph to make public their ideological kin (coincidentally, only to them), tacitly self-styled

body or person specializing in such research and corroboration or alleged paranormal phenomena revealed in photographs (i imagine that they are holders of special software used for this purpose) giving me any websites or links that seriously addressed this kind of research or emails so i can contact with any of them?. i believe in the ufo phenomenon but not everything that occurs as part of it ... and worse than it could be a hoax. today the picture is digitized and anyone with knowledge in computer systems can do and create \"wonders\". but one thing is to play innocently with these tools ... and another trick with narrow interests to the well-intentioned people. maybe also photography has not been faked. in this case, but i can not accept such evidence, because what is is. and

movimiento norte-sur; esta luz se agranda y al llegar al cenit del cielo se detuvo casi perpendicular a mi cabeza, pero, a mucha altura y desplazada ligeramente hacia el este. el objeto o lo que fuere era circular y totalmente iluminado en su parte de abajo con una luz blanca, muy similar a las luces fosforescentes. estuvo detenido aproximadamente entre 2 y 3 segundos para luego comenzar a moverse hacia el este de modo ondulante, como si estuviera buscando un rumbo, un poco para atr���s y un poco para adelante, haciendo cortos y lentos desplazamientos, para luego regresar al punto en el cual estuvo brevemente detenido; se detiene nuevamente por 2 o 3 segundos y comienza a desplazarse hacia el norte; su primer movimiento fue lento, luego se dispara a una velocidad inveros���mil. mientras

but at times would get brighter and larger then fade back at other moments.  my best guess is these craft are at least the size of a football field each.\r\n\r\nthey appeared blurred out (cloaked) but the pale glow made them noticeable.  we have rotating spotlights in the falls here, and when the light would pass over and graze the one ship, it reflected back a very bright icy-blue flash much stronger than the spotlight.\r\n\r\na distinct formation was noticeable.  they stayed at fixed angles to one another, if you could think of the marks of a clock, they were roughly 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock respectively.\r\n\r\nplease contact me with any questions!  i just hope all of these witnesses with all these photos and videos are taken seriously because quite frankly i just want to know whats going on in our sky.  youtube is where most video and photos of sightings are being posted, i encourage you to investigate this.\r\n\r\nthankyou so much!\r\n\r\n\r\nlouis\r\n\r\nps the sightings

time was in the car with my grandfather.  he saw them too.  it was strange, but i didn't think too much about them.  the second time was on november 28.  i was in the car with my sister and her husband.  a few hours later i saw a helicopter heading in the same direction where we saw them last.  the last time was on december 7, which was the strangest sighting.  i was with my sister, and we went outside with her dog and saw one of the orbs moving very quickly across the sky.  then we watched it disappear, and reappear again a little farther away.  all three nights were clear, and they all happened around the same time, approximately 8pm.  a little while later we went back outside and saw another orb in the same spot, but it didn't move, and we could see the other one across this big field.  the one that didn't move did the disappear, reappear thing too.  either these orbs are pretty close or pretty big.  we couldn't hear anything unusual though.  another strange thing we saw on that same night of december 7 was a red light that flickered.  it was in the same part of the sky as the unmoving orb.  it moved back and forth in a swaying motion, and then it too disappeared.  my sister has saw a red light moving quickly across the sky in the same area too, and she heard a helicopter shortly after.  it's all been in the same area at the same time, except for on november 25, we saw something during the day, but in the exact same spot.  four children also witnessed it with us.  it was faint, kind of grayish in color.  it didn't appear to be round, and we also watched this one vanish.  there was a helicopter closeby.  also, for about a year, there's been this bright, star-like object that we can't explain.  it almost looks like a planet but we don't know if that's a possibility.  plus, for about the same amount of time, we've been seeing these little, blinking lights pop up all over the sky.  they look triangular, with a white light on the top point and two red lights for the base points.  they don't move, so they can't be planes and i don't think they could be satellites.  it's all just strange and kind of discomforting because i've lived here my whole life and never seen anything like any of it before.  i'm very interested in this kind of thing, but i find this almost frightening.  we were shaking when we saw the orange orbs vanish right in front of us.  this is such a small, rural town.  the closest airport is half an hour away and there aren't any military bases nearby.  the objects were mostly in the northwest, and if they moved they were headed southeast.  i'm just not sure what to think of it...","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

hang myself out the window to get a panorama of the clear night sky. we start watching all the stars more closely and pretty soon they are all switching positions and forming constellations (there were 2 orions, 2 big dippers) then they fall out of those shapes and start taking the triangle and diamond shapes i'm familiar with. we watched in awe for the next hour while the entire sky filled up with these unfathomably large crafts. at some point in all this a craft became upright and was in the shape of a pyramid, with a smaller inverted pyramid at the bottom. all during this time there were single \"stars\" (individually manned crafts)moving in all parts of the sky. we drive around and get a different angle on the huge pyramid and we see these single \"stars\" coming out of ports on the inclines of the craft (we can see recessed lights in the ports). we drove around all night getting different vantage points, on multiple occasions they responded to being \"bright lighted\", they would actually flash back.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

bright light, not blinking, heading south, parallel to i5. it looked like it was over the pilot fueling station in brooks ore. the reason it caught my attention, was because of how low the object was flying above the ground. so, i figured it was a helicopter flying at a low altitude to inspect, or look at something. as i got closer, it flew over i5 and it was further away than i thought. as it flew over i5 i got a look at the bottom and saw three bright white lights in a triangle formation, with a small non blinking red light somewhere on the bottom. after flying over the interstate, the object hovered behind some thin trees at the norpac cannery in what i think is a cabbage patch. from the side it looked like a jet with no wings. i was baffled. i know for sure that there was no propeller. i passed the object at the norpac plant on i5, it was approx. 90-110 feet above the ground and going maybe 20-30 mph. i got a pretty good look at it. it was dusk, but i could see that it did not have any wings or propeller, and no blinking lights. it looked like it was matte silver or gray. i remember seeing a car pulled over on the side of the interstate. i dont know if it was related. i told a couple of close friends and family, and they all thought i was seeing a helicopter or a small plane. i drive that section of freeway alot, and commuted to woodburn ore. from salem ore. for a year on graveyard shift. it took along time to say or tell anybody about it, because of ridicule. i still think about this event almost everyday. what ever this craft was, man made or not,

this evening. i was on my out to pick up my girlfriend from work and there was a blizzard happening. i was driving very slowly at about 5 mph and a strange blue light appeared right over my car. i could not explain this light by anything other than a light-blue lightning bolt. it flashed above me and in around my car for about 8 seconds. there was no sound at all. the flashing was very chaotic. i instantly thought that there was something falling out of the sky and was headed directly at me. i stopped the car and actually prepared for an impact of what i quickly thought was either lightning or a crashing plane's light. i thought the latter because i live very close to an airport. as suddenly as the light appeared it had disappeared. i was fortunate enough to have a car about a tenth of a mile facing my direction at the time this happened. i drove up to the street and got out of my car to ask the other driver if he saw anything. the man in the other car said that a saw a very bright flashing light above my car. i asked if he saw the source and he said no. i asked if it was a plane and he said it couldn't have been because it was too low. i also asked if the light appeared as a beam coming down and he said that he just couldn't  describe it. this really frustrated me because of his distance would have given him a much better perspective of the event. it was difficult for him to truly describe the source of the light because of the poor visibility through the blowing snow. he also seemed confused and freaked out by the event and didn't seem willing to continue the conversation. he did ask me jokingly if i had though it was a dream i was having. i simply said yes. he said that i shouldn't worry because he saw it too. i walked away from him saying \"[cms/tg/pd]\" over and over again. i was freaked out! the light seemed electric. i cant really describe it any other way. it was as if there was a ball of blue electricity right above my car. the event happened at [cms/tg/pid]. if you are to google map this address the red pointer will fall on the exact place where the event took

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I witnessed three orb-like objects in the sky during july over santa rosa, california.\r\n\r\nas i was walking downtown that evening, sometime between 7:45 and 8:15 on what i believe was july 8th, i looked up into the sky, as it was a rather clear evening. i was located between brookwood and e street in a small one block residential strip before the downtown area, headed west. i was struck immediately by the color of three spherical lights traveling in a triangular formation in the sky headed east. the lights were of a luminous orange-red color and seemed to be flickering, as from the inside, with a yellowish tinge. it is best described as a flicker, as the lights did not blink; there was absolutely no blinking involved. primarily i likened the lights/orbs to red balloons with a candle in the center.\r\n\r\nupon seeing the lights, i froze to observe them, as they continued to fly in formation to the east. before passing over me, i was surprised as the two rear lights, which essentially formed the \"base\" of the isosceles triangle formation, peeled off showing independent movement not only from the leading object of the formation, but also from one another in the process, and they began heading toward the north. i continued to focus on the two northern bound lights as they continued in that direction and seemed to ascend until completely out of sight. it was then, that i turned my attention back to the other orb/light, as it continued eastward bound. by this time, it had passed over my position, and i had turned my body toward the east in order to observe it. it continued east, made a slight deviation toward the north, and it too ascended into the sky until out of view.\r\n\r\nthis event lasted 40 seconds at the most. it was absolutely silent all of the while.\r\n\r\nthe orbs were extremely luminous and they were very visible in the night sky. they appeared as striking as jupiter (this season) in the night sky in contrast with the other celestial objects. the orbs had a depth-like quality to them, which is why i use the word luminous.\r\n\r\nthere are many reasons why the lights cannot be explained. i am extremely used to helicopters in the area, as memorial hospital, which was less than a 1/4 of a mile to the east of the event, is where the life-alert helicopters fly patients in. i do not live far from the hospital, and so i am familiar with what they look like in the night sky, what they sound like, and how low they are in altitude as they are landing at the hospital. they were not helicopters.\r\n\r\nin addition, i am also familiar with leer jets and other small planes that are seen over santa rosa's skies, although not often. i was able to see that the orbs were not on aircraft, but were airborne themselves, and they did not appear to behave like or look like anything i have ever seen before or since.\r\n\r\ni was armed with an unsophisticated cellphone camera, but i did not take a picture, as i was entranced by the lights themselves, fearful that if i looked away they'd be gone, and i also knew from previous experience that when taking a night picture with my phone of the sky, that streetlights wash out the image.\r\n\r\nafter the event, i phoned home and spoke with my mother to inform her of what i had just seen. i explained to her the odd qualities of the flicker as opposed to any constant or blinking light source. i since have done a bit of research of the orbs, and i am confident as to what i saw was an unidentified flying object.\r\n\r\ni feel that it is important that i report this event to allow it to be logged and correlate with other possible events that may have or might be occurring in the area.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional
