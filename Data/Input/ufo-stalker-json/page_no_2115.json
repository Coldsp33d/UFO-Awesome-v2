weeks i pointed out this light in the sky to friends and co-workers ...Some said it was the iss,or satellite. i didn't think it was,it wasn't like any star or satellite i have ever seen, it just seemed real close to the earth like it was in the atmosphere not in orbit, over a few days it seemed to get closer to the earth or to my posision so i decided to see if i could get a zoom shot of it, i took 11 pics 7 of them are out of focus or blurred from shaking but still have some value, 4 of them are clear showing the object and the moon, i took the pics facing west toward vancover from mission bc on a upward angle of about40-50 deg. it stayed in the nite sky for about three weeks until i looked up one nite and it was gone ,to the naked eye it just looked like a very bright white lite with a faint pulse to it , it wasn't till about 6 months later i uploaded the pics from the camera to my computer and had a look at them [ hadn't looked at them due to my fathers death in early dec. that year] when i noticed it had a \"saturn\" like shape to it. then it wasn't till i seen some similar pics on utube i went back to my pics and compared them to ones on utube, it looks exactly like the one from  apollo 16 \"we have a boggy at 10 o'clock\" video i was shocked at the similarities which led me to doing this report, my only goal with this report is to share what i seen and get a answer as to what it was ? thanks for taking a look at them and if you would like the out of focus ones i gladly send u them if you request them and if you know what it was i would love to know?","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

scared.  i ran to his bedroom to look out the window and was completely floored by what i saw.  clear as a bell, without any doubt whatsoever, a large diamond shapped object was slowly cruising no more that 100 meters above the ground and about 100 meters out.  it was glowing very brightly and changing colors (blue, red, green and white).  as it moved from our feild of vision i ran out the back door to follow it and was even more amazed when i got there.  i could see details such as panels and that it had a kind of thick antenna on the top of it.  i had the presence of mind to try and capture it on video.  i grabbed my digital camera and did my best.  i have a couple of minutes of footage but it does not do it justice as since there is no zoom it is not detailed.  it appears on film as a small glowing object that can easily be seen changing colors.  if someone has image enhacing capabilities it will be very interesting.\r\n\r\nnote: my wife has never been even slightly

southbound on rt. 91 and was nearing wells river, vt when i saw a line of lights in the sky. they were drifting slowly from east to west and remained in a straight horizontal line. now let me make this clear, i've been researching ufo's my whole life, and i've seen some strange things, but this was really weird. the lights were clearly there, they could be nothing else (no lights reflected into the sky, and so on). i continued going through the list of possibly causes and not finding anything, and meanwhile the lights were drifting slowly. every ten seconds or so, a new light would appear on the west end of the line, and a light at the east end of the line would disappear completely. then i came to a conclusion, and i believe to it be correct.\r\n\r\ni think that that these lights (and possibly the others witnessed in the same area of vermont) were nothing more than military flares shot from an aircraft (a la pheonix lights except they didn't last that long). they did indeed appear, just as the witness in case 20894 says, to be drifting and a new one would appear on one end of the line and at the other end one would disappear. they drifted slowly, presumably on the wind. why the military was dropping flares, i couldn't say. \r\n\r\nthank you for your time, and consideration.

(this is an estimate only), but along it���������s path, it jumped left, then right, then up and then down, headed down, then up and kind of jumped all around. what really helped me at that point was there were two other aircraft (seemed to be interested in this craft, possibly following i don���������t know for sure), they were comparatively very steady, the lights all were where they should be, not jumping around, and the trajectory was a normal aircraft with nothing remarkable in any way. when i compared them, (now behind this vehicle by a few miles but seemed to be closing in slightly), this thing was obviously all over the place. then i got a little better look at it, and what i was able to make out, was that the colored lights were following a triangle shape. the shape was dark black, even more so than the background sky, the lights were in a triangle shape, meaning it appeared they followed the trim of the aircraft, and one bright white light underneath. comparatively to the other two normal aircraft, it had to be a few hundred feet wide easily, and that is very conservative. even the strobing colored lights were 10 times as bright as the other two aircraft in the same trajectory. again, following the trees, the electrical lines, the two rear aircraft were very steady, but the aircraft out front, was very large and jumping all around while the other two were as steady as any other aircraft you watch fly across the sky. so, what do i believe it was, i truly don���������t know, but, in the short time i had to watch, and the fact, it covered it���������s distance to out of sight, from the moment i first saw it, was about 1 to 1.5 minutes. but it was a few minutes i won���������t soon forget.\r\n\r\nby the way, my partner [b] and i would still like to become investigators. we were also trained through fema, and the red cross. i am also a tv producer, once in a while, but this has nothing to do with that. in fact, i prefer to keep it separate. however, in the field, investigating, it would be a very useful tool. \t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[cms/tg/pid]\r\n\r\n\r\n .

looked up i saw what looked like a neat looking constellation in the shape of a tryangle. just as i was about to go back inside one of the \"stars\" started to move, it appeared to me that it was coming closer to earth instead of moving left or right. i wanted to see where it would end up going, so i waited a little bit longer. it suddenly started to move the side where the clouded where, and i was thinking  great now i can't even see it. again, right when i started to head back once again the \"star\" came out of the clouds and was idle... at this point i thought i was just seeing things. right then the other two \"stars\" shot the other way going away from the first \"star\" that moved. needless to say my mouth dropped. the first \"star\" then went backwards threw the clouds and then shot out to the other two who then spilt up and started going in and out of clouds, almost in a playful like way. i watched for a good 1.5 hours and they just kept moving back and forth. at one point the first \"star\" almost looked like it was going to hit one of the other ones but didn't then all three just disappear. \r\n\r\nsorry i used to \"star\" as a way to describe it but that is what they

i paid sixty dollars for it. when i started the film, video, i saw what was filmed at the islands of of ventura about forty miles out, where there was this ufo flying at slow speed over them. it was taken by a fisherman, who was out there at there time. there was this one time air force leutenant, who used to see them when flying in aircraft for the air force. they used to film them. one such film was a number of ufo's on the ice, while flying over alaska. i was also interviewed from somebody from the airforce, who told me t6hat he believed what i saw was a real ufo. everytime something was on tv about ufo's i would video tape it, or if i saw a bood on them, i would buy it. i know what i saw, and it was real. i'll even take a polygraph if needed to let people know it was real. yes, ufo's exist!!!

fifth generation monterey family.  i've always questioned everything my entire life.  i always wanted a way to know what was going on with ufos, rosewll, the moon landing, all the wars on the planet, and all the unresolved questions such as ufo sightings, and \"are we alone\".\r\n\r\nthe government lies to us about everything.  i can give you a concept to help prove this statement.  \r\n\r\n\"if you can see ufos with third generation night vision goggles, and you can, then everything else is a lie.\"  simply question everything from the standpoint that \"what you know - ain't so.\"  ...Now, all you need to do is  look through the night vison goggles and see for yourself.\r\n\r\nit was the saturday before october 31st 2007.  ed grimsley came to monterey to show me night viewing with third generation night vision goggles.  shortly after 8pm we went outside and began checking out the sky with the night vision goggles.  after seeing birds, planes, moths, trees, leaves, and getting use to viewing, four fly overs took place in about 10 to 15 minutes.  there were three groups of two and one group of four.  as they flew they remained in perfect formation distance from one another in close proximatry as though they were in perfect unison with one another.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw were craft that resembled a folded 8 1/2 by 11 piece of paper into a delta paper airplane glider.  there was a tail section similar to how you would make the tail on the paper glider just like on an airplane tail.\r\n\r\nthe craft were low enough to make out their description.  there were wispy cload formations, but mainly clear sky.  it appeared that the craft were visibly under 10,000 feet.  we have a 1,000 foot mountain near by. \r\n\r\nthe craft appeared to be enveloped in a wave bubble as there was a distortion field around the craft resembling heat rising.  the craft were angled slightly pitched nose down like riding on the crest of a wave.\r\n\r\nthe craft crossed the sky from one horizon to the other in about 6 seconds. they made about 4 to 6 sharp angular cuts in straight line formation.  that is to say they traveled in a straight line and abruptly made an angular cut of perhaps 30 degrees then straight on the new trajectory until the next cut.  first cutting one way then back the other way as they crossed the horizon in about 6 seconds.  i computed their speed at roughly 40,000 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nthe best term to decribe the experience is \"surrealistic\".  no noise.  ed grimsley was with me and he saw the craft at the same sighting with me.\r\n\r\nthat evening i stayed up all night.  i did not see anything more dramatic or low.  i did see at least ten addition high flying (100-200 miles) which often did make course changes.  that night ed saw a spherical craft low over housing area near us.  it was the size of a one bedroom house.  i did not see this craft.  but ed seamed very shocked when he saw it. it abruptly shot off.\r\n\r\ned grimsley and i have gone night viewing about 20 times together.  each time people see lights and or craft.  it is my belief from what i have seen myself, and my conversations with hundreds of other people, that the skys are full of craft and the government simply lies about it.  to what end i don't know.  but it has caused me to question things even more than before.  ed and i have shown over 500 people in the monterey area that you can see the craft with third generation night vision goggles.  ed has been doing this since 1996 with the night vision equipment and i imagine has given thousands of people the oppertunity to view.  for more information feel free to contact me directly:\r\n\r\n\r\nbob oliver 831 383-2676  boboliver9@gmail.Com  www.Edgrimsley.Com\r\ni do the radio show \"the bob oliver show, the quantum leap\"\r\nwww.Krxa540.Com mon8pm sat9pm west oast time.  888 579-2540 live\r\n\r\n\r\ni have had four other sightings with the naked eye, maybe more.  but, for anyone interested, you definately can see the craft with third generation night vison goggles, every clear night. best viewing time is just after dusk. here is how it works:\r\n\r\n1.  our eyes do not operated well.  we see only a limited spectrum of light. therefore everything above and below that spectrum of light is essentially invisible to us.  \r\n2.  during the day when it is bright, we squint because our eyes can't handle all the light.  3.  in fact it is so bright we cannot see the stars during the day. 4.   at night our eyes aren't getting enough light it is hard for us to see thngs.  5.  using night vison allows the electronic equipment to sense much more frequencies of light and image those frequencies into a spectrum we can see as a solid colored visible object.  6.  so what was invisible is now visible.  7.  also illuminated objects stand out brighter in the night vision field, so there are objects we can see with the naked eye at night that are then enhanced with the night vison goggles.\r\n\r\nother observations include experiences which lead me to believe these craft and or occupants communicate with us intelligently.  when they are visually sighted, often people including myself feel a connection and and understanding that there is an awareness of being viewed.  even at extreme distances.  figure that one out and let me know!\r\n\r\ncall me if you want more information. bob oliver

9:30 pm. sky was completely clear, moon was 3/4 full and there was very little unnatural light in this area, which made it a particularly good spot for sky watching as opposed to my home in the city. after spotting a very bright star through my binocs, i brought them down from my face to view the star/planet with my naked eye when i see (2) black \"boomerang\" or \"chevron like\" crafts (the size of 2 stealth bomber jets each) flying extremely low, side by side (but 1 was slightly behind the other in formation).They each had 1 very dim, round, greenish/yellow light on each wing tip (so 2 total lights per craft that blended in with the stars in the night sky so well). they were moving almost as if they were gliding through the sky, but at extreme speed. so fast in fact, that before i could bring my binoculars up to my face to see better details, they had zipped over our house and over the neighborhood, out of sight! these 2 objects were completely silent and produced zero vibration, which was shocking due to how low they were flying. had i not been looking up in the sky at that very moment and seen them, i would've had no idea they were even there. that's how \"stealth\" these objects were! they were all black in color and didn't have a body or passenger/pilot cabin area at all (almost drone like). i described these objects as \"boomerang\", or \"chevron like\", but in reality they were a unique shape that i had not seen before, but those words would describe these crafts best. i have seen many planes fly over my home and my families over the years and living close to west point, ny and growing up here in pa by the army war barracks, also visiting military air bases all over the country to visit friends in the past, but i've never seen anything like this! the basic physics of these crafts did not fit in with our current technology (even \"secret ops\" that have been leaked to the public)just because of the height in which they were flying (very low) and their size, to cause no sound or vibration whatsoever was the most amazing thing about the whole sighting! you expect to hear or feel something (even a breeze??) when 2 objects the size of 2 stealth bombers each, fly over the roof of your house that low! it's a mystery! this was my first real sighting where i was able to see the crafts up close and personal to give a description. i went outside several more times over the night, through 5am and never saw anything else like what i had seen earlier. thanks:)","distance":"101-500

tree in the photo. i took two pictures within one half second from each other of the sky which contained the top of a tree and some clouds in the back ground.  the photos were taken with a canon xs dslr at an f-stop of 5.6, using 70-300mm zoom lens.  weather conditions were typical of a south texas afternoon in july.  \r\n\r\ni was taking random test shots of the area to include the nice looking

that it looks saucer shape but could not identify the object.  the reason i beleive it is strange is because the object does not appear in the first photo, which was taken about half a second before the second photo.  keep in mind that it took me about four months to find it as i did not realize what i had captured until the day i was tranferring photos to my hard drive.\r\n\r\nthe loaction is

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My partner and i were heading out for dinner around 6:00pm. it was quite dark, and the sky was crystal clear. the milky way was quite bright above us. as we walked to my car, we both were startled to see three strange lights low on the horizon, just above the tree line (which was about 40 feet from us), in the southwestern sky. \r\n\r\nthe lights were close together, all the same size, and heading away from us at about a 45 degree angle. we probably would have dismissed it as a plane if we hadn't been struck by how odd they looked. they were large yellow/orange lights (not the usual white), fixed in a row, looking like they were part of one craft, but there were no flashing lights. nor did it have either red or green lights of any kind (that we saw, at least). when we first saw the lights, i would estimate that - holding a ruler at arms length - the lights measured (end to end) a bit more than a 1/4\".\r\n\r\ni had time (and the presence of mind) to run back into the house and grab my binoculars, which gave us a good look at it. it didn't look like it was any higher than many of the \"local\" traffic (i'm sorry, i'm not a pilot, so i have no reference as to how low our local traffic flies - but think prop plane flying between two small airports 50 miles away - like that.) but the lights were too large and far apart to be a small plane. \r\n\r\nthe other odd thing about it was that it was traveling rather slow... this may be because it was flying away from us, but the rate at which the object \"shrank\" as it moved away didn't seem to be very fast (when compared to how local traffic at that height and trajectory recede). \r\n\r\nso far as sound, hard to tell. there were a couple of other aircraft in the sky at thetime, one of which was making a typical jet noise, plus we have three huge windmills on the ridge to the south of us (half a mile away) that tends to give a low whoosh-whoosh sound. but, it didn't \"seem\" to be making any noise from where we stood.\r\n\r\nwith in a minute or two the object's trajectory took it behind the trees and ridge. we spent most of our dinner going over what we saw. i was struck by how similar the object looked to the one that was reported on 11/30, down along route 295. my educated guess would be that the object we saw was within visual range of the coast line (most flights traveling a north/south trajectory love to use the coastline as their \"highway\"), and was moving along the same line (southwesterly direction) as the sighting on 11/30. \r\n\r\na little background on location: we have a fair amount of low level air traffic over our property, considering we live in the maine woods. traffic from bangor international airport, as well as the national guard facility there, come right over us as they head for the coast line. we also get small jets and prop planes going back and forth from augusta, bangor, etc to the coast (i.E little airports in belfast and islesboro). we also get a lot of high altitude traffic from what i am guessing is ottawa, montreal and quebec, canada, heading out over the atlantic. plus, i grew up in nyc, so... in short... i know what a plane looks like.\r\n\r\ni am an artist, so my visual memory is pretty darn good. plus, i have a bs in environmental sciences, so i also have an analytical, science-trained, questioning mind. i try not to jump to conclusions, especially around such a difficult subject like ufos. while i am convinced that there are strange things afoot that truly can't be from around here, i believe i've never seen a \"real\" ufo (i have, however, seen a fair number of \"unusual\" air craft over the years).  would i call this a ufo? well, it was definitely unidentifiable by myself and my partner, and it was a flying object. but that's as far as i'm willing to go.","distance":"Over One
