Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on my way home with my mum (she was driving) from st andrews on friday 27th of november 2009, it was a very clear night. when we were outside windygates heading along the main road to kirkcaldy(a915)at about 7:10 i noticed a very bright light(south east) very low on the horizon in the direction we were heading. i quickly put on my glasses to have a closer look. at first i thought it was the top of a town���s christmas tree due to its position and height but as we were approaching the roundabout we gained higher ground and i could see 2 bright lights in the distance. because of this new vantage point i concluded it was no longer the top of a christmas tree nor was it a star, the only star i could see was very high up just to the left of the moon which i believe to be the north star. as we passed the roundabout and carried onto kirkcaldy i could make out a 3rd light. i noticed that the 3 lights were all different colours and arranged in a triangle, i got very excited and took a few pictures but none of them worked, camera phones are terrible. the object on the left, which was the tip of the triangle in my opinion was a yellow light, the 1 on the bottom right was an orange reddish light and the 1 on the top right was a bright white light. \r\n\r\nnone of them pulsed nor did it occur to me this was anything but a squadron of helicopters, even though i did find the colours odd. it wasn���t till i got my phone out to take a picture on my camera that i noticed something strange. i rolled down the window so there wouldn���t be a reflection when i took a photo and there was no noise. if these were helicopters i expected to hear them, then i realised that these 3 lights actually might be connected by a structure, as i started to make out 3 sides connecting the 3 lights like a triangle. it then appeared to turn clockwise. \r\n\r\nmy mum and i were so intrigued by this that we pulled into wells green which we had just approached. turns out we weren���t the only ones that found these lights odd as other cars started pulling into the driving ranges car park as well. i took my mums camera out her back, got out the car and headed down the wee road to get a better look. i was about midway down with the driving range exactly on my right and could quite clearly see the 3 lights just above the tree line. i tried to take pictures of the object but the flood lights from the range made it very difficult to get a picture of lights in the distance and i still couldn���t hear anything. so i eventually gave up and got back in the car. we drove on still heading to kirkcaldy. i could still see the 3 lights still emitting the same colours then suddenly the two lights on the right broke off and moved off to the right of my view and disappeared in the distance. i managed to keep an eye one the light left behind.\r\n\r\nafter about 5 minutes of it being left alone and stationary it started to change colour, it didn���t pulsate, it seemed to fade out of its yellow tinge and fade into green and then red in a seamless way, when it got back to yellow that���s when i knew this was no aircraft that was currently known to me and i had researched many classified and secret craft from the b2 to the supposed aurora craft.\r\n\r\nas i stared out the rear passenger side window the object flew with immense speed towards where the other 2 had gone. my head literally turned in about 3 seconds as i followed the object and which also disappeared into the distance. now we were travelling at about 60 miles per hour and this object seemed very, very far away so for it to then pull of at the speed it did and stay at the same distance from us, overtaking us and disappearing into the distance meant this object would have to be going almost supersonic speed something like mach 6 which i know no human could survive nor do we have any aircraft that can go that fast to my knowledge.\r\n\r\ni thought that that had been the end of it as we approached kirkcaldy but then i could see the 3 lights had met up and were again in triangle formation the exact way they had been before but now further away in the distance from our location. my mum asked me if i wanted to go down to kirkcaldy promenade/esplanade to take a better look as we drove along dunkier rd, i said yes so we did. we turned off at the roundabout at asda and headed down overton rd to the prom. during this time i could not see the objects however when we arrived and stopped at the truck parking end of the prom i could see the 3 objects over the water (north east), they were slightly higher than before and had split up. yet again the yellow 1 was all by its self but the other 2 had seemed to almost join together side by side and were glowing red and white. they were moving off to the right as i stared out at them, i had to turn to watch them move over land, they were fairly close or at least close enough that i should have been able to hear an engine or rotor, but it was silent. i quickly turned my attention back to the yellow one which by this time had started moving back towards the way it came. i attempted to take pictures but alas my mothers camera is not very good and i got the feeling that even though these lights were bright they were too far away to be picked up so i gave up on trying to snap shots and just focused on visually remembering the events.\r\n\r\ni turned to see how the other two on the right were doing and they had vanished. i decided to focus all my attention on the yellow one. it was moving at a steady pace keeping its altitude and suddenly as it moved through the clear black sky 2 stars just appeared out of nowhere 1 over the other and the object passed in-between them and carried on its course. it eventually disappeared in the direction it had came but the 2 stars remained. i ran back to the car, my mum had been on the phone with my dad to inform him of our situation and what we were doing, that was at about 7:30. we left about 7:35.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

phoenix, az back to our hometown of seattle, wa.  we left phoenix around 1pm in the afternoon and arrived in las vegas around 6:30pm and continued to head north via highway 93.  we were about 50-75 miles south of ely and it was around 11pm or so on december 2nd.  both at how middle of nowhere we really were as there were absolutely no lights from buildings and only saw a passing car every twenty to thirty minutes or so.  i remember we were just kind of lightly talking about how much we looked forward to getting to seattle and how few stars we actually could see that particular night because of the full moon that was in the sky that night.  it was during that conversation that we noticed to the ne of us over above the mountain range to the east of us we saw a very bright redish white light that just appeared above the mountain range.  we both saw it and it took a few seconds to register in my head that what we were seeing was not something normal.  i asked her if she saw the light and she responded \"what the hell is that.\"  then the light literally disappeared and immediately reappeared to the right of where it originally was and was visible for a few seconds and then vanished and reappeared a third time in a spot higher above where it was the first two times then disappeared after only being visible for a few seconds.  we both had the exact same reaction, both of our bodies were completely covered in goosebumps and the hairs on the back of our necks were sticking up.  it was probably no more than 10 miles away and it was very obvious that what we saw was either human technology that is far beyond anything we are aware is out there, or something that truly cannot be explained.  it honestly scared the hell out of both of us and we called our parents and they googled what we saw and realized we are not the only ones with a very similar story.  i have never been someone that took anyone's claims of seeing a ufo or anything like that seriously, pretty much always thought they were lying or insane, but after experiencing this and having someone in the car with me seeing it with me has completely changed my attitude on what might be out there.  truly amazing experience i won't forget.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20870,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.2497993,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12042009-0004","longitude":-114.8869996,"occurred":1259740800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nevada","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\nas soon as i had made a left turn onto one of the back roads heading home from work, i immediately noticed two bright lights hovering over my neighborhood in the distance.  it was approximately 1:30 a.M. on november 23, 2009.  the reason these lights caught my attention is because after living in this area for over 30 years i know every shadow, every light, which lights are street lights, and which lights belong to the homes there.  i am very much aware of my surroundings, and i know what belongs and what doesn't.  these lights didn't belong.  \r\n\r\nas soon as i noticed these lights, they started moving across toward the east toward the road i was on.  the lights originally started out south west of me.  they were just below the tree line of a wooded ridge situated ahead.  that ridge is approximately 80 to 100 ft. high so this thing was fairly low.  when these lights were directly up ahead of me, i remember thinking this can't be a ufo, and with that thought, all of a sudden a craft appeared above me as if to show me that they were there.  the entire bottom of the thing was lit up, and i could see the original set of lights on the craft, but i don't remember seeing these lights fly toward me.  the nose of the craft was pointed north.  as i stared up at this thing through my windshield in disbelief, i had a feeling that i had seen it before but couldn't remember when or where.   \r\n\r\nas it hovered at just above tree top level above me, i continued driving although i did slow down a bit.  i was dividing my attention between the craft and the road, the whole time trying to figure out what it was.  i remember thinking that the shape reminded me of one of our stealth fighter planes, but it could not have been.  first, why would it be flying in our neighborhood that low, and second, i don't think it would have been that well lit up.  i don't remember hearing any sound, and as i made my way to the first street on the right, i noticed that this craft was staying with me.  it was as if it were watching me.  after making my turn, i had to lean forward to get a good view of the craft and noticed that it seemed to be higher up in the sky than before, and it's nose was pointed east.  i didn't see it change direction as i had to divide my attention between this craft and my driving.   a few seconds later the craft disappeared.  i didn't see it leave, and i couldn't see any sign of it in the sky.  no lights.  nothing.\r\n\r\ni have searched the internet trying to find something that would at least come close to matching what i saw.  the closest thing i can find is the stealth fighter f-117 nighthawk,  but the similarities are in shape only with still a few differences.  it was triangular, and the back end was curved inward, and i don't remember seeing anything that would indicate tail wings.  i was looking up at it so all i saw was the bottom of the craft.  the two lights i saw originally were situated toward the front end of the craft and were inside a dark oval shape that looked like it was recessed.  there were other details like lines and how they were placed is a little fuzzy in my memory, and for the exception of those lines and that oval shape, the entire bottom was brightly lit. \r\n\r\ni can't recall our military having anything that can hover like that, or disappear the way this thing did, and i would think that it would have been too dangerous for any aircraft to be flying in as low as this one did. \r\n\r\ni have not reported this to the police.  i didn't think they would believe me, but i have told my co-workers and family members.  one of my co-workers told me that she has a neighbor she teases a lot because she claims she sees ufos in this area almost on a daily basis around 5:00 a.M.   so, it seems that our area might possibly be a hot bed for ufo activity, and i've never noticed it

 i couldn't see it anywhere...The moon was still there...A cloud didn't come in front of the space where it was located.  it just disappeared.  i have no idea what it was and i have a whole new appreciation for all those nutters out there with their video recorders trying to focus in on these things...These things are so high up in the air you would have to have a good camera (like nasa quality) to focus in on it and be able to make it out.  i always thought that they didn't focus in on it to really make it out because then you would be able to tell what it is...Like a balloon.. (and maybe that is still true for some) but in this case, you would have to have something significantly powerful that could focus in on it.  like you would be trying to focus in on a plane that high up and be able to show you some specifics (like how many windows are on it that far up)...So you can see how hard this would be.  unfortunately, as this is my first experience it took me a minute to finally think about pulling over and doing a poor attempt at getting a picture with my cell phone.  so, now photos or anything.  but i am really considering bringing my recorder even though i probably won't be able to get much if it's that far up again.  for sure, this was not a plane or a weather balloon or any of that nonsense.  anyway, my first ufo sighting (i'm 33 and somewhat of a skeptic).  hoping for more now...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20861,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0904963,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08052011-0068","longitude":-92.4363711,"occurred":1259853180000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1312587798000,"summary":"Luminous white, stationary balloon shaped object at least 15,000 miles up that just disappeared into thin air on a clear early morning sky","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":610,"locationName":"Conway, Arkansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:163158"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Colonial Heights","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on front porch my house on feb.18,2006 at 8:10 pm,i saw a triangle ship across street from me appox.40-45 ft. above ground,size 100 ft.Color black,no windows or opening,speed very slow 15-20 mph-so low only in sight 1-2 min.-sound a low pitch hum.Lights on bottom did not count,8-10 appox.-size were about size of old seal beam car head-light,color amber. the base of triangle in front,the point in rear.Wasso close i could have hit with a sling shot.Direction 60 degree mag.-course would have taken ..Ship over a military base,fort lee ,virginia.What did i think ?Over the years i have seen many lights in the night sky,and were not aircraft ,not of this world. i wrote this down,notes on feb.18,2006   waverly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\\@","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20860,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.244039,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12032009-0017","longitude":-77.4102607,"occurred":1140322200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1259892293000,"summary":"Size 100 ft. x8-10 ft.,speed 15mph, low pitch hum sound, height 40 ft.","tags":["sound"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1383,"locationName":"Colonial Heights, Virginia","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:163159"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2116}
