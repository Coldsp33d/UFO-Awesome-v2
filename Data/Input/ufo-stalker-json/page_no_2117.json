by a mr. jerry faglie. on or about 2-3 pm on an undisclosed date in the year 1968 mr jerry faglie had a singular encounter with an unidentified person. this person entered mr. faglie's home and within the same room said one word to mr. faglie by a method described as telepathic communication. the one word which was repeated by the unknown entity several times was \"watch out.\" there was then a time loss by mr. faglie and intermittent memory loss til about 19:30 that afternoon. the unknown person did not make physical contact. there was not any physical marks to mr. faglie's body. no other lastig effects. the unknown person immediately left after inparting the one word several times. no ufo or any land or flying object was noted at the site. the entity was apparently adult size (unknown specifics) wearing a human type rimmed hat and what appeared to be a \"trench coat\". the feet were not obvious. the hands from bi-lateral arms were in the pockets of the coat. the head was visual identical to the large gray type species head with the large almond eyes. no mouth was visual. no other anatomical parts were noted at the site. mr. jerry faglie was the only contact and witness to this event. his age at the time was about 21. he denies drugs, alcohol or any other substance or situation to cause a change of reality from normal life. mr. faglie only recalls the event if reminded about \"aliens\" by the news or on television. mr. faglie is an artist and does note that he both consciously and unconciously paints to various sizes of \"aliens\" into his paintings. no purchaser of his art work has ever said anything unusual about this painted appearance. they appear both singularly and in groups in some paintings. mr. faglie at this time seems alert and oriented and not particularly disturbed by the events but rather a curiosity about them. he has reported other far distance visual events from the 1950s previously to the mufon national hq according to him. these 1950 especially 1953 events are easily confirmed by historial reports.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20856,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.4271219,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12032009-0013","longitude":-98.4883882,"occurred":-65894400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1259884145000,"summary":"In-person

loved aliens but at my 8 i forgot about them and about the subject. after this kinda ufo sight i've been very obsessed with ufo's, aliens and everything related to it, i remember everything clearly so here it is.\r\n\r\ni lived in lake buena vista, close to disney i think.\r\nit was another boring night, clear sky, warm outside, i was at the laptop, my brother and my aunt were at a local store and my mother was at my side watching tv. suddenly she receives a call from my brother, i heard him yelling at her but i didn't knew why, i noticed her nervous, she quickly standed up and ran outside the apartment.\r\n\r\n\"what's wrong?\" i asked myself, but i thought there was a fire outside or something stupid so i kept chatting.\r\n\r\na couple of minutes later i went to my bedroom to grab my ipod charger, i stopped abruptly because i had a feeling to get closer to the window and look outside, i did but didn't saw anything, except something on top of the forest at my left side.\r\n\r\n\"what the hell is that?\" i couldn't see anything since everything outside was dark, but had the feeling there was something in there and it was watching me. i got scared so i went back to the living room but it was the same thing since the balcony of the living room is facing the lake with the forest.\r\n\r\n-to make things clear, imagine a line of aparments of 3 floors each, a path with a small space of grass, then a lake and behind the lake a forest with no entrance to it.-\r\n\r\n5 to 10 minutes later or so the three of them came back, talking loud in excitement, i asked them what in the world happened.\r\n\r\n\"there was a ufo outside!\" my aunt answered.\r\n\r\n\"it was like disc-shaped, i'm not sure! but below of it had a very but very bright white light with a red light spinning, the two lights were spinning below that thing very fast, after a while it slowly moved to the north, it made odd moves like a slight up and down then we couldn't see it anymore because of the trees, it was amazing!\" my bro said very excited.\r\n\r\nhe also took a picture but it looked like a star so he deleted it.\r\n\r\nnow that i'm writing this, if the ufo was located at the north-east area and moved to the north, where i was looking was at the south, what could it have been?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20855,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.3936186,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12032009-0012","longitude":-81.5386842,"occurred":1245467400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1259880117000,"summary":"It

ufo. \r\n\r\ni was on lunch break and standing in the play ground where ther was one tree it was in the fall and there were no leaves on it. as a little kid i was just looking at the sky and this tree, when here came this cylinder shaped thing passing from the north,it was going really,really slow no sound at all it was a dull gray about 20ft across and about 200ft long, it was rounded a bit on the front and flat in the back about a 1/3 of the way back from the front around the circumference there were what appeared to me as good sized rivits [remmber i was only 12 and thats all i could relate them to]. this thing was only like 400ft in the air as it passed right over my head!. i watched it going south and little bit to the east until it came to some small hills and disapeared. this was in de norte colorado which is in the san luis valley.\r\n\r\nhere is my 2nd siteing: my mom and i were going through north new mexico going east to texas,there again it was in 1952 but this was in the summer and we were on a long straight stretch of 2 lane highway and it being hot out there were these heat ripples comeing up from the highway, we were in a 1939 plymouth sedan and me being so little i was sitting way forward in the seat holding on to the dash, when out of these heat ripples there was what looked like a big dark line that was a little wider than the highway comeing straight at us it was really going fast and just before it hit us head on! it shot straight up, my mom hit the brakes hard and she pulled off of the road we sat there for a long bit of time before she could drive again. our car had what they called a viser over the top part of the windshield and with me up to the dash i could look up through the gap between the car and the viser. and what i saw was a disk [now i know it was a flying saucer] shooting straight up it was dull gray and the bottom or under side looked just like the bottom of one of my mom's metal pie pans. there was no sound to speak of, no flashing lights, and it was as clear as clear can be, but at this time we had never ever heard of a flying saucer.\r\neverything i have told you is 100% true!\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

eastbound. i was just past azusa (the city) and it was around 6:30pm.  it was pretty dark.  \r\n\r\nat this time, i noticed out the front window of my car, off to the right, a string of lights in a semi circle (as though curved.)  the lights appeared to be a orange/yellow and i thought it was a fire on a mountain.  but i couldn't think of a mountain off to the right... as i drove i kept glancing at the lights and began to see them move.  they started to appear a connecting set of lights under the semi-circle - so that it now appeared to be an oval of blinking lights.  as though some object was banking and i could now see more (i couldn't see the object as it was so dark - i could only see the lights.)\r\n\r\nnow i was curious as it was an oval of flashing lights.  i was trying to think what it could be.  the object continued moving until it was over the freeway.\r\n\r\nat this point, it began a slow path west, along the west bound side of the freeway.  at this point i got my iphone out and began recording it.  a lot of us on the freeway were slowing down - and i had slowed down to 30 mph.  although i shot video on the iphone. it's pretty bad quality... that with the camera shake in the car, it was spotty at best.\r\n\r\ni began to realize this thing was going to pass over/near me, so i studied it until it was past me.  the lights were curved, as though attached to a curved surface and appeared to be on the bottom of this object.  i know they were curved, because the lights were in rows (like five yellow lights in a row) and i could see the individual lights in a curvature.  the lights were animated like this... imagine 5 or so lights in a column and several rows of lights.. so that column 1 turns off and column 2 comes on, column 3 turns off and column 4 turns on... etc.  so it showed an animation of lights in a direction. they were animated in the direction the object was moving.  \r\n\r\nas the object was nearly past me (so that i had to lean into my stearing wheel to see it) i noticed sometimes the lights would appear as animated blocks... so instead of a row of lights i would see a set of lights make up a block of lights - which would animate in a direction.\r\n\r\ni tried to estimate how high the object could be... it's tough in the dark, but i'd guess around 200 feet.  it was wide, and all the animated lights appeared on the bottom of whatever it was.  \r\n\r\nas to audio - i couldn't hear much as i had the radio on. i never thought about turning it off, as i was so interested in the object.\r\n\r\ni tried to ponder what this could be.  the only man made object i could think of, would be a blimp.  but what was weird was, i dont know of a blimp that has it's display on the bottom.  they usually have the display on the side.  so i discounted that idea.  \r\n\r\nregarding the attached video - it was shot on a iphone 3gs which isn't that great at night video. also it's super wide angle so everything is smaller then you normally see it.  the object appears in the bottom right in the video, and towards the end, it's almost in the center.  \r\n\r\ni honestly dont know what i saw... i'd love to know what it was.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

when i walk at night i like to look at the stares, naming constellations and thinking maybe i'll get lucky and see a ufo. i remember looking to the north/north east and saw what i initially thought was a plane. we have an aiport and i see planes coming and going all the time, for about maybe 20 seconds or so i didn't think much of it but a few things about it didn't seem quite right. most lights i see on planes have a distinctive pattern of arrangement, the way they blink and such. but this was just one blinking red light, it must have been pretty far away, because i couldn't tell if it was a strobing light or a light that just blinked off and on. at this point i still thought it could be a plane or a helicopter(we also have a coast guard airport). the light was not stationary, it was moving west from what i could tell, and very slowly.  slower than a plane and i believe slower than a helicopter would be moving.\r\n\r\ni must have watched it for about 5 minutes maybe, and from what i could tell it must have been moving rather slowly for an aircraft. if i had a ruler at arm length it would have covered a distance of more than a foot, maybe a foot and a half. as far as i could tell it didn't make any sound, but that could have been due to the distance. at about halfway through the sighting a plane i see coming and going all the time flew through my field of vision, it was closer to me than the light was so i could hear the plane. i recognized its lights pattern and the sound of its engines, so i had a reference to what a plane would look like at that moment in view while watching the other light, and there was a definite difference. the plane flew into my field of view and disappeared in under a minute, meanwhile this light is still moving at a rather slow speed. some people might say it was a flare, this was not a flare. flares don't move horizontally like this, they float down to the ground and their light flickers, they dont have a consistant blinking light. i was in a hurry so i started walking again, i couldn't have walked more than 10 feet before i truned back to look at it again and it was gone. no zoom off into the distance, just gone. it was a clear night so it couldn't have just disappeared behind some clouds, the only clouds were way off into the distance, hugging the horizon. that was the last i saw of it

out of the mouth of squaw creek canyon. i observed the craft flying out of the canyon in october, several years in a row. i observed different modes of operation in regard to the propulsion system, or energy field surrounding the craft. when it first began to ascend out of the canyon, a very dense, orange energy field surrounded the craft, obscuring the surface of the craft. when it began to descend, the energy field diminished, and the white spherical surface of the craft became visible. when it descended, as if to land, the energy field shut off entirely, and the craft became invisible. stealth? in any event, this could be a valuable clue to the workings of the propulsion system. it could further be described as a hysteresis effect from the propulsion system. i discovered a picture on the internet, which shows this effect. the first image (labeled a), is a computer generated image, which depicts the appearance of the craft when the surface is visible. image b depicts the above described effect. it looks exactly like what i observed. the image from the internet is of  spheres, which according to eye witness accounts, ascended out of the ocean. that in itself is interesting. the same type of craft i observed flying out of a canyon in montana, was also observed flying out of the ocean. very strange!  perhaps image b represents the mode of operation in the startup mode. when the system first energizes, a dense energy field is produced, then levels off.\t                                                                        \r\n\r\nsincerely, \r\n\r\ndarryl

have a degree in earth and space science. she is a geologist. behind my house is a farm and behind that is franklin county, brookville, indiana. there are three street lights and two cell phone towers. what i saw was a trapazoid of very bright lights, moving imperceptibly slow. it lasted for quite awhile. it moved from se to nw towards richmond. it would have gone most probably over brookville lake and the connersville area. at my age, i have seen many unexplainable things in the sky, including a sphere on long island, ny, where i am originally from. both were very odd and i, for one, felt compelled to watch it. it started as 5 lights and looked like the lower half of orion. it then either turned, or something else occurred, because one of the lights went out and there were four. the question is asked what made me notice it: something or someone, told me to look outside.  i had no real reaction to it, except curiosity. as i type this, i am able to turn around to see if it is back. the question of how i lost sight, is that i was busy making dinner and had to go back to what i was doing. it was there, however, all during dinner, which was about between 6 and 7 pm

the drowsy state that i was in at the time, i became extremely fearful instantly, for i didn't recognize the sound at all as being anything i've encountered before.  totally and completely unrecognizable....And not of nature.  the fear intensified very rapidly to closing in on terror. after, what i perceived to be a few minutes, i turned on my light and saw it was 4am. i laid in bed, continuing to listen and trying to come up with a logical answer to what this sound was.  eventually, i got out of bed (i had turned the light off) and slowly walked into my living room, still trying to determine the source of the noise. in the state of being still somewhat asleep and in extreme fright, a part of me felt that i was in somewhat of a trans like state of being.  i moved here and there in the dark living room randomly, continuing to try to determine the origin of this totally new and terrifying sound. i never looked out the window to see if i could see it. this is totally contrary to my nature. i seek every means to solve a problem or curiosity, so this is confusing to me, since i check out anything and everything as thoroughly as possible, even if it is idle curiosity. i also, did not go to every room, area, and window in the house to try to find an explanation for this strange noise, so this also tells me that i was not fully in my right mind, even in a semi sleep state.  i eventually went back to bed, with the humming continuing all this time, and laid there, fervently wishing and praying that this terrifying noise would stop.  eventually it did, and after waiting to see if it would return, which it didn't, i was able to fall back asleep.(time frames are merely guesses throughout the whole incident, since i feel/felt like i was primarily in a trans like state)  throughout this whole incident, i knew i wasn't dreaming; i knew that i was hearing something consciously, even tho' i knew not what. i had enough consciousness to feel like i was in a foggy state where i was not functioning as i would normally, even in just a partial sleeplike state.  hard to explain. it was also unusual that when i got up for the day finally, it was enough later than i normally do, which was quite outa character for me as well.  the rest of the day i still felt surrounded by fear, altho' it had lessened somewhat.  i felt like this incident haunted me the rest of the day, in a way i've never experienced before, and when it came dark and then time for bed, i was scared to pieces of the darkness, quietness, and aloneness (also completely out of character).  i was terrified to go to bed.  \r\n\r\nwhen i face heavier obstacles in life, it helps for me to vent and share with another what i'm going through, so i talked with my 90 year old neighbor this morning, who is a kinda mom to me now, and told her my story.  she mentioned, in the early stage of our talk, that the previous night (nov. 30, between 8:30 and 9:30pm-ish) she looked out of her front window on 2 different occasions, to see if i had come home, from being outa town all day.  the first time she looked, she noticed a red, glowing, radiant ball, hovering in the alley behind our house and got scared, for she thought something was on fire.  she eventually passed it off as a red light in the garage of the house directly behind us, with the door left open. upon the second time she looked out of her window towards our place, the red glowing ball was still there in the same spot. after observing it again, she concluded that it did not act like fire and dismissed that notion. she couldn't define it, but felt it to be an unknown mystery but with some kind of unexplainable importance. \r\n\r\nthis event, now coupled with another rather unexplainable incident that occured when i was age ten, has greatly heightened my desire to search for more concrete answers to these two great mysteries in my life. my hope is that your organization may help to become a guide.\r\n\r\nthank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":20838,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.2218333,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12022009-0004","longitude":-112.6288867,"occurred":1259668800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Montana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1259802827000,"summary":"Woke

only visible twice and the object moved between the first time the lights were on and the second. this object had no running lights on whatsoever, once it was not lit up we did not see it again. now on the very next night we were going to binks store on u hwy. the same place we were headed the first night, this time we saw the same lights when we pulled onto hwy 42 from hawken cemetery road where we live. the lights were the same, they would appear from nowhere and stay on for 5 to 7 seconds and go out with no running lights at all. this was on 12-1-09 at 6:50 pm cst. we got down the road about 3 minutes later in nearly the same place we saw them on the first night and saw them again. this time we saw two objects with the same light configuration. the lights would stay lit for 5 to 7 seconds again and just go out. these lights or burners were fairly bright but not so bright as to light up the sky. i do live about 40 miles from ft. lenard wood but i have never seen lights that looked anything like this before and i am 52 years old. one more thing when we got to the store that was only about a mile from where we saw this object, i asked two people that i know if they saw anything when they were coming down the road and they saw the same lights. they were coming from the other direction on u hwy. on the second night we saw them we pulled into the store parking lot and there were 3 people in the parking lot, i asked if they saw anything, one guy answered no but the people he was talking to said hey we saw em and the description was the same as what we saw both

and son's girlfriend were having a lengthy discussion running into the wee hours.  at approximately 2:30 am early wednesday morning (possibly tuesday last--i myself am sketchy on this because i work

bright light through our back door at the kitchen.  my next door neighbors reported immediately afterward as they compared notes on the incident with my family members that their storage shed in their back yard was levitated at least four inches off the ground.  two days later, the neighbor from three doors down at our apartment complex happened to be visiting when mention was made of the incident casually, and he reacted strongly on the spot, apparently surprised that someone else had had an encounter.\r\n\r\ni can attest to the credibility of the people involved.  i feel their story has some

sky across the street above a housing development. i just automatically looked up directly at it just on the other side of the trees. it was a gigantic ball of yellow/orange light! my very first thought was \"is that the moon? what is it doing in the northwest? why is it so huge?\" i stood there staring and straining to see for about 2 or 3 minutes trying to find markings and craters. i knew it couldn't be the moon, but i looked for craters anyway. there was none, none at all. then it hit me and i thought to myself \"wait a minute, i saw the moon earlier and it's path goes over the back of the building! the moon wasn't full, it still had a slice missing, and it was white, not orange!\" i became very excited and happy! i greeted the craft and asked if it would come over here so i may see them and meet them. perceptually from my point of view, this light was very large and bright. as a means of comparison this light was about 4 to 5 times the size of the sun perceptually. the altitude was maybe about 500 to 600 feet up at most and it was silent. the distance from me was less than 1/4 of a mile. after about 10 minutes it started to very slowly drift away towards the northwest. when the craft's light itself was completely out of view, after watching it for at least 15 to 20 minutes, i could still see it lighting up the sky for at least a further 5 minutes. when it completely left towards the northwest all the lights in the area blinked off for less than a second. this includes the street lamps, the lights at work, and the lights in the houses across the street. i could only assume the reason for this is that the electrogravitic propulsion system kicked in and pulsed an electromagnetic field that disrupted the area.\r\n\r\nthis light was so big and bright that i could not see the craft itself. while the light was still in full view, i called a co-worker that was to come in and relieve me. i told him to \"get here as quickly as possible because there is an extraterrestrial craft across the street! it is huge, orange, it is lighting up the sky, and it is gorgeous!!��� this was at 5:58am. about 5 to 10 minutes after that phone call it was completely gone.\r\n\r\nthe whole event was mesmerizing. it always is no matter how many times i see a craft. every time i see a craft i'm always happy. sometimes i'm excited and some times i'm peaceful and calm. i am never afraid. my heart is still fluttering from it even now. still now i can think of little else than that craft. who was it? what were they doing? were they dropping some one off? where are they from and where are they going? i very much wanted to see and meet the people inside the craft.\r\n\r\ntonight i have my digital still camera, my digital video camera, and a flashlight so i can get their attention. unfortunately the video cam has no battery charge to it, but the still camera has brand new batteries. every time i go outside, i look all over the sky, but especially in that same area���.. hoping it returns���..\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

to work. sky was very clear with no clouds & still dark. as i was headed down a small hill between pinole & hercules on hwy 80. i noticed two very bright lights just slightly above the tree line on my left side. they were pointed in my direction which was roughly a mile away.  it caught my attention as those lights were not normal for that area. my 1st thought was roadwork. however the lights were too high up to be flood lights. since i was on a hill going down the hwy. i had a clear view of anything in the far distance.  i glanced around and noticed nothing other than flowing traffic. next i thought it was a traffic helicopter or possibly there was an accident & someone was being airlifted. at that time in the morning it���s not uncommon you see accidents as people are rushing to get to work. \r\n\r\ni focused my eyes on the light trying to  determine what the source of light was. about 3/4 mile away two smaller lights started to strobe back & forth. the large bright lights still remained on. as i got closer the lights were so bright you had to squint a little. when i was roughly 1/4 mile away i noticed there was this very large dark object hovering about 500-1000 feet from the ground.  at first glance the object was dark & cylinder shaped.  it didn���t appear to have wings nor windows. it was roughly 50-100ft to the left of the hwy. i slowed down to about 40mph and the car behind me stepped on his brakes & went around me. when the object was directly in front of me i rolled my driver window down & stuck my head out the window. it was 3-5 times bigger than a commercial plane. it made no sound and was just hovering like a kite. as i drove past the object i could see there were three large cylinders. two smaller cylinders on the outside and one large cylinder in the middle that protruded past the smaller cylinders. it appeared all three cylinders were connected.  there was also no markings. \r\n\r\nat the moment i had to make a quick decision if i should stop and pull over or keep driving to work. also the junction to switch hwy���s was around 1000ft so i had to act quick.  i was so dazed & confused about what i was seeing my reaction was to head to work.  i couldn���t believe what i had just seen so about a ��� mile away i turned around and headed back. it took me less than a minute to get back to the spot where i saw the object but it was nowhere in sight.\r\n\r\ni searched the local news papers to see if anyone else had reported seeing the object but i didn���t find anything. i know for a fact someone else had to have seen what i saw as it was right next to a major highway. luckily i found this site & im hoping someone else saw what i saw. one last note. i thought it was strange while i was searching the internet for reports of the object. there was a ufo convention (the bay area ufo expo) the following week.\r\n\r\ni told my family & friends but they didn���t believe me. honestly i don���t care what they think. i know what i saw!

airport in livingston county just accross the street and through the woods. so the u of m emergency helicopter and small jets take off pretty often. so i know what the diffrent planes look and sound like that they keep there. anyways,my freind and i were enjoying one of the last nice clear night before it gets too cold. we were enjoying the stars on my back porch. my freind asked me to take a look at the skys just north of howell and north east of us. he said he noticed something odd and wanted me to check it out. now the night was very clear,only a few small clouds flew low in the sky. what i saw i first thought i was a star. but then it started to shimmer and pulsate a bit. suddenly this \"orb\" started taking huge leaps in elevation and dirrection. looking at something stationary like the tops of the two pine trees. you clearly could see this thing was taking incredible leaps in direction and speed so fast,then it would stop and hover momentarily. at first my logic made me thing it was a helicopter. but what is a helicopter doing at 4:30am flying with a huge white spot light on its self? no sound eventhough it was low like a plane circleing for a landing. my freind and i are experienced star gazers and never seen anything remotely close to this before. we could clearly see this thing flying through the few low clouds in the sky. as it flew through and past the clouds its lights reflected on/through the clouds. like a glowing nimbus. so obviously its not a star. we watched this thing for well over an hour. all i have is a consumer grade camcorder and camera,so i didnt bother taking any video/pics. i have never seen any aircraft make such sudden and erratic changes in flight path and elevation. then we also noticed another one of the exact same phenomenon flying above the west side of the airport. they moved up,down the left,right. both with a white light that seemed an ord. with green and maybe some red pulsatings lights. i say pulsate becauce they didnt seem to flash. maybe the pulsating was from the craft changing dirrection. the objects didnt steadily move over time like the stars behind them. nore did i see them the next night at the same time/location? i even saw a jet fly far above and behind it. so i know it was closer. this was my first unexplained experience and am still trying to logically be skeptical. but we both saw the same thing? i am surprised no one else reported it. i was sure they would. eventhough it was very late/earily. but it went on for well over an hour. then i went in to warm up and they were both gone?","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

the past 3 weeks i am able to witness with my own eyes that cloaked craft are flying day or night if you now what to look for you will see them, which is sort of a heat haz moving, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. the problem is that for the past week it is a nice day only a cloud here or there but as it gets closer to night fall the clouds roll in from the pacific side of the baja so i started taking photos of these and to my amazement some of them had a face looking back down and the way they move in the sky they seem to stop and start pivot on there own axis and just don't perform naturally in my experience as i am a sailer and have done many ocean miles and the weather is the most important part of any safe trip and clouds tell you alot.\r\n   \r\n   so as it get dark the lights start appearing roughly in the same position, i am no stars man but shouldn't the stars be in the same position in relation to the moon round abouts? correct me if im wrong please. but the next thing is like a haz will come over the whole of cabo sky, what i meen is that it looks like the night sky but not a star insight not 1. then you star seeing massive shadows move through the sky some are the same some are quite different and even when they are pasing overhead it is like a gap in the clouds but nothing there stars nothing only the moon is ever visiable. i have hundreds of photos

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am not sure when this event occurred. it first popped into my consciousness as a \"dream\" i must have had a few days or weeks back. however, for many reasons i've come to believe that this was no dream. \r\n\r\nagain, i have many rational reasons for now believing this to have been a real event and i have had a lifetime of what ufologists would consider tell tale signs of repeat abductions, but this is my only recollection of an encounter with a being quite like this:\r\n\r\nit was early-mid morning and i was sitting (still in my bathrobe) on the front porch of my house having a cigarette. i started to sort of \"zone out\" and i began to stare off into the distance at a tree across the street. then i noticed something very peculiar: \r\n\r\nthere appeared to be some sort of near-invisible \"bubble\" floating toward my side of the street slowly. i could only see it because the edges of it were a bit warped looking, but very subtley. it was totally transparent, not at all cloudy or anything of that sort. if it were holding still it would have been invisible (i imagine) but as it moved the outline of the bubble became apparent due to the above warping of light mentioned above. \r\n\r\nit appeared to be spherical in shape (but not necessarily a perfect sphere) and it looked about 6 feet in diameter. looking at it frightened me a bit, but also made me feel somewhat mesmerized. it was just so amazing and strange.\r\n\r\nthen, my dad came outside to tell me something (i was still in my early 20s living at home at this point) i cut him off to tell him about the bizarre object and he immediately saw it as well. it then appeared to float over to our front lawn. he and i both walked from the porch to the driveway to get a better look. \r\n\r\nthen, out of nowhere, my dad collapsed onto the ground and appeared to lose consciousness. i looked away from the bubble to look at him, and when i looked back toward the direction of the bubble i saw a vague image of a greenish humanoid figure about six or six and a half feet in height standing about two feet from me. there was nothing blocking my view of it, but it was hard to get a clear look at it for whatever reason...Almost like trying to make sense of the small details in a very low-resolution picture.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, i felt weak and collapsed right next to my dad. i thought to myself, \"here we go again\" despite having no prior memory of this being or of my dad being with me during any paranormal/ufo encounter. i felt paralyzed, but i could still see and move my head a bit. i looked over toward the creature to try once again to get a good look at it.\r\n\r\ni saw its feet, or shoes, and legs. it looked like he was either wearing a greenish armor or else he had an exoskeleton. the feet were boxy looking, as were the legs. then i managed to move my head slightly to look further up at him. his whole body was just like his feet and legs, except that his torso was much more rounded. his face or perhaps helmet was also a bit boxy and i was still unable to make out the details of it. i could only make out a general shape. his body as a whole was a bit odd. he stood sort of crouched, like a praying mantis but not as extreme. he also appeared to have joints in slightly different locations than humans.\r\n\r\nmoments later i just sort of faded out and that's all i remember. again, my brain presented this memory to me as a dream, but i'm doubtful that it was truly a dream. i have not spoken to my father about this \"dream\" to see if he had it too because i have this almost instinctual aversion to bringing it up with him. anytime i even contemplate doing so, i clam up and feel like i should just let it go.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20824,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1512419,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12012009-0005","longitude":-118.449057,"occurred":1117638000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,
