at the time there was no other speck of cloud or mist in the sky, nor had there been any before. in any case, this white \"cloud\" clearly had been almost wrapped around the light source and its beam in a very strange fashion. i am still baffled.

what a beautiful, clear night it was and how well you could see the stars in the sky. looking across the night sky ,i saw three stars in a perfect line perhaps two fingers between each and wondered as to what constellation i might be obvserving. the three stars were all stationary for at least 30 seconds. at that point the center of the three stars seemed to start moveing. at first very slowly (at this point i began to wonder was it actually moving or was it my immagination?) after three or four more seconds of watching it, not totally sure if it was moving or not, it began to speed up.Eventually to about 4 times faster than any of the commercial jets that fly over our home. i watched it move in a straight line across the sky. i ran to the other side of the house to keep watching but it had allready distanced itself from view. i have no idea what i saw, but i felt kind of lucky in a way to have seen something so interesting. i cant stop thinking about what it could have been. each time i think about what i saw that night, a warm smile appears upon my face. i truely believe that i saw something very special. i have seen meteorites,comets,cloud punches,and many other oddities in the sky, but truly this was the most amazing thing that i have ever seen. if you think thier is a simple explanation of what i might have seen, please let me know. the truth of what i saw is all i seek. i have allways had an open mind about the possibilties that are out there. my father was in the air force in england in ww2 and saw or heard some amazing things which he \"hinted\" to me about, but said he could not tell me any more when i questioned him on it. i found out later in life that he was describing what they call \"foo fighters\" and such. one night, while dad and i looked up at a beautiful night sky, he asked me if i thought that there was intelligent life up there. without hesitating i responded \"absolutely\". he asked why i thought that. i told him \"well there isnt any down here, there has got to be some somewhere\". he grinned and shook his head in agreement. i think he might have allready known it. as much as i am a dreamer and a romantic, i still have an extremely analytical mind. i question everything and everyone, incuding myself on occasion. my heroes growing up were davinci and giordono bruno; because they told the truth at whatever the cost! please continue your wonderful work, and thank you very much for your time. terry

movement was erratic and the glow was stronger then a star or headlights even dead on. i didn't want to disturb my wife working in the next room, but this was it, i knew it. so i called her in, she has 20/20 eyes and can almost see at night, she's lived here all her life and after staring at it \"closely\" for a few moments just said :\" looks like you got one\".I was already snapping these. but like all true u.F.O sightings, my camera was set to 5 mega pixels instead of 10 !!!!  (it's a fujifilm finepixz)\r\nthe object slowly moved beneath the tree line (which is 100 meters (300 feet) away, south-west)and floated slightly north/north-west to finally disappear from sight over the town of wattrelos due to neighboring houses and trees. i kept a look out in that direction and then the rest of the sky for a further 15 min without any luck.\r\ni blew-up,lightened/contrast, and use the density(-) tool in photo editing software and was blown away by the \"structure\" that just forms (i didn't \"insist\" on any particular part of the image nor did i favor any forms to bring out this structure, thus the original dark unedited image 001) , like  3 port holes with light on one side and a grill in the back with symmetry. i added the originals, the zoomed in and lightened ones and even the wobbly one, i have more but just blurry dots. on the \"lightened\" photos you can  see the tree line and the trees are about 20 meters high (65 feet). the backdrop is lighter due to lights from the town of wattrelos, about half a kilometer behind the house starts the belgium highway, the only one in the world to be completely lit up at night, orange. but what we saw was golden copper, no flashing colored lights, it looked like it was changing shape or morphing, pulsating in form i could say.I've traveled all my life in planes and my parents were in the airline business, i know what we saw was not a plane. it's movements were, like i said erratic, yet smooth; like if you were always falling but just never did. i felt like one would when seeing a wild animal in the brush, amazed, flabbergasted and i must admit a bit frightened. it on the other hand looked like it was looking for a place to park or sightseeing. i still have a little tingle in my chest.

the sky.It looked oval in shape and it slowed down for a second then sped up at a very high rate of speed.I could see the object moving across the sky nice and steady and smooth.It did not go up or down.Before you knew it was gone.The event lasted for less then 30 seconds.I have to admit.This is the 1st time i and my father ever saw anything like this.No one can change my mind about what i saw.I knew this was special.Yes there were other people that saw the same thing.Everyone was talking about it. it was traveling against the direction of the wind so in knew it was not a balloon.I never saw a object move through the sky the was this did.Well thats my story. i hope more people will report what they saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20794,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.962135,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11292009-0011","longitude":-75.160489,"occurred":1259532600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1259545595000,"summary":"Saw

up at the brilliant cosmos, i noticed 2 very bright, starlike objects, one trailing the other silently gliding from n-w to s-e, not sure how high up. these silverblue diamonds (in color, no red, no green) kept exact distance between each other as they passed. since i couldn't tell how high up they were, i couldn't calculate their speed, but it was fairly rapid. they definitely were in our atmosphere, and i hoped the 'gap' between them would be solid-- indicating 'something' of great size. but no, as they passed over, the fixed stars beyond them were visible, no light distortion. as the 2 objects passed 'beneath' the moon, they silently and quickly faded out of visibility. no high clouds or fog they could have disappeared into, moon still shining brightly. haven't seen anything this unusual since jan '74 when i was in the dc area...","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:22","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

range, it appeared solid white. when i looked at it when it was further away, it looked almost like an orange pink color. i thought to myself that it had to be a satellite. i eventually lost sight of it after about 5-6 minutes. just to note, there was alot of traffic in the sky. it seemed to me they were putting in alot of chemtrail

middletown,indiana a few miles east of anderson. as i was cutting a piece of j-channel, out of the corner of my eye i saw a flash in the sky nearly overhead at about a 75 or 80 degree angle to the west.It was sunny with a few clouds so i assumed it was just the sun reflecting off an airplane as it passed. when i looked up at where the flash had been there was a silver metallic looking sphere moving south at about the speed of a small airplane. i have never seen anything like it in the sky before, and i've been doing roofing and siding for 19 years so i look at the sky much more than average. i kept my eyes on it as it flew directly south for about ten seconds until it entered a small ball shaped cloud. the cloud was small enough that the sphere should have come out the other side in three to four seconds, but it never came back out in over ten minutes that i stared at the cloud. all the clouds including the one the sphere entered were all drifting directly to the east, so the sphere wasn't moving with the wind like a balloon would. from the size of the sphere being at cloud level i would guess it's size to be between fifteen and twenty-five feet. it appeared to be made of brushed stainless steel and had no markings of any kind on it. since that day four and a half years ago i've tried to find some example of what i saw on the internet but the only thing that looks like it is the pictures and videos of silver spheres shown on ufo websites. i included a picture i found on the internet of what it looked like and i've kept a camera and binoculars with me ever since in the hope of seeing one again.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
