and one army base, plus civilian airports, seeing something in the sky is a common occurrence. immediately, though, i knew there was something different about this object. as i stared at it, i could tell that it was white and rectangular, with no wings. there was also no contrail behind this \"craft\", and it was heading from a northwest to a southeast direction seamlessly. in other words, it was travelling smoothly through the air. at a couple of points during its journey that i saw, it appeared to be reflecting light off of it, or perhaps it was emitting something that gave that appearance. there also appeared to be some device attached to its top that resembled a radar dish. it also seemed to disappear, then reappear while i was watching it. finally, as i was trying to retrieve my

looking at sky hoping to see one more ufo. i was in the car, back seat on a highway. \r\nwhen i looked at the sky, i saw a white line, as if someone drew it with a ruler. i thought a bit weird.\r\nfew minutes later when i was heading south, i looked up again and found that line closer, with no shape of plane in front of that line. and the line was moving forward!\r\ni felt so weird and i took a photo, it was very hard to take one because the car was moving so fast on the highway.\r\nanyway when i looked the photo i took, i found that it is a sphere!\r\ni saw few more flying objects behind the sphere and in front of the sphere which seemed like chasing the sphere from back and front.\r\nwhen i took those photos, they came out just like jets. but the sphere was sphere in my photo again and again.\r\nit was a very shiny sphere, moving fast like the speed of a jet, but the difference was that it didn't make engine smoke.\r\nthe jets were making engine smokes, which spreads to air after some time, but the sphere made a line, which caused by friction of the air because it was flying so fast.\r\nthat's why the line seemed so weird, like pen drawn line and made me look at it.\r\n\r\nsuddenly the sphere disappeared and after few minutes, and the two jets one chasing from behind and one coming from front, crossed each other, quite close each other.\r\nthen, the metal sphere appeared on the sky near where it was disappeared, little bigger size, maybe closer to me. it looked very clearly like a shiny metal sphere with no legs, wings, windows nothing.\r\nit stood there for 2 or 3 seconds, not moving at all and then slowly disappeared its shape, as if it melted in to the air.\r\n\r\nfirst photo is a close view of the flying sphere.\r\nsecond photo is a photo of jet which was coming towards the sphere, you can see the difference of shape and the line they are making.\r\nthird photo is taken while the sphere was disappearing.\r\nfourth is another photo of sphere flying,\r\nlast one is same as third one.\r\n\r\nit was very hard to take a photo, camera could not focus the small thing in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

our vehicle, i had had the notion to quadruple-check the back doors (my husband & i have ocd when it comes to locking doors, which is a good habit!).  while my husband was loading himself & our dog into our vehicle, i jogged to the back of the building.  after everything checked out ok, i jogged back to the front side of the building & stopped dead in my tracks when i noticed 3 red lights.  at first i thought, \"what a weird plane\", but as my brain slowly processed what i was seeing, i noticed this was no plane at all. this object did not make the slightest sound. as i looked at the 3 red lights, i noticed the shape of an equilateral triangle. the bottom 2 lights would stobe together & the top light would stobe at the same rate but at a slightly different time. the lights would always be on but flash at different times, almost as if they were dimming lights?  as i was fixated on this object, i noticed the top light was moving down & to the left while the 2 bottom lights stayed at the same fixed distance. finally my brain kicked into motion & i ran as fast as i could to get my husband. he then ran to the back with me and was astounded by what we saw. there were no lights other than the 3 red lights. whatever unseen hard object that was bordered by the lights seemed to be rotating slowly, as if the \"foward\" point were moving counterclockise from west to north. after it completed this 90 degree rotation, it began to slowly and silently move to the north horizon. it was hard to gauge the overall size of the object.  we would guess that it was approx 300 ft wide. the size was very hard to guage especially because of the unknown altitude and lack of comparable structures..  if it was as low as we thought, it should have made some kind of sound.  if was a \"plane\" at such a high altitutde that it wouldn't make any sound then the craft would have to be thousands of feet wide. we watched the triangle for no more than a minute and proceeded to get in the car and attempt to follow it as it headed north.  thanks to our towns pointless infrastructure, we we stopped at a red light for way too long and by the time we were able to follow the direction of what we saw, we had lost sight of the craft.   we live & work in the flight paths of a regional airport & we are surrounded by miltary bases in almost every cardinal direction. we are extremely familiar with civilian, commercial, and military planes, and are certain this did not belong to any above categories. if this was a secret aircraft, it flew very conspicuously over a high-density population area, with 3 attention getting wierd red strobes. we had even considered if it was 3 separate aircraft, but the precision and uniformity of distance, movement, and complete silence eliminated that as a possibility. we were very excited and somewhat nervous seeing this so close up, but were ultimately disappointed in missing closer details, like what the stucture looked like or where it was going.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20773,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6663074,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11282009-0008","longitude":-81.5134835,"occurred":1257558300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1259451982000,"summary":"Three

smoke. it was a very clear night and i was looking up at the stars towards the north west. i noticed an object moving in a roughly south east direction in a straight line. it looked very similar to a dimly lit star. there were no noticeable lights (steady or flashing), what little light coming from it appeared to be reflected light. at first i thought i was watching the iss going overhead. i have seen the iss before and this object looked very much like it. i figured i was either watching the iss or a satellite passing by, cool.\r\n\r\ni watched it for maybe half a minute when it suddenly made a sharp, right angle turn towards the south west (almost directly away from me). i thought to myself \"what the ???\". it continued in a straight line towards the south west for about a half a minute. then it made another right angle turn back towards the south east. \r\n\r\nthe object continued this pattern making several right angle turns every 30 seconds or so, back and fourth, zig zagging like a staircase across the sky.\r\n\r\neventually it moved beyond the tree line to my south east. the object probably took less than few minutes to cross the sky (my field of view). i remember thinking \"geez, i forgot to smoke my smoke\". \r\n\r\nmy wife was asleep at the time but i told her about it in the morning. she just rolled her eyes and made some comment about me being a geek. i didn't bother to mention it to anyone after that.\r\n\r\nnow it's been bugging me for months, i cannot figure out what the object could have been. i'd really like to know if it was something man-made or not.

my wife excitedly said \"do you see that?\" while pointing at an object in the night sky.  i looked and saw the strange object too.  \r\n\r\nmy wife, who saw the object longer and had a better vantage point, described the object as a green tear-drop with a whitish tail, sort of like a comet but not a comet as it was about the size of one or two houses and was descending rather slowly at maybe a 45-degree angle over some trees and a residential neighborhood that was behind some businesses.  during our viewing, the mysterious green object made no sound.\r\n\r\nwe watched for about 4-5 seconds as the object slowly came down and disappeared.  my wife is a bit of a skeptic and not into ufos like i am, but even she was extremely excited, perplexed, and agreed that it was a ufo.  it was not the right shape, color, and moving too \"intelligently\" and slow to be a natural object, helicopter, or plane.  it was moving too fast to be a balloon, and the latter do not have luminous tails, and it definitely was not a flare or swamp gas.  we both agreed that it was a ufo, probable et craft of some sort.  this realization left my wife not upset but a bit shaken.\r\n\r\nwe were about to turn left onto hull street (rt. 360), near the waffle house restaurant (speeks dr).  moments after the sighting, we saw a man working the drive-through window at a nearby hardee's restaurant (10210 hull st.) who was leaning/straining/looking out the window.  it was obvious that he saw the mysterious green ufo that we saw and was trying to see more.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i decided to check out the residential neighborhood behind the waffle house where we thought that the object may have come down, and as we drove down the streets, we saw some residents in the streets who were looking up, pointing, talking, and must have seen what we saw and also were curious.  it's possible that we may have midjudged the distance of the object, and it may have come down (landed?) a bit farther north, maybe not in the exact neighborhood where we were looking, but it was obvious that some other people probably saw the green ufo too!\r\n\r\nafter getting home, i went outside, even though the temperature was dropping into the 30s, and scanned the night sky for ufos, but all i could see were the stars and perhaps a planet.  i also called my friend, jeff, who is heavily into ufos, and told him about my sighting.\r\n\r\ni feel very lucky to have seen this green comet-like tear-drop ufo.  i saw a cylindrical ufo with lights up close and personal in rural powhatan county, va many years before, so getting to see a second ufo in the city was not something that i was expecting and icing on my cake.  i personally believe that we are in what some call \"the end time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

of the events that took place i can see how it could be useful: for bringing back memories). in the beginning of this event i was wearing a quartz necklace with a dragon given to me by my brother. it was explained to me that there is an eternal everlasting soul, and that god was becomming very angry with me and other people because of the lack of affection(the mood control was actually explained to me this day). that night a star or an object shot some thing blue down in to our yard two or three feet in front of our house. this blue light didn't move or disturb the ground at all when it hit. this event was followed by me getting on facebook.Com to send a friend a message, but then i started hearing chanting. the chanting started a time in my life i'll never forget, because either i had completely lost my mind, or there were some very strong forces at work. the force chanted some ones name over and over, and they changed that someones name totally around the next morning on facebook.Com. the forces claimed that they were very strong witches, and that they had the ability to control peoples moods. not only that, but they aren't just saying things in songs. my mom and i came to a self-diagnoses of either schizophrenia, or narcelepsy (a sleep problem in which you see two kinds of hallucinations hypnogogic and some other sort). i had been taking supplements dhea, pregnenolone, creatine, pantothenic acid, piracetam and royal jelly while the climax of these events took place. i wanted everything that was happening to stop, and i hoped it was happening, because the supplements i was taking, and that it would slowly fade with time. the television shows started getting weird, and by weird i mean i could remember them except the memories were new, and i could remember other memories, but it was as if they had been supressed, or that i had forgotten them, but all of a sudden they were there. two years before this all had started happening i was heavy in to marijuana, and i had experimented with ayahuasca and psilosybin mushrooms. but during this whole event i had not taken any drugs or alcohol. in fact i had not taken any thing for about 2 years. leading to this event i had performed meditation rituals in which i lined different stones according to my chakra centers. after i had lined all the stones up according the the centers i had a very realistic dream that some force was holding me down just along the left side of our house. the dream was so real that i screamed for someone to help me up. now i'll snap you back to the actual event with me. some morning after the chanting i woke up and saw snakes crawling around a figure like medusa, a blue mist of some kind shadowed in my eyes when the image(or hallucination) left me. the force claimed to be lucifer star of the morning, and explained to me that he or (s)he had been around an aeon!\r\n\r\naliens, demons, or angels? schizophrenia or conspiracy? mind control or paranoia? you be

angular.\r\nafter i first observed the object i alerted my son and nephew to it. they pulled out a camera and cell phone respectively and started recording the event.\r\ni rushed and got my family out to see it too. \r\nplease see the video links as follows:\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=w5p-6qfz9xs\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=bfjh0lmiar8\r\nwe have the original camera files ��� and can upload at a future date.\r\nsome interesting tidbits:\r\nthe fireball came from the north in a straight line in a parallel direction to the north western side of the house. there was thick cloud cover (details can be obtained through abe logs of the cloud ceiling).\r\nthere was no observed trail of falling debris nor was there any sound. if you missed the fireball in the 2 + minutes observed you most likely would have missed this event.\r\n\r\nall together there were 8 other observers plus myself.\r\n\r\nwhat does an atmospheric type of break without any sound, change direction and appear to head off at the same altitude (under the cloud ceiling)?\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

drive ne of calgary ab) on the phone to a friend & noticed a bright white dot in the sky sw of me.  asked the friend (who was located 30km s & 13 km e of me at the time) to look out the window & see if she saw it too. she could not see anything out of the ordinary in the south, north or west sky.  the sky was blue & streaked with long horizontal clouds.  the object looked just like you would imagine a distant comet coming towards the planet would look; white ball/dot, with the occasional flicker of what looked like a white (comet-ish) tail flaring out on either sided.  thought maybe it was a plane heading directly away from me, with the jet stream flaring out on either side, but then realized there was no sign of the jet stream left behind, so discounted that idea.  it didn't actually seem to be moving unless you sat & watched it for an extended time with markers in clouds/sky.  i watched it slowly move further south in the sky, still looking like a dot, leaving no trail behind (approx 5 minutes?). then it changed course (still super slow...) and appeared slightly different. it now didn't look like a ball, but just a trail starting through the clouds.. could not see anything leaving the trail.  the trail started out white, then changed to purpley grey heading sw in the sky, coming towards the ground at about a 45degree angle.  the object was still moving very slowly.  right about now realized i should get the camera & try to take some shots.  with the bright sky,the distance i needed to zoom in, and not the greatest camera, i wasn't able to see it in the camera's screen, but clicked away zooming in & out, hoping something would show up on the bigger computer screen.  got several shots that do not show the fireball/comet-ish object that initially caught my eye, but do show the tail it was leaving thru the clouds.  still kicking myself for not getting the camera sooner.  the object in right corner of pictures is our farm gas tank.  the object seemed to just fade into the cloud cover on the horizon.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

which had the typical late night traffic.  a car flashed his high beams at me and i automatically assumed, \"ok a police officer is up ahead.\"  as i traveled down the road further, i saw a light up in the sky.  at this point, i was about a mile to two miles away from this light.  initially, i thought it was a helicopter because there was a light that kept flashing around (similar to a spot light on the front of a helicopter).  the road i was traveling on turned into a single lane road and was much more rural at this point.  i was only about half a mile away from whatever was in the sky, when i came to the conclusion there was no way it was a helicopter.  i came to a complete stop, rolled down my windows, turned off the radio, and observed.  at this point it became even more evident that my sighting was not a helicopter, small plane, weather balloon, or anything like that.  while i was stopped this object passed me going no more than 10 miles per hour about one hundred feet to my left over an open field and no more than two hundred feet above the ground.  it had one row of lights that illuminated from front to back one at a time.  in addition to it being dark out, the sky was filled with clouds, so i i could not use the moon's light as an aid to figure out the definite shape of the craft.  from what i gathered by the illumination of the light, it was a diamond shaped object.  i watched for another twenty seconds while it seemed to float across the air.  i started to drive off again when two more cars came behind me.  i looked in my rear-view mirror to see their reactions.  they as well, had come to a complete stop to observe.
