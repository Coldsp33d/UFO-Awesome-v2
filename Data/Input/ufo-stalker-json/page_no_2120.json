careful because i was driving, there were three amber lights hovering in a triangular formation.  as we looked closer, we noticed this triangle slowly rotating and ascending slightly.  the longer we watched, the more we realized these weren't helicopters so we decided to pull off into a side road to get a closer look.  as we got out of the car, the bottom two lights descended behind a building, that's when i took out my iphone and took a picture (see attached).  it's not a very impressive photo but it may give things a little context.  a couple minutes later, the visible light began ascending, flickering and then slowly faded until it was gone.\r\n\r\ni've been wondering if they were flares but flares don't maintain a triangular formation, and hover and ascend.  it was extremely

east to west about 25 degrees above the southern horizon.  i observed the phenomenon from my home while burning trash outdoors.  my location was (is) approximately seven miles nw of ada, oklahoma in a rural setting.  the weather was clear, sky fairly dark (about 1 1/2 hours after local sunset), and practically no wind (smoke from the trash fire rising straight into the sky).  i at first believed i was seeing fireworks, particularly because of the color (definitely the pinkish-red observed with strontium salt pyrotechnics) and the rapidity of motion.  the duration was very brief, 2-3 seconds at the most, and i did witness the event in its entirity.  i listened for a report, but heard none; and i did not see smoke or a cinder/ash cloud as would be expected from pyrotechnics.  these objects did not increase or decrease in brightness; they simply appeared while in motion and then disappeared very shortly thereafter.  the motion of the objects was also trending slightly upward as they moved from east to west.  the appearance was so brief that i was unable to accurately count the number of objects, hence the 4-6 estimate.  there is a significant treeline about 1/4 mile due south of my property that obscures the first 10-15 degrees of the horizon, and the objects were an apparent 8-10 degrees above it.  i must assume from that observation alone that the objects were at least one mile to my south, but they could have been much further.  i simply could not judge the distance in such a short time, and as a consequence, i had no real reference on which to estimate their velocity.  they were moving quickly, (shooting would be a good description of their motion), and there was no change in velocity or direction for the duration of the display.  i can state with certainty, that the objects were not aircraft, astronomical bodies, aurorae, commercial lighting, wildlife, or combustible gas from decaying organic matter.  i don't believe the light was reflected at all; it seemed to be generated by the objects.  the brilliance of the light was notable, very bright like fireworks or emergency flares.  the lack of sound was also notable, it was a very quiet and still evening, and i heard nothing except for the fire burning in the barrel i was tending.  and i must state that the aforementioned fire was well to one side (15-20 feet) and out of the line of sight to these objects.  i informed my wife of my observation immediately after it occured, but she did not witness anything herself.  i also told my oldest daughter almost a day later at thanksgiving dinner, and she was clearly skeptical and more or less dismissed the whole thing as some kind of silliness on my part.  that skepticism alone convinced me to report the phenomenon to this site.  i have been actively observing aerial phenomena for over 43 years, and i am familiar with both astronomical and terrestrial objects that are commonly mistaken for ufos (and i hesitate to even use the term ufo for all the negative connotation associated with it).  i cannot explain what i saw to my own satisfaction, therefore i submit the observation here for consideration by others more experienced in the field.  i'm curious to know if anyone else has experienced a similar sighting, and of course, if it has been explained to their satisfaction.

chester when we noticed something overhead in the dark sky glowing red with no blinking of lights and not making a sound. we asked each other, what's that, and then another one quickly followed then another and another and another until there were 10 in formation. they floated over head and up into a dark sky up ahead behind clouds that were illuminated by the moon. after that we were in awe, wondering what we just saw with our eyes glued to sky in amazement.  we finally started moving up the block on our walk when coming from the same direction, another one floated towards us and then another and then two more which seemed to be more propelled and moving faster. we were oohing and ahhing and feeling like we should knock on someone's door to come out and see this.  but it happened so fast and we were unable to take our eyes off them until they veered upwards towards the clouds and the moon and disappeared out of site.  again we just stood there trying to imagine if these were hot air balloons, sattelites, gps, google earth cameras or what.  we started moving down the block when our dog saw one of his friends who was on his porch with his humans who were saying good bye to each other after a thanksgiving dinner together.  we told the group about what we just saw and lo and behold to validate the story, over the top of her house, another one floated overhead.  all of them were the same.  silent, red lights, surrounded by a lighter white ring not further than 1500-3000 feet, no sound, no blinking like aircraft. we thought maybe they were balloons but why would anyone fly balloons at night and that many of them all lit up. i work in the aerospace industry. it was not an aircraft. it could have been a balloon but why at night, why glowing red, why a couple of

work i watched two brightly lit craft flying over the washtenaw/jackson county line in a northwesterly direction.   i work in tecumseh, mi (lenawee county) and was driving home by way of manchester and napoleon, michigan.  while driving west on austin road near the county line i watched two brightly lit craft flying slowly together toward the northwest.   initially i thought that they may have been military helicopters or jets as these two craft seemed to be flying in extremely tight formation, one leading and one slightly behind.   i soon realized that they were flying much too slow to be military.   they were both lit brightly and i then realized that they were flying together, dangerously close to one another.   the sky was a dark shade of blue as the sun had set about twenty minutes previous to the sighting.   i could make out that the trailing object was probably a cessna-type craft.   i could just barely see the dark shape of the wings, fusalge with wingtip lights in their appropriate configuration.   however, the craft immediately ahead of it was unidentifiable.   it had a rather large red strobing light and a steady white light.   the strobing red light was much larger than what i've seen on other aircraft, perhaps three or four times as big.   it also seemed to be at the rear of the object.   what is most disturbing about this are that the two craft were much too close to one another for safe flying...The distance between the two was less than a hundred feet (using the size of the trailing cessna-type craft as a reference).   they maintained their distance and didn't seem to deviate, as if connected together.\r\n\r\nthe bright red strobe and two bright white lights remained visible on the horizon to the nw (flying toward jackson, mi) for several minutes after passing above and ahead of me.   it was difficult to make out any more details due to the traffic with headlights in the oncoming lane.\r\n\r\nwhat still bothers me today is that these two objects were insanely close together and didn't deviate position during their flight while in my observation.   i've never seen anything like this before (including aircraft pulling gliders).   this might not be a ufo event but it certainly was an unusual display of two craft flying dangerously close to one another (and possibly illegally so).\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

river. which surrounds that era.\r\nit was the 4th of july 1999.10:15pm after all the fire works were done i noticed what i thought at the time was a stealth fighter, and i thought damn thats pretty low coming from my 10:00 veiw. his yard was pretty large with no fenching at all conjoined to the other yards in the back of his house. i was standing in the middle of the yard alone, cant remember why since i was wit my ex wife and two sons. but they were about 40 ft in back of me has she took pictures on the cam of her family. she is not sure if she caught it on film because she thought nothing of it at the time but she might have, i have talk to her two days ago ask her to check and see. anyhow i could see it flying slowly erraticly and has it got to my 12:00 it flipped in circles 5 times and changed shapes into a triangle\r\ngreen in color at times it looked like it had 3 triangle shaped wings into a complete flat triangle, the best veiw i saw was as if it was on its side and a window appeared with 3 nordic looking men in white with blonde hair staring at us as if we were mere cattle. i could see them from the belly up, not sure if they were standing or sitting. they had no apparattus on at all. i never took my eyes off it until it was gone from sight. the main light source was green which lit the craft up sorta lime green, there was a blue and white light also. i heard stories about how ufos make no noise, but this did and it was not loud but it was noticeable.The houses or ground did not shake at all. i am a army vet so i know what jets can do even a plane at 20,000 ft you hear it quite well, i have had air shows fly over and shake the house alot. even one jet. but this whizzing and whooshing sound was unique. i clocked the speed at about 45 to 50 mph. perhaps even less. most people dont get to see craft that close and distinct, i even saw the molding around the windows. i was not blinded by the lights at all, skies were clear starry and it was about 2,000 to 3,000 ft in front of me if i were to walk under it. my son ran to me across the yard and said dad! was that a ufo? and i said i don't know wtf that was but it aint ours. what gets me is everyone saw it there and there was like almost a hundred people, but young. and they were partying pretty hard and playing games so i guess to them it seemed like nothing. i talked about it for awhile with my kids and my wife but let it black out after awhile. but that image stayed with me and grew over time, and now i live in canada where its been bothering me so much and details are getting stronger, i cant get the one guy in the middle staring at me as if he could see me like a calf in the field alone. its damn near huanting. lately i have been thinking about getting hypnotised but people say it's a waste of time. i wonder. i also think about the time or if it has anything to do with the time i was working the night shift, 11:00 to 7:00 am left for work and when i approached the steel bridge as always i noticed a small white light which i thought was a reflection from the one street light and the end of the road, but it was not. it was like a probe the size of to beach balls round and all white. as it flew by my windsheild i pulled off to the side of the road but it went down into the wooded trees and so i dared not venture and headed for work. i was not going to say anything to no one, but my boss said with one of my fellow wotkers there that i was 2 hrs late. i leave everyday at the same time and im never late. but i too let this pass because this never even became a after thought because i have had no nightmares or thoughts about it. i think i would know if i was abducted. the only thing that bothers me is where did the time go and how was i late that day. its only a 20 minute drive and i left at 10:15 as always.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20734,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0410955,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11262009-0006","longitude":-76.2989344,"occurred":931151700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1259271695000,"summary":"Green

maryland about an hour away from both washington d.C. and baltimore.  \r\n\r\non the night of friday november 6th, 2009, my family and i were crossing a friends' darkened back yard on the way to our car parked in the alley behind their house.  we were on east 5th street, in downtown frederick.  i heard the sound of a \"military\" jet engine up in the sky.  it sounded like a single f-16.  i searched the sky for it.  i found the plane; every strobe and beacon was lit up on it.  it was chasing a pair of red-orange \"dots\".  the dots were not particularly very bright.  they appeared \"flat\".  they did not twinkle.  they remained consistent in both brightness (intensity), size and color.  one dot followed the other, horizontally.  the dots were headed in a southerly direction, the \"f-16\" appeared to be keeping pace, but was unable to close on the two dots.  they were just west and above of my location, (initially) about 60-70 degrees up from the horizon.  distance and altitude unknown/ unascertainable.  i watched until the view became obstructed by neighboring structures to the south-west.  the whole thing lasted about two minutes.  the skies were clear, and dark blue.  stars were visible.  i don't remember moon phase, but it may have been low, to the east.  \r\n\r\nthis area of the country has many busy air corridors, as well as many restricted air-spaces.  civilian aircraft are often escorted away from these areas by military jets.  the local ang sqaudrons fly the f-16 \"viper\".  \r\n\r\nat first, i thought a civilian airplane had wandered over camp david, the presidential retreat located nearby, and had triggered a persuit.  it was when i noticed the speed at which these objects were flying that i decided this was no ordinary interception.  i've seen a pair of f-16s struggling to remain in the air as they had escorted a slow, prop driven civilian aircraft in the past.  they had to fly in large circles around the much slower offending aircraft to keep their speed up, or they will stall out of the sky.  the interceptor plane on this night was keeping up with the fast moving dots.  i don't know if the f-16 was in \"burner\"- i did not see a

facing north at the intersection of northern blvd. and 49th st., exiting the roof parking lot of the stop & shop shopping plaza.  absentmindedly, a moving object in the low horizon of the northeast sky caught my attention.  i initially assumed it was another plane leaving laguardia airport but it seemed a bit larger than typical planes.  it was moving at normal speed but i was shocked to see it had a tail of blue/orange fire - making it seem like a horizontal tear drop.  my stomach dropped and my gut reaction was: oh no - that's a plane on fire!  i followed its path for the next 5-6 seconds until it was due north of my position and it simply vanished!  i was stunned and looked around to see if anyone else had seen it - pedestrians or people in cars.  no one seemed to have seen it.  i immediately wondered if i had seen a meteor or something.  i checked the news (online/print) over the next few days but could not find any mention of the sighting.  just thought i would post it here, as i hope to find a possible explanation.  i definitely saw something!","distance":"Over One

driver looking through the window when i saw the ufo in 10 to 10 position moving slowly between 100 or 150 feet high. i told my friend and we passed by the path of the ufo and stop in the middle of the road. the ufo was at that time in 8 o'clock position and was descending and approaching very slow to our location. it was huge and sound less, i could see an entity\r\nin the lower level, in the middle level lights were spinning with different colors, when the ufo was getting closer a yellow light was lighting the area, it was kind of cloudy yellow. we were observing the ufo until it stop\r\nabove our head no more than 30 feet high. next thing i remember was me getting up in a sort of spiral steps escorting by an alien behind me i think to the 2nd level. an alien almost 7 ft tall with blond hair and a colorful tight uniform was standing up just in front of me on my right side when i reached the floor level,his head was kind of upside down conical shape , , he looked and me with a friendly attitude for a moment and then he kept doing whatever he was doing. i saw another entity far away on my left side also engaged in other activity. the room was wide and spacious kind of self illuminated, the ceiling had a dome shape and the color was a intense blue similar to the sky you can see in the early morning high in the mountains. the one who was escorting me took me across the room and introduced me to a fourth alien was sitting down and greeted me with a friendly approach, i remember no have a single drop of fear. he talked to me for a while i could feel how we were moving i do not know if we were flying or just floating. after that point i can not remember anything else.
