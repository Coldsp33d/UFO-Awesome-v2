headed into russellville when in front of us, maybe a half-mile to a mile, was a triangular shaped object slowly passing over the interstate. i do not remember it coming into view quickly especially since it seemed to be moving so slowly, only that it\r\nappeared and my daughters and i all noticed even as i was yelling for them to look.  there was a radiant multi-colored prism like light at each of the corners, and a small flashing red light in between the two rear lights. the lights definitely were not those of any aircraft, as they were almost ball like and the rays or the light source itself seemed to have a glowing life or activity about them. the object appeared to be slightly tilted at about 20 degrees but at the moment was not turning, only drifting directly across us.  my youngest daughter immediately upon seeing the object asked, \"what is that daddy?\" to which my oldest immediately responded, \"a spaceship!\" i go to grab my phone and notice the craft begin to arc in a horshoe, a slow deliberate curve away. i pull our vehicle over onto the shoulder of the interstate, against the wishes of my oldest daughter, and check my mirrors and wait for a semi to pass to get out.  when i look back, it is further away and when i get my cell phone up to snap, it is gone behind the tree line.  it didnt zoom away but definitely seemed to speed up somewhat, although its lights never turned from the original direction they were facing, even when pulling the arc away behind the tree line.  my heart was pounding, it was so real and intense and obviously not an airplane, or aircraft as we would think of them.  i got back in the blazer and we sped to pass the tree line and view the sky openly. when we broke past the curve and saw the sky wide open there was nothing that could explain what we just saw, and upon it seeming to disappear, my daughter inquisitively asked, \"daddy, was it an alien spaceship?\"  i hope this helps with anything, and if you need anything else please e-mail me at dyliho@yahoo.Com\r\n\r\n     sincerely,  matthew dylan foster","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

friends and family after a funeral we had for my father earlier that day. we were on the beach setting off some fireworks when i looked to the south side of the beach and noticed two very bright blue orbs twirling in the sky. i immediately ran for my camera and shouting \"ufo's! ufo's!\" it took me about 10 minutes to find where i had packed my camera. just as soon as i got back to the beach ready to film, the orbs descended to the water. i thought that i had missed my chance, only to find out a few minutes later that they were coming back. i captured almost 30 minutes of these ufo's flying near madeira beach. the manueverability and speed of these things was unlike anything i've ever seen, or heard of. their shape was like that of a ouija board planchette, sort of like a stretched-out heart. i noticed a couple of times while they were turning, they seemed flat, whereas sometimes they seemed like an orb. they would pulsate every once in a while from a light, bright blue, to a bright red, and sometimes a teal/green. it seemed like they would change color when they would do a sharp turn, sort of like a sailfish when its hunting prey. i noticed that every once in a while, one would move and do a loop and a couple of sharp turns and come to a complete stop and just as soon as one would stop, the other did the exact same thing. once they mimicked each other, they would line up and move in a half-circle in sync with one another. i broke the filming up into 9 parts just to make sure i had at least something on film if one of the files were to become corrupted. the next day, i went onto google maps to try and pinpoint the area in which we saw them flying around. my guess is that they were 3-5 miles south of where we were at. the ufo's were definitely going down to the water, as you can see in the video(unfortunately, i never got them actually becoming submerged). if you get a chance and would like to look at the map yourself, look right along the coast near treasure island, fl. if you look at the map in satellite mode, you'll notice there's an area right off of the coast that google doesn't show you. it might not be anything, but its's kind of peculiar. i checked all of the bay area papers the next couple of days and there was no mention of anything like what we had seen that night. this was just a small explanation of what i had seen that night, if anybody has any questions, i'd be happy to help, or if anybody has any answers, i'd be glad to hear them.\r\n\r\ni have all 9 parts on youtube.Com...Look up *must see* ufo's near madeira beach,

moving.  my first thought was it must be a satellite.  then i noticed that another of what i took to be a \"star\" also seemed to be moving.  that's when i noticed that these two moving lights looked as though they were moving on an axis.  the one following the other.  they looked as though they must have been attached to some invisible structure.  it then struck me that if that were the case, this flying invisible what-ever-it-was must have been huge.  it was also totally silent.  i then started fumbling for my cell phone camera, but by the time i got it out the lights had drifted away to the south east and were almost invisible.  i watched as they faded silently away in the direction of some clouds off to the southwest.  then they were gone.  i then noticed what i took to be a conventional aircraft with a flashing light passing across the sky from west to east.  there was nothing unusual about this light, so i just continued on my way into my house.\r\n\r\nthe object moved

coast. when my husband got home from town around 8:30 pm, i went outside to greet him. at that point, i noticed two blinking craft (red, blue and white at this point) at about 40 degrees above the horizon. they were moving slowly south. there was a distant jet engine noise at that point and we were about to dismiss it as unusual proximity for two aircraft--maybe a military maneuver. however, at that point we noticed a third very dim light moving south just above the ridge line. when that plane had moved out of sight, the jet sound vanished but the lights suddenly intensified and became a very bright gold and stopped blinking. at this point for a moment they looked to me like the classic saucer-shape with the bubble on the center, though they were too far away for this shape to be seen clearly throughout the sighting. they turned back north and followed approximately the same flight path that they had flown to the south, one behind the other. they started blinking again and at this point my husband noticed a green blinking light on the right side of each craft. \r\ni ran inside to get my camera just in case they came close enough to film, which they never really did. we both grabbed binoculars and tracked the lights north and south along the same flight path for the next 5 + minutes. they were repeating some sort of maneuver and synchronizing their flight paths. there appeared to be at least a dozen lights of various sizes on each craft, sometimes blinking, sometimes solid, color varying from gold to blue and red to green. when they were blinking i thought they looked like they were in a v-shape (though it was hard to tell through my jumpy binocs). they were so bright and glittering, that as we watched them move silently through the sky we began to feel that these were ufo's. at one point the craft on the left had what appeared to be a central bright light that blinked like a regular aircraft light, but then the light blinked much faster, then became solid, then intensified in brightness to a very bright golden white light. at times there were so many lights visible on each craft that they seemed to glitter. we noted that the lights were not arrayed in a way that would indicate horizontal wings perpendicular to a fuselage, but rather a more 'three dimensional' and complex shape to the craft.\r\n\r\nafter several minutes of observing these two craft, a very large conventional aircraft (that clearly made the sound of jet engines) with a blinking red light on each wingtip moved in swiftly from the south and flew directly over us at medium  altitude. the aircraft had a very wide wingspan. it banked to the west in the direction of the two craft that at this point were in the northern part of their flight path. the lights on the two craft dimmed and began to move back south. the conventional craft followed at a distance, not really in hot pursuit but maintaining an observational distance. it was apparent that whatever the two ufo craft had been doing was interrupted by the arrival of the conventional aircraft. all three craft went to the south and out of our field of view. to recap, the only time we heard any aircraft noise was at the beginning of the observation (when there was what appeared to be a large commercial craft following a fairly standard path that we have often observed such craft to fly) and at the end, when the large craft moved in to observe what were obviously objects of interest. the rest of the time, we watched the two craft moving in utter silence.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

normally do and it seemed there was much activity this night due to all of the airplanes and normal aircraft i see. \r\ni saw at one point a flashing light which did not strike me as an airplane but it was moving spasmodic and moving in very close to what was pretty clear to be an airplane and it seemed that they were so close that they almost ran into each other and one split second i thought they had hit and then it was all ok and they were on their way in opposite directions. \r\n\r\ni kept watching the sky and as i drew nearer to work i work very near the dfw airport and always see aircraft which i know to be airplanes but tonight there were strange lights in the sky more like spheres, there were about 6 of them flying in and out close to each other and then out again and as i drew near my exit they formed a diagonal line and just hoovered there not moving while other airplanes were flying all around them. \r\n\r\ni am so surprised that nothing has been reported on tv because these were not your usual aircraft in these skies.. i wanted to stop and take pictures but i do not have a great camera on my phone and could not get a view on them so i drove on thinking i would see them when i got to work but when i got to work i could not see for the trees so i was not sure if they left or what they did. \r\n\r\nnext time i will be late to work and i plan on buying a really good camera because lately i have seen several sightings in this area... \r\n\r\nwho knows maybe someone else will speak up on this i know they had to see them however i think because of the

i noticed a bright seemingly stationary object in the western sky, possibly above the ocean.  i began to observe the object because i've worked here for a year and have never seen planes in that portion of the sky.  one would think that there would be a flight path leading into los angeles int'l there but i truly have never observed planes flying in from that direction.  plus, this object was too high to be a plane on approach (i'd estimate several thousand feet) and there was something about this light that didn't indicate 'airplane' to me.  it was just too bright.\r\n\r\nshortly after another object appeared to the right of the first.\r\n\r\nwhile the initial object was remaining still this one appeared to be moving slowly to the right.  both objects then grew intensely bright before quickly fading out of view.  after about 5 minutes the stationary object reappeared in the same location.  it sat there again for a few minutes, grew very bright and then quickly faded away.  this repeated numerous times over the course of about 45 minutes.  the second object wouldn't always appear but when it did it was always in a different portion of the sky.  sometimes it appeared to traverse a great distance in a very short period of time.  twice the objects appeared right next to each other while another time one was above the other and sometimes when only one was visible the other would fade into view as the other faded out.\r\n\r\ni have been a ufo enthusiast for the majority of my life and have never seen anything i truly believed to be worthy of a ufo claim.  watching these objects i felt completely ecstatic and excited.  i should also mention that about a dozen other people i work with observed them too.\r\n\r\nsomething i find fascinating is that they appeared in the portion of the sky where i believe the infamous objects did in 1942 during 'the battle of los angeles'.  also that they seemed to be over the water and near catalina island which i've read is a uso & ufo hot spot.\r\n\r\nanyways, i just wanted to share and hope i'm not the only one!\r\n\r\n- zack whitford\r\n\r\np.S.  i see someone reported seeing a bright disc in the sky not far from where i am on nov. 22, two nights ago.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

flying in a v shape.  realizing it was dark and the geese would have to be glowing i realized it was about fifty lights compact relatively close together in a large v shape.  they were rather dim and white but with a slight light green tint to them.  they did not blink or strobe but seemed as if they had free will to move as they please while still staying in a v position, much like a bird.  i heard no noise whatsoever and it was up about where you would see birds flying.  i realized after about ten seconds that what i was seeing was extraordinary.  the lights went over my head and i watched it disappear into the horizon.  as it went away the shape looked like a strait line as a v would look from the back but and more of a hook on the left side.  i don't know how fast it was going, it wasn't going too fast but fast enough that between the time i saw it and it moving into the horizon i would say it took between a minute and a minute and a half.  it kept steady pace and did not seem to drop or rise in elevation.  i do not claim to have seen a ship or saucer for i saw no metal or frame.  all i claim to have seen was lights but as close as it was i should have seen a frame.  i was actually not scared but quite excited about what happened.  i have never seen a ufo before and would say i am a \"open-minded skeptic\", but what i saw was not an airplane, at least not as we know it.  it was the weirdest thing i have ever seen.  i have searched for other videos or pics or descriptions and haven't seen one quite like this...It was up very close and very surreal.  it felt like i could reach out and touch it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"For about two weeks rr, ru, j and i heard on the radio station kq 106 reports of u.F.O. activity around kearney, lexington and north platte, which are cities of nebraska.  the most reported observations were a bright multicolor object near lexington.  this bright light was reported being seen every night at 9 o���clock pm to the southwest.  we read the kearney hub newspaper which had an article about this object in lexington and in another news paper an object landing at or hovering at north platte���s air field which radar did not detect but witnesses called it in to police station.  other reports in the one of the papers and radio stations were of objects that made red streaks, even in the day time, right down main streets of lexington and north platte.  we even listened to a guy calling in to the radio, chasing one by kearney near cotton mill park west of kearney.\r\n\r\n 2.  i said ���let���s go and investigate this thing tomorrow night and see what the fuss is all about.   maybe if we are lucky we will high jack one and beam up all our friends and beer and destroy all the communist nations and explore the universe.���  they laughed but i just smiled.  we agreed to meet at the fraternity at 7 o���clock pm and leave by 7:30 pm.\r\n\r\n3.   rr arrived as always late at 7:45 pm and drove.  we reached the krazy dicks convenience store at 8:36 pm, which is south of the lexington i-80 interchange.  we got some snacks and pop and met a nebraska state trooper.  rr went over to talk to him about this object that was being reported in the newspaper and radio station.  he told us it was in the south west sky about foot or so above the horizon and to get a good look to go past johnson lake and find a high hill.  ���you cannot miss it because it turns different colors.���  then he pointed the direction and height of the light and asked if we had seen it yet.  rr said ���no, but we are curious to see it.���  then for some strange reason the trooper got mad and stormed off.  i do not know if ru (who did not believe any of this) made a face or gesture.  rr said ���i know a hill where you can see johnson lake and the city of lexington.��� \r\n \r\n4.  we arrived on top of this hill and there was an unharvested corn field to the north of us and pasture land in all the other directions.   you could see somewhat johnson lake to the northwest for it was dusk and the tall corn blocked full view.  it was 9:10pm when we arrived on this hill and started viewing. we saw nothing.  i said ���rr if you had any sense of time we would had seen it.  the state patrolman said it was out there right now and he was pointing out where to look and how high it was hovering.���  then we decided to leave and as we got in the car i saw a light that was as bright as venus but only 12 inches up from the horizon.  i said it is moving or bobbing.  we got gathered together and this light was changing colors from red to yellow, than green and finally blue.  ru said it is venus setting.  i said look out of your corner of your eye and see the action.  j freaked out when she discovered what i was seeing.  rr said he could see it but, ru could not -- we figure he had contacts in.  it was bobbing like a bobber on wavy water and then it would circle two to four times and repeat the cycle.  but if you looked directly at it would be stationary.  ru said he heard a u.F.O. expert that gave a lecture at kearney state college that this object is venus and the atmospheric pressure was changing causing venus to turn colors and make it appear moving around.  i said ���no, because venus sets more to the north and not to the southwest.  don���t you think a state patrolman knows the difference between venus and this light?���  he said ���i do not see it moving or changing color.���  we all argued with him and i said we need to get closer.  \r\n\r\n5.  we headed back to i-80 and ru said ���go straight through lexington to bone road to a hill that overlooks lexington and surrounding area where you can see for miles all around.���  i kept my eyes on the light in the back seat driver���s side and lost it in the trees going around johnson lake.  i said ���ru's plan sounds good to me, for i lost it.���\r\n\r\n6.   bone road got its name from the dirt being off white color and very dusty.  we got to the hill about 5 miles outside of lexington at 9:30 pm.  we could not see the light to the west and scanning the sky we spotted another multicolored object to the north east.  this one was bobbing and circling only at a much faster pace.   you could look at it directly and see the motion, at  which j got scared and hid in the car on the floor board.  ru said ���it is a farm yard light which the light was very low to the horizon.���  i replied ���no, it was slightly higher, about 2 inches off the horizon and the distance looks like it is 20  or 30 miles  away,��� and i pointed to a farm house to the north with a light about 2 miles away and said ���see the difference.���  ru began to be puzzled and confused.  then he said ���betelgeuse is the star!���  i said ���how it can be for it is below the star horizon.���   it was making the same color patterns as before and this light is the same one as the western one.  it had must have moved.  then i got a funny feeling and turned and looked over my shoulder and saw the first one barely above the ground.  it too was bouncing like crazy and circling.  j screamed ���get in the car and let���s get out of here.���  rr, who was her fianc���, said to be quiet and sit still.  then the objects stood still and began to change colors from yellow to red than to green and blue.  they were headed to meet above us and as they came closer the yellow seem to be in front and as it turned away the back was blue.  ru said it is like the rainbow.  they seemed to be about 5 miles away and were as big and bright as a full moon.  we were all in awe and fear and i said ���my wish may come true.���  our heads were looking almost straight up for they had to be at least a mile apart and in full view of our eye sight.  i would guess about a half a mile high.  they were bright white lights and round.  we made some moaning and groaning noises and i said ���what a way to go!��� and ���take no hostages!���  when they got to the closest point, about one eight of a mile or about 6 inches apart, the area around us lit up twice as bright as a full moon and then they shot back to their original positions.  then the westward one disappeared.  the northern one held still like a star.  we looked at each other and realized we were on our knees and we were confused how we got into this position.  j was screaming and lying under the dashboard.  i told the guys ���i think they knew we were here and fled.���  i said ���let���s head for the northern one, for it has to be 20 miles or so northeast.���  ru, familiar with the area said ���it has to be by ansley, nebraska.���\r\n\r\n7.  we hit highway 40 about 10 miles east of eddyville and headed east.  got between eddyville and sumner and dart-like things, i called them, began streaking all over the northern hemisphere.  all directions up from the horizon above the horizon to down straight across east to west and west to east and they had a red streak constantly following the object.  i was screaming ���pull over, pull over.���  ru saw some and said ���it���s a meteorite shower.  i said ���the hell you say -- when a meteorite comes up from the horizon and straight across the sky and has a tail that stays the same length about 3 to 6 inches and it is red!���  i had a few cuss words to get the urgency to pull over and finally we turned off on a road.  \r\n\r\n8.  we had alfalfa fields between the highway and railroad tracks, with clear vision of the horizon with a view to the west, south, and east.   the north had hills and the big dipper was southwest west or over my shoulder, looking straight ahead at taurus constellation.  these little dart things reminded me of the fighter jet exhaust or afterburners we saw one evening before this event.  i believe they were slightly smaller than a fighter jet, but every time they sped up 3 to 6 inch red streaks would appear.  otherwise they were white small round objects and had the brightness and size of jupiter.  if one could imagine using peripheral vision at the whole northern hemisphere one could see what appeared to be hundreds of objects streaking all over.  a freaky and random thing!  we were all amazed at the sight.  i remember looking again over my shoulder feeling the west object must be coming but it never again appeared.  i saw a steel quonset, which would have blocked my vision of it, and the big dipper slightly north of the quonset.  the object could have been behind that building but this was my gut feeling only and none of the dart objects were in that area or southern hemisphere.  i said to the guys, because j was hiding in the car, ���i am going to stop that car i spotted west bound to witness this.���  i took off running to the highway about 100 yards or so and they began to yell at me to look.  i got in the middle of the highway to stop the car and it swerved away as i jumped back and it kept going.  \r\n\r\n9.  i then turned around and saw the most awesome site���they were forming a formation around the big object.  this object or light was twice as big as the little objects.  first formation was a perfect octagon and in the center was the big object.  then the rest, like a magnet drawing things to it, formed a perfect circle around the octagon.  if one again could imagine you could see a line or stop sign shape and a perfect circle and dead in the center a big object or light.   this formation covered north northeast quadrant or in the constellation orion.  your vision looking at would cover three quarters of it; to give you an idea how vast this formation was.  the thing that bugs me is trying to put in a box or having a ceiling which it did not.  i cannot explain the magnitude of the range but simply using the boy scout method in measuring trees by using a sick and lining the top of the tree and using your thumb to mark the bottom and laying it sideways and have someone line up next to the tree and count the steps, depending how wide the steps are, is the length of the tree.  measuring it my mind and sticking a tape measure straight out in front me it would be 2 feet across.  or 1 foot to the center.  laying it down and having a person at 20 miles away or directly under it start walking and counting the paces one can see the vastness of it.  i say 20 miles because the location ru guessed was ansley, nebraska.  my calculations, though i am poor at math, are 1.2 miles per inch.  taking 24 divided by 20 equals 1.2 miles per inch.  this is my educated guess.  knowing this i measured at the time by using fingers from the center to the octagon as being 6 inches and 6 inches from the octagon to the circle.  this is recorded in my first written account.  the bottom of the circle was about 12 inches from the ground.  ru said it covers orion.  now my imagination was turning to astrology and the bible, for this is an omen of something to happen.  this is a message.  \"it is a sign,\" i told them.  of course, ru said \"it is the devil.\"  rr said nothing.  i said \"did you count how many objects are in the circle?\"  no response.  ���24,��� i said!  ���8 to make the octagon and one big in the middle and they are in the constellation orion?���  the total was 33 in all and spaced 6 inches apart from each other.  rr said ���it might be you and you have us in a mass hallucination.���  i said ���how in the hell would i think of this?���  they laughed.  \r\n\r\n10.  now if you see a 24 hour clock, like in the military, the top is 12 am and the bottom 12pm or zero hundred at the top and twelve hundred hours on the bottom.  then the next event happened.  the ten hundred hour object in the circle broke ranks and the object from the octagon at the eight hundred hour point chased the renegade.  it looked like a dog fight and every time they accelerated the red streak would follow.  they went around in circles in all kinds of directions but in an area or box about five inches square and about two or three inches from the ground.  this was bizarre because there was no depth, it was just two dimensional.  then after a few seconds the one in the circle streaked out toward the horizon or fell straight out into space or toward the horizon.  then the other returned to its position in the octagon and they all stayed still for a few seconds and then darted off in all directions.  the main object stayed still like a star.\r\n\r\n11.  by this time it was 3:00 am and we wanted to go to ansley.  but rr needed gas so we headed to his parent���s farm down the road.  about 3:30am we arrived at his parent���s house and woke them up and got binoculars out to see this object.  we all saw that it rotated in a clock wise fashion and had a short tail that sparked like a comets tail.  when the tail faced you it was yellow and as it moved away it turned red then green and away from you it was blue and the pattern ran in reverse as it turned back.  when i got the binoculars and looked at it, the thing or light broke away and the same time everyone yelled it is breaking apart and something is entering it.  which it did and the dart thing entered and it closed.  it was like a cup of water and one swirls the center which opens but still stays intact and after wards gels together again.\r\n\r\n[material having to do with personal beliefs omitted here]\r\n\r\n12.  there was a hog farmer in the area, which one of my friends talked to, and he saw the formation and everything and said he never would speak of it again and would kill my friend if his name got out.  his hogs were acting up about 10pm and went to the farrowing house to see if an animal got in.  he saw the streaks of light and the formation and the dog fight.\r\n\r\n13.  i am sure there are others out there that had to have seen this event, but they are afraid like the newspaper reported.
