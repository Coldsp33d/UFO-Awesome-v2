take shots in the sky to see what they were it dawned upon me that the orbs look to be part of a bigger craft cloaking itself to appear invisible but i could see them slightly rotating in a fixed position the photos agree with what i was thinking as i took numbers a pics in defferent places in the sky,and everytime until the cloud cover blocked my view the objects were there.\r\n    there were a few other things that caught my eye while looking at these pics as there seemed to be something scared out from in the palm tree as i took the shot,whem i took the photos my camera was set on long shutter 15secs and i would set it down on something so it wouldn't move at all not even when i touch the button as i also put timer on it took three pics at a time. so look at the palm tree on the left and when you put the sequence together you will see something don't now what, the first thing i notice was a leave move on the top and the rest didn't, the next was in the second of three pics you see faintly a round object and back towards the tree is it leaving from under one of the upper leaves and i notices the leaf looked pushed back but not like it would have been done by wind. so it's a bit worrying to see but i just want to now if there has been any sittings like this anywhere or other pics around or video fotage will have more photos on youtube

back yard looking at the night sky.  i told him if he looked close he could see satelites as they passed by circling the globe.  we saw two and he was very fascinated.  we then began to locate constelations, the big dipper, the little dipper and so on.  when we looked to the west i noticed what seemed to be a bright star.  i asked my son if he seen it and he replied yes.  then the star moved, i then thought maybe it was a helicopter or plane.  i realized that it didn't have any strobes and it moved from side to side in a zig zag type pattern.  i approximate it was maybe a mile away.  i asked my son, do you see that?  he replied, yes.  i then asked him, what is it doing?  he replied, zig zagging!  i wanted to make sure that i, was not seeing things!  since it was at a distance we could not hear any type of engine noise.  we could not make out a shape at this time, just points of very bright light.  the movement of this vehicle was very precise, it seems to be scanning the area.  to describe it, it seemed like it was suspened from a string because it never changed elevation.  the movement reminded me of a computer printer, sharp precise side to side irratic motion.  within seconds it was approximately 100-200 yards away, and now we could see that the points of light formed a triangle or diamond type shape.  that is when it basically stopped in mid air!!!  there still was not a sound, complete silience and now it was moving toward us very slowly unlike anything i have ever witnessed.  this object was not flying, i am not an expert on flying, but i do know planes and helicopters must maintain a certain air speed to maintain lift.  planes bank when they turn and make a distinct noise.  helicopters can hover and make tons of noise.  this was not a hover, just a complete stop.  then it seemed as if the vehicle could see us and it began to head towards us.  at that point i admit, i was scared, i grabbed my son by his shirt and pulled him off the trampoline heading to the front of the house where everone else was located.  the whole time i kept a visual on the object and it then turned sharp towards the north and in a second or two it was gone.  once in the front of the house we asked had anyone else seen what we had.  everyone looked at us like we were crazy. both my son and i were very excited and scared at the same time. if i had to guess the size of the object was approximately 30-60ft in diameter with points of light on the either three to four corners.  to this day i ask my son about that night and he remembers it like it just happened.  to say the least it has made and impact on both of us.  we both concluded that it was definitely a u.F.O. not a plane, helicopter, blimp, hot air balloon, firework, flare, lantern, etc.  i wish i had not become frightened so i could have observed it longer, but my instinct to protect my son kiked in because i honestly did not know what we were witnessing.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501

and left of orions belt what appeared to be the constellation pleiades (not sure) but left of orions belt for sure, and low in the night sky after dark. the backwards shaped 7 (might have been pleiades) seemed to blink down from top to bottom, when looking through a pair of good binoculars, there was 4 faint stars above it, that would flash and the entire inside shape of the diamond would fill in as if it were all lit up and filled in. as the night sky continued, the object rotated up with the rest of the stars and constellations until around 11 - 12 pm, it would be very high in the sky. we were looking east south east at the time of the initial viewing on the 10th or so. it was there every night, except on the cloudy nights. the cabin is very remote, and there is little if any light pollution so the stars are very visible to the naked eye. \r\n\r\nthis object had no regular pattern to its appearance (the diamond), and didnt appear at specific intervals, only random. it appeared to be a diamond above the backwards 7 (maybe pleiades). we looked at it for over an hour total on several different occasions. we have been going there for over 20 years, and never seen this \"diamond shaped object\" appear ever before.\r\n\r\nwhat is it, and what did we see?\r\n\r\nsorry, we have no pictures or video of

above my neighbor's two story house.  out from behind their roof suddenly drifted something with three large, red, steady lights with a white strobe flashing. the apparent size would be length of your thumb held at arm's length. the separation and size of the red lights was like if you positioned three pennies in a triangular pattern with  maybe a half-dollar in between them.  they were a steady red, not real bright.  there was a fairly powerful white strobe located inboard of the three red lights but much closer to the top light in the triangle.  the strobe was flashing for approximately 1/30 of a second in approximately one second intervals. if it was a helicopter, using a typical helicopter as a yardstick, it would have been no more than 100 ft. from me and drifting at no more than 100 ft altitude.  there was absolutely no sound.  at that hypothetical distance the three red lights would have been more than 18\" in  diameter. again, at the hypothetical distance of 100 ft the craft would have been going 25 mph or less, which seems like it would be below the stall speed of any fixed-wing craft.\r\n\r\nalthough it seemed like a helicopter going by that close would have made a lot of noise, i went ahead and checked the federal aviation administration (faa) website to see what the regulations are for collision avoidance lights for helicopters.\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is an excerpt from the faa regulations for rotorcraft (helicopters)\r\n\r\n\"(c) flashing characteristics. the arrangement of the system, that is, the number of light sources, beam width, speed of rotation, and other characteristics, must give an effective flash frequency of not less than 40, nor more than 100, cycles per minute. the effective flash frequency is the frequency at which the rotorcraft's complete anticollision light system is observed from a distance, and applies to each sector of light including any overlaps that exist when the system consists of more than one light source. in overlaps, flash frequencies may exceed 100, but not 180, cycles per minute.\r\n(d) color. each anticollision light must be aviation red and must meet the applicable requirements of ���27.1397.\"  \r\n\r\nso the lights have to be red but they must be flashing lights.\r\nthe lights outside my bedroom window were not flashing at all but a steady red. they were also larger than any running lights i have ever seen on any aircraft.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20665,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.1688768,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11222009-0015","longitude":-105.0940575,"occurred":1258783500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258944129000,"summary":"Three
