past the thick pines and oaks so i could see the stars and perhaps some \"shooting\" stars. the night was very clear and cold.\r\ni was driving about 15 mph looking up at the sky out my windshield when a light to my left caught my eye. looking out my (driver's) side window i caught sight of a round light going faster than i -comming from behind me on my left just above the tree line-it was angled downwards. i saw it between some if the trees and then it went behind the trees and the mountain to my left. my first thought was that thing is going to \"go down\"-meaning hit the ground-but then my brain finally caught up to the event and i almost felt sick to my stomache. it had a light of it's own-no \"sparkle\" like a star. more like a flat kitchen light with a lense-a perfect cirlce of opaque light. there was no tail, no streaks, no sparkle.  it must have been huge-it came from higher up but dipped below the tree line-instead of looking the size of a speck like a star or an earing stud like a planet-this filled my vision like a baseball just outside my window would.The area it went over is blm property-so it was not a house-and it just wasn't that kind of light. \r\ni stopped the car for a moment-trying to see if there was any kind of fireball-i saw none. i was shaking, but took off toward the area it went to see if i could see it again-the road ran out-and it is all wilderness and a river gully-i never saw any hint of it again. i went up to a higher spot but saw nothing. i still can't quite grasp what i saw. i know i saw it-just can't get my brain around it because there is no explanation for that kind of a light behaving in that way. the only \"earthly\" explanation would be that beal afb is about 45 miles away-and they perhaps were testing something not meant to be seen. it was no airplane headlights and not a meteor. i've seen planty of both. \r\nthanks for listening-had to tell someone-\r\nl. glass","distance":"101-500

here as we live 8 miles from stephenville tx and 10 or so miles from dublin texas. but last night we saw the lights at the same level in the sky ..Id say at least 7 of these.It was around dinner time so i was in the kitchen at first and since the lights had been seen lately we had been looking outside once in a while at night. my husband and i walked out  and were only out for a minute and then we saw them...I guess that was a lucky thing.I didnt have to wonder what it was since these lights have been seen here off and on for quite a while now...Guess they like the dairies around this area of texas.The rather round orange lights (that look almost all the same size)just last a few seconds then they disappear.Of course your real excited when we are seeing these lights..And then they are gone (maybe not really gone, just change position so we can no longer see them)..Almost always afterwards we see the blinking of jets and hear the jets coming in the area.Since we had had some news only a couple of weeks ago about the unexplained lights again in the stephenville paper people in this area start looking around at night again to see ufos.Actually we had seen the lights last october and were waiting for this october to look again ..But it was cloudy most of the month.Now it is november and we saw them last

was walking on the sidewalk in my neighbourhood which was very quiet at the time in the city of granby in the province of quebec and came to the street corner close to my home. at that moment, the corner of my left eye caught attention of an object in the sky coming in my direction. i estimate it was about 300-500 feet in the air or 5-7 average trees in comparable elevation.  the object, a fireball, was traveling slowly, perfectly horizontally and without a noticeable trail of smoke. there was no smell of burning.  there was no sound at all coming from it. in consideration of its elevation, i approximate the size as about 75-100 feet in diameter, or about the size of a small house.  \r\n\r\nwhat was disquieting about it was its slow speed and its size.  from my available perspective, it took maybe 6 to 8 seconds to travel the distance from when i first noticed it to when it disappeared.  i estimate this distance to be 1500 feet calculated with the help of about 20 houses on the street from my left to my right of the street corner. it disappeared then out of my sight above the houses to my far right.  astonishment was my reaction and i went back home. i always thought it would have been a meteor of some kind and i expected something out of the news or newspapers the next day but nothing noticed was ever mentioned about it. in view of its size, i always thought that if it touched ground somewhere, it would have done some damage and thus reported.

(this was in a dream?) something landed on a runway while this thing hovered. there was a distant vacuum cleaner/microwave sound coming from it.\r\nthen it was like i saw another craft coming in for a landing, but an object on the ground rolled out for it to connect to. then it was pulled along the runway and i saw some type of guard person turn around and look at me. i immediately opened my eyes and was in bed, but i still heard the sound. immediately after i opened my eyes there was some kind of blue beam about the diameter of a large honeydew melon that pulsed at my neck/shoulder region 3 times in about a 2 second instance. i could feel it, not painful, but was tingly and i know i was awake at that point. i looked at the clock and it was 3:15 am.\r\n\r\ni laid awake on bed awake for a couple of hours before going back to sleep.\r\n\r\ni looked at the ceiling the next day but didn't see anything unusual.\r\n\r\nthis was unique and unlike any of my previous experiences from years ago which were all similar, but even though it apparently was a dream, i was awake when the beam thing happened, no doubt in my mind at all.\r\ni am a high level it engineer of sound mind with a happy family. i don't know what this was but it happened, and i know there is something going on. \r\n\r\n3 days ago my 4 year old woke me up at 3:33 am crying and very scared, complaining that he had a nightmare about a scary man who took him into space. this bothers me because i am a christian and i am trying to understand the nature and source of these experiences. i never really had a \"good vibe\" from my experiences. \r\ni have never reported anything to anyone before outside of certain close friends and family. anyways hope this helps somehow.\r\n\r\nwhen i was a child, it always started with an array of vertical light bars moving across the wall in front of me, followed by feeling like i was sliding out of myself and floating to the ceiling. there were things around my bed doing something to my body. i have one faint memory of being submerged in a tank full of green liquid with black hose things everywhere, and other people too. one other memory that stands out is a bunch of little white guys sort of floating and sliding around in what seems like a huge very brightly lit shopping mall. they all had big black eyes just like in the typical descriptions. there were a lot of them. i was about 4 or 5.\r\n\r\nthe rest of those types of experiences consisted of feeling paralyzed after \"sliding out of myself\" and feeling very afraid, and feeling strange pressures on my legs or hips just before waking up. i would also always have a blood pool on my pillow  and sheets as my nose would be bleeding profusely.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20614,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0277031,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11192009-0016","longitude":-96.6958656,"occurred":1245913200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258686809000,"summary":"Viewing

see if it would appear again, in doing so we observed the same light turn on again, then a second one appeared to the left of it. they appeared to be hovering at first glance. we then pulled over to watch them, then within approximatley 15-20 seconds they turned off again. i then took out my iphone and began recording what was happening. at that time one appeared again in view, this is whan i started recording and then another one appeared, then 3, 4 and 5 bright yellowish tint lights about a 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile above the mountain range. at this point it looked as if to take a v shape form. then about 20-30 seconds later they started to turn off again. at this point a nh state trooper had pulled up behind us and came to my window to ask what we were doing, i asked him if he had seen these lights? he responed yes, he says, i noticed two bright yellowish lights about 2 miles back, i ask him if there were any military manuvers going on in the area and he said no. he said at first i thought it might be a plane but these lights appeared to be stationary with little movement. plus he said he listened for any noise but could not hear anything. i also ask him if this could be flares and he siad no, not here in the national forest, plus he said if they were flare you could see them slowly decending with an alluminated trail. at this point he said we had to move on cause we were in a break down lane and that this was not an emergency so we had to leave. now i know there was a meteor shower going on that night, however i have seen plenty of meteor showers in my life and those are showers are in above the earths atmoshere. these lights were visible a half mile to one mile above the the mountain range. these were had notthing to do with a meteor shower. they were way

macdill afb in tampa or to the pencicola afb on the panhandle of fla.The sonic booms came from the west of me over the gulf area. but never 3 days in a row.  i was not scared, just a little up set on the 17th of november that the booms upset my pups. they were in their beds when they heard the booms, and were alarmed. they have  never alerted to things like this before.. only to some one comming to the door or something in the yard at night.(deer, wild critters that come into the yard at night)i was in the livingroom kitchen area prepairing meals when i heard the booms.I can hear comercial jets go over and have heard sonic booms before, but never 3 days in a row.From the gulf to the west of me. ( i live 20 miles from the gulf.)it made me a little anxious to think that the booms would upset my two pups so. it took me a minute or two to get them calmed down. as i think back now my two cats were affected by the actions of my two dogs as well. they became aggitated as well.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":20605,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.062361,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11192009-0008","longitude":-83.1696678,"occurred":1258398720000,"potentialRelations":[20604],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258642308000,"summary":"On november 16 , 17, 18 i heard sonic booms.  to the west of me over the gulf region.

(smoke on a rope)????                                        on sat. oct. 25 after a rainy day the clouds were finally clearing, only a few dark clouds over the gulf about 7:30 i was out with my pups for a break. there was a dark black cloud over the gulf area like a sideways y (the two arms pointins south) there was a small flash that caught my eye. there seemed to be a bright orb (yellowish gold in color could have been feflecting the sun as it was nearly sunset)skimming along the bottom side of the cloud doing what i would call a figure 8 among the clouds edge.. it only lasted a few seconds.The orb did about 3 of its loops and was gone. just long enough to catch your attention but short enough to make you wonder if you really saw anything.I was curious about both events. i was not afraid, but the sonic booms did upset my dogs, they also heard it. and they normally do not bark unless some one or some thing is outside the house in the yard.They allert to the deer and other night critters that visit out yard but this time it was different.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with
