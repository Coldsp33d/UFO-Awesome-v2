but more near dublin with my four year old and 12 week old in the car with me.  it was not long after i turned off of county road 242 which i had been heading north, on to another county road, i believe it is county road 381 heading south east.  it was not long after i turned onto county road 381 that i noticed two bright lights in the sky.  out of the view from my windshield the light to my left was slightly higher.  my initial reaction was that they were planets, they were orangish in color and they were larger than star.  i slowed down and leaned forward in my seat to investigate what i was seeing.  i soon realize they were far too large to be planets almost as soon as i came to this realization another light appeared above and to the left of the light on my right and then another light appeared above the new light and to its left forming a straight line at about a 45-60 degree angle.  the lights were stationary in the sky never moving. as the new lights appeared i started freaking out.  as you well know ufo sightings are prevelant in our area and i could not believe that i could be possilby witnessing it for myself. probalby second after the new lights appeared they faded beginning with the first light on my left and then they were all completly gone.  once the lights on the left started to show up i did not pay as much attention to the light on the far right.  i do not believe it changed but do not recall when for sure it faded although i know it was within seconds of the other lights.  in all the event took place in probably less than 2 minutes.  the thought of the ufo sightings did not occured to me as the third and fourth light appeared but it was really the manner that the lights faded that convienced me that i had just witnessed something strange.  i was very excited and shocked about what i had just seen and got on the phone to share it with my husband immediatly.  my outgoing call to him was at 7:44 p.M.   therefore i approximate the sighting took place at 7:42 p.M.\r\ni just recieved word via facebook that a friend of mine also witnessed lights in the sky this evening although i do not know the specifics of their

sunset.  as we looked out at the sun dipping below the horizon we all noticed what looked like to be an ordinary plane from a distance.  we thought that because the way it was flying steady and linear, but what kept my interest was how low the reddish orange glowing object was flying. it wasn't very big it was about pea sized from my perspective. it maintained it's path and we all could hear no audible noise.  my friends didn't take it seriously as a \"unidentified flying object\" at first until they realized that if it was a plane we would have heard it from since it was so close.  it was difficult to judge how close the object was and plus i'm bad at estimating measurements.  it was about 350-400 yards away, about 200-300 feet above the treeline.  it was traveling at about 25-30 miles and hour and it traveled from west to east and it went out of our sight over the hills.  so once my friend ray could no longer deny it being a ufo he pulled out his cellphone and took a video of it.  since i have filed this report i have not been able to get a hold of ray through his phone(probably didn't pay his bill) so i'll have to go visit him personally to try to retrieve the cell phone

it's hard to explain. one second they weren't there, and the next, they were. large and round in shape, they appeared all at once in the sky and lasted for roughly 3-5 seconds before disappearing, one at a time. i stopped my bike and thought that it must have been fireworks or something. and then, about 3 minutes later, it happened again. bright round orange lights, appearing in a semi-circle pattern in the sky. after 4 seconds or so they disappear, always one dimming then the next, and finally the last. i then took my cell phone out and the next time they appeared, roughly 4 minutes later, i took a video clip. i caught the tail end of their act, only about a second worth of footage. but you can clearly see something there, and then fading out. they appeared about 4 times at the

area. the large lights started to ascend into air while they would be vivid orange and then pitch black. it looked like it was almost generating energy during black stage because when lights would appear again it looked somewhat glitched, then lights spun around which looked like a half circle to boomerang shape and became more vivid. the lights them self looked like as if looking into a conical shape of a flashlight. it went very fast into a westward position and went black and gone. next we looked up trying to find it and it was gone but 5 planes/jets were in the area above it. we have always watched the sky in this area, because last while coming home in same area  on january 28 and 8:40pm, we {all 5 people in my family} were driving west to get to hwy 37 when i looked up to the west in the sky and said \"oh my god look its a ufo.\" my kids began to panic and scream and my husband freaked out after seeing it. i wanted to stop and watch because i was excited, but my family was screaming and trying to rip themselves out of the car. at this time the object was moving in a west to eastward position. it was very large it started with 3 large orange lights, then went black & seemed to hover and then fanned out into about 9-12 lights. it was as well, boomerang to half-circle shape moving at a good speed after it was done hovering.  we kept driving because my family was freaking out. we watched that for about 2-3 minutes as well. so from this event last year to this event yesterday my family tends to always watch the sky in this area.

i coudn't believe my eyes, this gigantic machine was just floating in the air shining it's lights, i waited for my fahter to say something like \"oh that's just a blimp with lights\" or something like it but he just stood there with his mouth open. \r\n\r\nit was a big craft hovering, no sound, and everyone who was out on the street could see it. this wasn���t some bright light in the sky moving behind trees, this was something you could see very clearly, no clouds in between it and us, very close and you could see the fuselage or metal that it was made of because of the reflection of it���s flashing lights on it. the craft wasn't completely flat, it's shape was part concave and part convex, as when you take a piece of paper hold it infront of you and pull the top part towards your face, this curvature is what reflected light illuminating the craft's body. it had a wide row of lights aroun it's outer edge or diameter and then a shorter row of lights above that and another set of lights below the wider row. some other lights blinked very fast others slower. yes, it was that close that all of us could actually see it's structure, so it wasn't just some set of lights hanging on some wires or some balloon or blimp flying by.     \r\n\r\ni remember very clearly because at the time i had no preconception of what ufo���s were so i looked at it with a clean slate, not thinking it was ���this or that��� , i just observed and took in every little detail. we stood there for a about ten or 15 minutes and some people where saying that this thing had been there for a while now. my parents grabbed me and ran back into our home in fear. they closed all the windows and kept asking each other ���what is that?��� i���ve never seen my parents as scared as they were that night. you could feel the fear or anxiety of everyone who was witnessing the event. \r\n\r\nafter witnessing this event, which must have been seen by thousands that night, i don't know what all the fuss is about the phoenix lights. \r\nit's a pitty that in the 70's camcorders weren't available like they are today because this ufo i saw that night would have been the most undeniable proof of intelligent life visiting earth because of how close it was to the ground, how clearly you could see it's fuselage and all the lights in it, and how it looked like something with mass and not just some massless row of bright lights blinking on an off. \r\n\r\n \r\n      \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":20587,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":18.3775963,"location":null,"logNumber":"PR-11182009-0015","longitude":-66.1580374,"occurred":78118320000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258584688000,"summary":"Gigantic disc with dome, flashing lights white, blue, green.

from the time i first noticed it moved and it couldn't be a star i was amazed. i knew it was something out of the ordinary and was so upset we did not get a telescope in time.  plese let me know if others reported this. i know for sure that many planes in the area that night flew by. those pilots had a great view.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":20586,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.955685,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11182009-0014","longitude":-75.158309,"occurred":1258444800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258584372000,"summary":"Very low star, not twinkling, moved slowly over a period of a few hours.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:169336"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Wife and i were just exiting vehicle at stovepipe wells village (death valley, ca) at around 1735 hours on 11/17/2009.  my wife said what���s that pointing to the east at an large object stationary in the sky.  the object appeared to be oblong in shape and a bright rust-orange color. it looked like separate lights  (you could see dark between the lights making it look like segmented lighting) lined up in a row slightly curved to the east.  the object  brightened in intensity then faded quickly and was not visible (this sighting lasted 7-10 seconds).  we both watched the area and then within 15-20 seconds the same type of object started to appear again approx. 6 miles south-east (again over the armargosa range) of where this last object had disappeared from. it was not as bright and faded quickly and was not visible (this second sighting lasted maybe 4-6 seconds).    \r\n\r\nthe object appeared over the amargosa mountain range in death valley (the ridge line of the mountain was still quite visible).  i did a compass bearing after the sighting which was 29 degrees (declination set to 15 east) from stovepipe wells village. the line of sight runs from stovepipe to corkscrew peak  (amargosa mountain range) to north of beatty nevada. \r\n\r\nwe watch the international space station and space shuttle quite often from here. neither of these were visible tonight in the death valley area (11/17/2009) in checking the human space flight site.   \r\n\r\nthe size of the object is what amazed us!

bright to be a star) behind the building that i live in. these lights were side-by-side at maybe a 15 degree angle to each other. the light on the right started to dim and turn black then a couple of seconds later would appear to the left of the other light..Then the one that was now on the right did exactly the same thing. it continued this pattern for maybe 30 seconds. i thought they were flares at first but they were not descending and the blinking on and off was too methodical. it was not twinkling. anyway i ran upstairs to tell my boyfriend to look out the back porch but then it was gone.. i kept looking for a minute and i saw some plane lights. but this was much to close to the mountain to be a commercial plane and there was no sound. it was moving pretty slowly for a plane and the lights were not consistent like a plane. it was very twinkly red and white lights but dim like it was very far away. it moved to the west for a ways then the lights went to a solid dim white light..Continuing on the same path then disappeared. i told my boyfriend about it while we were still on the porch..Just as i was explaining the plane thing we saw a very bright white light! (as big and bright as sirius looks sometimes) it flew right over our house crossing main st. very quickly and the light just dimmed out before it went out of sight. all of this happened within five minutes or so of when i first noticed it. i just found out that my friend that was coming back to town from lancaster had seen the same thing around 6:00 as well! she described seeing the orange lights blinking in the same fashion as well. if these were just flares or something i would love to know how a simple flare can change it's position after it dims out..","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":20578,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3110625,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11182009-0006","longitude":-71.7677985,"occurred":1258509900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258561631000,"summary":"Two orange lights slowly blinking on and off and a \"fake plane\"","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Littleton, New Hampshire","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:169344"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":null,"country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hello i run a website called www.Mabusincarnate.Com for over 7 years i have been discussing ufos and the paranormal. i have never really talked to mufon.\r\nbut someone told me i should turn in my report to you guys. so here i am. i have seen ufos for over 15 years. i believe for some odd reason i attract them and many witnesses agree. so i made my site above to find out information and gather data. i have interviewed william birnes from ufo hunters and many other folks there in our chat room. plus we have a paranormal magazine called continuum. i would love more info about mufon. i would also be interested in interviewing one of your guys sometime for the website. just wanted to say hi and turn this in thank you. jeffery pritchett: founder of mabus incarnate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew ufo sighting 621pm. florida, panhandle. with 2 witnesses. tonight i had a ufo sighting. four objects red and blinking oddly. they flew very close to each other. all 4 objects and then two flew away. four sphere like objects moving insanely close to each other. strangest sighting i have had since my first sightings many years ago. i need a video camera and do not know anything about them. what kind of video camera would pick up ufos in the sky? i friggin need one and the right one like really soon. contact me please if you know about video equipment or speak here. it must be able to pick up aerial phenomena. i have no doubt of what i saw with witnesses. just need to get it on film. i don't have much cash so just gathering data. i haven't had a sighting this odd in many moons..But have definitely seen similar things in my past.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20577,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6728974,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11182009-0005","longitude":-81.5142335,"occurred":1038643200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258561481000,"summary":"Ufo sighting 621pm. florida panhandle. with 2 witnesses.

was in the hospital, when i noticed a very bright what apeared to be a star a great distance east from us, but it was brighter then any other star in the sky so it caught my eye. as i stared at it for a minute i noticed it was moving ever so slightly, so i said to my brother hay do you see that bright star its moving we stoped and stared at it for a minute and he said bullshit so we kept walking but for some reason i kept looking back to it and noticed it was moving so i said to him no stop for a minute it is moving so we both stoped and started looking at it, i said to him it is moving isn't it, then it went from 12 oclock to about 9 oclock in under 2 seconds stoped went straight up for a long way stoped returned to its starting point and started heading to us from the distance this thing was from us i would say it went 150 miles in under 2 seconds 3 times and now it was heading our way i asked him what is that a helicopter he said i dont think a helicopter can go that fast so there we were standing and staring at this light trying to figure out what it was ruling out anything we knew of that could move like this thing just did. this is where the story goes off the deep end as it got closer we noticed not only the color but the size of this craft it was huge like 3 football fields big as it got streaght overhead it stoped and there we were staring up at the bigest thing i have ever seen in the sky it made no sound at all it stoped for about 20 seconds then continued over the mountain north west of us over virginia city we told our folks and big supprise they didnt beleive us i have only told a handfull of close friends over the years 30yrs to be exact and my brother and i talk about it from time to time i did talk to a guy about it ounce that told me he saw it to but he was drunk leaning against a poll in vc and didnt beleive what he had just seen funny it was about the same time i think he saw it go over him after we did or he could have just been jerking my chane. eather way i know i saw what i saw nothing will change that. and what we saw i couldnt tell you but what i do know is i havent seen anything like it sense. well somthing kind of like it but i
