i had three friends with me and we all watched this thing for well over an hour. not a chance in hell this was any type of man made object or equipment; zero -- none just to set that part straight... i know heavy equipment well, and farm equipment and the like, and this was none of the above; it was not anything man made. we all agreed on that after a long lengthy discussion on this sighting. we decided to keep quiet about this unanimously 30 years ago out of fear others would think we were crazy.... crazy or not; its time to tell the story.\r\n  very late at night while parked on the side of a country road in my custom van playing cards and drinking a few beers (we were all around 21 at the time and no one had an apartment or our own place yet, so we used my van to get together in) we noticed this thing out in a snow covered field when getting out to take a whiz... there was major snow on the ground. it was a clear night. it made no sound or noise at all and was dead silent. it was around 400/500 feet away from us out in this field, just in front of a tree line. level ground, no obstructions at all. no wind, no snow or rain at the time. we had a clear and direct view of it. it was absolutely huge, and towered over the treeline it hovered in front of. we viewed it through some field glasses i had in the van and up close it was just this very bright yellow glowing light energy. no light bulbs or the like; every bit of the entire structures shape was illuminated in a bright dense yellow light, the edges were clearly defined and sharp; it illuminated the trees behind it and i could see into the branches of the trees behind it with clarity due to the brightness of the light. we had made a drawing of it.\r\n   it was the shape of two huge circular spoke type wheels side by side, each at least 150 feet in diameter (by the size of the mature old growth trees behind it) each wheel rotating slowly and moving in and out towards a center pivot point, then back out, changing the direction of rotation every now and then, all very slowly. it was about 25 feet or so off the ground with no connecting structure touching the ground of any kind. the rotation was odd as the wheels turned contrary to any rolling motion as they went in and out from the center point between the two wheel structures. it had a dual beam like connecting structure between the two large wheel shapes with a central pivoting point. as a unit the whole thing turned end up a few times, one wheel over the other, then went slowly back down to side by side. best description is it was kind of similar to a double-decker ferris wheel in a way. this was not any ferris wheel. (especially not out in the middle of winter in an empty fallow field at 3am...) i searched the area the next day to see if i could gain access back to where it was at and it was impossible. there were no access or fire trail roads, driveways, farm roads, or anything. there were no houses nearby or barns or any kind of structure. (that's why we parked out there; there wasn't anybody we would bother and the cops never came out that way.) no power lines or towers are out there either; nothing. as said this is just a huge fallow field with a old windbreak tree line out back. the field had very tall field grass that was matted down heavy with snow and it was simply impossible to walk through this to get out there, i tried very hard to do this, but it was not humanly possible on foot. the object was long gone the next morning four hours later. i wanted to try and see what it had been doing. it looked like maybe it was doing something with the ground or those trees behind it, or maybe some kind of self maintenance? who knows? wish i did, i can tell you that much...\r\n   we all watched this a long while as said, just amazed at what we were seeing. (we were not drunk just to set the record straight on that.) it was up to something out there. then it was suddenly unanimous among us; we all got this feeling like this thing was watching us back, almost as if it were examining us, and it really scared hell out of us all. we all became very frightened by it and decided it was time to leave. my friends watched it out the back window of the van as i drove away with the lights off, trying not to draw any attention to ourselves, that's how frightened we all became of this thing. when we got back in town we sat and discussed this for another hour or so. i got no sleep that night and went back out there not long after to investigate as said above. it was long gone...\r\n   after never mentioning this for thirty years to any of the others (we seldom get together any more) i got together with one of these guys and said i needed to talk to him about something that happened a long time ago when he was with me. strange enough he knew exactly what i wanted to ask him about and spit right out with \"oh you mean the light out in the field that night\".... i was amazed he knew without any provocation. evidently he was thinking of it from time to time himself. one of the others has passed on now, and the two of us are trying very hard to remember who the forth friend was. we will figure it out soon. i will guarantee you they remember this with striking clarity.\r\n   for thirty years i seldom thought of this event. now in the last year it seems to bother me a lot for some reason. don't know why, but i think about it a lot, so i decided its time to tell the story. well there you have it. i would love to talk to you on the phone about this if possible.\r\n","distance":"101-500

  a. for control, so that humans do not go into space to find their non human et bases, cities and ships.   b. because of our souls, this is very complicated to understand  we have a \"soul\", the soul is an atomic particle electric formation that is part of us, but according to all legends and some modern technology the soul can be taken with the use of high frequency high voltage technology. the soul is a vestige of our \"genetic\" past that was a piece, in much the same way our reptilian  lower brain is, of another space et being race. there are several types of et's that can remove this part of your body reptilian, greys(fallen angles \"devils\"), steal it and use it for longevity, for energy, and for their own race studies, just like some  ets do with our dna ovum and sperm, thousands of very well documented cases around the world, i know this reads far off think this through please. c. for dna, and because dna is a resource for them like the soul is, and in many real medical ways!\r\n\r\nthe federation, white brotherhood, reptilian's, grays(fallen angles), ascended masters, midwayers, all of these et recessive demonic and dogmatic societies recruit people aggressively from dark religions;  the art of living, the illuminati, jesus demonic cults, scientology,cults in general, islamic religions, voodoo and african botanic cults and many more religions, too numerous to list, they choose and influence people like puppets and then some to govern us!   the greys are the most hive minded and dogmatic of the societies interacting with the earth and near space i.E. mars!\r\n\r\nthis is important... religion is a legend, *some are factual most are not*, a construct written by various non human\r\ninter dimensional recessive dogmatic et races and by some not so well educated semi-primitive humans, it is very misleading and troublesome, religion  does not help us solve our problems of global warming, cancers, defense against recessive et's, economy...Instead religion focuses on a construct which is incoherent. jesus and god will help,* neither can be further  from the truth (the bible, koran, buddha vedic texts etc. are full of wars initiated by;  (\"gods\"** non human et\"s) never helping but instead killing humans, wwii greys w/ nazis. the earth is in the worst condition ever as is the human race. read the newspapers....And neither jesus, god nor budda is helping us. the churches are filled with pedophiles, (catholic and christian churches i.E. usa arch dioceses settling for billions of dollars and others    evangelist tony alamo for raping young girls, \"the lord is in charge\", mind control etc.  ex-cons, dumb human beings mind controlled people fill our religious and spiritual organizations.. social studies, social support and human directed initiatives are a need, and we are being blinded my mind controlling et\"s.  many people who study history in detail will read about how the church enslaved many cultures to kill, rape, torture and tap into banking and world currencies.   the spaniards (greyet managed) in the holy conquistador wars, the israeli zealots against their neighboring humans, and the nazi (grey) occult war of wwii, the mormon cults(recessive greys) hurting, raping under age girls and on and on.\r\n\r\ni was taken to the \"federation\" caves by  physical barely visible in our spectrum..Beings. i used  infrared/spectrum lenses goggles to see them, including a type of sub-space being, as the attacks went on i compensated as much as i could.  regressive sub-space beings working with greys, called the white brotherhood are the culprits. after my life threatening experiences of many years i learned from the greys themselves buy watching and studying as i was being pulled, (they abducted me for sperm surgical removal, as they do with women's eggs all around the world).\r\nthis is what i know to be true: and our children must begain to arm and defend themselves            against these beings, praying, religions and  african vodoo are not real, and some who try to pray, in a crises, to god are going to keep getting attacked! \r\n\r\n\r\nif you are religious why would, if god did exist harm the pontiff?    hurt the popes by giving them parkinsonism, harm them with neurological disorders and knock them down and fracture their arms as was done with the current pope...These are harmful violent extraterrestrials!!  \r\n\r\n\r\n1). all extraterrestrials are physical carbon based, silicon based, or molecular based beings (all), including the ones who use magnetic field technology to cloak themselves, to travel,and as weapons and to appear as a human. the weapons  i have seen and been subjected too are:  mind control, frequency signal control i.E. \"the tower of babble\", around the world the transmitters are hidden in caves,  and beamed in by grey satellite. some of the \"orbs\" glowing ones seen are either weapons with lasers or frequency attack projections or are recording your brains thoughts and sending the info. to the reptilian greys...We humans desperately need better more advanced detection  in the areas of  detecting magnetic crafts in our atmosphere ( non usa saucers), frequency control detection, field technologies, laser detection and better weapons, better armed military, guns do not work against 6th dimension!!!  i.E. stable plasmon technology. some of these  technologies can be detected with geiger counters, and magnetic field detectors sold \"on line\", directional is preferred..Also passive radar detecting magnetic changes in our atmosphere and around our homes find the electrical devices on them,and around them in their nearby craft. for your homes and cars..Some of the grey and reptilian devices can be disrupted by mhz frequency devices built at home, someone could make a small fortune selling better portable particle and wave detection, and disruption devices for our pockets. ** high voltage tazer weapons work very well.  hand held powerful battery operated magnets,in close proximity can interfere with grey technologies,the size of a cell phone, need to be mass marketed for our protection. magnetic shielding paint can shield a room in your house where no emf or elf is detected!  other races of sub space beings have technology that i have seen, are defended against with hand lasers,  built at home!!    2). critical, we are not the only humans in the universe or multi verse...There are humans from lyra, pleiadians, andromidan, cassiopeia, simion, human confederation and billions more!  3, even more important the grey federation is using religion to \"dumb down\", all of us on earth.   3). all religions have misleading information, there is no god, only extraterrestrials and human support groups from other  worlds, the earths which nasa is just now locating are inhabited. \r\n\r\nour military is being attacked by the greys, (google on the internet to get more info...), and by the reptilian federation all the time, all the time, the shootings at army bases world wide are mind controlled by the\r\ngrey/reptilian federation, as is the sweat lodge incident \"6 hospitalized\", 911, and the current state of our economy and health, chemical atmospheric \"trails\".  pay attention to numbers in the news...When you listen to the news or read the newspapers you will find a numerical correlation that is a sign of the sub-space federation, for example \"13\" soldiers killed in fort hood, \"6\" miners killed in last years coal mining incident, coordinated attacks on the usa  for \"911\".  historically, 13 students killed in kent state in the 1960's.  they use ( 8-120 mhz broadband mind control technologies piggybacked on t.V. cell phone and cable signals, important for you to remember). a strategy used by the greys and others is to mind control, in the name of religions \"allah\", a not so well informed  person into doing the killing or attack on our government. obama needs to know this as he has been manipulated openly by the federated greys, those of us who understand    grey,  reptilian   military mind control strategy and tactics listen closely to his speeches;    for example...Jesus is my mentor and i am speaking with him now, no!!  jesus is dead it was told to me jesus did exist by some et's, but he is dead it's an et who learned earth languages and controlled jesus. these military et beings speak good english too!!!!!!    it is not obamas fault, nor is it hillary clintons fault...It was not president kennedsy fault, but the   grey military federation did kill him in part because the greys and others did not want us in space.\t\r\n\r\n\r\none being had an advanced weapon which i determined was a magnetic laser weapon which would track me as i moved around my home either bio metrically or by implant, i sure would like an idea on how to protect against it?  it feels ***just like being under an extremely strong magnet making it very difficult to move, and think.  i tried grounding myself, and to use nearby shielding to no avail....What an ordeal. this is a weapon we need to defend against...!!!   i did a search to see if i could find something like it, the closest thing i got was raytheon's, \"microwave crowd control beam weapon\", it was not microwaves.  in the caves, and near my home the gray types and reptilian's make many rather high frequency  screeching sounds, like you get on t.V. interference or like the \"brakes of a car\" sound, i believe it's their inter dimensional technologies, using probes to come in and out of the area from their locations to mine.\r\n\r\nit's being done mainly because these other types of et\"s, greys, reptilian snake beings, insectoid  which are more technically advanced and regressive in the way they think and act are working together against humans,           abducting women mainly and men for  experiments etc.     \r\n\r\nas we speak somewhere on earth a child is being abducted for food by the reptilian's, and or for dna by the greys i know!!!  according to all law enforcement agencies their are 100,000's of kids and people missing in the usa every year (where do they all go)?   there are technologies you can buy to protect yourselves, guns, tazers high volts, mind brain protection velostat 3m caps,velostat 3m shielding material also works in many labs with high emf use, buy it at home depot or on the internet, particle detectors, magnetic particle detectors...Critical infrared binoculars, portable magnetic field room detectors. the recessive and violent ets have through chem trails and dropping poisons form the ships into our water supply, use water filters and a/c hepa filters, screwed our government not all of the chemicals in our oceans and local water supplies are human derived, look up chem trails on the net. local, national and regional government  need to do more to protect its population.!!  we must invent better ways of protection against these recessive extraterrestrial races, mind defense technologies and home shielding as well as robots to detect and defend!!!\r\n\r\nhave extra food and defenses at home for your family, it is no coincidence that in the movies on abduction and on aliens we are seeing a lot more of et films, on t.V. \"v\", house, \"2012\", district 9, etc...They are signaling massive problems ahead with recessive non human ets as mankind goes into \"space hotels\", luxury space travel, more military crafts into near and far space., maybe another war?    many people are trying to educate you with films to inform you of the risks we are in!  2012, alien mind control, h1n1 grey federation attacks on humans. \r\n\r\ni don't know weather this is true or not but have been told by greys that earth is entering a ***photon belt*** of\r\nvery dangerous particles, this explains global warming, within the context of a very dormant sun spot cycle. some ancient scriptures, books that i have researched speak about a method by which humans are selected, and \"the belt\" connection opens their souls but not for all humans, astral bodies. it has been presented to me that many societies of ets are going to be speaking to us in the next few years, be extra careful who you stay with, that better et society,\"war of souls\".  very carefully choose to be with human societies!  \r\n\r\nthis is taken,  from melora:\r\nphoton band pleiadian 1995    question: and what about the forecast of the three days of darkness when we enter the null zone? melora: this is when the sun will become fully immersed in the photon band. we discussed this last time, and we wish to move beyond the forecast, for example, of the electricity becoming neutralized and batteries, and cars, and electrical devices no longer working. although this may be true, understand that you are in a state of transformation. at the point at which . . . first there are the days of darkness-- absolute, total darkness--and people are saying, \"well, i'd better lay in some supplies, and water, and get a kerosene heater, and so on. but, you see, given your transformation, you will not need these things. and so we wish to emphasize that focusing your consciousness on your transformation, your transmutation, in the light is the most important.  now the scenario, as you may have been reading in recent books, has changed. and we wish to focus now on the various agendas of the various beings who are \"spectators in the stands\" in this \"football game.\" our strongest message is this: aim as high as you can in your consciousness. fifth-dimensional pleiadians are going to want to use you as \"human libraries\" so that they can learn from you about dimensions above themselves through you in your connection to the earth. fifth-dimensional sirians are going to wish to help you understand how three-dimensional reality manifests from ideal morphogenic structures so that you can begin now actively to co-create the peace and harmony forecast for your planet. and so, again, they are invested in your becoming fifth-dimensional humans so that they can partake of your experience, but in a different way than that of the pleiadians. sixth-dimensional sirians, of which we are \"one,\" as a group, wish to have you understand that many of you will be returning to dimensions higher than fifth. and so in the barbara marciniak books, for example, her pleiadians are saying \"oh, this is what it will be like when you're a fifth-dimensional human.\" we are saying that you don't have to \"stay\" there. understand that many of you are returning to angelic light resonances, and so forth. and so when you read this material, understand that these are fifth-dimensional beings talking about their agenda, and that happens to be pleiadian. and these are also fifth-dimensional, but they're sirian, and that's a different agenda. and be discerning when you read these materials.  this also applies to information about the photon band. the source of the information, and it is channeled . . . (channeling is one of the few sources that is not controlled by \"world management\" teams, and what not.) channeling often is the most direct source of the truth now--not trance channeling as in the old days. channeling now is conscious, although the channel is in an altered state, connecting directly with the higher self as we are here, and we tell the truth because this [indicating jyoti alla-an] is one of our children, here, and we would not deceive our children--not anyone.  so the scenarios about the photon band and about ascension will be filtered according to the agendas of the beings communicating through the channel. so if a channel is not coming directly from the higher self connection and is channeling a totally other entity who is a fifth-dimensional pleiadian and not in that soul \"hierarchy,\" then that entity essentially can work its agenda through the channeled information. each of you is sovereign; you must discern, because your free will is what keeps you strong in your acceleration. your free will is also what you must always be conscious of so that you are not violated from outside your self. you need to be extremely cautious of where you are looking and who is there as a guide or as an enemy of humans, if you feel pain get out and stop , ask for the human 5th+ dimensional guides,,,  when attacked  as part of the defense use frequencies i.E. different tonal sounds like on a dead radio or on some t.V.'s \"tone\", for hours...Beep..............One of the most violent societies in all places are the short orange brown reptilian's some working with greys, if you are channeling or meditating or remote viewing watch your back !\r\n\r\nany scientist who has atmospheric x-ray, gamma ray detection please let us know about the increase in such particles vs. previous years! % ?  thank  you!  the earth will change violently and dramatically in just a few days, in the years leading into 2012!\r\n\r\nthe grey federation ruined myself and family like they did with alex collier, and billy meier for example mr. meier's has recently, per his web site communicating with us and warning of 2012 and other recessive nonhuman ets. \r\ni know about the many friendly human races who are trying to help us now.  when i was at the grey army here in santa fe, n.M.Base, i did see many things, i have  a phd, i'm a quick learner and  can now read their sumerian type alphabet and words... i was taken on one type of craft they use, how they fly and what they use in them...     ***the saucer shaped craft uses electrical batteries as propulsion power(this is why some are seen charging up on power lines), in the middle of some saucers there is a large circular ceiling to floor barrel structure it contains lithium type batteries extremely high voltage charges. the craft are made of layered and compressed metals titanium  type layered compounds,the outer skin is electrified to reduce and eliminate drag and atmospheric resistance.  inside the saucer is a network of compressed tiny frequency transmitting fiber optics for controls and for on board guidence systems,simple.They use the earths magnetic and gravatational fields to fly *****************************************************\r\nthe copper clinder circles on top of the craft and bottom spin, picture two smaller circular disks on top and bottom spining independently of the saucer. they charge up..That differential of charges interacts with a planets or spaces magnetic field lines for  lift and movement.  the saucers are shielded to prevent explosions and to prevent magnetic field interactivity......(the outer shell is charged up to fly w/o reseistance, \r\nit stings when touched electrical pulse).  i'm not a physics major but did study some engenering. this may be the only way we can build these craft and get off the earth before these earth changes end our civilization!!  not  kidding, google the last few years of forest fires around the world.\r\n\r\nthey are trying to mind control our societies through mhz frequency control, we think in about 11-80 mhz,and they use computers and oscilloscope combo. a type mri  equipment to read thoughts as we read print or as scientist      \r\nreads peaks on a graph, as well as gravitational field technology to beam in false info. \r\n\r\nprotect and shield your brains and spinal cords!!!  all of our military and armed forces should wear velostat 3m (signal protection electrical grounded materials on your head) caps and monitor the frequency changes around them, the government of the usa ours, needs to be informed of the greys methods and take steps to help each other,  protect our families people this is real....(people in britain were not ready, prepared for wwii, study military history )  ...(we have a very weak and complacent military/police/nsa/cia/) the greys have even infiltrated some govt individuals in these agencies.........!!! just because you were in church on sunday and you see people speaking in tongs, falling to the floor, and saying they are talking to god?  there is no god only et groups (mostly the greys are lying about god and impersonating) , et governments. just because our president says, \"thank you jesus, it's mind control.......Pay attention and analyze what is going on in government, it is scary, not human.\r\n\r\nsome more devices which are still being used on my self and home include, some type of beam (laser), because i saw it, and followed up on the net  and found that these beams can turn off all electrical switches including some in our nuclear arsenal.  how is it that these nuclear silo switches are not shielded?  i'm working on electrical shielding for my appliances, etc.\r\n\r\nlove \r\ndan\r\n\r\np.S. this was written under partial duress......They know where i live.        pass the info on.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe federated reptilian/gray/insectoid societies are using harmful technology to harm the human mind, causing\r\nmemory loss and fatigue...Fight back!!, i use the above mentioned technology and when i go out and they start to   harm my body with high intensity back spasm devices  i.E. microwave, particle , mind control. i use my mind and       picture each attacker  being attacked by me,  mental warfare.  they are distracted by loud music, food odors,            perfumes, high intensity flood lights, mace, strobe  lights, and our minds killing them......... i keep a gun and tazer      by my side always now!!!\r\n\r\nlisten to this highly educated and experianced  old man, if you see a craft these are not dolls, these are recessive  violent, harmful, controlling alien males, they have an agenda! read the info. on the net with a grain of salt,  why haven't they come   forward? they will not because of violent abductions, use your logical brain the reptilian greys  are ,\"devils,  depicted correctly in many books of legend, history and many religious books. even the nazis contacted the greys.    protect your brains!!! stay away from them, betty and barney hill were assaulted, all of the abduction cases are  harmful  rape and kidnapping humans, we in the usa have laws against these crimes yet our government turns in another direction. because they control some people in our not yet, \"one world government. get involved the stakes are high.\r\n\r\nspace is much more crowded than most people know, extremely dangerous nasa knows..Our rocket \r\nsystems and defense systems are frail... connect the dots.........2012 we are getting close, climate change, biology, secret governments,   mind control, abductions,  alien technologies genetic and magnetic fields, and we wonder where they come from reverse designs from crashed ufo...Many historians believe  that many earth human races i.E. mayans lived with et reptilian control.. i'm building a small back yard underground shielded shelter for my wife  don't laugh at me i have been through a great ordeal and know much more than most!\r\n

estimate the magnitude very well, but they were brighter than the stars in that region, but they did not seem as bright as, say, mars. what made me stop and recognize them is the equality of magnitude and the fact that they were not twinkling. no twinkling means not a star, and in such close formation and not near the ecliptic meant they were not planets. i should note that the triangular formation as i saw it was maybe the size of a large orange if i held it at arm's length. the formation did not appear to be a perfect triangle from my perspective. there were two lights that appeared to line up north to south. the third looked like it was a little west and slightly north to make it non-iscoceles, if this makes any sense. i decided to scrutinize this a bit longer since the sight was very odd. i think i observed the lights in a stationary pattern for about 10-15 seconds. no sooner had i stepped into a good viewing spot, ducking away from a nearby streetlight, the light closest to the north pole started to move toward the south. very slowly it broke the stationary triangle, and it appeared to be going a similar speed as a visible satellite would. naturally, i thought then that this could very well be a satellite, but what of the other two lights that appeared to be stationary? why no twinkling? i then noticed that the moving light, not changing speed by much, started to slowly veer toward the southwest. what i mean is that it is possible that the light slowed down slightly as it veered, but not by much. by this time, the moving light was now (if at arms length) maybe a half of a foot to a foot in distance. now that it was changing course so drastically, i was convinced that this was not a satellite. as soon as that first moving light started to veer, i set my eyes back to the other two lights and noticed they were now moving toward the north, at the same speed as the first moving light but in a near-opposite direction. in less than maybe five seconds, the two started to fade from sight. i might say that while the lights during most of this time were pure white, it appeared that the two lights moving together and now fading together started to twinkle slightly and maybe show flashes of blue. since the lights were so small and so faint, it was hard to discern distinct color in such a short amount of time. i tried to find the original moving light, the one that veered toward the southwest, but i could not spot it. i venture to guess that it faded into blackness, as well. i will add that this whole incident took place during a span of maybe 20-30 seconds. it was quick, and mind-boggling given that i could fairly easily assess that these were not stars and not satellites. i will attest that i could judge that the lights were indeed moving because i had the backdrop of a carport, trees and some \"telephone\" wires in the vicinity. it was easy to see that these lights were moving, if you happened to be paying attention. i can also attest that i was sober, that the night was cloudless, that there did not appear to be any flight activity from the afb nearby and that there was nothing other than what i have described above. in no more than maybe five minutes, i called someone who is fast becoming an armchair believer of visitations from those out in space, and he stated that it is very possible that i saw ufo activity. i did a little internet research in the next day. this led me to the mufon page, and i noticed that someone in sahuarita noticed three(?) lights. but those were colored, not white. i don't know that we saw the same thing. naturally, i felt a little stirred, because if no one else saw these lights, i felt validation in the fact that there are some strange things hovering above us. this is further evidence that we are not alone, as campy as that sounds. \r\n\r\ni sincerely apologize for not only having provided some approximations in my observations, but i do not have the kind of technology to have captured any of this for the record. no images. but then, i doubt that i would have caught any because i normally wouldn't carry a camera or otherwise. thank you for this opportunity to get my report out there.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On the 1st of november at approximately 7.40 pm we were driving back from the matlock area in derbyshire. it was an extremely clear night, i had strong intuition that i should keep my camera with me, i sadly ignored that intuition and stuffed it into the boot. a decision that i would later regret heartily. we had driven for about 15 minutes when i became aware of a very bright light in the sky. planes fly overhead all the time and i guess this night was no different than any other, except to say that the plane i saw seemed odd, it moved too slowly, considering how low in the sky it was. moreover it was extremely low in the sky, helecopter low. it was pitch black outside the car so i could not get a good look at the plane.\r\n\r\nwhat i can tell you though is that it's altitude stuck me as odd, as did its lights. it seemd to have one light in the middle and two constant lights on both flanks. it had a small blinking light underneath. as it flew low over carsington water, i'd say it wouldn't have been more than 300 feet up at the very most. my real estimate would have been 100 feet. now i'm not saying that this was an alien spacecraft. yet to me it was a ufo. ufo doesn't mean alien spacecraft that would be an etv (extra terrestrial vehicle). it was a ufo because it wasn't like any plane i have ever seen, it wasn't on a flight path i have ever seen. it moved slower than any commercial plane i have ever seen. what was it? i watched it fly over carsington lake and then i lost sight of it for a few seconds, it was gone. yet, i had a perfect view over the lake, as we climbed towards kniveton near ashbourne. where did this low flying object go? i certainly felt unnerved. rightly so. this part of derbyshire, matlock, wirksworth, bonsall is well known for its ufo reports, even more so lately. this year, 2009 has seen the highest incidence of ufo reports worldwide since records began.\r\n\r\nmy partner who was driving the car, doesn't really hold with ufo's. i think she'd have to see one to believe it. she tends to express the view that there is a rational explaination for this sort of sighting and that there is no pooint making a fuss. this is the view help by the majority of the population. if fact i believe it too, except that i have long had an interest in ufo's because of very unusual things i have seen for years now.\r\n\r\non with the story. we drove on, i had now got a sneaking suspicion that we would see something else unusual. there seemed to be a lot of activity in the skies, but nothing quite as startling as what i had just seen. when we got to uttoxeter, we were approaching the mcdonalds roundabout when i became aware of a very large red light low in the sky. the red light seemed to be near to the racecourse , it was at least 2 miles away though, so impossible to tell what it was, my partner also saw this. she looked a little spooked. i asked her to turn off toward the light but she declined and drove on towards stoke on trent. i couldn't help but feel that we had missed an opportunity to investigate. that said, having the family in the car probably wasn't the best ufo hunting opportunity. we drove on.\r\n\r\nthen things got really good. as we approached stoke on trent down the a50. we were at the britannia stadium when i looked across to my right (uk drivers side) and saw a very bright white light right over stoke town. i asked my partner what the hell it was, again she looked spooked and, again turned away from it opting to drive down to newcastle via the handford roundabout, much to my frustration, i wanted to try to get a photograph of this light. it was so bright.\r\n\r\nas we left the handford roundabout the light became visible again. i pointedly asked her to look at it. it was a white light with tow smaller while lights on either side of it. as though on stalks or like spotlights. we could hear no helecopter noise, even though my partner assured me that was what it was. as we drove along the a34 we were both looking at this light. it was definitely no more than 100 feet off the ground. suddenly, and this is the best bit it changed colour from white to emerald green. again, i alerted my partner to this, i said \"look at it, tell me it has changed colour and i'm not imagining it\". she confirmed that it had changed colour, the two small white sidelights seemed to have disappeared. at this point we were directly by the tesco's at trent vale, and i could still see the object, i tried to get a photo. i took 2 and one caught a tiny bit of green glow...The image was very disappointing. \r\n\r\nwe arrived home minutes late and i scanned around and then went out for a drive to see if i could see anything unusual, i couldn't. what we did see that night though was 3 objects that were unusual. for once i had another witness who saw at least 2 of these objects.\r\n\r\ni felt sure that this incident was so unusual i simply had to check it out. i called the police that night to ask if the helecopter was up and flying in that region. they said they'd check and get back to me. no one got back. so i called again on monday morning. i spoke with staffordshire police and asked them to check. they, recorded the incident (trent vale) and ran checks to see if the helecopter was flying. they called back to say that they had no record of the police helecopter flying that night. this still doesn't mean it was an etv, but it rules out police helcopters.\r\n\r\nother options could be military helecopters or the air ambulance. i called the civil aviation authority who told me that small aircraft do not have to register their flight plan with them.\r\nso i have thus drawn a blank. whatever i saw looked weird to me. i'm keen to rule out check all conventional options. yet i'd just like to say that what i saw in all three locations that night is consistent with current ufo sightings across the country and the world.\r\nsee my crude sketch of the objects.\r\n\r\nministry of defense informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

new out-door mall. we had trouble finding the place. we came to this dead end, that was a four way stop each road wasn't built yet, but the stop signs were there. tony noticed a red star in the distance, almost tree level, but a little higher. it moved very odd, as if it were going and stopping. we continued to watch for maybe ten minutes. by now it had come rather close. we were waiting to see what kind of plane it was. thats when it came to a complete halt. possibly 70 ft. infront of the jeep. we both had to lean to look up through the front windshield. i rolled my driver side window down and stuck my head out.\r\nthis object is hard to discribe, it was blurry. i said something to tony, and right as i turned, thats when the flash happened. as if someone had snapped a picture of us, but the flash didnt go away, as if frozen. i remember seeing tony curled up with his head between his legs. my first thought was to crank up the jeep and leave. the object slowly followed us for a mile or so. when we came upon the first red light, i had to stop, but the light was behind us. it seemed to look like a car coming, but we were the only car in this dead end. it was pretty much right
