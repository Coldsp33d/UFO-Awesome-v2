(contractor) for the research and development dept.I had gone home to my travel trailer at the trailer park after work,took my shower, watched tv, and later that night got hungry and didn't feel like cooking so late at night, so i decided to go to wendy's for a midnight snack. the approximate time was about 1 am. i'm not sure of the exact date/month, (its been 8 years since i experienced this). while driving my van back to my temp home away from home i saw a strange orange glowing object, shaped like a large m&m over the tree line a few miles from where i was driving.(i was heading west)it was very dark out and clear, it slowly hovered over the tree line in a southerly direction until it got almost in a direct line with the road i was on, but still miles away. it stopped then rotated at about a 70 degree angle,it waited a few seconds i could then see that it was a round saucer shape, but as i say like an m&m shape on the side view. it then accelerated at an unbelievable speed up into the clear night sky and out of sight. i build and worked on aircraft for the past 30+ years and was an aircraft mechanic in the navy for 6 years onboard the carrier nimitz and stationed at patuxent river maryland at the naval air test center.I know the capabilities of jet aircraft and the speeds they can attain. nothing i've ever seen could accelerate that fast, and it didn't leave a fire trail as a jet would do during night ops. i was excited, stunned and in awe at the object and how fast this object went. within seconds of the object leaving, another one came from the northern side of the tree line and did the exact same manuver, leaving at unbelievable speed. during the second object sighting i floored the gas to get closer. i was driving about 80 mph trying to get a better look to confirm exactly what it was? then a third object with the same glowing orange color as the first two appeared and did the exact same maneuver the other two did till it was out of sight. i had no camera, i actually looked for someone else on the road to stop them and make them look at what i was seeing. there were no other cars on the road. this all happened near i believe its hunter airforce base or fort stewart. i know one of those facilities is in that area. i went to work the next day and told the guys at work. as i expected they asked what i was drinking when i saw these objects. i don't drink ! i didn't like the ridicule so i just kept my mouth shut and didn't tell anyone else about it. i've kept this mostly secret the past 8 years, i have told a few people about it, and my family knows of it. but to protect my status as an aircraft technician and not being labeled crazy i kept quiet about it. i'm convinced that what i saw was either from another world, another time, or some super secret thing the government is hiding.(i doubt the government could ever have a craft like that hidden) no jet aircraft that i know of could ever reach that type of speed so quickly and be out of sight in mere seconds as all three of the objects did. i watched them go so fast till they went out of human sight. plus the fact of the \"g's that would have been experienced by any occupants of a craft going at that speed from a dead stop to out in space, would be phenominal. i truly believe they were from another world, highly intelligent, and curious about us. anyone who thinks that we are alone in this vast universe needs to rethink what they believe. we are just a speck in the vast expanse of the universe. with billions of planets in a galaxy, and millions of galaxies in the universe, you'd have to be pretty closed minded not to think about the odds that there is other intelligent life out there. perhaps smarter than we are and able to explore other planets.(which we can't even do yet) and because of the concept of fear to the public, the government will keep it hush hush about any other life out there that they may know about to prevent panic. my guess is they already know !!! it convinced me seeing them and i believe now !!! i wonder what they are like?

toward newport, pa on route 322 west. i was between the watts and midway exits. above the mountain prior to the midway exit, i saw what i thought was the moon behind the clouds. then, i noticed that there was more that one light. the size of the lights that i saw made me think that they might have come from people spotting for deer. \r\n\r\ni realized that it wasn't the moon nor hunters, when i saw five or six lights in a row. the lights were above the clouds, so they could not have been people spotting for deer. \r\n\r\ni liken the size of the lights to be the size of large spot-lights. they were not bright like spot-lights. the colors were pale blue, white, and pale red. there was a small dim light centered and behind the larger lights. this light was a very dim, pale blue. it appeared that the craft was travelling in the direction of the row of lights, as though that were the front of the craft. it seemed to be slow moving.\r\n\r\ni know that i am not an expert on ufo sightings, but i have seen my share of helicopters and airplanes. i grew up in close proximity to the former new cumberlan army depot. my father was a rotor mechanic. i do not belive for one moment that what i saw was an airplane or a helicopter. \r\n\r\napproximately six or seven years ago, i saw something in the sky at the same area. instead of flying above the mountain, it was hovering above the edge of the juniata river. i do not remember the month. it was when the weather was cool. there were no other cars around me, so i slowed down to between thirty-five and forty miles per hour, rolled down my windows, turned of my heater and radio to see if i could hear anything. i thought that it might be a helicopter looking for someone in the river. however; i realized that there was no search light. there were three, small, dim lights which made a triangular shape. the color of the lights were pale red, white and pale blue.\r\n\r\nthe craft made no sound. it hovered in the same spot from the time i spotted it in the distance, and while i slowed down to observe it. i don't know what it did after i got scared and sped up as fast as i could to get away from it.","distance":"501 Feet

illuminated as if a car was shining it's headlights towards to object.\r\nas it faded the outline of the tops of the trees, near my house, became visible once again. i have no logical explanation for what i saw and really believe it was a craft of some kind.

with different colors moving. i jumped up ran to the back door and stood on the porch. it was, as close as i can describe, like someone had wadded several strands of christmas tree lights together and made all the lights touch. there was no space between the lights but they were noticeably separate. i can't be sure of the distance from me, but it was passing above the trees with no sound. it's visual size was roughly two and a half inches from front to back. it did not rotate. i can't tell you it's speed, but in the patch of open sky in my back yard it was visible for about a minute from the time i saw it out the window till it left sight. it was traveling in a generally southeastern direction. i remember thinking that i was seeing a u.F.O. i didn't know if it was an alien space craft or something from the government, but being a child i hoped it was aliens. it passed behind more trees and i lost sight of it. my father came outside after it had passed and asked me why i was outside at that time of night. i told him i saw a u.F.O. and he said i'd probably dreamed it. i don't have waking dreams and i don't believe i would have seen it in the window and then again outside. \r\nafterward i felt confused, excited and somewhat frightened by the experience. i guess everyone's read something about u.F.O.'s at some point in their life, but to actually see one was another

my house, having a cigarette. my two dogs were outside with me, running around the backyard and my wife was in the garage nearby. it was nearing dusk, so while it was not yet dark, there were some stars visible in the sky. i was watching a plane pass overhead when something lower in the horizon and to the north caught my eye. what i then saw was five orange glowing spheres flying in a 45 degree formation with each other, traveling from west to east. living along a plane route and being very familiar with seeing planes and helicopters flying over daily, i immediately knew that these were not planes, helicopters, or really anything i had ever seen before. it is very difficult to judge, but i would guess that the objects were flying at an approximate altitude of 1000 feet. the objects made no sound that i could discern, though the aforementioned plane's engines were still audible. the light source of the objects seemed to be emanating from the objects themselves (no body of a craft visible at all.) the objects traveled at a steady speed, flying slightly faster than a passing plane would be expected to. they stayed in a rigid 45 degree formation with each other with the exception of the \"center\" object falling slightly back for a short moment before falling back into formation, lending to the idea that these were five separate entities and not a single craft with five lights. i called to my wife to come quickly and see this, but by the time she got to where i was, the spheres had disappeared over the sight line of our house. the entire episode lasted no longer than 10-12 seconds. i would say the sighting gave me a feeling of \"calm excitement\" - i knew i was witnessing something quite out of the ordinary. but, given the short duration of the experience, coupled with the lack of any visible detail of the objects, it afterward did not feel like a \"mind blowing\" or life changing event. it was simply a highly interesting occurrence that, to me, lacks any sort of conventional explanation.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

regarding the ufo sightings that occurred in the hudson valley.  i had mostly thought that my sighting was an isolated incident so i kept the story to just close friends.\r\n\r\nnow that i know i am only among many who saw this craft, i feel its time to tell my story.\r\n\r\nlocation: lake walton road, hopewell jct, ny 12533\r\n\r\nactivity: me and two friends and their parents were shooting off some fireworks at my friends house.  4th of july was coming and we were testing some out to see how we would plan our fireworks show.  these were all class c fireworks, nothing fancy.\r\n\r\nwhat happened:  we were lighting off the small stuff for a while ( bottle rockets, cakes, some rockets) and everything was normal.  my friend took out some of the \"grand finale\" items and we started to light them off.  these are called mortars.  basically its a cardboard tube with shells that you insert in and then the fuse hangs off the side.  these go the highest and look like mini versions of what you see on tv.\r\n\r\non the second round, we started to hear a very low sounding humming noise.  directly in front of us, a series of lights shaped in an arc came close.  we all immediately knew what this was.  the craft was easily 1000 feet long, it covered the majority of jefferson park which is a development on the other side of lake walton road.  the development has 16 or 17 houses at its width.\r\n\r\nthe craft was super low to the ground.  other than the lights, we couldn't make out any of its exact shape, but if i were to guess the object was a flattened out oval very wide at the length with little depth.  the lights along the edge were all different colors.  i mostly remember the reds, yellows and whites.  the lights were evenly spaced from each other and had some flikering to them.\r\n\r\nthe craft was 100% silent as it hovered there.  my friends dad comepletely flipped out, and ran inside to get a camera while his wife was screaming at the top of her lungs.  we lit off one more mortar to see what would happen and then heard a bang and the humming again.  the craft slightly rotated on axis and in a whoosh it was gone.  at this time the dad came out of the house with the camera and there was nothing there.\r\n\r\nhere is the odd part.  and this is the part that scares the crap out of me.  nobody said a word and for the most part, i have no memory from this point forward.  all i know is that i got on my bike and went home.  i was soaking wet with sweat.  \r\n\r\nwhen i came home, i was very late.  i had a super strict father and i was amazed that my parents, who were downstairs watching tv said hello to me as if nothing was wrong.  i said i was tired and went to bed.  100% amazed that i was not in trouble.  we were lighting off the fireworks at 8pm and i think it was around 10:30pm or 11pm when i got home.  i'm not sure.\r\n\r\nnobody in our group ever talked about the event.  about three years later i asked one of my friends about it and he said he didn't know what i was talking about.  he was a tough guy who worked in a gas station.\r\n\r\nthe point i want to make about this story is that i think the ufo was in the general area when we were lighting off the ground fireworks.  it was only when we sent the huge mortar into the sky that the craft approached.  as if it was examining the explosion.  when they figured out it was just us, it took off.\r\n\r\nthe speed at which the craft approached us and left is simply impossible.  something so large like that able to zap around at will without making much noise except the low humming noise is amazing.\r\n\r\nif anyone wants to contact me regarding this event please feel free.  i am now 38 yrs old, i'm an executive in a large corporation and i would like to learn more about this event in my life.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path then

the triangle flattened to make a wide line.\r\nthe tile like things had the same visual light change that ticker tape or confetti does as it falls. \r\nalso i had a wave of nausea with a metallic taste in my mouth just before my husband pointed the \"birds\" out to me.\r\nthe nausea just faded along with the odd taste.\r\nthat day had been clear, no cloud cover, and it was not windy that night.\r\nin fact it was a oddly quiet evening for our neighborhgood.\r\nso quiet that 2 neighbors came home while we were just standing out in the street and they unloaded their car as they would normally do.\r\nif my husband had not looked up when he did we think we would never have noticed this thing at all.\r\nit was that well blended against the sky. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

was at home at the time and walking to my car to go to the mall.\r\n\r\ni always look into the sky to identify aircraft, stars, satellites, planets and thought i was watching a satellite pass over at very high altitude.\r\n\r\nthe \"glowing light object\" looked exactly like a satellite, but was traveling\r\nfrom south to north at satellite type speed, but maybe a little slower.\r\n\r\ni decided the \"object\" was a satellite, but then the \"object\" began to get brighter very slow (1 second interval), i thought it was still a satellite, but then it became dim got brighter at the same interval again. the \"object\" did this 3 times. the 3rd time the \"object\" was brighter and completely disappeared. usually satellites travel completely across the sky in full view until they disappear across the horizon.\r\n\r\nthe \"object\" traveled in a smooth straight line until it disappeared. \r\n\r\nduring the observation, i felt it had an intelligent possibly telepathic presence as if \"the object\" noticed it was being perceived by observation before disappearing.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the \"object\" when it disappeared.\r\n\r\nafter the sighting, i continued my journey to the mall. \r\n\r\nthe \"object\" could be a satellite spinning, i suppose, but i don't have the resources to check this
