proceeded down a path towards the beach where the brush was grown up and formed a tunnel about 10 feet long to walk through before opening onto the dunes. upon exiting the tunnel the dunes, beach and ocean become a vast expanse of visibility. \r\nas we walk towards the ocean we notice how still and quiet everything was. the sky was perfectly clear and the ocean was motionless allowing the reflection of the stars to be clearly seen on the reflection of the waters surface. a few ships lights could be observed on the horizon either coming into or leaving charleston harbor though they didn't appear to be moving. we both sensed an uneasy feeling at the extreme stillness of the night and the ocean and were ready to go back home when we noticed what seemed to be a very bright flickering star very low in the sky over one of the ships in the distance. while we were observing it wondering if it was a planet or what, it suddenly moved left to right from hovering over one ship to hovering over another one some distance away from the first. the movement was almost instant and the distance was finger tip to thumb tip at arms length on the horizon and 3 fingers at arms length off the waters surface. \r\nthe object hovered there for a few minutes then began to meander back and forth when a bright white light shown down to the water. at this point we assumed it must be a search helicopter as it seemed to be searching the waters off the coast. \r\nas it was doing this it also began to come closer and closer to the shore. as it did it became apparent that this was no helicopter. it slowly moved to within 100 yards of the shore hovering 50 ft above the water not creating so much as a ripple. the reflection in the water was perfect, even the stars could be seen reflecting their light. it stopped directly in front of us and sat hovering there a few minutes. it then moved to the right and sat hovering diagonally from us, still over the water for a few more minutes. it then moved again and hovered over the beach 100 yards south of us as if observing but keeping it's distance from us. it hovered 50 ft over the beach not creating any disturbance or noise. it was an incredibly bright saucer shaped object with colored lights all over it blinking in syncopated patterns that changed when the motion of the craft changed. it sat there for a couple minutes as we stood there in awe of what we were seeing. suddenly it began to move again, this time directly in our direction at the same slow speed. at this point my blood ran cold as my girlfriend screamed and turned to run the other direction. i too turned and took a few steps running away from the craft when i turned my head back to get a look at where it was. it was not down the beach anymore but was hovering over one of the beach houses a couple hundred yards away cocked at a 45 degree angle. a ring of red lights was flashing around the perimeter of the object with all the other lights out. it sat hovering there for a few minutes before drifting off east over the island to be obscured by the houses.\r\nwe sat on the beach waiting to see if it would come back. after a few minutes we observed 2 of these objects high in the sky flying towards the ocean in like a formation, one behind and below the other. as we watched them fly out over the ocean they both disappeared before flying out of visible range.  \r\nupon arriving home that evening we called around to see if anyone had reported these objects and found no reports. we chose to not report it at that time. i'm not sure why, probably extreme confusion mixed with a bit of fear. or a bit of confusion mixed with extreme fear. not sure which. it was a profound event which has changed my life in the 29 years since observing it. knowing something trumps believing in something and this is scary knowledge which few people are ready to hear about.\r\ni've never seen a picture or video or description to match what we saw that night. only in the general sense of being saucer shaped. i've been looking now for 29 years and this craft is still unique in appearance and behavior. \r\ni am trained in electromechanical engineering as well as being a certified lighting designer and an accomplished musician. i also have been a respected salesman in the electrical industry. i served in the army 75- 78 and have a music degree. my musician skills are recognized by many around the world as extraordinary and i currently teach guitar for a living. i was honorably discharged from the service and graduated college magna cum laude

degrees to the north. the lights were visible through a break in the tree line and as i looked closer i could see more off to both sides of the break. i could see at least 9 or 10 lights that appeared to be round and white with a slight bluish hue. they were not moving in a linear fashion as does the air traffic around here but most appeared to be motionless but for 2 or 3 that moved around the others. at this point i wanted a closer look and ran inside for about 20 seconds and grabbed a pair of binoculars. i also called my wife who was in our house and told her to come quick with the video camera. as i started to watch with the binoculars the group arranged itself into v shape or boomerang as above. it remained this way for a minute or two and then the lights dimmed as if on a dimmer switch and became less orb like and more like smaller dots of light and began to disassemble itself into groups.One group of 3 appeared to rotate in place for several minutes while the others began to move off in a north or northwest direction another to the east and another to the south east all moving away from my position. my wife had arrived with the video camera but as i am not very familiar with the functions could not get the night shot function on the camera to work. with the last light disappearing my wife and i got in the car and drove east for about 5 miles where we could see three groups again one to the north one northeast and one southeast after another five miles or so the groups began to move away from us faster than i wanted to drive so we stopped and watched the last group drift of to the southeast and headed back to our house. when we were about 2 miles from the house and heading due west i could see another group of 3 lights off the west of our house.This group hardly moved from where it was at and i watched it for another 20 minutes before heading into the house for supper.There was no sound associated with these lights and except for the earlier brilliance

state, i could not move a musle, it felt like something was on top of me.\r\n\r\ni fighted to get movement back in my body. i could not turn my head, or move at all, it was like i was having a fight to get control of my body.\r\nafter a few panic stricken momentts i could just barely move my finger's , only just a little bit. i then felt that there was more than just a spasm, i felt dirty and touched, it was a horrible feeling from deep inside me. \r\n\r\nthen i could just about move my toes, again very very slightly, my throat felt like it was being held, i could feel something was on top of me, my hands where by my side but it felt like they was around my own throat, holding very tightly, i was using all my might to break free from this spasmodic state.\r\n\r\nthen i swear i could feel something breathing into my left ear, a sound of a growl like noise right next to my ear, i struggled to move my head to the left, like breaking free from a strangle hold.\r\n\r\ni could just work out a head , a big long head next to my own face, and as the spasm like feeling started to wear off, a tiny bit at a time, i could work out that this thing on top of me was like a lizard/newt thing, it was like blending in with all what was around it, or maybe invisable, im not very sure which, but i could see it clearly as the seconds passed on.\r\n\r\nit was reptilian, i growled at it, or i think i did, my mind and my body gave all it could to do so, i bared my teeth at it, and i could feel it could read my mind, and i was swaering at it, and shouting all sorts of vengence at it, i felt violated and used.\r\n\r\nthe next thing, which was very very quick, it was off me and was standing to one side of the bottom of my bunk bed, which i had at the time, a light came through the thin gap which was made by the curtains, the light was diffrent shades of a golden light which also had very very small particles inside it, like dust or very very small stars which moved around like little bright lights.\r\n\r\nthis reptilian creature stood there, i would say about 6 feet high, i could feel it was either proud or happy, maybe both, i tried to sit up as best i could and i spat at it, but the spit just went down my chin, and through my mind i swore at it again.\r\n\r\nthe creature walked forward and stepped into the light beam, as it did, the feet, then the legs vanished into the light, the more the creature moved forward towards the window, the more of it vanished.\r\n\r\nit was gone, i felt relaxed then, but i could still feel where i was held around my throat, i felt i was raped by this horrendous monster.\r\ni awoke the next day, it was bright sunny day, i could hear my mother downstairs, washing up and doing housework, i then didnt move a muscle, i ran the thing through my mond again, and yes i could still feel where i was held around my throat as i lay with my hands down by my side.\r\n\r\ni know this happend, my mind and heart and soul knows that this happend, but for the life of me, i could not run downstatirs to explain to my mother about this. who would have believed it, how would my parents have handled such a thing, i did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nsince that night, my step father passed away, and every once and a while, i always bring up the subject of ufo's or aliens, to see if i hear anything by someone who has experinced anything like what i did, so maybe i could hear of someone else to explain my story to. i aske dmy mother if she believed in aliens or ufo's, she repleid that my step father said once that he saw a ufo in brighton, in the sea in the 1960's, and he swore blind that it was a ufo, but only told my mother this.\r\n\r\ni never told my mother about my experince, as i thought it would be to harrowing for her to hear, as if she heard such things from two people who wouldnt never ever tell her a lie , it would be to much for her to take.\r\n\r\nwhat do i do about my experince, i would love to do something about it, if it helps somebody, or even do something fpor the world, as i am being very honest, and things like this should be worked on, and an answer has to be found why they are happening.","distance":"20 Feet or

day and the house was still warm so i went out\r\nto the porch for a breather.\r\n\r\nthe best way to describe what i seen was a ball of pure bright white pass\r\nover the roof of my home, float over our driveway and just a couple of feet\r\nover the roof of our neighbor's home across the road and then it completely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\ni was waiting to hear a crash or something but there was nothing.\r\n\r\nyou need to remember we live in a wooded area means lots of trees.\r\nhow this ball of light managed to avoid trees just baffles me!!\r\n\r\ni ran back into the house and woke my husband up and tried explaining what just happened.  he said it was probably a meteor.\r\n\r\ni got back into bed and laid there contimplating all of this and i am pretty sure it was not a meteor.\r\n\r\nif it was, wouldn't there have been some reddish orange from the heat?\r\nwhen it hit the ground wouldn't i have heard that or felt that?\r\n\r\nby my best calculations i would say the ball was about 2 feet more or less and being completely round.  no sound at all...Just a very bright ball of white light floating.\r\n\r\n1.  this happened on saturday, nov. 7th at around 10:30pm.\r\n\r\n2.  no storms, no winds, a beautiful clear night.\r\n\r\n3.  sitting on the front porch enjoying the evening when a perfectly round\r\nglowing white ball drifted approximately 15-18 feet above the ground.\r\nit had come over the roof of our home from behind and then it came\r\ninto view floating completely over our long driveway moving in a straight\r\npath crossing the road and almost hit my neighbors house roof.\r\n\r\n4.  once it cleared their roof it vanished.  i mean just vanished!!\r\n\r\n5.  the best way to describe this ball was perfectly round illuminating a\r\nvery bright white light.  it was moving at approx. 3-5 mph.  slow enough\r\nwhere i was able to watch it and it's movements.\r\n\r\n6.  the next morning i took my camera and was going to walk the path\r\nand see if i could find anything behind my neighbors home, the trees and\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n7.  i knocked on my neighbors back door and talked with both the wife and\r\nhusband.  this is where it gets interesting.  the husband told me that about a month ago he was sitting in his front living room with his blinds closed when he seen a round bright light coming into his living room through the living room window.  he then said that the \"ball\" of light kept moving throughout his home.  he got up and followed the light until he reached the back of the house laundry room and it disappeared.  he thought it was someone with a bright flashlight scoping out his house.  he went outside and started looking for this person.  he found nothing.\r\nthis has happened a total of 4 times that he has seen this \"light\".\r\n\r\nhis wife seemed upset that he didn't tell her about this, but he said, \"i thought i did tell you\".  he said he was happy to hear that he was not the only person seeing this and that i actually witnessed the actual object that was causing what he had been seeing.\r\n\r\ni asked permission to walk behind their home and look around.  they both\r\nsaid...Of course and keep us up to date.\r\n\r\n8.  as i walked behind their home i noticed too many trees (large) that\r\nwould have been very hard to maneuver around.  i did not see any\r\nburnt marks or damage on the ground or on the tree trunks.  i continued\r\nwalking down the road looking for anything.  i found nothing.\r\n\r\n9.  i contacted our police dept. to find out if they received any phone calls of other's seeing this.  our chief of police said i was the only call. i did ask him that while on duty if he has ever seen anything like this and he told me no....I was the first to report this.\r\n\r\n10. what is also interesting is that there is a cattle farm 2 roads behind our home and that is where it had to have come from.\r\n\r\ni checked out \"lightning balls\" and looking at pictures, it wasn't even close to what those look like.\r\n\r\nthere was no \"tail\" wind or sound.\r\n\r\nsince this caught me off guard i didn't have a camera (banging her head)\r\nwhere i could photo it.  i now have my camera on the front porch and i have\r\nbeen going out there from 10:00 pm to 11ish hoping to see it again.  the\r\nchances of this sound good since my neighbor has seen the light 4 times.\r\n\r\nok... deep breath....This is still baffling me","distance":"20 Feet or

difficult to spot the dimmer ones due to a considerable amount of light pollution. the few clouds around were a light orange color due reflecting from the ground. as i was looking at andromeda i noticed something moving southward through the sky. it was what appeared to be an object about the same size (visually) as a low flying helicopter and was moving at a similar speed. it was emitting no lights and was making no sound. what i saw appeared the reflections of the ridges of an object. it appeared to be tear shaped object with bulges. i saw an outline of several curves, the largest of which was at the front (in the direction on motion). it appeared slightly larger than a semi sphere (based on the size of the rim i saw). the bulges gave it the appearance of multiple toruses on their side  which got progressively smaller towards the back. the object also had what appeared to be a rod of some sort under the head pointing forward. the image was dim and seemed as if it was only visible because of reflection of ground sources of light. it was a significantly darker shade of orange than the clouds in the sky. it was also much less defined in shape than the clouds. the edges of the object were not crisp but fuzzy. i stood there watching the object and i thought it was a trick of my eye- an after image perhaps. i looked away to see if i would still see it in the center of my vision (to check if it just was an illusion), but it wasn't where i looked. i turned my head back and it was still there but it had continued moving and was nearing a high cloud. i watched it wondering if it would block out the cloud so i could see a better outline of the object, but instead of flying below the cloud it disappeared behind it.

trail following the second chemtrail but not changing course and staying straight.  he pointed it out and i seen it as well.  it was very odd and we arent sure of what to make of it.  also, while the planes were spreading there chemtrails, it was as if something was following them, breaking through the clouds.  we could not see it, but the clouds were moving apart.  it couldve have been a shadow of the chemtrail on the backround clouds.  not sure though.  let me know what you guys think. i've attached a microsoft paint picture of what it looked like.  sorry no real pics.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\ndave

from west to northeast. i tracked it overhead for five minutes until it was out of my line of sight. when in my home i told my roomate about what i saw. we were on our porch and i retraced the line of flight and pointed to venus to gives some reference as to the objects luminescence. while on the porch a low flying double engine plane approached from the south flying low and swooped over our place and headed in the general direction that the object had taken. oddly enough this plane did not have it's main bright light on.

do you see what i see up there? what is that thing?\" he followed my gaze and immediately noticed what i was talking about, remarking, \"oh, yeah. i see it. what the heck is that thing?\" he then walked over to his family who were admiring the memorial and directed their attention to it as well. over the next few minutes they discussed what it could be, with a boy of about 10 years suggesting that it might be a hang glider.\r\n\r\nmeanwhile, i called my girlfriend who was at home and asked her to go outside and try and photograph the object, as it appeared to be floating in roughly the direction of our home (southeast, towards the pentagon and crystal city.) she tried to do this, but was unable to locate the object in the sky. \r\n\r\ni continued to watch the object as it drifted southeast and passed into the area of sky that the rising sun was occupying that morning. before i lost sight of it in the sun's glare i tried to photograph it with a cell-phone camera, but upon examining the photo on my computer there was too much sun-glare to see anything. i'll attach the photo anyway just in case someone else wants to take a look. the object was visible to the naked eye just to the left of the sun when the photo was taken. if anyone else saw this object i hope they post their own story, as this was during the daytime on a sunday over our nation's capital, so i can't have been the only one who noticed this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":20478,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8889497,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11112009-0026","longitude":-77.0970998,"occurred":1257703500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1258004708000,"summary":"Odd floating tube ","tags":["floating"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/20478_submitter_file1__1108091032a.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Arlington, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:170675"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2128}
