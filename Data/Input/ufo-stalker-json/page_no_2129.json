at the sky. it was a cool, clear night. we both immediately noticed what we thought to be either an unusually large bright star or a planet. we also saw other stars that appeared normal at the time and looked to be in a big dipper configeration. we focused our attention on the largest object, though, because it was so beautiful. after a couple of minutes we both noticed that it began to hover slightly and then saw a red light at the top that came on and was flashing. then a green light at the bottom would flash. then a bright white white light at the top would flash. i went inside to get binoculors. over time, these lights would take turns flashing as in a pattern. sometimes it returned to all white but would become larger and change shapes. sometimes it would look like a triangle, sometimes like a long vertical rectangle, sometimes it even appeared to be a celestial being with a bright white head and open arms. my friend thought that it looked like a large quartz crystalline structure. at times a large dark red area would appear that looked like a door opening and closing. everytime it rotated positions it changed the appearance of the overall craft. i then began to focus on the other brighter stars i could see with the binoculors. i was amazed to see that they were now not stars like i had first thought. they had the same basic configerations and colors as the largest craft, just smaller in size. there were four others like this and they were located in a triangle relative to the largest craft. it appeared that they were surrounding the city. they stayed stationary for the entire time i was watching them. after the first hour of watching, i noticed what i thought was a helicopter moving through the sky but it was too high up and made no sound. under the binoculors i could see that it was just like the other crafts but all red. it moved across the sky and out of vision. later, two small red crafts appeared and hovered next to each other about midway between the mothership and another stationary craft i previously mentioned. same flashing lights and patterns, but all red. they moved on after about 30 minutes. not long after that i saw what i thought was a plane due to a line of red lights in a vertical pattern (again, no sound), as on a wing span. but as it moved across the sky, it rotated and the lights looked like a \"greater than\" mathematical symbol. it rotated again and i could see that it was actually a disc-shaped flying saucer type craft. it moved rapidly around the sky then out of vision.\r\nactual airplanes and helicopters were flying in the sky over this 2 hr. period, so i am very sure that the other objects i described were not normal aircraft.","distance":"Over One

went out on my back porch to investigate the sound of animals fighting, like a cat or dog. i had been in my family room watching letterman when i heard the noises. i looked around unsuccessfully for a few seconds, when something caught my eye flying overhead. for a fleeting second, i thought i may be seeing some geese, and that would possibly explain the sound i was hearing, but within a second, i realized that what i was seeing were four separate aircraft of some kind. they were completely luminescent boomerang or flying wing vehicles, with no body, only wings. it looked for a second like they were very close to the ground, because of the way they were lit up, like they were catching reflected light from the street lights. i soon realized that they were much further up than that, maybe two or three hundred feet. what shook me was how fast they were going. i watched them go from one horizon, (at first sight) from the east, and disappear out of sight on the southwest horizon, in about six seconds. \r\ni would compare it to the time over this past summer when the space shuttle flew over our area. my wife and i waited up for it, after we saw it on the news. these vehicles that i saw last night, were going about that fast. they were completely, and absolutely silent. \r\n     three of them were in a tight formation, and the fourth one was flying slightly behind and to the left of the 3

me to hurry over to his dorm. i heard there was a meteor shower coming soon and thought he was just watching that. i get to the dorm and he rushes me to the window and as i look out i see nothing. as i am about to tell him such 2 red lights fly around each other and zoom off in opposite directions and a 3rd very bright white light appears out of nowhere. we continue to watch in awe cursing at what we are seeing. next 2 bright lights appear and begin to move and a little later one becomes 2 small red lights and the other disappears. the red lights stay in the sky for a good 30 seconds and then disappear, in the mean time they are flying back-n-forth across the sky. the foothills and flatirons are in clear view from our windows and this morning we saw that the objects were too close to the mountains to be any type of aircraft (ie helicopters and planes). also if they were some type of manmade aircraft, 2 red lights appear and get dimmer as if moving away and then an instant later one is gone the one more right suddenly is a bright light. had this been an aircraft it would have had to do a complete 180 turn in a split second. 2 lights with red and white appear a fair length apart and then appear to rotate and we saw what looked like a cigar shape with red lights on the ends. the object couldn't have been smaller than 30 yards long. we rush outside and try to get a good view. over the course before this we see what i described many times only with more appearances by the large bright light. the activity continues as we are outside but not as dramatically. for about 10 minutes there is no activity but then the large bright light comes on and stays on for a second, goes away for another second, then comes back for a second, then off, and repeats 2 more times. we see various red lights over the 20 minutes after the bright light stops and then my friend screams \"abduct me!\" and all activity stops for about 15 minutes as we walk back up to his room.  then the lights come back and begin to fly back-n-forth yet again with very high strobe activity from small white lights to red every 5 blinks or so, only this time there appears to be a short beam of light coming from underneath, not like those abduction beams but lights. 3 of these appear and form a triangle shape and move around and the shape gets distorted like its moving in crazy directions. all activity stops for 3 minutes and then 2 of the red lights with beams appear a good 100 yards or more away from each other and fly at a large speed and collide and appear to become 1 and then disappear in almost an instant. at the exact moment, another large bright white light juts out of the darkness maybe 150 yards away from the collision point and disappears 4 seconds later. all activity ceases for 10-15 minutes and i head back to my room on the same floor. 10 minutes after sitting down i get another call that they are flying around like crazy and blinking like crazy and i run over to his room to see one of the objects with the beams fly to the left and disappear. many people came into the room over the entire period of this and saw activity but threw it away as airplanes. a red light appears some minutes later and flies to the left and disappears and then reappears far on the right and continues heading left and then disappears again. i wait 15 more minutes and then again go back to my room, this is about 12 or 12:30 now. i told my friend to call me if anything dramatic happens again and i fall asleep at 4:30am with no call. in the morning i ask him if he saw anything else and he says he stayed up til about 2:30 watching various lights appear and reappear. after seeing the red lights moving i thought it was just a plane but then the agile movements began. tears were in my eyes, i could not believe what i was seeing, i felt so very confused. attached is a view from his window i took today. the objects stayed above the bottom of the mountains and below halfway into the sky. also this morning a farmer in las animas county found one of his cattle mutilated, no blood, no tracks, no reproductive organs. please provide some answers.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

i'd send it in. there were no flashing lights, such as an airplane might exhibited, and they went from being still to suddenly moving away in opposite directions with a speed that is contrary to what an airplane might perform.\r\n\r\nat the time i was listening to a radio program. i don't know why my girlfriend looked out the window, it was more or less spontaneous. for whatever reason it held her

watching it.\r\nthe object was there from when i arrived around 6:15, watched for 30 minutes, rushed home to get camera, came back it was only there for 30 second more so i captured nothing on video. \r\n\r\nthere were many witnesses looking up and staring and commenting, some screaming saying \" omg what is that\" etc. i noticed at least 5 witnesses and talked briefly to a few people about it.\r\n\r\nit was almost straight up in the sky as after the clouds went away a bit i noticed it was in the area of w cassopia. \r\n\r\nit flashed when the casino spot lights hit it, just like the previous youtube video's from the end of october of this year, but those video's had only 1 small light, this had 2 identical lights and a longer one in between them.\r\n\r\ni could not make out anything when the spotlights were not hitting it as there was cloud cover and it was already night.\r\n\r\nit looked like it was just above the clouds, quite high, 1000 feet for sure, about 2 inches long&#65279; at arms length. very bright, was in a straight line time facing nnw.\r\n\r\nthe light was white with a tinge of blue, light itself was the straight like a bar bell with 2 lights on the end.\r\nit had a smaller light on each end of the bar that were identical in shape. there was a light, then a small space then light. this composed the small light at each end.\r\nthen there was the middle bar light which was about 5x the length of the small end lights.\r\n\r\n had a middle longer bar then the light like the video again in a straight line.\r\nsince it was there for about 30 minutes or more as i was watching it, i was hoping it might be there for a while longer, so i rushed home to get a camera and my night vision monocular.\r\nwhen i got back, it was there for only about30 seconds more, i couldn't even set up the camera to take any video then it disappeared.\r\n\r\ni waited until after 9:20pm to see if it would come back but i didn't see it anymore.\r\n\r\njust before 9pm, still looking in the area of the sky where it was using my night vision monocular, i suddenly saw a dot just like a small star moving in a straight line and immediately thought it was a satellite as i have spent countless nights star gazing and see satellites every 5 minutes sometimes which is nothing unusual. \r\n\r\nthis light however  stopped going straight, slowed down smoothly, but quickly, and turned, started flying around that area with incredible speed and maneuverability, it's very difficult to describe the type of movement...It was fast, reactive, but still smooth flying, not like a bug or bird or anything i've ever seen....Keep in mind i've star gazed for decades, have owned numerous telescopes, so i'm familiar with what i can see out there, this was like nothing i've ever seen.\r\n\r\nthis point light looked to be very high as it was in focus with the stars, anything very close would be out of focus on my night vision as it's manual adjusted focus so it had to be quite distant.\r\n\r\nthis light then darted off in a straight line after the maneuvers, and the lights from the street and buildings flared up the night vision and i couldn't view it anymore as there were street lights everywhere.\r\n\r\nthe whole time i was yelling out \"that's impossible\" etc, i couldn't contain myself.\r\n","distance":"Over One

west. when it got over our house moving west, we suddenly caught a large grey object moving n to s just missing the small plane we were watching. at first we thought that's a bird because sometimes you can see birds in the dark if they are low enough to the ground and have a large wingspan. within a fraction of a second we realized this was no bird but rather a large boomerang shaped flying wedge gliding smoothly and silently across the dark pre-sunrise sky.It was dimly lit with 3 or 4 lights on the bottom of the craft on each of the leading edges. they were symmetrical i.E. 7 or 8 lights. we had been out for about 15 minutes so our eyes were night adjusted. this craft was dark grey,but slightly lighter than the sky. still, we wouldn't have seen it if we hadn't been looking up at the exact moment it passed over the flight path of the small plane we had been watching. i'm an ex-usaf weather observer and i'm very well trained in cloud heights. i'm estimating the altitude at 8,000 ft and the size as twice that of a 747 and completely silent. this object was menacing as it clearly was operating stealthily over a major metropolitan area (albuquerque) in busy early tuesday skies. their were several other planes in the sky at the time so it was operating in traffic yet i doubt that the small aircraft operator even saw it. neither of us had ever seen a ufo but we have now. there's a chance that we saw a top secret craft and an equal chance we saw an extraterrestrial craft. i'm leaning towards extraterrestrial because of the operating conditions at the time. it's doubtful that usaf would operate stealthily in traffic over abq not to mention the size and silence of the ship.It also traversed the sky from north to south in less than 10 seconds and we lost it quickly due to its color and dim lighting.

range closer than anything i can find in many ufo chronicles across the web. \r\nat about 6:15-6:20 on february 10, 2009, i saw a large circular object floating above highway 16 on the west side of charlotte, nc. i was driving toward huntersville when i saw the grayish object floating right above the trees. it was kind of shaped like a flat disk or acorn, and was floating above the trees on the right of the highway. \r\nthe object appeared to be between 50 to 100 feet in diameter and no more than 10 or 20 feet tall. i first noticed the object about 200 yards ahead of me, and i could not see the entire circumference, yet it was a circular object suspended in mid-air. as it was i became immensely curious as to what was keeping it suspended. \r\nwhen i approached the object i realized that it was hovering without suspension partially over the highway and the trees on the right side of the road. from a distance it seemed to be shrouded in shadows at the very end of dusk when the sun is on the horizon. \r\nas i approached i could see in clear detail four lights all on opposite sides in a sort of perfect x-formation on the bottom of the object along with hollow hole in the center of the bottom of the saucer. the skin of the object seemed to be made of a grayish metal with clear, straight seams in a seemingly symmetrical pattern. \r\nacross the bottom of the object there seemed to be markings that looked almost hieroglyphic in nature. in the center of the object there was an empty black hole like there was a middle cylinder removed from the structure. the method of flight of the object seemed to be something completely out of this world, yet since i was on the ground and could not clearly see the top of the object, i could not tell if it had any sort of propeller keeping it adrift in mid-air, yet from every angle that i had a visual i did not see anything that would explain its method of flight. \r\nthe skin almost reminded me of a smooth pewter with a pattern that was grid-like with the hieroglyphic symbols in each cell. from the distance i was it seemed to be texture on the outer surface but i could faintly make out markings in the pattern, but i had no idea what they meant. \r\nthis simple fact - that the object was simply floating a few feet above the trees on the right of the road interested me most, when i realized that the object was beyond the human capacity of technological development, i remember feeling a sudden fear that i should not be witnessing what i was seeing. \r\nwhen i passed under the object for a brief moment, i remember passing almost directly under one of the light fixtures which i remember seeing with clear detail. it seemed to emit an intense cone of light similar to those that illuminate night construction on highways, if not brighter. \r\nthe light seemed to be held onto the object on two sides by small v-like metal structures, and the light itself could not have been larger than one of our manufactured 100 watt generic bulbs, yet it burned with great intensity. \r\nthe center hole of the object was most peculiar because it seemed to ascend into the object into a total blackness which my eyes couldn���t penetrate. the hole, from what i could tell, probably took up about 10-20% of the base surface area and was in the exact center of the object. \r\nwhen i passed under the object i remember nothing but fear and curiosity in the object. i must have been going close to 100 mph when i was passing under it to get out of its way, and the only thought of stopping for a picture was thwarted with my fears of abduction. \r\ni still to this day pass by the very curve on highway 16, and remember the sighting every time i drive that route.

friday september 18th) i saw something that i had never seen before. i live in the canadian rockies in the province of alberta. my house is situated on the end of town, less then a kilometre west is complete wilderness. my room faces south looking onto the backyard, behind the backyard lies a green space. the green space which is several kilometres long and 400 metres wide borders more houses on the other side. there is not a lot of light pollution where i live so stars and planets are easily distinguishable. at around 11:30 pm i was lying in bed and i felt a little bit uncomfortable so i decided to change the position of my pillow. my bed faces north and is pressed against the southern wall so if i turn my head south i can see out my window and see the sky clearly.As i was doing this i was sitting upright, i moved my pillow and began to lay back when something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention. i quickly turned my head south and saw a bright star, all seemed normal and i continued to look at the sky. all of a sudden a bright light appeared west and quite close to this star, it continued to move west rather slowly. i continued to watch this object for another 10 seconds before it stopped and disappeared. it reappeared at a much lower altitude and slightly further to the west and after 10 more seconds it disappeared. once again reappearing but at a much higher altitude and further west. this pattern continued for 30 more seconds until i could not see it anymore through the thicket of trees off in the distance. \r\n\r\ni have no idea what i saw last night. i

to see,looking around the stars, i fixed on three stars in an elonggatted triangle,perfect in shape,looked like any other stars, but as soon as i fixed my eyes on them they started to move together in a west northwest direction towards tree line, i freeked and started screaming,hey, hey, goddamit, no that does not do that, pointing to them, and by now thinking that that or they, was an it, a ufo. i was tring to get my friends attention, to no avail.The next thought in my head, as the ufo was going out of my site in the tree line, was that the ufo was watching me until i saw it. it all took of 1 second to start moving once i saw it. total time as it slowly move to the tree line and out of my site was 15 seconds at most. and my dumbass friends did'nt belive me, that pissed me off. this was my second siting in my life.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

longmont a half-dozen or so extremely bright, flat objects stacked in a tight formation, one just above and the side of the next. the proximity of these objects to each other was alarming to see. none of them appeared to be moving; several were tilted at 20-30 degrees from the rest. they were just hanging there in a tight group, one above the other. about two minutes after i first noticed them, the lights all disappeared in the very same instant. they simply went out all at once, as if someone had thrown a switch. i've never seen anything like that. didn't see faa or other blinking lights on any of them, nor did any appear to ever turn, bank, dim, or move away - they remained in the same arrangement and distances from one another for the length of my sighting. very strange, and more than a little alarming in that moment to see that kind of air traffic in such close formation in darkness. i'm sure many other must have witnessed this event, as it was during rush hour on a busy stretch of state highway.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20450,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.1695468,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11102009-0026","longitude":-105.0968475,"occurred":1257908700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1257922030000,"summary":"Six

enough to see what i did without them!), i turned around to grab them out of my car (took maybe 4 seconds).  when i looked back up, they were all gone.  i was stunned, wondering what they were. my thoughts were along the line of \"what the ??!!@@@ were those?!\"; although, i was also thinking that they looked exactly like 5 ufo's hovering. decided to go for a walk down the street.  saw what looked like one more again towards the west (towards the mountains...I live on the front range with the mountains to the west)...It was a disc-looking shape, all bright (it is totallly dark here by 6:00 now, since the time change), moving very slowly, and then disappeared.  i couldn't really tell if it just disappeared or went behind a house.  continued walking for about 10 minutes, and then went back home and took a drive towards the west where there aren't many houses/obstacles for night-sky viewing; but, didn't see anything else.  very intiguing, mysterious incident.  i wish there had
