object, it was so far away already that he could not make out the object good enough to actually observe that it did not have wings or a tail fin. i believe what really caught my eye about that  object was that it seemed just solid silver and it shined unbelievably. it moved rapifly and smoothly through the sky with no trail (no apparent exhaust , no con trail nor chem trail) and there was no sound.  the fact that there was no sound didn't really bother me because it was a fair distance away. but it was close enough that i could see details well enough to tell as it moved that there were no wings as the object shifted from the east of us to the north northeast i still couldn't see any wings and typically when i see jets or planes as the plane moves you can see the different parts
