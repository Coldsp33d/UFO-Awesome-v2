 it was so powerful it shook my entire apartment and rattled the windows. i immediately jumped up out of bed frightened and looked out my bedroom window.  my bedroom window faced our apartment complexes small parking lot and just past the parking lot is a fence followed by houses on the next block over.\r\n\r\nthrough my window i looked out and across the parking lot and over an adjacent house i noticed two strange slowly pulsating stationary lights. one light a was dark red and one a dark blue.  these lights were spaced maybe 20-25 feet apart, one of them appeared to be right above the roof of this house and the other other appeared to be slightly lower just at the fence line level between 2 houses. \r\n\r\nat almost the moment i fixed my eyes on these 2 strange lights i heard a police megaphone kick on and the voice of an officer specifically warning \"do not leave your residence, this is the police stay inside your home\" at this point i became curious, alarmed about what was going on the next block over so i quickly threw on some clothes on, stepped outside and tried to get a better look at exactly what i was seeing some 100 feet away above this house.  \r\n\r\ni watched these lights above this house, staring at them...I have never\r\nseen anything quite like this before. i'm a cigarette smoker and spent alot of time on my porch looking in this direction.  this was something bizarre!  i cautiously decided to try to get closer look so i walked about half way across the parking lot with my eyes fixed on the 2 objects when i noticed the red colored light had dissapeared, just vanished! about 3 seconds later i could hear the police saying something but i could not make it out, their voices raised...And then immediately following that they began focusing spotlights at the top of a tall tree sitting next to this house.   \r\n\r\nthey were scanning the top of this tree with the spotlights for about 15\r\nseconds. apparently looking for something, the object that vanished..Or maybe from their vantage point they spotted something else that i did not see from my line of sight.  at this point i got scared and decided for my own personal safety that i should not continue any farther across the parking lot and turned around. \r\n\r\ni then decided to walk to the enterance of the apartment complex and look down the street in the direction of the next block over and i noticed an unmarked police car blocking both lanes of the next road over, it had its headlights off, i could see it was an unmarked because the flashers were on and illuminating the hood and roof of the car and it was not marked like a normal beaverton police cruiser. \r\n\r\ni have told this story to a few people, and most have written the red and blue lights i saw off as comming from police cruisers on the next street, but i know these strange lights or orbs or whatever that they were, were definatly not comming from the cruisrs and they were not reflections. they were hovering objects maybe the size of basketballs and once they disapeared the police were searching the trees for them. \r\n\r\nlater that same day i was perplexed by what it was i had witnessed, i could not get it out of my mind.  it was eating at me because of how unusual it was so i contacted the washington county sheriffs department from my work phone during my lunch break.  i got a gal on the phone who immediately put me on hold after a brief rundown of my question..I was put on hold for more then 15 mins and eventually i was transfered to what i was told was a 'corporal' who informed me that the sheriffs department had no record of officers on sw hazel st that morning. \r\n\r\nthe next day after work i walked over to the next street over and knocked on the door of 4 houses and asked the residents what it was that they had seen, unfortunately 3 out of the 4 were hispanic and spoke little to no english and the one who did talk did not know what it was himself.\r\n\r\ni know it sounds crazy, but this is really what i saw that morning, im sure someone in the neighborhood or complex heard and seen this besides me.

so he could do big orange cat related things. i was swaddled in my robe against the the november chill. i was wide awake from too much coffee earlier in the day and decided to have a cigarette on the porch.\r\n\r\ni live in the middle of the city and our house is located almost directly under the path of incoming air traffic from memphis international airport. 3am is magic time because fedex recieves most of their overnight packages starting then. i can sit outside and literally see the rivets on the underbelly of incoming cargo planes. \r\n\r\nso, i am sitting on the porch, just flicked the cigarette in the yard (i'll pick it up later), and petting my big orange kitty, sam, when it dawns on me that the air traffic has thinned to nearly zero. maybe it was a slow night in the overnight shipping business...Who knows, right? sometimes it's slow, sometimes it extremely heavy. at this point, i get up to go back inside.\r\n\r\njust as i am walking opening the door, i hear the doppler effect of really loud, fast engines. the cat scurries in and i walk back out. i missed the first jet, but not the second and third. memphis int. has a national guard base within it's borders, so again, not a big thing to see fighter jets landing or taking off. what made me stay outside was the fact that these guys aren't landing. instead they are flying around, criss-crossing the city. \r\n\r\ni sit back down on the steps and look up. as soon as i look up, i see a shooting star. i think, \"rad!!! jets and meteors!\" the shooting star appeared on the horizon directly in front of me then skimmed the atmosphere from a six o'clock position to about the mid-way point in the sky from my point of view (figure that out in your mind). it was bright white and awesome. at this point the jet sounded as if they pulled off their engines and went in for a landing.\r\n\r\nthen the shooting star reappeared...\r\n\r\nhigh, very high in the sky, directly over head. i stared at it and thought, \"huh...It slowed down.\" at this point, i was still thinking it was a meteor or something. then the damn then made a slow, wide arch to my left and doubled back on itself. it then made a very fast, serpentine movement back to the six o'clock position and quickly faded from view.\r\n\r\ni sat there and it occured to me that i had seen a ufo. i couldn't sleep. i literally sat on the porch for half an hour, then sat on the couch until daybreak. i was scared for some reason because right before the thing faded from view (and i will swear on my life) there was a flash that lasted a fraction of a second that lit up my street .\r\n\r\ni know it wasn't a trick of my eyes because every dog in the neighborhood lost it's mind at the same time.\r\n\r\nanyways, that's my story...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

they were supposed to visit. well in trying not to be 100% claimed by it, we were unable to pull ourselves to not think about it. so the night of \"said arrival\" we stayed up late looking into the sky. he was at his house and i was at mine. i went outside with a blanket and laid on my porch at about 10:00 pm. my father came outside to smoke a cigarette. we talked about why i believed in ufos and other acts of this \"sci-fi\" stuff as he called it. after about 2 hours of my sitting in the cold he cam back outside with some hot tea and asked if anything had happened yet. then just after he asked that and i said no, he asked me what \"that\" was; first we saw this item which looked like a normal shooting star, but it was huge and shot across the sky, then we heard an explosion and it broke into 3 different lights. we wrote it off as just being a shooting star that exploded upon hitting the atmosphere, and continued on it's path (but we never thought we would hear it). about 30 minutes after that, i saw this weird star above the trees from the direction that the shooting star had disappeared, it was changing colors but just staying there, i was confused and asked my dad if he could see it, because i figured my eyes were playing tricks on my after starring at a black sky for 2 hours, he said he could see it but not when he was looking directly at it, he could only see it when he looked to the side of it. it was changing from blue, to red, green, yellow, and then white. we talked about what it could be, feeling bad that my telescope broke just 3 months before, and figured it was just reflecting off the clouds, and that it was just the city lights, it never moved all night. we waited to see if anything else would happen, at about 2:30 am i saw this item from around that star all the sudden there was an orange light. i called my dad back outside to ask him what it was. it was to big to be a satellite, and moving to fast, but it was still moving slow. my dad pointed at it and said \"see that, sometimes planes turn on their front lights, and they have an orange tint to them, it's probably just a plane\", but we watched it for an hour slowly moving over the sky, never blinking. at one point it was right over us and almost stopped. usually if a plane was that close, we would see the lights blinking, it seemed to be big enough like a plane only about 300 feet in the air, but it looked small enough to be a plane 2000 feet in the air, i was confused how it could look two different sizes. it was just a solid orange color i went inside to get a camera but it was pitch black and the only camera i had was a little 50$ one, that can't even pick up the moon on a dark night. we followed the light until it started to speed up, just before it hit the tree line it shot almost straight up into the air, and the orange light turned a red color. my dad and i looked at each other, and i shouted \"oh my god! i know you saw that! that was not a plane!!\" my dad sat down and was trying to think, trying to label it as any and all technological item he ever saw. he said when he was working on the air craft carrier before i was born they saw three of those things, each time at the same time. when they asked the captain he just said \"the air force never tells us when they like to run their planes.\" but my dad swears he was in the room with the radar and nothing came up one night. he said \"we saw an airplane and caught it on radar, but something was right behind it, that same orange color, but the only thing that came up was the air plane. we radioed the plane and asked if the captain could see any lights around it, and he answered no, but we followed it until the plane was out of sight, the light stayed at least 400 feet behind the plane, until it just vanished. it looked so bright the captain had to have seen it.\" he went back inside saying \"i don't believe all this crap\" and told my mom, she came out and talked to me about how every time about 20 years someone claims to speak to aliens and how i shouldn't get my hopes up like she did when she was my age. she explained that it was a little weird all this was happening on the night my boyfriend and i had talked about for 4 months but that it was all coincidental and could be explained. i called my boyfriend and told him about it, he said he never saw anything but that he heard an explosion about 3 hours ago, when i had seen the shooting star. but he said you should never be able to hear when a shooting star explodes like that. we talked about that night for the rest of the night, i never saw anything else that night and never went to sleep. i asked my other friends and they all heard the explosion but never saw anything.","distance":"20 Feet or Less,

through richfield when we noticed a bright cone of light in the hills approximately 1/2 mile west of town.  at first we thought it was some sort of helicopter or flare.  however, as we watched it, it seemed too bright, too quiet, and too stationary to be either one.  the cone appeared to be shining down from a source approximately 300 or 400 feet in the air above a well-known flood control dam.  the cone appeared to extend from there down to the ground.  we couldn't tell what the source looked like, since the cone itself was so bright.  since we were young, curious, and in a jeep, we thought we could get a better look at the light.  as we drove closer, the source of the cone flew off at an amazing speed leaving behind what looked like a blue lighting streak.  although the source was gone, the cone of light remained for quite some time.  the cone faded as we continued to drive closer to the dam and by the time we arrived on location, the cone was completely gone.  after the jeep was turned off, we stood there in the silence waiting for something to happen again.  unfortunately, no evidence was there - no sounds, no smells, and no other physical evidence that anything unusual had just occurred.  later we told others about what we had seen, and several of them confirmed seeing the exact same thing.  some of them as far away as 6 or 7 miles.  as far as i know, nobody has yet

been watching the skies diligently and know very well the difference between airplanes small and large and helicopters by now i can tell by the light patterns what an object is. i was leaving work and it was right around 6:15-6:30 am and at first when this caught my eye i thought it may be a possible helium balloon or a weather blimp, i knew it was not a plane or helicopter. it was fairly long and the shape of a non cut cigar at one end had a white strobe light flashing very fast almost looked like a sparkler and at the opposite end it seemed wider but not to much and had white lights that flashed from side to side and when it was actually in flight going in front of me with the wide end farthest away from me it seemed that the lights on the wide end were more to the left of the aircraft not in total synch but strangely to the outside of the left. when i first came up on it it was hovering in a slanted direction yet seem to be flying in that position  the same direction as i was driving and as i came up close to it i could see it very clear then, it's position turned straight and was still flying in front of me to my right and as it flew ahead of me i saw that it looked as though it were metal and glass, the rounded end being metal and in the middle it was a mixed make up of  glass or clear material outlined in metal, at the wide end there was metal in the middle then the clear on each side outlined in the  metal and at the end of the wide end there was a dome right in the middle of it which was smaller than the width of the end, there was no light on the dome. as it flew beyond me it got pretty far then stopped and hovered there until i came up on it again and as i drove under it i could see it very well and all of a sudden it started flying backwards with the cigar end leading. i thought that it was gone and that was the last of it so i kept driving and watching the sky and was sad that it was gone but from the corner of my eye i saw it soaring ahead again to my left side this time flying fast, and again it stopped until i came to it and it started going backwards again. i remembered thinking does this thing know i am watching it and i wish it would follow me to my house so my kids could see this, it was astounding and i wondered if any of the people in the cars passing by had noticed it besides me but, as it flew backward i figured that was it but in a bit it was up on my right side again and this time it soared ahead flying strangely sideways and kept going farther to the right more toward the west. i was on lbj about to go east on i30 taking the texarkana exit and lost sight of the object at that time. i have my own ideas and thoughts on this but who really knows at this point. someday i feel we will all know exactly what they

the kitchen. i heard my dad calling me loudly from outside. not sure what he wanted i went out onto the deck to see him pointing up in a south easterly direction. coming over the neighbor's house behind us, where three beige metallic spheres flying in a v formation, approximately a 100 feet in the air, heading in a north westerly direction. one in front and two spread evenly behind the first. there was absolutely no sound coming from these objects. the spheres then stopped moving and lined up in a perfectly straight line. one next to the other. they then began to rotate their positions, juggling their positions in perfect unison. they did this for a short period and then went into the v formation again, before continuing their movement in a north westerly direction. we watched them go over our house until we couldn't see them anymore.  at the time everyone was a little stunned by what they saw. i remember feeling unnerved by what we had just seen, knowing that they were not balloons of any type and their behavior suggested deliberate, intelligent movement.

they were back today for a good 20 minutes. they would blink off and on quickly and looked like a large orange ball up in the sky. they were coming on one at a time then the final time one came on and went off then another came on a few seconds later directly to the left of this one almost adjacent to it very brifly and went off. its very clear out, they were to the south of tuscola they were also to the sw of tuscola as they were appearing in varios parts of the sky for 20 mintues. even though they were lit for a brief second they seemed to be pretty large i would say almost the size of my first. they seemed fairly close too. these are the same lights i saw on oct 2008, jan 30th 2009 and sometime in march of 2009.","distance":"Over One

split apart into 8 flying objects that were all lit up and they flew together across the sky, but not in a row but in a triangle formation and then they were gone that fast.  maybe they were fighters planes but i have never seen that may at once together. i definetly felt they were chasing something that fell from the sky. i checked the news but have heard nothing, thanks, what an awsome

6:30 pm. it was dark , and we were unloading firewood. i noticed an extremely bright light moving from the southwest to the northeast , the object appeared to be cruising altitude for a jet, i see plenty of them day and night. it stood out because of it's  intense brightness and it was moving at a good speed, above average for something that high to move across the whole sky in a minute or so. as it got closer the light remained intense, so much so that it made my eyes blur a bit when staring. as it flew directly over head i pointed it out to my brother in law, he commented that it hurt his eyes to watch it, i pointed out that there were no blinking lights at all, he acknowledged this and agreed that this was peculiar . when the object was about 80% across the sky it faded very fast  and dissapeared completely . we stood there dumbfounded and i commented that he had witnessed his first ufo. we both agreed that that was not a plane and we had witnessed something very peculiar. as far as the sky, it was clear and dark with lots of stars visible as well as moving aircraft.
