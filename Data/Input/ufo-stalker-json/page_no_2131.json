but not an ufo. like i mentioned, i was standing in the front of my house, so i went into the house and got my camera. because i was shaking, i gave the camera to my husband so he recorded for about a minute, but it wasn't as bright as it was in the begining but you can still see it and the color changes. the light continued traveling south east and then it just disappeared!

(<)  the lights were not strobing or blinking which was very unusual to me as everything passing this way is usually aircraft beginning their trip from charlotte douglas itnl airport.  the triangle passed the satellite and kept going south, never blinking.  as i was watching the triangle from behind me i could hear the blades of a helicopter coming from the north, same direction the red light and the triangle came from.  the copter seemed to be very high in the sky because the sound was kinda muffled and the blinking red and white lights on it looked like small lights.  i mean the lights were small and the sound was muffled which led me to believe it was very high.  i was shocked about this sighting.  nothing about it \"felt\" normal to me.\r\n\r\ni have to add that this is the second sighting i've had here in lancaster of the red, zig-zagging light.  i saw the very same thing back in 2006 and thought it was odd.  it also made it's way across the sky in less than two seconds.  i reported it too i believe. this is also the third night this week i've heard a helicopter outside.\r\n\r\nhope this helps someone.  i'm kinda

kept occurring. had to change the time to get it to go. someone needs to check this form, thanks)\r\n\r\n12:04 to 12:06 am the morning of monday, 11/9/2009.  my wife and i were driving home from a late sunday night movie at park meadows. she noticed a bright flickering light in the sky out her side of the car and got my attention.  i glanced up then parked along the road fairly quickly. it was moving very slowly away from us, first at an elevation of roughly 45 degrees, and a distance from us of perhaps a couple thousand feet, although distance was very hard to judge. about 2 minutes later it disappeared by fading out abruptly. it seemed like it disappeared into the cloud layer, at something like 15 to 20 degrees elevation, and at a greater distance from us off to the east.\r\n\r\nwe first saw it as we were rounding the curve on e. county line road heading east and then curving to the north just before it intersects with e. otero ave.  this is near centennial airport. you can see the spot where where we first saw it on google earth at 39d 34m 1.27s n and 104d 49m 38.47s w. i pulled over at the point where the road widens to create a right-turn lane for turning east onto otero. i got out and quickly took a video clip on my cell phone.  couldn't tell if that video worked, and will check it out tomorrow.  we got back in car, turned onto otero going east, then stopped again within 100 feet or so of the intersection. we watched it move away from us just a little to the right of straight out our front window. looking on google maps, it appeared to be moving pretty much due east during the two minutes of the sighting.\r\n\r\nall we could see in the dark sky was a bright, flickering strobe light, almost sparkling in appearance. the pulses of light were very quick, perhaps 5 or 6 quick flashes followed with a short pause, several flashes per second. either the object was moving around a bit, or there was more than one strobe light on the source, as the light point was jiggling around in location as it was flickering. i carefully compared its location and movement with lighting on the horizon, and am convinced the motion was more than misperception due to autokinesis.\r\n\r\nno other lights could be seen, just the brilliant almost bluish-white strobing light or lights. it started out close enough to us that i feel certain any conventional aircraft's lights should have been visible.\r\n\r\nweather was very calm with little or no detectable wind at ground level. no stars could be seen as it appeared there was a layer of clouds. the sky was very dark.\r\n\r\nwe got a good bearing at the point it disappeared, as it was directly above a red light on a water tower or tank east and slightly south of our location just around the corner on otero, where i stopped the car a second time. this tank can be seen on google maps, satellite view at 39d 33m 58.29s n and 104d 49m 1.78s w\r\n\r\njust minutes before the sighting, as we drove past the south end of the runway area of centennial airport, i had noticed strobing lights near ground level marking that end of the runway approach. not sure if they flash all the time or only when there's traffic. i did notice them flashing tonight. we didn't notice any other air traffic that we can remember.\r\n\r\non a side note, we've twice recently noticed aircraft on landing approach into centennial having their bright landing light cycle on and off at a frequency of something like once per second. the strobing light tonight was entirely different. the landing lights would smoothly light up and dim down rythmically due to the filament bulb rise and fall time. the strobing light tonight was composed of extremely short brilliant flashes in an irregular pattern resulting in a bright flickering effect.  i mention those landing lights because my wife and i have talked about them in the last few days, as we do watch the centennial traffic quite often and notice when anything is unique. we suspect the landing lights are explainable, but neither of us have ever seen anything like the flickering strobes we saw tonight.\r\n\r\ni do have a theory, and perhaps someone can check this out and get back to me, as a quick check on the internet didn't provide me with any good answers. since the sighting was at 12:04 am, a balloon launched from near centennial airport at exactly midnight is something to check into. as i understand it, though, weather balloons are launched at midnight greenwhich time, but perhaps this was some other type of research balloon. were the lower level winds below the cloud layer generally easterly at that time and location? are their balloons with strobe lights being launched by anyone? can a launch be verified for this date, time, and location?  did anyone else report this sighting?  thanks for any answers you might be able to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

off one of the kids for an event, enjoying the beautiful weather while we had some time to kill.  we had stopped the car and moved around a couple times admiring the night sky since it was dark (no city lights) and flat and we were able to get great views of the stars. \r\n\r\nwe were both commenting that it had been a long time since we'd seen so much of the night sky, since we don't often find

the tail end of its disappearance.  we never saw it move in the sky, just remain still then disappear.\r\n\r\nwe both got out of the car at that point and continued to observe the sky for about 20

noticed the object start slowing its descent, then the object \"deployed\" i watched as the light split into four separate lights each with their own small tail on them, that began to perform their own flight maneuvers. i pulled over to the side of the road near westlake parkway, from that advantage point it appeared that the first light i saw had stopped descending and was hovering as the three other objects descended in a spiraling pattern. at this time i also saw \"other lights\" suddenly pop on around the first light that was appearing to be stationary in the sky. at one point i counted up to six of these strange yellowish lights in the sky. the entire time there was a strange military craft circling the area.\r\ni picked up my iphone to try and make a call but i the phone had no

lights but was not in a very good vantage point. however i was able to get a better look at the strange military craft, it flew directly over the blockbuster parking lot i was at. as it flew maybe 2000-3000 feet over my head i could make out the sounds of four big prop driven engines. i did not see any maker���s or insignia���s on the aircraft, however, this massive aircraft also had four big lights on it (two on each wing), that made the aircraft very easy to spot in the sky as it held its very tight bank around these strange lights. this sighting lasted maybe five minutes afterwards i

(hard to tell really) the reason i say that is because when this jet reached the thick chemtrail i lost sight of it until it went thru it or over it or whatever. this jet was not leaving any sign of a trail either and it was also much lower altitude than the other one. i could hear the engines on this one and see it very clear since it was fairly low altitude. it wasnt so low per say as it were coming in or taking off (not that low) but just \"cruizing\" at what i would call a normal low altitude from what i have personally see in jet planes. then i noticed another jet traveling in another direction close to the chemtrails but not leaving one itself. the chemtrails were made before any of these planes were sighted but i didnt see what made the trails. i never thought anything was really \"out of the ordinary\" so to speak until i looke toward the south and then i noticed there was what appeared to be a large star when a halo of sorts encircling it moving northeast very slowly at a very low altitude. now this craft was flying at an altitude i would compare to a \"cessna\" or maybe an \"ultralite\" aircraft. it never behaved eratic or anything but proceeded in a straight line northeast and never made any sound what so ever. it never blinked or there were no other lights near it. i have never seen any planes or helicopters fly that low and not make a sound at all. it flew right over my house and i observed it for at least 2-minutes or slightly longer. i have never reported anything like this before and have only experienced one other strange sighting in my life which actually was stranger than this but that was back in 1996. i hope someone can investigate this because i do not think that this was a normal craft. please let me know if anyone else saw this or can explain it. i didnt have time to get my camera or binoculars or anything so i have no photos but i know what i saw. i watched the craft until it dissapered over the trees in mu yard and i could no longer see it. please keep my personal info private. thank you........Randall k. herron","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":20385,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.7716845,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11082009-0013","longitude":-84.7610285,"occurred":1257728400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,   Sphere,   Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1257739313000,"summary":"Bright yellow star-like with a faint \"halo\" as such around it slowing moving,low altitude, no noise at all.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":0,"locationName":"Chatsworth, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:171425"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Baltimore","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Walked outside of my house at the time above and saw what looked to be an airplanes headlights coming over my house from the south.  i continued to watch until it was over my house and going by towards the north.  i expected to see the lights on the ends of the wings as it went by thinking they were being obstructed by the headlights of the plane as it was coming towards me.  it went over head making no noise and stayed bright, as it went by the light slowly dimmed out until it was gone. i would put the height as about the average altitude of a plane once it is under its flying altitude after take off.  i live very close to martins state airport and am very familiar with the types of planes and normal flying lanes.  this object adhered to nothing of i have seen in the skies around here before.  i am also a backyard astronomist and am able to make objective decisions about objects i see in the sky.

the bike ride they went on that day, and i stepped outside for a cigarette.  my usual smoking area is on the back porch and i regularly observe the sky when out there (making me quite familiar with the night sky in my area).  \r\n\r\n  while looking towards the east, i noticed a white strobing sphere in the sky, about 30' above horizon and at a far distance.  the sphere was about twice the size of venus and the luminosity was greater than that of polaris.  this is a common area to spot commercial airlines flying towards the bay area, but the light i saw was strobing way too fast to be the lights on a plane or helicopter (the skies were pretty clear too).  there also weren't any red or blue lights like you find on the starboard and port side of an airliner, nor did i hear the sound of a helicopter or plane.\r\n\r\n  this strobing sphere flew at a high rate of speed from the east to the west, passing in front of me at about a 70' angle at the closest.  i quickly yelled for my mother to come out and look to make sure i wasn't hallucinating (i knew i wasn't, but needed someone else to see what i saw).  she came out and spotted the object as well.\r\n\r\n  the object continued at a high speed to the west for a little bit longer, it didn't appear to fly over the hills between tracy and livermore.  the object then began traveling nnw.  now, i say \"began traveling\" because there was no visible turn made.  it was like if you move the mouse cursor to the left steadily, then immediately shift to moving it to nearly the middle of the top of your screen.  a conventional aircraft would have a visible curve in their trajectory when making that kind of an angle change, but this didn't.  two conventional airliners flew into the viewable sky and i was able to point out to my mother the significant speed and altitude differences.\r\n\r\n  after that, my mother went inside and i continued to watch the object fly off to the nnw.  it faded away from view when it got too far.  at first, i tried to convince myself it was some kind of satellite, but i later realized satellites don't make turns like that.  now, i don't know what i saw, but i'm sure it wasn't conventional aircraft or a satellite.\r\n\r\n  during and after the observation, i would have to say i've been excited.  i've seen enough evidence from others to know that extraterrestrials exist and have wanted to spot an actual ufo for quite some time.  i knew the first steps were to watch the night sky, so i have been for some time.  i'm happy to have finally seen something i can't explain.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
