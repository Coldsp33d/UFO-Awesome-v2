first it was just hovering there,then it moved silently towards me slightly to my left passed and went by before dissapearing into thin air.I had to pull over and exit my vehicle to get a look at this thing as i knew straight away it was different to anything i had ever seen before.I had on me a digital camera ,but in my excitement could not activate the video,instead i just took one single photo of a minute orange dot in the distance.Although its a bad photo you can clearly see how orange the object was.Im into the ufo scene and always looking,but also making sure there are no strobe lights are anything of that nature,making sure its not a plane or helicopter.But heres the deal.Gets home to tell my partner and she seen it also.The very next night ,the 6th it was back.My partner and my 5 year old daughter were watching it hovering over the town from our bedroom window.We all watched it for a couple of minutes,then i ran for my camera,but as soon as i got it ,my partner said it had just blinked out and dissapeared into thin air.Just now on the 8th,i was driving to the shops and there it is again.I pulled over and watched it hovering over the vacinity of bolton a town nearby to ours.It hovered for a couple of minutes,then sort of circled upwards,going round and round in very tight circles,before it sort of shrank in size and completely dissapeared.I came home checked the web to see if our local paper has been covering any sightings.When all i could find was a few storys of orange lights over lancashire england,i had to tell someone and here i am telling you.I am absolutly posotive that what i saw was no conventional craft,and as far as im concerned have elimanated such objects as chinese lanterns and fireworks etc.The way in wich this thing hovered then moved silently and quickly,then dissapearing into thin air,has astounded me.I have never reported anything in my life before ,but thought it was to good a sighting to dismiss without sharing it with someone such as you at mufon.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

park to capture it on film. by the time i arrive at the great hill in central park, 3 huge blackchoppers begin to surround me and either monitor me or the red craft that resembles orbs attached together to form some sort of airplane. it was very scary. i was very frightened. they just stood over the hill and over my head for a while. the red craft re-appears and you see the blackchoppers start to react to it.. one chopper flew directly under the red craft. the craft was above the choppers and i and the 2 witnesses i bumped into saw it all. after a while, the choppers leave and the red craft begins to fly lower and lower. it also begins to fly directly over me as well.  this happened on wednesday night. the choppers came back a few hours later and began to fly over the park once again. what the crafts looks like is multiple orbs, green, white, red all huddled and attached to each other to form a plane. the \"craft\" seems to at times change shape or patterns in mid air. at times it looks like helicopter, then an airplane and even an airplane flying backwards...  somes times just 2 lights are flashing, other times 4-6...   no noise , just a loud humming sound.. very strange.. this is over central park in nyc, and nothing is suppose to be flying that low due to new 9/11 flight regulations.  my footage is from on top of the great hill, located on 104th & 105th and central park. the highest point in central park..  those black choppers are here for a reason..  i think either the military is up to something or the choppers are the ufos them selfs who mimic our planes and helicopters..

my pomeranian began barking and wouldn't stop. i yelled to her to be quiet as i thought she was barking at the dog next door.  she continued to bark and ran inside and began frantically barking at me. it was then that i noticed she was looking out the window at the sky behind me.  i ran outside and when i looked up i saw a large flaming meteor about the size of a full moon.  it was black in the center with white flames around it and red on the edge of the tail.  it was so large and moving so quickly i froze and the only thing i could think of is if this thing crashes we are going to die.  before i could gain my composure and decide what to do it changed right before my eyes.  it suddenly stopped and became a smaller flamed object and turned into one, then two, then three huge balls of extremely white light.  it was as if they had been stacked one behind the other. one to the right then one to the left while the last remained in the center.  they were very bright and each about the size of a full moon.  they were perfectly spaced apart in a straight line.  it took a minute for my thoughts to catch up as a second before i was deciding how to survive a crashing meteor and now that was gone and i had accept a new impossible situation in a very short amount of time.  i remember saying out loud, \"what is happening?\" and that is when i noticed some neighbors talking in hushed voices and i believe that they were seeing it too.  \r\nafter hovering in a line for a few seconds they began to flash on and off.  when they would turn back on they would be in a different location in the sky. they seemed to take turns flashing on and off. they went from a straight line to a triangle and then a diagonal line.  they seemed to go through several patterns but i don't recall all of them. they also were higher and lower in the sky at different times.  \r\nthey finally ended up in an upside down triangle. the top two would flash in and out. and finally did not come back.  the last one remained and this was the only time that i saw actually movement instead of flashing in and out and ending up in a different location.  it floated slowing towards the ground and i really thought it was going to land.  it hovered very low for a few seconds and then if finally flashed out.\r\ni stood in the silence and could not believe how quiet it was. there were the normal planes approaching and waiting to land at dfw airport.  i could not believe i did not see any military aircraft or some type of activity to signify that something amazing just happened. i finally  saw a large plane that seemed very close to the ground but i could not tell if it was military in the dark.  i waited a little while longer and a single helicopter flew around the neighborhood briefly and then it was gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

arrived about 6.45p.  i had already put some potatoes on the grill to cook, and at about 7p i went outside to flip them.  the husband of the couple (call him 's') followed me out there, because we were already in the middle of a conversation about the real estate market.  at exactly 7.04 i felt the need to look at the sky.  \r\n\r\nfirst thing i noticed was a really bright, white light..And when i say bright, i mean way brighter than anything else in the sky. the object looked almost stationary.  then i noticed it moving. i couldn't figure out what it was...The only thing i could think of is the iss.\r\n\r\nit was at this point that i yelled at 's' to get out and look at it.  he was now on his phone, but he came out from under the covered patio...He was as awe-struck as i was. at this point, he noticed a jet in the sky.  then we both noticed that this bright object and the jet were going to perfectly intersect in the sky. \r\n\r\nthe object started moving faster, and by our estimation traveling about twice as fast as the jet.  i almost thought it was a rocket or something at this point, because of the timing of the event.  now both of us are really in awe!\r\n\r\nafter they crossed paths, the object seemed to increase speed even more.  it made a gentle sweeping northerly turn...Followed by a gentle sweeping easterly turn...Followed by a another gentle sweeping northerly turn...And then again, followed by a gentle sweeping easterly turn.  then it just faded away. i'm not sure if this was because it was going into the earths shadow...But i can say this, unless we have satellites that turn, this was not a satellite. i also know it was not a shooting star, and it wasn't another plane. \r\n\r\nnow, i'm shooting myself for not having my camera on hand.  so, i had to draw a picture of what i saw.  \r\n\r\nalso, this may have something to do with it...We have a international air show in town this week.  so, who knows...","distance":"Over One

color to purple as it got closer to the ground. wondering where it may have gone i happened to look to the left of me in a auto center parking lot, less than a football field away, saw a strange light in line with the street lights a red round light with 3 or more blue lights that were smaller than the single red light the combo of the lights of the red and blue made like a purple.It was not large infact it fit right in with the street lights from a distance and was dead still. i could not grasp what i was looking at.I was still driving while i was trying to figure out what that combo of lights was. at the intersection of pelandale and mc henery i made a left turn hoping to get a glimpse of the \"thing\" from a different angle and by that time, it was in the air hoovering around quietly and almost balloon like but not going up in to the sky like a balloon but more like a deflated balloon. i pulled off and parked on the side of mc henery and tried to get a cell phone photo of it but it would not show up on my screen.  the photo was black. it was not a large object. i left and it was still just hoovering in the air.  i have a really hard time grasping what i just saw and even wierder is that from the looks of the bright object falling from the sky and then seeing the small red and multi blue lighted object i have a really hard time coralating that that would be the same object but

asked my cousin which exit to take before he went to sleep. much of i-75, once you're out of the city is dark and not many lights... he told point down the highway telling me the exit is near those light poles a couple miles away... as i got closer to the lights i started to see that they were not light poles and as we got closer that they were not stationary... as i got within a quater mile of the lights i woke up my cousin and told him that those were'nt light poles, that they were helicopters... and as we got closer we both looked and could see that they weren't helicopters either... we got within about 150yds we could clearly see that the objects were about 200ft from the ground and that 1 object was hovering in the middle of the highway, a second was on our side of the highway hovering and another across the highway hovering maybe 50ft higher than the others... i slowed down from 75mph to 25mph with my head out of the window while we started to freak, saying \"i know this is not what i'm thinking, ain't no damn way\"... as we got up close to the objects one of them started crossing the highway directly above the truck...I was looking up from over the sterring wheel at thousands of lights beneath a disc shaped object just gliding across, making no sound at all... we could see that there was a fourth object in the field off the highway hovering, and looked to be spinning.. but, the others were'nt spinning, just hovering.. then we could see a fifth object coming from ahead of us on the opposite side of the highway, moving in the driection of the oncoming traffic... i told my cousin to look out the window as the object passed over us, and he stuck his head out the window to see, and i could hear him saying \"oh [cms/tg/pd].. it's a disc, it's a real disc.. we could see the entire bottom of the disc changing colors like thousands of different color lights constantly changing.. the other 4 disc seemed to only have lights on the sides. we had nothing to take a picture with as my boost phone had no camera on it.  but, i can swear on my father's grave that what we seen was real and that they were discs.. and other people on the highway seen the same thing as they also, slowed nearly to stopping.. i don't know if the radio turned off during this encounter as i don't remeber turning it down.. but we sat quietly for the rest of the ride amazed and confused. i only wish i had a camero phone then. as we drove away i could see all the objects eventually going into the field on our side of the road and i watched in the rear-view mirror until they were out of sight. i don't know if it was from the adrenaline, but we both felt extremely energized for the remainder of the night.  i never felt threatened or scared, and wanted to stop and get out.. but my cousin would'nt let me and swore to leave me there if i stoped the truck. it was a freaky, but great  experience, i felt really happy for some reason.","distance":"101-500

dinner, when my 7 year old daughter noticed \"yellow shooting stars\" in the sky. i looked towards the southwest and saw three yellowish, extremely bright lights, in an upside-down triangular shape. all three of these lights were definitely separate entities, but were in perfect formation with each other, almost moving as one. when i first saw them, they were heading straight down with a tail behind them - kind of reminded me of what a comet would look like. all three of them made this streak behind them, then slowed down and the streak stopped. the light then faded slowly out to a pinprick and then all the sudden, they brightened back up again and went back higher in the sky and repeated the process over again. they fell slowly from the sky and had a trail behind them. the trail again phased out and then the light dimmed again to a pinprick. i ran inside the house and got my husband to come out and see it also. he watched the trio of lights do the same thing i saw two more times and then it disappeared from sight and didn't reappear. unfortunately, the lights vanished before we could get video on it. during and after, there was a huge plane of some kind that was circuling the airspace. when it turned, it was almost at a perfect 90 degree angle, which for a plane this big, it was amazing to watch. we didn't get a close look at the plane as it was winter months here and it was already dark, but we definitely saw it's massive size and the lights that were on it. it was also apparent that the triangluar-type lights were not part of this plane shape. rather, it looked like the plane was circling the area, almost like it was looking out for these lights, or whatever was making them. i checked online and wasn't able to find any reports of special events in the area that would give a legitimate excuse for the lights. if anyone knows what these lights were, please let me know!!","distance":"501 Feet - 1

december 11, 2008. that night was the night of a full moon.\r\nafter driving west through blythe, california on interstate 10, my wife and i started seeing bright orbs in the sky. the orbs were not to far in the sky and would come on one below the other, like a traffic light sequence.\r\nthis continued on the north side of the freeway and a couple of times on the south, so we were observing the sky very intently trying to figure out what these were.\r\nas i looked toward the south, a string of bright white lights appeared. my wife and i booth saw them, but in the bright moon light, i could make out the dark shape of a disk. the lights were on the edge and rotating in a clockwise direction. the lights came on and went off in the time it takes to say, now you see me, now you don't. it looked as if it was lighting up an area to land.\r\nthe craft was approximately 500 feet in the sky, at a 30 degree angle from the ground, appeared and disappeared. it was between 9:00 and 9:30pm, pt.\r\nit was a life changing event to realize that something like that exists.\r\nthe hair on my arms stood up and my eyes watered. we continued to look as we continued on but nothing else appeared.\r\n\r\ni look around every time we travel through that area. the area is northwest of the yuma proving grounds, so it may be a craft being tested from the base in yuma.....Or maybe not.","distance":"501 Feet -

thin high level clouds.\r\n\r\ni was sitting on my deck in the back yard of our home this evening with my 6 year old daughter, rebekah.  i had finished mowing our yard and was enjoying the unusually warm evening (71 degrees).  the sun had already set and it was getting dark.  i would estimate the time to be approximately 6:00 pm.  as i was looking up into the sky and noticed what i thought was a bright star.  i told my daughter ���look, there���s the first star tonight���.  i told her this as she likes to make a wish on the first star of the evening.  however, as i was looking at the ���star���, i noticed something odd; it began to move in an ���s��� shaped flight path within a very short distance ��� less than one mile (estimated).  its movement was to the north and the speed of it was much faster than a standard airplane.  it quickly faded out of sight.  i waited a few minutes to see if it would reappear, but it did not.  i then informed my daughter to go get her mother (my wife) who was inside the house at the time of the sighting.\r\n\r\nthis first ufo sighting lasted for less than 15 seconds.  i would describe it as a bright, star-like object at high altitude.  it was not an aircraft as it did not display navigation or strobe lights.  i am well versed with commercial and military aircraft as i had spent 8 years in the u.S. air force and previously held a private pilot���s license.  this was not an ordinary aircraft, nor did it have a trail as would a falling star.  its luminescence was consistent until it faded from sight.  \r\n\r\nregarding my feeling/emotions following the first sighting, i felt confused as i had not seen anything like this before, i.E., unidentified flying object.  i attempted to sort out all possibilities of what it was, such as a commercial/military aircraft, satellite, falling star, or some other natural phenomena.  i could not explain it.\r\n\r\nsecond sighting:  at approximately 6:05 pm, my wife, fiona, had come outside with my daughter.  i calmly told her of the incident.  fiona did not know what to make of my sighting, but chose to stay outside with me.  at or about 6:15 pm, the bright, star-like light again appeared out of nowhere.  it appeared in the sky directly above our home and was much brighter this time, possibly due to the fact that it was at a lower altitude.  i pointed it out to my wife and she also witnessed it.  \r\n\r\nthis second ufo sighting lasted for about 30 seconds.  i would describe the object as a very bright white light, much brighter than the first sighting and seemed to slightly pulsate.  the object appeared to be descending, but then it quickly ascended and began to move in an arced flight path.  the light was moving at a very fast speed as it moved to the nne, traveling for approximately 2 miles.  the light faded as it ascended into the sky and it disappeared from sight.  we all waited to see if it would return again, but after several minutes, we decided to go inside.  this was the last time that i saw the object. \r\n\r\nregarding my feeling/emotions following the second sighting, i felt very bewildered.  i conferred with my wife attempting to sort out all possibilities of what it was.  neither of us could determine what it could possibly be.  it should be noted that we did notice commercial aircraft far to the north or our home as they were heading into kansas city international airport (mci).  however, these were traveling low along the northern horizon from east to west.","distance":"Over One

always look at the sky above the airport to see the planes landing and taking off.  i noticed something very out of place in the sky to the left of the airport/runways.  it was hazy black and pulsing.  or it seemed like it was pulsing.  it was zig zagging and moving up and down.  when it moved it was going so fast it gave the appearance of a trail behind it that was lighter in color then the object and transparent.  it's movements were very smooth and made it look alive.  i pulled onto the side of the freeway and grabbed my phone to take a picture.  as soon as i put my hand on the phone the object seemed to disappear.  i was shaking because i knew that what i saw was a ufo.  i took two photos of the same area that i saw the ufo floating in and included some landmarks to show my position.  the sky was clear and sunny.  there was no contrails or clouds when i snapped the shot.  i have two photos of a strange vapor trail that shoots right over the runways of the airport and it makes a sharp turn.  i did not see this with the naked eye or i would of taken many more pictures.  it shows that something was there and it moved very very fast.  if you use the paintbrush program on your computer and click on the \"airbrush\" then make the pen larger and drag it over the page that is the best way i can explain what i saw.
