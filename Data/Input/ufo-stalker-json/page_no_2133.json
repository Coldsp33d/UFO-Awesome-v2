husband to get a few candies left over from the halloween.  while i eat them (3) i was sitting in the bed watching outside.  i have 2 boys 9yrs and 2.5 yrs, and they both have been sick for about a week with extremely high tempreture. so i have been sleeping with both of them in our guest bedroom.  while i ate i was starring outside at the sky which was relatively clear.  i saw aircrafts flying around with their blinking/non-blinking lights as usual.  since the sky was clear i continued starring at the sky and realized that one light which i thought was and aircraft light flying in the direction east to west hasn't moved for about 10min.  so thought why has that aircraft not moved at all, and payed a little more attention to it. it had gotten a little closer by then and i starred at it and saw it giving different lights (blue, red, green and yellow) now i felt even more curious.  continued to look at it.  my excitment grew deeper and i call my husband who was on his laptop in our master bedroom.  i call him over and asked to pay attention to this object, and after a few min. we realized this was an unusual object in the sky. like any other person, we both told 'what if its a ufo.'  but my husband doesn't really believe in ufo so we watched for some more time and the movement of the object was a little more clearer. now my husband was also curious, i asked him to get a camera (we don't have any high-tech one although).  but anyways, we got what we have and tried to zoom in and out excitment got even deeper becuase we could catch something in that tiny camera.  we kept talking to each other with excitment-may be its a ufo or may not.  but then what it this object.  i could record only about 20- 25 min.  2 reason- the capacity of my camera as well as my hands starting hurting.  it was difficult to hold the camera still for long.  i tried my best. but all the time i kept asking myself what is this object. it moved a little to the north and then rose up-straight in the sky and after about a 1 hr started drifting to the south.  i watched it for a 3 hrs, until it moved out of the range of my window.\r\ni have recorded what i could see.  i would like to show this recording to someone who understand objects in the sky.  i would not call it a ufo unless endorsed by an expert.\r\nplease contact me for more evidence of what i have seen.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then

regularly on a path over my house (at high altitude).  when i looked up a small relatively bright object caught my attention.  it was motionless, quite small and almost glowed a white light with just a hint of red on one edge.  i walked back in my house, got some binoculars and tried to focus on it.  i was unable to get focused very well and i did not have a stable platform to keep it in a stable view. at this time i thought it was probably some kind of weather balloon or some other kind of balloon that had floated to a high altitude.  i stopped trying to see it with the binoculars, and put my glasses back on and looked at it again.  i was about to loose interest, still thinking it was some \"normal\" event when it suddenly began to move in a northerly direction.  it moved for a second or two at a moderate pace and then quickly picked up speed and rapidly sped away at a very fast speed.  it didn't appear to rise, it just moved at a very high rate of speed out of my field of view. it traveled in a very deliberate path and did not seem to float or drift.  it traveled much too fast to be anything like an airplane or balloon.  the altitude appeared to be relatively high, as in a few thousand feet, and the size appeared to be small.  from my perspective the size was about the same as a bright planet would look, but this object was being controlled by some means. i do no know how

west bank of the san gabriel river (near whittier, ca). we started from peck road and proceeded north (toward the san gabriel mountains). when we got to about a quarter mile passed the pomona, (60) freeway, we turned back.\r\n\r\norlando went ahead of me, as he wanted to walk faster. after several minutes i glanced across the river to observe a scene that included the shadows of trees and various lights behind them; including street lights on the other bank in the distance about a mile away. as most street lights do nowadays they appeared almost orange.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, i saw what at first appeared to be one of those lights start moving toward the north (the opposite direction) in a more horizontal manner, on the other bank in the distance. it would have had to be very low to the ground for me to have to look twice to see if one of those lights was somehow moving, as if i were seeing things���i was.\r\n\r\nthis light appeared to be orange and very bright. as it moved it must have been ascending. i started running down the bike path toward orlando (because i wanted him, or anybody else to see this with me) who was by this time very far in front of me. it seems like i ran a long time. as i got closer and closer to him, i yelled several times for him to stop. when he did i ran up to him pointing to the object that was by this time floating high in the sky, and said: ���orlando what���s that? what���s that? is it a helicopter? jesus! is that a helicopter?��� he replied ���no it���s not���. we both observed it for a moment; it appeared to be heading somewhat in our direction. he said ���what is it?��� i said i don���t know. it was mesmerizing. i found myself taking steps forward to get a good look.\r\n\r\nby this time the object seemed bigger and it had no particular shape. it could not have been as small as when i first saw it. it was bright and moved through the air slowly and appeared to change from orange to white and back; it appeared hot. it looked like a hot blob in a lava lamp. as we observed it was definitely getting closer. i could actually see flames; it was definitely on fire. i began to get frightened because it looked like it was turning toward us.\r\n\r\nbut suddenly, it appeared to stop about a half mile away, across the river near a power tower. it made no sound, it just burned. it was enormous. then it burned out. the fire ended. it was as if sections of it were burning off one by one. as it burned it was dropping what appeared to be the burnt remnants, but also it was silvery, as though it were liquid like molten metal.\r\n\r\nas it burned away i tried to look in the area in the low sky where it had just been, thinking i���d see what caused the flames or if i could see anything at all. but i didn���t see anything else. also, there were no clouds were the object burned away, like there would have been if fireworks had exploded there. but no, it simply vanished.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

where we did chores (fed animals) which is about 100 to 150 yds from my parents. we were on the road almost to our driveway about 10 yds when my dad said he had to check on cows. so he left and then about 1min to 2 min later i saw a neon orange oval craft rise from what appeared to be the gully which is on top of a hill across from my parents approx 200 yds away. it rose from gully due south n then came north in about 3 seconds to hovering approx 3 to 4 ft above road. it took up virtually whole road. i would estimate 20 to 25 ft wide and 10 ft tall. it had an orange gaseous aura that enveloped over an apparent solid structure. thru center of craft it had glasslike round window portholes like that of a cruiseship  that couldn't c thru. it. hovered without noise for 3 to 4 min n then shot off thru two trees in a southwesterly direction n vanished several seconds later. i was about 15 ft from craft. i ran in as fast as i could to tell my parents after it was gone. several days later i was poked in the side by something that felt like a long finger next to bed by the window.. my room was dark n i could not c what it was bc had sleeping bag zipped to top bc scared at nite after sighting. i had dream i tried to yell for parents but couldn't get words out n felt paralyzed n remember dream about running from giant ufo and jumping into window with several other teenagers.

work. i walked outside to take a smoke break and looked into the sky and saw a blinking star of various colors in sky. first, i thought it was probably a plane or a helicopter or something, but then it moved swiftly to the left, then to the right, then up. by this point, i thought i was just seeing things because i had been in front of the computer screen for much to long so i looked at the other stars and planes in the sky to see if it was just my vision, but none of the stars were as brilliant or changing colors and blinking like this star. \r\n\r\nso i went back in the house to grab my phone to call my sister to tell her what i had seen and then proceeded to go back outside to see if it was sttill there. sure enough, it was, but it remained still for a long time. i turned around trying to take my mind off of it and saw another bright star, more brilliant than the star that i had been examining for the past few minutes, and it too blinked several colors. i started screaming on the phone telling my sister that i had saw another when suddenly the more brilliant star moved swiftly to the left, then hovered for moments, and moved up. \r\n\r\nit was the wierdest thing, but i would have been content with never sharing that story with anyone other than my sister, it wasn't too spectacular, and i figured i was maybe just having an overactive imagination. then i looked back at the first star again and saw a bright light coming towards my direction through the trees in my neighbor's backyard. it had to be about 300 or so feet in the air, but it was a massive light and there were red lights and green lights on it as well. as it drew closer, i saw its silhouette in the night sky, and it looked to be a giant disk. it flew slowly and glided through the air. it made absolutely no sound, which was wierd considering that it had now come very close to where i was--it had to be about 100 feet or so away from me. my knees got weak and i became speechless on the phone with my sister who was trying to get me to talk about what was happening. it was massive, and the shear size of it scared the [cms/tg/pd] out of me. suddenly my sister stopped talking on the phone, so i said hello and all i could hear was feedback of myself talking. \r\n\r\ni kept talking, saying hello, to try to get my sister to answer. but nothing, all i could hear was my own voice coming back to me. i ran into the house, looking for some type of camera and grabbed my father's digital point and shoot hoping that i could catch it on video somehow. however, when i looked into the sky, it seemed to have shot off into the distance because now it was much closer to the brighter of the two blinking stars in the sky. it flew into that star and never came out. \r\n\r\ni know what i saw, it was no helicopter, especially considering that for whatever reason, there had been a sequence of police helicopters with spotlights surveying the area for the duration of the night at low altitudes. they were very loud and small when compared to the silent and large disk i had seen. \r\n\r\ni had always been a skeptic before, but i cant refute what i had just seen. it was the most amazing and eery of things. part of me would like to see it again so that i can tape it, but the other part of me would rather be completely oblivious to it all. \r\n\r\ni knew it was crazy, so i wanted to see if there was anyone else online that had possibly seen what i had. i googled, \"ufo sightings in maryland november 6, 2009\" and of course nothing came up, but this site was the first on the list. so, i've decided to post this story hoping that maybe there was someone else in the area that may have seen it, or have photos, or something to give me maybe a piece of my sanity back. \r\n\r\ni do want to set a disclaimer that your systems wouldnt let me set midnight as the time i saw it, so i set it as 1am. however, the sighting happened around 12:08 am.","distance":"21-100

had time to react to the fact that it would hit the ground it stopped dead. it travelled at a huge rate of speed and glowed so bright. i would have first thought it was a meteor had i had time to think anything at all before it stopped ubruptly, a real sudden halt without slowing at all. the object continued to glow for severel more minutes before it got extremely bright and changed colour and then broke up into three red/orange glowing balls. the balls of light seemed to travel in different directions. from my veiw point at the docks, one travelled towards colchester or london direction, one travelled down the river orwell towards ipswich and the third travelled over the docks and i presume along the coast, i lost sight of it in the light polution from the port.

neighborhood, this was an unusual flight path so i got up and went outside on my deck to check it out.  it was a medium size airplane heading towards santa barbara airport (ne to w/sw)  \r\n\r\ni then turned around to look east and saw several small planes with typical blinking lights, and then saw one with two bright red lights blinking simultaneously coming in a straight line on a path that would fly over my house. the time was approx. 11:27pm.  \r\n\r\ni went inside for 5 seconds and picked up my field glasses and returned to the deck, getting the aircraft into my field of vision.  i followed it as it went over my house, thinking that this configuration of simultaneous double red blinking lights was atypical for standard planes at night.  \r\n\r\nit was not very high in the sky going over my house and it appeared to be of an airplane silhouette in the front half.  i couldn't make out any silhouette of the tail section. as it traveled west, i looked at the back of the craft. it had three big unblinking white lights, larger than any i have ever seen on an aircraft.  the lights gave the impression that the back of the craft was  flat (which may be why i couldn't pick it out in silhouette overhead) and overall shape of the craft might be triangular. the body was dark and blended in with the background of the night sky. \r\n\r\ni remember listening for sound. it was running silent. it was not flying particularly fast and it held a straight course.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the craft as it went past the hill behind my house about 11:30pm.  my feeling was this was an atypical aircraft of unusual design and mechanics.  i have never seen anything like it before.  i tried to research this as a prototype plane or something currently flying in our skies, but have come up empty.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I had been planning to have a bonfire in a field behind a barn behind our rural house, for my three kids. last night was a good night to do it: little or no wind, a bright moon to the east, and relatively dry conditions. after a late dinner ended around 7:20 pm, i got my three kids, aged 7, 4 and 2, all bundled up (temp was around 37 degrees), and drove my jeep out to the spot. i had the tailgate lifted up and a quilt set for them to watch me start our bonfire, a thirty-foot long accumulation of branches and leaves from the year. \r\n\r\ni routinely tell my son of my ufo and mib research, and at his urging, occasionally tell him ufo stories at bedtime. btw: other than an unusual red flare some years ago and numerous meteors (and one demonstrable hoax this past 4th of july), i have never seen a ufo before, and have never reported one. \r\n\r\nas the kids piled out of the jeep, unwilling to wait in its relative warmth before the fire got going, i happened to say to my son, \"wouldn't it be great if tonight was the night we finally saw a ufo?\" we inspected the sky to the south and southwest, where the open fields provided an unobstructed view. jupiter was clearly visible, and with the moon to the east and barely over the barn, it did little to interfere with the stars to the south. my son pointed out a series of flashing lights high in the sky heading west-southwest, and asked if that was a ufo. i assured him it was a normal commercial plane. \r\n\r\nbut then, directly due south, we both spotted a strong stationary light, whitish-orange in color, at least twice the brilliance or more of jupiter and twice as big, seemingly hanging above a distant treeline a mile or so away. it had no accompanying flashing lights, and i would have taken it for the spotlight of a helicopter if it had been paired with navigation lights. measuring with my arm extended, it was exactly one finger width above the treeline, but other than the brightness and its color (whitish-orange, almost like a sodium-vapor street light), there was no way to discern a shape nor its distance. it could have been right above the trees, or it could have been a dozen miles away.\r\n\r\nwe both watched it for a minute or more, and realized it was not moving at all, neither left-right nor up and down. i had to attend to my other two children, and instructed my son to keep watching it. i marked the spot where we were watching (near two large tree stumps), and moved east to light the bonfire. my son reported a few moments later that it was still there, and that he thought it may have moved from right to left a small amount (heading east), but was still just as bright. \r\n\r\ni took about a minute or two to lite the fire and then turned to look where he had indicated, but the light had vanished. he turned to look south again and was amazed. he'd just turned for a few seconds to watch me, and then looked back and the light was gone. we watched the area and waited for a few more minutes, but there was no additional sighting of the light. the time from when we first noticed the light to when my son lost sight of it may have been as long as five minutes or as short as three minutes. i am certain it was not a commercial aircraft (too low on the horizon), nor was it a planet or star. and the lack of any navigation or blinking lights indicated it was not likely a helicopter. there was no sound. time of sighting was between 7:45 pm and 8:00 pm.\r\n\r\nwe were a little disappointed that it had left so soon, but were also a little excited that it was a possible unexplained event. when my wife joined us in the field with marshmallows a few minutes later, my son enthusiastically explained the event to her, but in a detailed and unhurried manner. the arrival of the marshmallows and the quick buildup of the bonfire soon diverted our attention.\r\n\r\nnote: we live less than a mile from a few industrial strip-mall type buildings, but none use sodium vapor lamps, and they all lie to the southwest and further west of that. there are no industrial areas to our south, nor any streetlights of any kind, for well over ten miles. nor are there any north-south roads that could account for the lights as being reflected headlights as vehicles travel uphill, and the roads around here are relatively flat for long stretches anyway.\r\n\r\nnote also, i've previously explained to my son the methods for determining the size and direction of any ufo he was ever lucky enough to spot, using his fingers and hands as measuring devices with his arm fully extended, to note the exact spot where he was standing and any identifiable trees or buildings to mark what direction the sighting occurred. his calm and attentive watching of the light made me happy he'd learned this well.\r\n\r\ni understand that distant, undefinable lights don't make for a very interesting sighting, but i'm also aware that even a simple sighting such as this can help corroborate an event in a nearby location, such as albion, indiana (a few miles to our southwest), or fort wayne (around 30 miles to the south). another sighting could allow this one to be used to triangulate more accurately where such an event may have occurred. \r\n\r\nkeep watching the skies!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
