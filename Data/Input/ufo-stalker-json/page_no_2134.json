visit my ailing grandfather, in nova scotia, canada.  he had been suffering from serious dementia, so it prevented us ever seeing him this particular weekend.  in order to make the best of our time, we decided to do some snowboarding, hiking, and a bit sightseeing.  on our way home from the membertou reservation in sydney late one night, rather, early in the morning, maybe 2am,  we were traveling on the transcanada highway just outside of ross ferry and as my girlfriend was driving i per-chanced to notice a massive triangular formation of what looked like three stars all moving in unison across the entire expanse of sky.  from one side of the horizon to the other.  i can't tell you from what direction it came or where it traveled to since the area was a little unfamiliar to me.  i originally thought that this was some kind of team, in formation, perhaps a team of satellites flying in formation on some kind of joint space mission, as i've seen satellites before but these were significantly brighter than satellites. i had also never heard of a fleet of satellites flying together like this and i try and pay attention to science news.  my second thought was that this was some sort of massive solid object, but couldn't confirm this as it was difficult to see whether stars could be seen passing behind the formation in the moving car. unfortunately my girlfriend can't corroborate my sighting, as she never did see the formation, but can corroborate the event taking place.  i got her eventually pull the car over for her to witness this amazing sight but by that time, whatever it was that i had seen had already disappeared over the horizon.  \r\nthen today, as i checked the updates from your newsletter and watched the footage of the triangular ufo seen in michigan i was dumbfounded because this object, or rather objects (?)  was (were) identical to the one that i had seen!  it seemed to be the same size in reference to passing stars and in the identical type of configuration with one star seeming to slightly off making it more of an isosceles triangle rather than an equilateral triangle.  it was so comforting to to know that this event was actually documented by someone, and in video.  brilliant video i may add!\r\nthis was not the first time i had witnessed strange sky anomalies but rather one of many that i have been lucky enough to have witnessed  over the course of my life. my first also taking place in cape breton when i was twelve with my father and sister on a sunset fishing trip.  my most recent sighting, however has been my most impressive, in newfoundland, canada, (another canadian island...Interesting...) this past summer in gros morne national park, which my girlfriend was also witness too. there was similar sighting mentioned by a listener who wrote in to you, describing it's exit as being like the 'star trek warp drive'. but that's another story however.  love the program, keep up the good work.  can't wait for the next episode.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

near my residence moving in and out of the tree coverage. sighting lasted about a minute. video was taken of this event. one light was due west about 300 yards from my property.\r\n\r\n10-29-2009\r\n\r\nnoticed strange lights in the sky, east horizon. the first light traveled in from the sky at about a 45 degree angle and stopped suddenly. about a minute later a second light streaked in from the south and also stopped suddenly. at about this time i started taping the event. about 2 to 3 minutes later the third light came in from the north and streaked in is 3 separate busts of speed. once all three lights were in a triangle formation they seemed to instantly inch towards the middle of the formation as if it \"docked\". the formation of lights then slowly started to drift down towards the ground. the formation of lights then seemed to quickly shift a few degrees instantly. a second witness my wife witnessed this and quickly went back into the house. at this point i could hear a helicopter approaching from the south. the helicopter seemed to approach the formation of lights and or between me and the lights. the helicopter also flew directly over my house and circled the house after i pointed the camcorder at it with its ir light on about three times. the objects eventually went up slowly and started to separate and disappeared over a long period of time.\r\n\r\nthe helicopter returned the next night but flew in one direction.\r\n\r\n11-3-2009\r\n\r\nabout 1:25sm in the morning we heard noses in the back yard. sun in law and myself went to the backyard. we could hear noises and braches braking. my sun in law pointed his light in the shrubs and we saw what looked like a pal white skin arm grasping a branch. it seemed to duck the light and hide but we should still see the hand and part of the arm. we froze and went into a sort of shock and returned to the house quickly returned to the house and did not go back outside. the hand seemed to have a total of 4 digits, 3 fingers and one thumb the center finger was longer the other two fingers. the skin was pale gray.

outside into my backyard to get some fresh air and stretch; it was very warm outside still being a really hot summer here in the sacramento valley. now, i live right next to mather airport, i used to be a pilot, i've worked at different airports around the area, and i've lived in this area all of my 32 years on this earth, including when mather airport was mather afb. i know airplanes and i know helicopters and i've flown both. i looked up at the stars as i often do if i can't sleep early in the morning when the stars are shining their brightest. a moving light caught my eye in the south-eastern sky. my first initial thought was, an airplane, at first glance. i live right, right next to the airport, and aircraft fly in and out constantly. but this craft was especially bright, blinking several different colors very rapidly, with kind of a disk shape with a glowing-ish ball underneath...And then it stopped moving. at this point the craft appeared to be maybe 1 or more miles away; it was 4am and no moon, lights or other objects to reference. the creepiest thing for me to admit (as chills consume me now), is when i actually looked directly at the craft, it stopped. i had the strongest feeling i was being watched during the entire encounter. the ufo never made a single sound and there were no passing aircraft for the whole sighting which lasted roughly 25-30 minutes. at first i thought i was seeing things, maybe because i was so groggy and sleepy, but the craft began to move around the south-eastern sky with rapid movements up, down, side to side, forwards, backwards, but never leaving this area of the sky. i had my cell-phone in my pocket so i called my wife outside to confirm i wasn't hallucinating. she confirmed that i wasn't nuts. she grabbed me the video camera and i recorded this object for rougly 25minutes. i was overwhelmed, shocked, mystfied... and scared mostly. scared because my wife and i had an encounter of the 3rd kind exactly ten years earlier, in a little 400sq ft cottage (our first house), exactly five miles away, also way out in the country. we don't talk about it to this day. my wife gets very upset if i even bring it up. to this day i'm not allowed to talk about it with her. it's too long of an event to post.\r\n  now, at this time i haven't released the video to anyone and i've only shown family and close family friends. i had to use two tapes to record it, because of course with my luck the first tape ran out after about 10 min. the second tape has some \"night shot\" footage and some flashlight-light shining on the trees that gives perspective on the depth of feild in relation to the object; but the end of the first tape has the most dramatic shots of the object moving all over the sky in a fast dance of movements, almost as if it heard me egging it on to \"move\" more for video. i was having a difficult time keeping the object in frame, focused, or just not bouncing around by my body movements, so i held the camera perfectly still and thats when it's movements went bizerk, so you can really see it's radical direction changing. the object never really \"flew\" away, or left, but seemed to (please don't think i'm crazy) move in front of a star and i guess become invisible or something...I don't know. i do know that everyone i show the video to is shocked and dumbfounded by what they see. i would like to share this video, but not over the internet. i'm already nervous not knowing what could happen if i send this information. i'm not nuts, crazy, loony, whacko or paranoid, just wigged out by these events maybe even traumatized. \r\n   so now what....Whats next.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

south of the store.  i have no idea what type of distance away it would have been but it was clearly not typical of an air plane as it was stationary - i felt as if it knew i noticed it.  i of course pointed it out to my husband and we both just looked in awe of this object trying to make sense of it.  we watched this object that was stationary for about 4-5 minutes and then all the sudden it went directly up into the sky in a matter of seconds until it was gone.  \r\n\r\ni was in complete shock. i went home directly after - we live about a 4 minute drive from the store and of course went outside immediately to look at the sky more.  all of the sudden there were military planes cris-crossing over our home moving very fast doing formation patterns for about an hour.  the jets flew back and forth in pairs.  there were two sets of pairs.  these jets made no noise which for jets moving as fast as these were rather interesting considering jets generally make quite a large amount of

it.\r\n\r\nnovember 2, 2009 at 7:45 p.M.  \r\n\r\ni was outside with my dogs, standing on the porch steps facing south, watching a commercial jet at approximately 70 degrees agl, which was heading east to west.  i retrieved my binoculars from the house and when i turned around, the commercial jet now had on it's extremely bright landing light.  i thought that was rather strange, as there is no large airport near here.  the closest larger airport is about 60 miles w/sw, in abilene.\r\n\r\ni watched the jet for about 1 minute, when suddenly the landing light was turned off and the jet continued west. as i wondered why a commercial jet would have it's landing light on then shut it off in flight, i noticed a bright, large, orange golden light to my south/southwest at approximately 15 degrees agl. this light did not waver, did not blink or strobe.  it remained constant.  the light appeared to be more than twice the size of jupiter and at first i thought it might be the international space station but something wasn't quite right and and the object moved slower than the iss.  whatever this was, it was in our atmosphere and appeared to be between 1 and 2 miles from my location.  \r\n\r\ni began watching through my binoculars and i decided to see if there would be a reaction if i said something. i spoke out loud and said, \"here i am, come closer.\"  the object stopped abruptly.  hovered for a few seconds and then in an instant, it continued on at the same speed as before.  \r\n\r\nwhen i first noticed the light, it appeared to be heading to the northeast, stopped when i spoke and then took a more easterly direction.  the object held a steady course and speed to the east.  i could not see any wings, tail, or other structured features, just a disc, or oval shaped light.\r\n\r\nthe object itself, was a constant golden orange light, like an ember when fanned.  there were no other lights.  at one point the object appeared to look like a cross laying horizontal, with the cross member towards the front, much like an airplane.  but as i watched through the binoculars, the object appeared to take on a disc shape, before it passed from my field of sight and behind the trees to my southeast.  \r\n\r\ni tried several times to take photos with my digital camera but to no avail.\r\n\r\ni must note that i heard the distinct sound of the jet as it passed overhead but i heard no sound from this other object and am not aware of any conventional aircraft that glow an orange golden color.  my feelings during and after the sighting was disappointment, in that i had no photo to back up the sighting.\r\n\r\nthe sighting lasted for slightly under 5 minutes.  i came in and called a friend that lives 6 miles to my east.  i told her to go look outside and she would be able to see the object but she wouldn't do it. she just laughed and said it's probably already gone.  in other words, she does not believe things like this exist and was not willing to look.\r\n\r\nit was not the iss or the htv satellite.  i checked the human space flight tracking website to make sure.\r\n\r\ni have included a depiction of what i saw.\r\n\r\ni would like to add that the same morning, at 5:54 a.M., an unknown object passed over my residence, upset one of my dogs, caused my cell phone to activate, which in turn affected my clock radio (radio was turned off).  the radio produced a short burst of what sounded mike morse code.  i then heard a low rumbling, humming sound, like a huge electric generator slowly passing over my home.  at one point i felt a pressure in my chest and felt \"pinned\" to the bed.  as the sound faded into the distance, i was released and don't remember anything else until i woke up a while later.  i asked my spouse if he remembered anything.  he said he did remember the cell phone/radio incident but not the sound passing over the house.\r\nthank you for your time.","distance":"Over One

little cloudy, but the moon was very bright, so visibility was good in terms of lighting. i was sitting, looking at the sky, when something moving caught my eye from the north. i didn't know what it was at first. i could tell it wasn't a plane, as i see many every night and am very familiar with their appearance at various altitudes at night. it was coming from the north going south. i thought maybe it was some kind of balloon or kite, but as it got closer, almost directly above me, i could see it was neither of these things. although details of its surface were difficult to make out, the shape was very clear. it was a light color, maybe grayish, and in a cylindrical shape. it was difficult to tell exactly how high up it was, but it was lower than most of the clouds in the sky, and didn't seem to be that far away. this makes the size difficult to judge, but it must have been at least 100 ft. it was a very quiet night and it was clear this thing was not making a sound. the objects flight position is difficult to explain. the cylinder was parallel to the ground, but it was moving at about a 45 degree angle from its flight path. at some point while watching i had stood up, and as it passed over it looked like it was emitting several points of light along its length. these lights were whitish, but were not very bright at all. after it moved a little south of me it entered into some lower clouds, and i was unable to see it again. i sat back down, completely shocked and trying to figure out what i had just see. i looked back up hoping to see further evidence of what had just happened. after about a minute or so my eye caught a similar movement coming from the same direction, but a little more east of me. when i saw the second one coming i felt shocked. after the first disappeared i was trying to convince myself it had been some sort of floating debris, my imagination, or a prank as i had seen the story about the balloon boy a couple weeks ago. but when the second appeared i was immediately convinced that non of these were true. at first it appeared very similar to the first. it moved silently and steadily southward. after about ten seconds or so of observation i saw it was emitting lights just as the first one did, however, at this point the object seemed to change its shape. it seemed to curl up into a spiral like circle, but it s speed or path did not change. as it proceeded south this one too entered into some low clouds and i didn't see it again.   \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

dennis and allen, traveling south bound on canton center road.\r\n   while driving home i noticed several cars parked along the side of the road. what caught my attention was a black man with an afro stairing up into the sky. i immediatley looked up and noticed a strange object. as we were driving tourds this slow craft moving from east to west, where we were no further then a mile away and being a quarter mile high, i told everyone to look up. as im explaining what im looking at, allen goes from sarcasm to shock. dennis instantly starts to stutter and my mom replies (omg).\r\n   after driving a mile up, we approach our street and turn right into the sub. at this time the craft is right in front of us moving in the same direction. as our street curves to the left, the craft continous straight over what was then, miles of corn fields. as we pull into our driveway, the craft being 3/4 mile out, we noticed that the entire ufo had turned into a shade of orange.\r\n   scared out of our minds, we quickly close the garage door,went inside and closed the blinds. my mom picked up the phone to call our dad at work. imposible to get a hold of our father being that he worked on the assembly line at gm, we got a hold of our aunt. my mother told her we're coming over and will explain everything when we get there. \r\n   after being at the house for twenty min, we started our drive. along the way the ufo was never insite. 15 min away in westland where our aunt lives we pull into the apartments and park. after getting out of the vehical, my mother and allen reach the door first. as dennis and i are dragging our feet along, i kid you not. the most incredible thing happens.\r\n   as we were looking back in the direction we came from. we saw a white ball of light about a 1/4 size of the moon shooting straight up into the sky. i know to this time 2009 that there is nothing on earth that can leave our atmosphere and vanish in a second like this object had done.\r\n
