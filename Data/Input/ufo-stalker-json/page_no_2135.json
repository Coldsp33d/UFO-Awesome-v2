outside. we lived on the ne corner of lander and st. lawrence streets. i was doing something in the yard, maybe just finishing washing the car or a similar activity. some movement overhead caught my eye. when i looked up i saw what i believed at the time was a black or dark hang- glider directly overhead. it had a redish circular spot at each corner on the underside. the red spots were not overly bright, but visible. if it was a hang-glider, it would have been about 200 to 300 feet directly above me as i was looking up between two trees that were separated by about 20 feet.\r\nit was completely silent and turned 180 degrees in a quick, flat, fashion. after the turn, my view was blocked by the trees. i quickly rushed out to the street to see its continued path, but it was gone. \r\n\r\nat the time, i wondered what idiot would be flying a dark hang-glider directly above the city and at such a low altitude, and where would they land. because of the shape and the quietness, my mind just assumed it was a hang-glider. the incident seemed odd and out of place at the time, so i have always remembered it very clearly. however i didn't give it a whole lot of additional thought until recently when i saw a program about triangular ufos in nevada, then it clicked. it was not a hang-glider and could have been at any elevation if it were larger or smaller. probably larger.\r\n\r\ni don't know the date for sure, but i lived at that house from 1973 to 1978, i was between 13 and 18, and i know it was in a warmer time of year, perhaps may to september, and the

feet long.It at first came in the form of a star.As it has been for several months.Since around august i have been seeing these star like ufo's.Everyday i go outside they blink there lights only for me.And when i tell everyone else the lights stop.\r\n\r\njust 10 minutes ago i went outside and said \"blink your lights\" and sure enough the light was blinking and then started coming closer and closer to the house.So back to the story.\r\n\r\nso i was looking out the front window thinking it was my mom and sister returning home and that's when i noticed the blinking \"star\".This time i actually saw colors coming from the blinking hovering star i had never seen.There was red.I just continued to look at the \"star\" for a few minutes and then i went to the bathroom.When i went back to the window the bathroom was right over my sisters window which is the front of the house.\r\n\r\ni decided to take a closer look and go outside.So i put a coat on and headed out the door to take a look.When i looked i first saw the blinking light and then that's when i saw the whole body right there about 12-15 feet in the air floating above the front yard.It was cigar shaped and it sorta glowed either white or like a silvery,white,maetallic color.Towards the front the light was red and blinking.As soon as i saw that i immediatley ran in the house and locked the door.I called my mom and stayed on the phone with her till she came home.\r\n\r\nnow i had looked out the window again and this time it was gone and there was no sound no vibration it was just gone.I would expect noises from something so large but,there was nothing.\r\n\r\nthe object was about as thick or thicker than a full grown pine tree.\r\n\r\nwhen my mom arrived i showed her the lights and she insisted that they were plains but,they weren't.One they never moved the lights circled the house.They sat there blinking and sitting.Again there was no sound and there was no movement.I no it was a star either since it was red and blinked and slowly moved closer to the house.\r\n\r\ni continued to show my mom but she thinks i's a plain and it's not.It was so fustrating because it didn't move and it was so close to the house.There's no way it's a plain.\r\n\r\ni keep going outside right now and all i have to do is yell blink and the lights blink uncontrolably.It's crazy.Now the craft was in the yard yesterday but i went out there again when my mom arrived and i said blink and all of a sudden there was a red burst and what looked like a \"shooting star\" bursted out the sky.My mom again trying to play the scientist was like \"it's just a shooting star.\" i know it's not though because right when i said blink it came from right over the house right in front of us and just bursted out.\r\n\r\nit's so fustrating when she thinks it's these other things when clearly it's not.My sister even saw it and was trying to tell her.Anyways.\r\n\r\nthat's pretty much what happened.If i go outside and request for the lights it'll go off again.It's so strange.\r\n\r\nthere's other odd things that's been happening as well but this was the most

this.\r\n\r\nat times i would notice that the helicopter was getting closer & closer to my house, to the point that i would run & lock my back door in case there was a criminal heading towords my garden.\r\n\r\non this particular evening i turned all my downstairs lights out & went in to my living room window & opened the left window & amimed my camera phone\r\nat the helicopter/lights, i had it in my view & then zoomed in.\r\nwhat i saw on my phone was a shock, i became so afraid almost to scared to take the photo. i saw a dark disk & i think there was some sort of windows at the front near the middle the top was wavey with red & green lights in the dips in the form of red, green, red, green pattern.\r\ni tried to take the photo, my whole body was shaking, my hand trembled so much, well you can see from the photo.\r\n\r\ni've often wondered why photo's that people take of ufo are never clear,\r\nnow i knew why.\r\n\r\nas i took the photo there was a large obvious flash which i wasn't expecting. i panicked & felt that i had been seen.\r\n i ran to my hall turned the hall & toilet lights off so my house blended with the other houses with no lights on in my street.\r\ni turned my phone off & removed the battery.\r\ni got into bed with my partner whom was asleep.  the object \r\ncircle a couple of times then left.\r\n\r\ni was scared but i must have falled asleep quite quickly which suprised me.\r\n\r\nthe next day i looked at the photo & showed my partner, he does not believe\r\nin ufos & did not want to discuss this with me.\r\nhowever the memory faded & with time & i convinced my-self that i did not see what i thought i saw that night.\r\n \r\ni tryed to think of other possible explanations & put the photo down to the fact that i may have caught the street lights.\r\ni recently looked at this photo again & having learn't how to lighten pictures on doing so i realised that this was an object in the air &\r\nnot street lights.\r\n\r\nseveral month's later (september) i accidently photographed other possible ufos whilst i was taking photo's of hot air ballons & sunsets.\r\n\r\nthis year my whole family had a sighting of two dark grey discs that flew right over our heads.\r\nwe all drew drawings of what we saw. i was not scared this time & enjoyed \r\nwatching them for several minutes.\r\n\r\nkind regards

reflection of the light on the road, but i tried to duplicate that theory with oncoming headlights and it never looked anything like the photos. the orb appears too bright in the actual photos. you

i went to my sons school to pick him up from a band concert he was in and when i left my house, i saw 3 huge lights at the corner of my dead end street. as i approached the stop sign, i found myself underneath a huge triangle; it was about 100 feet above my head and had 3 lights in the rear, 3 lights in the center and as i drove under it further, it had 3 lights in the front. it was at least an 1/8 of a mile long and 100 feet across. as i passed the nearest intersection (route 93), i finally was past it. i think i was in shock as i continued to drive to my son's school; i picked him up and as i drove back to my house, i hoped it would still be there, however it was gone. when i got home i told my mom; i must have been convincing, because she beleived me. after that, every clear night i saw a star shaped object, sometimes 3. however i new in my heart these were no stars. this continued evey clear night i could see well into the sky; these things were preety stationary and moved from south to north over the course of the night. then i started seeing objects flying away from the stationary objects with blinking lights, almost like planes except they flew erractly and eventually flew below the tree lines. two nights ago i decided to look at them through my son's binoculars and confirmed what i knew in my heart, they're not stars, they're triangular shaped and blue at the top white in the middle and towards the bottom and red at the tail. the objects that leave them are blimp shaped and the entire object blinks lights in a spike pattern, the spikes being white and red. i'm actually looking at them while i'm typing this letter! i'm disabled, therefore poor and can not afford to buy a telescope and have no means of taking pictures. i assure you that this is no hoax and i'm asking you to bring your eqiptment on any clear night and you will crap your pants!!! what freaks me out is that niagara falls has a huge airbase and can't beleive no one is reporting this! it's also over the general vacinity of southern ontario, canada, these people must be seeing what i'm seeing; why isn't anyone saying anything????????\r\ni'm 51 years old and as sane as they come! i have a 150 iq and i'm as honest as abe lincoln! this goes on every clear night and the event lasts all night, therefore the bags under my eyes!! this is as good as it gets;
