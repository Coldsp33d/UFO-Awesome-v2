late summer 1976.I can't recall the exact date. what i do recall clearly is this object traveling from the north and passing nearly over my head toward the south,slightly west of me. it was transparent in that what i saw was an outline of this disc and the cloud cover behind it as it moved. it was overcast and the sun was setting casting an orange glow on the western edges of the clouds. this object as it passed blended itself into the cloud cover only revealing the outline to me. mid way through the sighting i attempted to get the attention of my friend at the bottom of the hill i was standing on. i yelled his name at least 3x before i ran down to the bottom of the hill to find him w/his grandmother. they seemed to be catatonic. unresponsive. i ran back to the top of the hill to watch this object travel over the top of the tree line and out of sight. i ran back down the hill to find my friend now responding to what i was saying. i ran east pleading with my friend to follow me,thinking if i get to the rail road tracks that ran north to south i could catch one more glimpse of this object and so could my friend,but i didn't see it again.                          to describe my feelings during this i would have to say,i ran a full gambit of emotions. from excitement to disappointment,frustration to dismay and fear. during the first moments i felt extremely curious as to what i was seeing. when i realized i was alone to deal with what i was seeing,i felt,well,alone. i have since had two other sightings of varying objects. luckily i did have a responsive friend during one of these sightings to confirm that what i was seeing was really there. unfortunately he has lost his grip on reality in these recent years so his credibility is less than one would hope to have for a witness.                                     i'm unsure if i should continue and describe the other sightings here or submit another separate sighting report.

friends boyfriend at the time and she was the front seat passenger.It was about 9:00 pm.We were driving to her aunts house to drink alcohol because we were all under age and we were teens,the only one who was not going to drink was the guy i was seeing.We were driving with the windows down and the radio at the time was playing led zepplin.I remember freezing in the back seat of the 2 door car and it was pretty windy out.We saw this huge object really close to the road on the opposite side of the road,maybe about 20-30 yards away. we had no idea what the thing was so the driver pulled over on that side so we were facing the traffic on the opposite side of the road,but there were no other cars.The lights were so bright,i have never encountered since a light that was so pure.We were like what the f is that.All of a sudden it started to rise, straight up with no sound of an engine or swirling blades of a helicopter,just nothing,no movement under the thing and there were tons of fallen leaves that should have blown around but didn't, there was no more wind and the sound felt like it was being sucked out of the car.We watched it and i was trying to yell to the driver that this was scary and he needed to get the f outta there,but i couldn't even hear my own voice.It just kept rising and i saw my friend hitting her boyfriend but could't hear what she was saying.All of the sudden we started moving ,the driver was pulling away and like a huge rush of all sound came whooshing back into the car and i heard my friend yell get the f outta here now!I was trying to shove his seat also to get his attention.We were all freaked out and realized that we thought we were only there for a couple of minutes and it was now 15 minutes later than when we pulled up.We were late getting to her aunts house but we should have been on time even pulling over for the couple of minutes we thought we had.I didn't even pay any attention to the guy i was with til after and he was real scared

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While working in the yard of a residence in lemoore, ca, at approximately 3:28 pm, i noticed a round, orange colored stationary object in the sky slightly to the north of my vantage point.  presuming it to be either a mylar balloon or other such object, i at first gave little thought as to the nature of the object.  after looking away and then back at the object, i noticed that it appeared to be stationary in position, not drifting as a wayward balloon or other such object would act.\r\n\r\nat this point i was intrigued and started to observe the object intently, wondering as to just what it could be to hold a stationary position, yet be so clearly visible in the sky.  my initial conclusion ��� after discounting the possibility that it was a commercial airliner operated by southwest airlines (who���s planes are painted orange and are clearly visible as such) was that it could possibly be a weather sonde balloon or a commercial dirigible, such as an airship of the goodyear fleet.\r\n\r\nthis possibility did not, however, explain the stationary aspect of the object, and quite intrigued,  i retrieved a pair of 10 x 50 mm binoculars from within the home that i was working at and returned to the yard where i was able to relocate the object.  using the binoculars i was unable to determine the size/shape/distance of the object, due to handshake and my inability to determine the focal distance to the object.\r\n\r\nlying on my back and propping up the binoculars with my arm resting on the ground, i attempted to focus on the still stationary object.  through the perspective gained through the binoculars, it appeared as if the object was round in shape and possibly convex on the portion visible from my perspective.  it is also possible that the object was segmented (as if to observe an orange from a polar view, bereft of its peel.)\r\n\r\nas i starred at the object, grasping for a logical explanation of just what it could be, the object ��� within a few seconds ��� became silver in color, and began to travel towards the west.  at this time the object began to accelerate at what seemed to be an ever increasing rate.  i tracked the object towards the west for about 35 degrees of arc when the object abruptly changed direction towards the northwest for a fraction of a second and then immediately jogged back upon its path and headed southwest, making what appeared to be a zee pattern.  i then lost visual track of the object as it traveled out of my vantage that was precluded by the trees on the western edge of the property.\r\n\r\ni would estimate the total duration of this sighting to be approximately two minutes and am unable to fashion a logical explanation for the size/shape/movements of the object based on my own knowledge of the currently in-service airships of the world governments.  i speculated that this could have been a capsule-type re-entry vehicle, however the rapid acceleration and changes of direction does not support this conclusion.  the possibility that the object was some kind of balloon is also highly unlikely due to the fact that this type of airship does not accelerate or change direction as this object did.\r\n\r\nmy personal speculation on the matter ��� based on my observations ��� is that the object was at least at large as the international space station and when first observed was at a lower altitude and thus was illuminated by the sun while located at the very fringes of the atmosphere (hence the orange color.)  the object then descended vertically into the atmosphere (turning silver in appearance) and proceeded westward towards the location of naval air station lemoore before twice changing direction (first north then south) and traveling southwestward towards vandenberg air force base.\r\n\r\nthis object made no detectable noise and left no visible contrail so i must conclude that this object is a yet secret aircraft operated by the u.S. military that is capable of outer-atmospheric altitudes and super-sonic speeds or was of extra-terrestrial origin and exceeds all capabilities of currently existing aircraft.","distance":"Over One

the balcony. the view i have is partial new jersey sky and partial brooklyn and far away queens sky. every day i see a lot of planes in the sky and i know how they're moving, how they look like. i notice this object immediately. why? because, when you step on my balcony you can't see much of people, traffic, so basically nothing is going on except what's on the sky. and this object looked like wasn't moving (read: moving too slow for a plane or and definitely didn't looked like a helicopter). that's why it has come to my attention. i didn't know what to think about it, because every day i see strange objects on the sky, but always i was looking for the explanation for it and most of the time it was something i know. usually plane, sometimes a bird, balloon. the object appeared from north making left turn into east part of the sky. the object looked like was hanging in the air , but it was moving very slow. all i was thinking was to take the best picture possible. my girlfriend couldn't see nothing. the object was really far away from my balcony. disappeared in the sky after few minutes. about 10-15 minutes later the same object appeared again , but this time it was much closer, moving about the same speed making the same left turn. basically the same event but much closer, and girlfriend was able to see it. the first and the second event was about the same period of time no longer than 5 minutes. first submitted picture (original) is darker than the time of the day at that time due dark lens i was using f/5.6 and maximum focal length 300mm with 3x teleplus pro 300 extender. picture is blurred, because i couldn't use auto focus only manual focus.","distance":"Over One

glowing red sphere came out of the woods about 150 feet ahead of me and headed toward our car.  i was going about thirty mph and the object was coming toward me at about the same speed following a slightly wavy path. it came within a couple of feet of the hood of my car and then raised up a little and flew over the drivers side fender and right past my open window about thirty inches from my face. i could have reached out and touched it. it was about the size of a soccer ball and perfectly spherical and glowed red the color of the brake lights on a car.  i looked back after it passed and watched it follow a wavy path down the road behind me until it went around a curve and wasn't visible any more. we just stopped the car and sat there in awe of what we'd both seen.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20222,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.1611246,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10312009-0005","longitude":-90.6942149,"occurred":330408000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1257017634000,"summary":"Close
