seeing your show concerning the sightings of orbs this week on television, i finally decided to tell my story too. i have already told family, friends and neighbors of this experience mostly to get their reactions and to see if they had had similar. i also want to emphasize that this statement is every word the truth. i am telling it because i have never expected to see anything in my lifetime like it, i am now 67 years old, i still work as an fc bookkeeper and tax preparer. i am not looking to have my story on television nor am i looking for money. i just would like to let you know as investigators of these type of phenomenon about it. maybe my story is unusual or maybe not but to me it is because after watching your show i made the decision to tell you and my husband agreed with me:\r\n\r\ni had taken my new puppy out to relieve herself around 3 a.M. we had only had her a short time and i was working on her potty training. as i was standing in our yard with her i noticed a bright glowing light a few feet to the east of me about 10-12' high and directly over our 4' fence. a lot of things were running through my mind because we live in a very wooded area and we have 12 acres of land and it is very dark in here at night. we also are isolated from neighbors so i was somewhat concerned as to what i was looking at and where and how did it  come from. as i was looking at it i decided to move and to my surprise it also moved the same way i did. then i bent down from my waist side ways, it did the same, then i bent from my waist sideways again on the opposite side, it did the same. so i thought it was somehow like being remotely controlled and i thought someone was playing a joke on me because i thought it was being playful and  what else would do that. i could think of nothing. i continued to do that a few more times.It always mimicked my movements. then all of a sudden it came over the fence and started coming toward me and then i became very concerned, i quickly grabbed my puppy and got into the house, locked the doors,ran up the stairs to our bedroom and tried to wake my husband. \r\n\r\nthat is my story. i don't know what it was, or if i will ever see anything like it again. it had some sort of intelligence and seemed palyful or teasing at first. it made absolutely no noise at any time.\r\n\r\ni hope that my experience with this phenomenon might be useful to you somehow in your work with the unknown. \r\n\r\nthank you for reading my statement and if you have any questions i would be happy to answer them.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nmarian

had started driving at 12:00 a.M. after 10 hr. break.  first saw white orbs in sky - they would move rapidly across sky and then either go straight up or would - without turning - reverse direction - there were at least 3 doing this at a higher elevation - several hundreds of feet up in sky.  i then saw 3 flying side by side at a low elevation - as if they had taken off from a runway and were flying in a straight line - moving in a direction that would lead them to pass right in front of me.  as they got closer to the highway (i-10) for a brief second they were so low that my vision was blocked by an overpass.  as they passed on the other side of the overpass they for less than a second - turned into 3 small glowing jets - one pink - one blue and the other white.  as they topped the overpass they turned back into white orbs and suddenly swarmed each other - in the same ways that bees swarm around each other - they then made a sharp turn and shot up into the sky and dispersed.  another semi was coming from the opposite direction on i-10 and should have seen everything.  i called out on the radio \"wow, did you see that?\" and he asked \"did i see what?\" - i described what i had just seen and he basically asked what kind of drugs i was on, saying that what ever it was - he wanted some.  about 2 miles up the road i came across a car that was turned over on the side of the road and a state trooper was approaching on the opposite side of the highway.  he waited for me to pass the overturned vehicle and then crossed thru the median headed towards the vehicle.  thats it.  on the 3 jets - you could tell that they were not real - but they were glowing like glow sticks and you could actually see black outlines on the outside of the inner glow - more like an animation than a real jet.  i truly halfway expected to see the warner brothers symbol appear in the sky above them with porky the pig sticking his head through and saying \"that, that thats all folks\".  wasn't drinking - was not sleeping - had just finished my 10 hr. break.  drove a semi for 3 years and had never seen a ufo and drove many miles at night time in the middle of nowhere.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":20217,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.8870222,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10302009-0015","longitude":-111.7498721,"occurred":1130753400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1256970713000,"summary":"Several white orbs -

(normally, there is no need to use flash for a sunset pic, the camera flash was set to auto at the time.) several raindrops can be seen falling in a downward direction and are blurry indicating movement.  the rest of the scene is in clear view because i use a tripod mounted on a solid brick fence post.  i usually judge focus in my pictures using the electrical wires between the towers that can be seen on either side of the sun (1/3 mile away).  zoom in to see the wires.  all of the distant light sources are not blurred in any way.  these light sources are at a local airport, the control tower (2 miles away) can be seen just to the right of the sun and left of the electrical tower.\r\n\r\nthe thing that is unknown to me is the object to the left of the sun.  when i took the picture, i don't remember seeing anything unusual, i was just taking a sunset picture.  the object appears to be between me and the electrical wires. the object appears to be moving towards the camera and in a slightly upward direction.  i also see three other bright objects (2 lower middle, 1 lower right of the view) above the ground on either side of a known dead pixel in my camera's ccd.  they are not falling or showing much movement at all.  not sure what those are.  all of the other light sources in this pic are familiar to me.\r\n\r\nif you have the capability to analyze this picture, can you tell me what it is?

just appeared.  they were about 70 degrees up from the horizon.  it was like they all came on together as a group, since they were all near each other, but didn't all come on exactly at the same time.

went outside my house at aproxiamateley 7:50 to have a cigarette. was facing sw looking at the moon 3/4 full, venus, and the stars when i saw a bright light bluish white in color high in the sky come over the roof of my house moving fast in a se heading. it was as bright as venus, as i could see venus to my right, but not as high in the sky maybe 30 thousand ft or more. at first i thought it was a passenger jet with landing light turned on for some unknown reason, but it was moving to fast and then it did a quick zig zag to the left and then back right then continued heading se. i kept watching it thinking maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me for about a minute or so as it was heading toward a small high thin cloud. it started going behind the cloud and i could still see it through the cloud due to the brightness of the object. at about half way through the cloud it disappeared. i kept watching since i could see all sides of the cloud waiting for it to appear on the side or even heading in another direction, but it never did.\r\n i kept watching for about 5 more minutes and scanning the sky where it should of been, when a bright shooting star or fireball appeared out of nowhere real low in the sky heading in the oppsite direction nw. the hieght of the fireball i estimate  to be about 100 hundred to a thousand ft above the tree line. i estimate the distance away from me to be about a 1-3 miles as there is a mountian range 5-10 miles away from my house wich you could see that night and the fireball was in front of the range.  the fireball also had a real low angle of entry almost flat with a tail behind it. it lasted about 5 seconds and i could see splinters come off it as it was burning up. i waited about five more minutes but saw nothing else and went inside to tell my wife.  \r\ni don't believe the first object was an asteroid as it was going to slow, and not a jet or satelitte as it was going to fast and did that quick zig zag manuver. i also know the most of the traffic patterns in the area above my house fairly good and it wasn't on a flight course i recognize. i star gaze all the time and can tell the differance between jets, planes, and helicopters as i live only a mile away from a small community air port. the object was also way to high for a plane landing there. what strikes me as odd is seeing the object and then the shooting star so close in time together with the appearing so low out of nowhere and  going in the opposite direction with parts splintering off. i can't say it isn't possible, but find it highly improbable.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am 53 years old and live in westchester county, ny, and have seen ufo���s four times, that i know of.  i���ve always lived in the hudson valley.  the first sighting was when i was a teenager.  my sister and i and a night watchman at bard college witnessed a disc with multi colored lights above the hudson river.  the speed and directional angles it traveled convinced us it was not of this world, and we were astounded when it finally shot off into space at an amazing rate. a few years later, again on the hudson river, i was going over the kingston rhinecliff bridge with two friends at about three in the morning to get breakfast after closing the bar we worked at (none of us had been drinking, i swear) and there, hovering above the river, was a gray saucer emitting a beam of light into the river.  i remember we stopped the car to watch in amazement.  however, to this day, none of us can recall leaving the bridge, or eating breakfast, or returning home, yet, somehow, we all got home safely.\r\n\r\ni grew up in a very old house at bard college that was on the edge of a field with woods surrounding us.  i have childhood memories of very bright lights shining in my windows, and of having out of body experiences, where i was floating at ceiling level watching my body in my bed.  i once woke up in my room in the wrong bed, above the covers, facing the wrong way, with a bloody nose, and no recollection of how i got there.  i never ever considered ufo abduction.\r\n\r\nyears later, on the island of kauai overlooking hanalei bay, i woke my husband and announced that i was pregnant and in nine months we���d have a son.  i had a vivid dream before he was born (i was right!) of standing on a balcony at hanalei bay with my son in my arms, watching a ufo come towards me.  i knew they wanted my son.  when he was four, he started telling me about his friends from the sky, whom he named ditty, pom pom, ten ten and king king.  he told me i knew who they were and, periodically throughout his childhood, he���d tell me, ���they���re coming���.  when he was about 12, he told me he and his little cousins had seen a ufo come across the lake towards them at our house in the adirondacks.  when he was 16, he woke one morning and had two perfectly cylindrical marks on his calf that looked like they had been made by a machine.\r\n\r\na year ago i was in my bedroom sleeping when my husband woke me up because there was a blood red orb in our room, and it was freaking him out.  it was about the size of a beach ball, hovering at ceiling level.  it looked gelatinous and fluid, lit from within, and it pulsated.  all the shades were drawn in the room, so it wasn���t a reflection of anything external.  now, normally, i would have been very excited, i would have been grabbing a camera and would have tried to figure out what the hell it was, but all i wanted to do was get back in my bed and go to sleep.  this, too, is strange, because i am normally a night owl, and i never would have been asleep that early.  it felt like i had been drugged.  my husband said he had to leave, that he was going downstairs to sleep (thanks, faithful husband), and he left. i got back into bed, and the orb traveled across the room, still at ceiling level, and came to stop directly over my head, still at ceiling level.  i remember watching it above me, but that is all i remember of that night. \r\n\r\ntwo days later, my head started hurting really badly.  it felt like it was filled with mucous, and for a month and a half, i was in constant pain.  numerous trips to two different doctors, along with two series of steroids, and three series of antibiotics, failed to give me relief.  an mri of my head showed it was full of something, actually packed with something, but the doctors were at a loss to explain what it was or why it wasn���t going away.  now comes the really gross part of the story.  one morning on the toilet, a fairly large, gelatinous blob of something came out of me into the toilet.  i thought about taking a sample of it for analysis, but then i thought, ���how am i to explain this?  where in the hell would i bring this for analysis?  people will think i���m insane!���  the one upshot, though, was my head was miraculously clear, finally.\r\n\r\nthen my health really went kablooey.  my blood pressure skyrocketed, as did my cholesterol, and different joints started becoming inflamed at different times.  when it was in my knees, i couldn���t walk, when it was in my hands, i couldn���t even dress myself.  at different times, every joint of my body has been affected.  my rheumatoid factor has shot up to five times a normal person���s level, and the doctors keep finding blood in my urine with no explanation as to why. i was finally given a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, and i am battling it still, but i am more and more convinced that something entered me that night and is systematically going through my body, which is causing my autoimmune system to go haywire.\r\n\r\nprior to all this, i have to say i���d enjoyed good health.  i come from a family that believes you only go to a doctor if you���re really, really ill.  i am no hypochondriac, far from it.  also, it might be prudent to add that i have always been very psychic.  as a child, i always knew if one of my siblings was in trouble.  as an adult, i have even known when my adult son or daughter is throwing up, because even if i���m miles away, i literally feel what they���re experiencing.  i have predicted two car accidents, because i saw them happening about a week before they occurred as i was drifting off to sleep.  i don���t always know who is going to be involved, but i now know to warn friends and family when i have one of these precognitive episodes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

megapixel i think and sum video of all the clouds . and i realised sumthing there is a mine here that was shut down right (dont know why) ... and its now filled with water , and there is this big thing about pumping it all out . they say the town will collapse if the water is pumped out (lies i think ). now i swear i have seen a pic of it empty with a military tank in it (going to find it ).Right? and strangely our town has a very high suicide rate ,i was told highest in the southern hemisphere (mind control ?). im thinking there may be sumthing here .Because the water that fills this open cut mine if copper sulfate or sumthing and the copper out of it would be worth millions of dollars (yet the owners dont care ) and it is fenced off .I have seen something (a ghost trying to get to me) there at night inside the fence (note i was very drunk ) so i dont know but it scared me to death .Im going to research this further . but i think it isnt coincidence that the first chemtrails i have ever seen here start when i begin really researching secret gov. stuff .I will continue to research this regardless of \"effects\" and conciquences .\r\n1. i was driving around and then at home when i spotted the ufo cloud.\r\n2. its strange shape and i was taking photos of chemtrails. \r\n3. it was a perfect ufo shape , so i thought a possible ufo.\r\n4. stationary sadly i didnt observe it

i wanted proof even just for myself so i grabbed the only video devise i own and that is my cell phone i took 3 cell phone videos one after another after i had been watching it for about 8 or 9

perfect but you can see that it is round fairly small stationary then moves very fast then just disappears! i was never going to report this to anyone not even my husband,until i was watching tv and saw a peice on all of the missouri sightings of the same exact thing!!!! and a video a guy had taken in missouri that looked and acted exactly like what i have seen and videoed! i am not doing this for publicity at all! but when they were talking about the investigations around here i thought my date, time, and video, may help or match up with someone elses account on the same date and time. my daughters and i all 4 feel very scared almost frozen when we have watched this!!!! almost a feeling of could they know that i am looking at it (them)??? and was scared to even take the video!When i showed my daughters the video back they said \"mom you sound terrified\" i said \"i was very scared\" if this can help with anything or anyone would like our account of what we have seen i would be willing to talk to someone.      thanks\r\ni dont have the capability to send my cell video to the computer but could and would be able to send it to another cell phone number i tried that by sending

noticed a very bright light directly above my line of sight. it looked like a street light size light compared to the stars around it. after seeing it with my peripheral vision i looked right at it and for aprox 30 secs i watched it just sit there. every once in a while it would flicker a little but not much, the shape and size stayed true the whole time as well. after the 30 secs it began to what seemed like just fade out or fly strait away from my vantage point, it just kept getting smaller, dimmer until it was gone. what made me watch it was in the direction of the orb we can see life flight helicopters take off and fly and when i first saw the light thats what i thought it was. however, when it is the copter the light tends to bounce and move, even change intensity, this did not, it was bright white and huge compared to the size of the stars. this is not the first time either, over the past month or so i've seen it 4 or 5 times, covering an area of about 45 degrees in sight line but always in the same area. there was also no noise with the sightings and always the same outcome, just fades away or flies away getting smaller and dimmer. i've lived here my whole life and i

point of asking god to let me know how i should live me life, as it had now become evident a significant relationship had changed. at the exact moment i completed that request in my mind, sitting on my couch looking out the window at the same time, i saw a point of light rise up from behind a tree and grow lengthwise in size then stop and become a horizontal white line of shimmering light in the sky. i often see airplanes coming into the airport turning around in that part of the sky, but this light was much wider than the airplane headlights i see. i could only figure it was a large airplane, so i kept looking at it, expecting it to bank out of its turn i figured it was in - i wanted to see what this craft was, it was relatively big! the white line didn't move, but grew in size a bit, 10 to 20 percent. i then looked at the clock to note the time of 8:55 pm. it stayed in that position for about 30 seconds. it then started to move very slowly to the left, its right side seeming to tilt up at a faster rate than it was moving left, but through the area of movement it remained light, \"sparkling\" away as it tilted to about a 60 degree angle, the light dissapating until two clearly spherical white balls of light remained. i could see the sky between the balls of light, and the overall intensity was dimmer than the white line it was before. the craft(s) was still slowly moving left, but had only moved about it's \"line\" length in the time it took the \"line\" to tilt and look like two distinct balls. the two balls then sped off left behind a tree, seemingly without accelerating, they just started moving at the speed they sped off at from the very slow speed they were when a line. the balls reminded equidistant from each other, and were so straight it was like they were on rails. i ran outside to see if they would emerge from the other side, but i didn't see them. i went back in and got my camera to take a picture of my viewpoint from inside looking out at the sky conditions. i did that, and was sitting there looking out the window when i heard a light wind blow then saw what seemed to be a very low flying commercial airliner fly right over my house! it was about 85 degrees in temperature that evening with humidity about the same percentage. the air was very still, which is rare for where i live in the city, which is why i noticed the wind start to blow. i had my camera! i went outside on my front porch and put it on my porch railing to get a picture of the very silent craft now completing a banking maneuver, still close enough that i could fit the craft within my hand width. everything worked until i hit the shutter and it failed! at that point the camera would do nothing, including off or on!! of course i'm frustrated, and the craft is now getting off in the distance. suddenly, the camera just comes back on in my hands, so i reset on the porch railing and took two shots although it was now much further away. i actually captured it, although perhaps indistinct from a plane to most people. it wasn't faa legal by its light, no red and green lights on wingtips, and the blinking was wrong, and not always blinking but steady. it was a triangle of lights, red in the lead, although closer to what would seem to be its midsection, and white on the \"wingtips.\" in terms of describing it in ufo patterns, it was a triangle with the front light out. the white lights always blinked after it passed my house, steady when it went over, and the red light usually didn't blink, but did sometimes. the attached triangle picture is actual, the spheres picture is a \"hybrid,\" created using the real picture i took of the sky a few minutes after i'd seen the white line and balls, which i \"painted\" in with microsoft paint. the hybrid image yet looks very close to real as i saw them. i found it ironically interesting that the location in the sky where i eventually actually captured the triangle is exactly where the white line hovered!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

joan, with our eyes closed we both heard and felt a very loud \"explosion\" that seemed close by, shaking us and the house. we had already been praying, so we shortly finished and i went out front, but those neighbors we'd heard come out and talking had gone back in. as reported to mufon, thirteen days earlier on september 17th joan witnessed an unconventional craft fly over her on her way to my house. anyway, i then went back in and out my back door, and two neighbors were still talking outside. my next door neighbor, and her husband, by her own initiative and repeated testimony with questions, stated she and her husband saw a \"huge\" white light over the cross-street at the same time of the explosion. both neighbors, the other two houses down, had their houses shake too. my next door neighbor, whose house was to my back as i was sitting on my couch with joan, were sitting on their couch facing in the opposite direction in their house than i was in mine. we both only have windows on the north side of our houses which look out to the street we live on, they are the last house on our street. looking out their window, where our street ends in a \"t\" with a main city street, morganford, she and her husband saw a \"huge\" white light over the street at that location at the time of the explosive bang, that only lasted for the duration of the sound. i asked her if she didn't just see a flash of light, or a light over the cemetery sky bordering that main street, but she emphatically said \"no\" to those things, and described seeing a \"huge flash of white light

spheres which stay in position for several hours unaffected by earth's rotation or wind related movements visible from the playing field of our local high school. i phoned in my verbal description to mr. robert d. long, assistant state director, mufon, ny who advised me to fill out this report on the main site. we originally sent report to ny mufon, site did not work on several attempts.\r\n\r\nthese lights were first observed by me around october 21, 2009 at approximately 6:55 p.M. i observed these lights (riding in my car) out of the corner of my eye because of their brightness and as i continued to watch noticed they were not in motion in any way. at first lights did not seem suspicious, however, as i continued on my way could not help (in other directions) see these bright lights as they stayed fixed. traffic took me away from continuing to observe these lights.\r\n\r\nit was not until tonight, october 26th at around 9:45 p.M., that the incident became more significant. my daughter called me on her cell that she wanted me to see some lights she observed, stating that she had seen them in the same week prior (as did my wife), and i should be outside waiting to be picked up to view. as we drove to the sighting area, she explained what she observed two hours previously. it was at that time i recalled my sighting of the same objects, and when we arrived there they were in the exact spot i saw them on the 21st. again, there was no motion, just intense, bright orbs, forming a triangle which reminded me of the phoenix lights. all of a sudden one orb moved in a semi-circular motion (clockwise and upward) to the side of the upper most orb. that was the only motion observed at any time. later, they were in the same formation as first observed. note, on the 25th, around 5:30 p.M. there was unusual helicopter traffic, whether more than one was difficult to ascertain, nor were they visible to my eyes though very loud. they circled for about 15-20 minutes continuously. connected? not known. i mentioned that to my daughter.\r\n\r\nwe continued to drive in an attempt to find a clearer vantage point without tree lines or buildings which obstructed out view. as we drove they stayed fixed. they dimmed for a brief moment, several seconds, then became brighter once more. we realized we had no chance of moving to a clear area. my daughter then suggested we return to the original viewing spot. on the way back they were still visible until we arrived at the original spot and were shocked to see they were gone!  tonight the weather was overcast, very little visibility and the planet jupiter was next to the moon (dimly visible), just enough to make out each body. these bright objects had to be below that cloud cover to shine so intensely.\r\n\r\nmy daughter attempted to take a phone photo. only two objects were dimly visible. tomorrow, if these objects follow the previous pattern and time frame, we will have a better camera to take photos. i will attempt to see if these objects will show at dusk and later. if so will record times, areas, and motion(s) (if any).\r\n\r\ni repeat, they remained motionless, unaffected by even the earth's motion. they were not aircraft nor were they flares or reflections from ground objects. these lights had not been seen by either of us at any time prior to these sightings. i would like to know if others in my area had reported what we observed, officially or unofficially. thank you for taking the time to view my report. hopefully we can get these lights on camera.\r\n\r\ni delayed my entry to observe another night. weather was heavy rains, no visibility. tonight the 29, the lights are visible and in a different formation though triangular. one object dimmed, this is the 2nd time, and the formation changed. that same light appeared in a different spot (lower,fixed). i could not get a clear photo.\r\n\r\ni would like to know if other reports in my area have been recorded. thank you for taking time to read my notes.\r\n\r\nsincerely, art moyano","distance":"Over One
