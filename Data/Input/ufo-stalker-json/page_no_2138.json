evening getting ready to drive back to colorado.  my mom lives in the u.P. of michigan on little bay de noc, a horseshoe shaped bay.  you can see the other side, which is a peninsula straight across. my dog was whining to go outside, so i opened the sliding glass door to let him out. the sliding glass door is on the lake side from the door to the lake is about 600 feet or more.  the back yard from the house is flat then drops off down a hill then the shore line begins. there are not many trees looking straight out the back, but to the right the trees are thicker, so there is a pretty clean view straight out the back of her house. so, i went outside with my dog, it was a very cold evening.  my dog wanted to come back inside right away, so i kept saying,\" come on go potty\".  as i was motioning him to go out into the yard, i notice a (boat) on the lake. i thought it was very strange for someone to be out fishing on such a cold, cold night, but not unheard of right? especially in michigan. i looked at it again and noticed it did not have a light on the front or rear, it had a light blue line than was angled slightly, the back being higher than the front.  i thought to myself that someone tricked out their boat with rope lights. all of a sudden it took off speeding, but i did not hear any noise.  it is very easy to hear noise on the lake because of the way the bay is shaped like a horseshoe.  i slapped my face a couple times, blinked my eyes, thinking what the heck is that.  then the light stopped again, then it took off at lighting speed again without a sound, it continued stopping and speeding about 3 times with no hint of sound.  it was going from left to right, so i just stood on the deck watching and listening, until it hit the area of trees on the right. the moon was almost full so the light was shining down on the water.  as i continued to watch, i lost site at the trees, but waited to see if it would continue toward the moon light on the bay, but i did not see it again.  my dog was already in the house, for some reason, he did not want to be outside, and i felt uncomfortable not having him outside with me. i was afraid to go to the edge of the hill and watch more closely. i stood at the sliding door watching for about 5 more minutes, but nothing. i went back into the house and grabbed mom's room-mate and told him what i saw, so we stood outside for 10 to 15 minutes longer and never saw the light again. throughout the evening, i would open the sliding glass door and look at the bay, i did here weird noises in the woods after the siting.  it freaked me out, so i went back into the house.  i had a very creepy feeling the rest of the night along with sleep loss.  this is the 2nd siting that i have seen over the bay, the 1st time was back in 1980.  for some reason i wasn't as creeped out over this siting, as i was with the one i saw in 1980.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

lake but fireworks were not visible as they usally can be seen over the trees.  i was glad when the booms stopped.....Not a fireworks fan.  i was online or watching tv near a window when i saw what appeard to be sparklers......It was like looking at a campfire through the trees........Tree leaves blocked most of the light so it appeard to be some kind of sparkler or fireworks, but all noise had stopped before the sparkling appeard.  the sparkles rose higher in the trees, and a growing bubble of orange light through and over the trees.....(pardon grammatical errors, trying to be coherent and accurate here)..The light was like the light from a fire that was growing rapidly.....Almost like the initial round, glowing, and growing explosion of a nuke weapon but no smoke, and again...No sound.  then the thing appeared above the tree line.........Three bright orange headlights/floodlights. the lights were distintly kept from illuminating upward.  the whole neighborhood was lit up from the thing.  it slowly ascended then turned eastward......Approx 100 feet off the ground before it started turning eastward and it continued to rise to maybe one thousand feet as it moved eastward, speed also seemed to increase steadily.  i could not make out the shape of the objett, but it appeared to have  lighted windows on the back side as it moved away.  i estimated the size according to the span of the crown of the trees it rose above when i first saw it.  that's all.....No lights pointed directly at me, no abduction, just sooooo weird because the thing was silent and the lights were so broad and oddly colored orange......Maybe a little less orange than flames of fire, but very close......When i saw a campfire through the woods once after the inc3ident, i pointed it out to a friend as it loooked very similar to the lights of the strange craft when i first saw it.   when i first saw it i thought it was a helicopter, but it was silent.  then i thought it must be a balloon or blimp, but it seemed to move too fast as it headed east.  i was quite awestuck and a little scared, but the thing had no notice or interest in me which i was glad for. the thing disappeared in the distance after moving a mile or two in less than one minute, too fast for a blimp. the object must have been about twenty feet in height(estimating by the size of the headlights/floodlights,  and fifty feet wide.  the wooded area is behind a school.  i did not examine the area...Yet...For signs on the ground.  people think i\"m crazy anyways.....If i find nothing there, that's just more reason to think i'm crazy.  didn't bother to look, i know what i saw.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

 they were flying in evening aprox. 800 ft overhead.  i have pilots license and know heights.  the sun was setting and the crafts were visible in evening light.    they were circular and made no noise, odd since they were so close to me. they were flying very close together for formation flying.  \r\n\r\nnext encounter (different day) i was focusing the video camera on a planet (so i thought).  i was setting up the camera���s f-stop for night photography incase i got another view of these objects.  i thought i was focusing on a planet.  the planet/object was bright and round. there was a faint shadow of a rim or something around the light.  i wasn���t sure of what i was seeing.  the object suddenly accelerated and shot threw the sky and made a hard turn, not like anything we have.  nothing moves like that in the sky.  it flew away for some distance real fast then quickly slowed down and stopped. it turned again went down a little, then the light split in two and the object disappeared.  \r\n\r\nnext encounter (different night) object hovering in same place again.  now i���m checking the night sky regularly.  i ran into house to get strobe light to flash object for attention.  two fighter jets approached by the time i came out of the house.  the item increased distance between itself and the jets.  two more lights suddenly appeared and all three lights appeared to play with the jets.  the jets and lights went over horizon.  \r\n\r\nnext encounter (different night) light slightly higher and at different location in sky.  by now i have memorized every bright looking planet in the sky.  if a light appears out of place i watch it with a powerful telescope.  i watch the sky around 20:00 hrs.  i ran in and got my strobe.  the light began to leave slowly.  i flashed the strobe and the light reversed direction, and backed up in my direction, stopped again then departed extremely fast.  \r\n\r\nnext encounter unsure.  during overcast air force back again in same area.  air force never fly���s over my house.  i documented the dates and times in my day planner.  i can make them available to you if you want.  \r\n\r\nobjects did not return as of late.  are these things dangerous?  i managed to get them to take a closer look at me by a combination of light signals.  i do not want to be known.  i want to be safe.  if this is not safe i am

lake. i have invited witnesses to do our ufo night watching and have on my video camera 60-70 strange encounters. i have multiple orange shaped intelligent flying objects flying over lake, i have white orbs appearing and flying towards my house. i have seen 2 huge ships. the first time was  a very large almost giant diamon shaped ship traveling at a high rate of speed spinning with red, white lights among other lights and the ship was spinning rapidly. i have seen lights that look like stars at first glow very bright and suddenly dart in close to my home. i have used things such as very bright glowing lamps in total darkness which seems to almost attract them, i have used lasers and i am successfull at attracting them about 50% of the times that i have tried. i have on tape a strange object come up from the lake and appear about 50 feet in front of me and a group of witnesses just this past may. this happened while i was filming a white orb coming toward us, and suddenly a splash from the lake and this object came up people within the group started to run away (this is all documented on my camera) i live approximately 1/2 mile from guinea nuclear plant and since there is a restrictive no fly zone the triangel red blinking objects are here frequently. i began noticing these objects while sitting on my dock watching sunset and i saw a silver like cylinder shaped flying around, this is what started my fascination, my neighbors can attest to many of the things i have stated here and i actually believe that i can attract these crafts using some of the methods i have developed that seem to get their attention and since i now have so many documented events and over 20 people who have been invited and have witnessed these strange events, i believe u can gather evidence here that may prove it once and for all. i should tell you that on more than one occasion myself and the people i was with did feel threatened and the ufos did seem aggresive , but for the most part they seem to go away quickly when they feel like it. i am very close to actually making my own documentary footage and inviting people thru ads so i have differnet peopls real live accounts on tape, i would like to keep my footage to myself right now but will provide it to you if you would like to investigate these multiple sightings.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 501 Feet -

intersection where i would take a right. a few minutes earlier i'd already noticed a bright single white oval light coming towards me from my left, lower in the sky, but it seemed probably a commercial airliner. when it got closer, it showed a green navigation light on a wing with bright landing lights, or so it then seemed. but, when it crossed behind some trees, the navigation light had become white! at this point it was just about in front of me, just to the left. as the craft continued to move east from right to left across my field of vision, directly over the road in front of me, it slowly tilted up its bottom towards my direction showing a perfect isosceles triangle of white lights with a single red blinking light, with a small red \"halo\" around it, in the middle. the craft continued to move slowly, then slowly rotated its bottom back down again while also starting a slow bank towards the north. at that point all three white lights started to blink. the car in front of me literally stopped in road after turning just slightly towards where the craft was banking away. i had to stop my car to avoid hitting him, and pulled around him while the craft was lost from sight behind some trees. i've filed this report because i feel bad that i didn't stop also, as i'm ninety-nine and forty-four one hundredths percent sure that he also saw what i did and was astonished at what he was seeing. i guess he was hoping that i or someone would stop too to verify with him what he saw. i'm sure there are are other people that could have seen this large object fly over st. louis too, so i'm reporting this should anybody be looking for such verification. i've created an image of the exact location but for it being a cloudy day instead of a cloudy night: the craft was

infinite and unexplained phenomena and mysteries that it beholds but because in my opinion it is the most beautiful form of live art.This is where i most vehemently see and feel god...In nature. the clouds, the sunsets, sunrises, everything about the sky completely enthralls and captivates me. i am a very scientific person and also a very, very spiritual person. i am skeptical about things such as ufo's, ghosts, spirits, aliens, and anything that i cannot see or feel for myself. i have always said, it's not that i don't believe, i am very open minded but i need to see things like this for myself in order to truly believe. this is why this occasion just leaves me speechless. i don't know how to explain what i saw. but i saw it. my fiance and i were driving from our place to visit our parents near stafford driving down beltway 8 south and approaching the gessner exit when i was merely looking out of my fiance's window up at the clouds in the sky. he was driving, i was in the passenger seat. the sun was setting at the time so it was still bright out but not so bright that a very brilliant light in the sky could've been overlooked. that is exactly what i saw. i saw a round, incredibly bright, bright light that seemed to be moving with the car. i knew right away it wasn't a plane or any other type of machine of that nature. i just felt that it was something....Different....Something i couldn't quite put my finger on. it was ....It just was. it wasn't the typical ufo sighting i've heard about or even the kind we see in movies. there was no actual tangible object i was looking at. it was just a very bright light. and i would've not been the least bit suspicious of said light except that i asked my fiance if he could see it too. so he turned his head in that direction and was able to witness it as well but only for a few seconds as he had to concentrate on the road. so i continued to stare at it, and it seemed almost immediately after i mentioned it to my fiance and he saw it, well, this is what happened next. as i stared at the light it seemed to get bigger and brighter and then it seemed to be moving away rapidly because it got smaller, then smaller, then just zoomed away instantaneously and disappeared. i watched the whole thing happen right before my eyes. i was the president of the astronomy club in college, i know

look like, i have never in my entire life seen anything like this!!! i know i didn't imagine it although sometimes i wonder if it would be better to believe that. i don't know to explain what i saw or even try to make sense of it, all i know is that i saw something. i don't know why, but i did. and i have to be honest, although i have no clue what it was it's not something one can easily forget. it gave me a whole new perspective on the place i already called home and couldn't wait to get back to, the stars, the world above and beyond us. i've always thought this universe and it's infinite vastness was just too big for us to be alone but what i saw that night, well maybe it's just a little firmer tug on my heartstrings. maybe it was just the confirmation i needed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20168,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6178871,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10282009-0008","longitude":-95.5564021,"occurred":1253928600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

funnel cloud as the funnel kept dipping down slightly, bobbing up and down. suddenly a spherical object came below the cloud level, as if it was studying the funnel cloud. it was @ 100ft in diameter, with lighted panels,about6'high by 10' long,flashing in an ac chaser-like sequence counter-clockwise. the peculiar thing was that it would flash a different color at each panel succesion, but the same panel would flash different colors. it simply drifted alongside the cloud, and i could see mechanical arms that were retracted as if they were landing gear. i only saw two, so i assume there was a third that didn't face our direction. there was no sound! it finally just rose back into the cloud. i counted how many of us saw that, and, including myself, there were exactly 30 of us. we discussed whether we should call authorities about it, and decided they'd think we were crazy, so we didn't. after moving to tn another event happened 8-27-94 that was completely different, so i'll call this

very dark out and about 8:15pm when we saw an object with 5 large white lights and 1 small red blinking light hovering low above the road in the distance ahead. coming from batavia we thought it was a radio tower or airplane or something of that nature. as we neared it we noticed it was some type of aircraft. we both were pretty calm at first because neither my husband or i believed in ufo's. as we drove directly under this object we both became extremely nervous. i didn't know what to make of what i just saw, my husband couldn't even speak. i know we were not the only ones who saw it because there were several cars in front of us an behind us. the cars in front of us were pulling off to the side of the road to look at it and other cars were swerving in their lane trying to look at the object. the object would not move. we opened our windows but no noise was present. after we drove a little ways up the road the object disappeared without a trace. when we arrived home about 7 minutes later, we stepped out of our car and the air smelled different, kind of like ozone or something like that. then, a half hour later, my husband stepped out onto the deck for his last cigarette of the evening and looked up at the sky because he heard a noise. he then knocked on the window for my brother and i to come outside. there was an odd humming noise unlike an airplane in the sky. we looked up and i saw an aircraft that looked like a square on top of a rectangle though my husband said it reminded him of the shape of an arrowhead sort of but without a point on the end. it was moving sideways. we watched until it disappeared once again.\r\n\r\nlater, about 3am that morning we were awoken by the odd humming again. we looked out the windows but saw nothing. however, there was an unfamiliar high pitched noise coming from the corn field behind our house. lasted about 15 minutes then just stopped. did not get much sleep that night because we were already a little shaken by what we had already seen. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
