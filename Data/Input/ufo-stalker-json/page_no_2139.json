(for those who don't know this route takes you thru the city of orlando on a kind of highrise highway). it was around 9:30pm and i was alone. i noticed a red shine reflecting off the buildings windows, about halfway up the buildings height my initial impression was that it must be some kind of promotional thing or maybe an ambulance reflecting as the light was pulsing. those thoughts were quickly gone when i saw what looked to be a red blood cell-looking object quickly floating from in between the two buildings! when i saw it, my thoughts were excited, as i have been intrigued by ufo's since i can remember, and here was one, maybe a mile away from me! then, without warning, it turned to its right(my left) and quickly glided over to my minivan that i was driving. as it flew over i noted how much it did look like a red blood cell. it had this plasma-like see-thru forcefield surrounding it and in the very center was a constantly glowing red ball, it would light up every other second and would make the entire plasma-like field around it glow a bright red. i did also notice that it didn't seem to reflect on the tree leaves, almost as if the plasma collected the light. it flew over, silently, to my van where it flew with my van for about a mile or two, right in front maybe about 15-25ft in front and slightly above the minivan's windshield. i would like to take a moment to point out the size of this object, which with plasma-like shield and all was no larger than my minivan. i'm watching this, i'm driving about 75mph on the highway and it must have been moving at the same speed because it stayed equidistant from me the entire time. after what seemed to be 1, maybe 2 minutes, the plasma-like substance surrounding it faded out and the red center ball spun to the left in a way that seemed internal but it created a yellowish sort of light that seemed more a result of the speed of its spin more than a color change, as the red color seemed to over-envelope it (almost as if the yellowish light was peek-a-booing thru it). i watched this spinning went on, and the spinning ball shape-shifted and grew wings with little lights underneath the tips of the wings, the left light was a white blinking, the right was a yellow blinking light. underneath the center of it was still the red blinking light. to tell it best it appeared to be a very small plane. only, it was no plane that i've ever encountered as it would have to be flying backward at 75mph. also, if you would, imagine the red blinking light in the center of it to be an axis of sorts, so while the rest of the \"plane\" was wobbly, the center remained in the same spot. i felt awed. i felt as if i were going crazy, i questioned my sanity. i remember i looked in my rearview mirror and all the cars that were around me were way back, almost slowed to a crawl, i also realized that no one was in front of me anymore. i guess people figured better me to handle it than have it come to their vehicle. i looked back at the ufo, it was still very much 15-25ft in front of me, still, as i felt, watching me i don't know why i felt that way, but it was like it was showing itself to me, showing me, \"look what i can do\". i did not feel threatened, and i certainly wasn't scared of it, it was almost in a sense, exciting. i was lucky to see this, so close. i felt what i was seeing was rare. and, i don't know if this will make any sense, but i felt like it was being coy or playing with me. i don't know why i feel that way, but it didn't hurt me nor anyone else and it left me feeling so pleasant at the end that is how i feel. i suppose now is the best time to say how i lost sight of this. as i was driving, there was a police cruiser with his lights flashing but no siren, he almost hit my minivan when he slid in between myself and the ufo. the ufo veered off to the right where there was a 10ish story brick building, it flew to the top window and produced a very bright white light and it flashed the window, seemingly peeking inside, and hovered there. i truly wish i could have stayed and watched but my drive home was long and i wouldn't get home till 10:30 as it were, so i drove home. i did note, however, that the police cruiser never pulled me, i was never contacted about it and i never saw anything about this on the news. i hope this information helps and, if you have any questions about what i have seen, feel free to contact me.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Path with directional

heard a jet flying over east to west to land @ a nearby airport 5 miles west of my house. i looked directly up to try and locate it when much to my surprise, i witnessed a spherical white object flying in a straight path of 330-340 degrees north to northwest @ a high rate of speed.\r\n  the experience lasted approx. 3-4 seconds before it disappeared over the horizon. i'm guessing the altitude of the object was approx. 10,000-to 25,000 ft. because it flew beneath the few scattered cirrus clouds that were present. my first thought was that it was a satellite passing by, but i tried to rule that out because there was no glare from the sun which was starting to set to the southwest as well as traveling below the cirrus clouds. it also did not have a tail or debris field behind it, nor was there any light emittance that i could tell, which makes me want to rule out a meteor. the speed was much faster than a satellite which i have viewed hundreds of times yet slower than a meteor. \r\n  the best description as far as the size would be if i were to hold up cottonball or possibly a golfball with my arm fully extended.     \r\n  for several years, f-16s would fly over our house on training runs at approx. 10-20,000 ft. and i could usually watch them fly over for a good 12-15 seconds at a probable speed of 400-600 mph.\r\n  being an analytical person, i find this anomaly to be challenging and quite simply, the last thing i ever expected to see when i looked up. i'm trying to make comparisons to the f-16s, meteors, and satellites that i've viewed over the years and am completely stumped! \r\n  did anyone else witness this same event over central indiana or the midwest at that approximate time and

i-96 on my way to play a concert in ann arbor with my band dr. device. we had just passed the kensington valley shopping center and were in in the howell area. as we passed datapak services inc. on our left, myself (passenger) and the driver of the truck noticed 5 distinct and strangely luminous green balls in the sky. initially we thought they were lights attached to a radio tower (which in itself was of note, as we drive this route often at night and in daylight and have never noticed such a tower), but soon we visually confirmed they were actually independent objects moving and hovering above the buildings to our left and further toward the westbound side of i-96.  they appeared incredibly low in altitude and of good size, no more than 100ft above the treeline(probably more like 50ft), and well under the scattered broken clouds that were strewn about the sky. there was light rain at the time. they seemed to be very slowly traveling west in a symmetrical trajectory. we we're only to observe these what i would call craft for 1 minute as we drove out of site of them, but we made the following observations: \r\n\r\n- they made no sound \r\n- no faa or blinking lights\r\n- moved in formation rectangular formation but also, \r\n- displayed independent movement at one time\r\n- changed color from green to red\r\n- witnessed 4 minutes later by 2 people we knew, who were only a few \r\n  miles  behind us on i-96 en route to the same location\r\n\r\nmore details:\r\nwe observed the first three (from left to right) change colors from green to red in a blink of an eye. this revealed to me what seemed to actually be 5 solid cylindrical or rectangular shaped craft.It seemed the green light was on one end of the craft, then would change (better described visually as morph)to the other end and become red (maybe the craft was rotating 180 degrees quickly). never did any of them have both color lights on at one time. the colored lights didn't emanate, refract off the windshield, or blink like the other lights we are used to seeing in the night sky, they were soft and glowing bright but not lighting up the surrounding sky, clouds, buildings or ground below. the fourth in succession remained green, and as i watched the fifth it turned to red and dipped down and moved westward as the still green craft (fourth) moved straight across east; the first three maintained their trajectory. after this they seemed to re-assume a symmetrical flight path, it was at this point i lost sight as we drove further east down i-96. the last thing seen by the driver was that the crafts were solid and dark on the bottom, while a bit lighter on their topside with the aforementioned light on the end (seemingly round). at this point i called to our friends trailing us by a few minutes down i-96e and they we're already having an identical sighting. the driver of the truck i was riding in previously did not believe there was any credence to the ufo phenomena, and this event has his beliefs completely reversed, as it was quite amazing.","distance":"101-500

(about 200 yards from end to end). it had no landing lights, but it did have interior lights that shone through rectangular windows which ran from one end of the boomerang to the other. there was no fuselage or tail section. the event happened quickly as the aircraft passed out of my line of sight. my apartment building was in the way. i ran to the parking area and looked up to where i thought the aircraft should be, and it was simply gone. i live across the street from and old martin-marietta aeronotics campus in littleton, and the aircraft was actually traveling in the direction of the existing lockeed martin plant. my speculation is that it was a version of the b-2 stealth aircraft. it was certainly stealthy, and had a black almost fluid quality to the texture of the exterior. it almost blended in with the night sky. i was not firightend by the sighting, but at the time it was quite surprising. i'm sure my blood pressure went up a few notches.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

heading the opposite direction but we didn't hear the call because our music was up. then we realized that he was calling and picked up the phone and just at that moment we saw the green lights right

imediatly and tracked the time the whole sighting, as far as i'm concerned i have never seen lights morph like that or that shape of a vehicle in the sky. three other people can tell you the same

other tv show that might be on regarding the subject.  but that was pretty much it.  that all changed at 9:00 pm monday night the 31st of january, 2009.  i was watching the bachelor, the jason/molly fiasco.  we have a large window which is to my left.  we live in the country in northern california, so we���re talking relatively dark.  a new moon reported on january 26 with a quarter moon on february 2nd.  so we���re in the middle���. what i���m trying to say is it wasn���t pitch dark outside.\r\n\r\nas i���m watching tv, out of the corner of my eye to my left hand side i see what i can only describe as a big round whitish-yellow light.  it ���dips��� down so i can���t help but see it.  needless to say, i was startled.  i couldn���t imagine what could possibly be that large, only 15��� away from my window moving in the air!  i���ve been struggling with how to describe it, but it was about the size of a tire.  we have two yellow labs,  both jumped up when i jumped out of my seat.  i don���t recall them barking, they just got excited, because i was excited.  still unaware of what the heck i was dealing with (a helicopter?) i went to the front door which was directly behind my chair.  i went out to the covered porch, down the stairs and looked immediately to my left and up.\r\n\r\ni still have trouble wrapping my mind around what i saw that night.  but here goes���.. i���m hard of hearing, but the first thing i did was check to see if my hearing aid was in my ear, because i heard no sound, but, there was a definite electrical buzz/feeling in the air.  as i turned to my left and looked up i saw directly above tree level, perhaps 40 feet a craft.  it was floating, best way to describe it, floating forward very slowly, perhaps 5-10 miles an hour.  by the time that i was able to get outside, down the stairs, and was able to observe it, only the back end of the craft was visible to me.  it was, and still is the most incredible thing i have ever seen.  it was a real space ship.  it was definitely metallic, burnished kind of metal.  white, blue, red lights adorned the back of the craft.  because i only saw the back end of it i���d say the size of it was a big car.  not as big as i would have imagined (had i thought about it at all).  as it floated over my house it continued over the trees and was lost from my sight.  \r\n\r\nfrom that night to this day i have become totally immersed, via the internet, in finding out everything i can about ufo���s.  i���m a daily mufon reader.  trying to find out if anybody else had a similar sighting.  what excites me and frightens me at the same time is that the ship made a point of ���knocking��� on my door, i.E. coming down to less than 15 feet from the ground and shining the light in my window to get my attention.  it wanted me to know about and become involved with ufo���s and the only way to do that was by doing something dramatic.  my husband works in the city but i called him, after i recovered sufficiently, to let him know what happened.  it���s been hard for him to grasp, but i���m a level headed 58 year old woman and he believes in me.  a few close friends know but i don���t really talk about it with anyone anymore.  i didn���t tell my story until now because, well������. same old story���. who���s gonna believe you?  if you harp on it too much, you become ���weird���.  thank goodness for the internet.  few days after this happened i went and bought binoculars and a camera.  \r\n","distance":"21-100

that sort of criss cross in a sense]. as i continued to watch i noticed that it was four opaque lights that were tear-dropped shape, but they had darker white circles in the center of them. the lights would come together in a center and immediately bounce back out. once they hit about 50 ft out in each direction they would come back and repeat the process. the lights as a whole were also rotating at a relatively slow pace. after about five more minutes i realized that there was no way this was from a light because it had been moving parallel to my car ( about 100 - 200 ft. up)for about 10 minutes. the object made no noise, and seemed much too large to be any form of aircraft. [it was about 100 ft x 100 ft.] i thought it was the coolest thing ever, and i immediately called my dad after my realization because we are obsessed with this sort of thing. after another 5 minutes

upwards.  first four formed square shape, then two more followed.  they were not blinking, pink in color, did not veer off course, so were not flares or fireworks. they just kept rising up and up until they faded into the clouds.  best rationale was that they were police helicopters - there is the killingsworth station in the general area they appeared to be from, but does portland even have 6 helicopters? and at less than 1.5 miles away, wouldn't i have heard 6 helicopters? and wouldn't the lights be blinking instead of constant? and how would they climb so high as to disappear on a relatively clear night....They rose slowly enough i had time to wake up girlfriend, she saw them as well.  wish i had thought to grab the cell phone

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Smoking outside, looking at the night sky, i am near the local airport, and flight paths are near and over my house...Saw this brilliant light, star like, a deep almost sparkling ruby color, like a star, that moved below the tree line. it moved slowly and would appear to stop at times and would do a jerking erratic almost light displacement movement as i watched it..;it seemed to be going in a pattern, but a tight one, at first i thought it was a star, then knew it was too low and close, then a plane, with brilliant lights, colors more vivid and deep than i have ever seen, but it seemed impossible because it would shift directions, not turn, and then there was the displacement thing...Then considered if it were a helicopter, but helicopters that i have seen rarely move like this if ever, and the colors, the displacement, moving from left to right on an even plane, then stopping moving right to left without skipping a beat...It seemed to go in a pattern, as if scanning or searching the area...It could not have been any more than 10 miles south of me at the most...It would do pretty much the same thing, move east behind the trees, then shortly come back west into my vision, then there were two brilliant white lights that flashed, and they were super bright, at first two then each one would flash taking turns and very fast and then the ruby red lights, a circle, or star type shape...When i watched it it did the same thing over and over, i kept telling myself, \"you have got to be kidding\" i am not sure how long this actually went on for because i really couldn't reconcile what i was seeing with anything i know about or have seen before... i actually got my digital camera out, but could not get a pic of it, the camera is not a good one the zoom is very very short, and does not take night pics well...I could not find it, or see in on the screen, no matter how i tried to find it with the camera...A roommate came home while i was still out there, he had a few friends with him, i wanted someone else to see it, and made him wait until it went behind the tree line and came back...They looked at me like i was nuts, he looked at it, they glanced, and he was not interested, said it could be anything, a plane...He wouldn't sit there to watch it more, he barely looked at it, he said he saw something but what it was, could be anything,then they went in...At that point i felt a little crazed, i had been watching this for awhile in disbelief and they just glance at it and go inside, no interest...I had to ask him if he saw it to get a reality check just in case i have gone bonkers...I have no agenda, to want to see any ufo's, in fact the thought of ufo's, as in, out of this world, alien technology, etc.. kind of freaks me out...I have seen a couple of objects with and confirmed by the people i was with years ago, that had no explanation but were much further away than this object...I went back outside later around 10 minutes and saw a plane come from behind the tree line i had last observed the object move behind. the plane seemed to be small, like ultra lite, i could hear it, from the point where i last saw the strange object.. i  could not  hear a thing as i observed the strange bright brilliant ruby red object..The small plane was not brilliant or bright, you could see the typical plane lights, i don't even remember seeing a tale light on the plane, and you could hear that it had a single small engine.. but i still blew the incident off as optical illusion, too much imagination, etc, i was embarrassed by my roommates reaction to my observation, even though he didn't bother to even watch it long enough to see how unusual it was...There is something totally intimidating about seeing the unusual alone, and then when i was trying to get someone else to observe, it was discounted without any real authority or observation... so anyway all day long this has bothered me a lot, i blew it off to maybe being the airplane, but still if i could believe my eyes and ears, it still didn't make sense to me...I am not sure what it was, it bugs me that i am not sure, not convinced of it being anything...Do want to call the local airport, that is less than 2 miles away to ask for any explanation, of the lights i saw...Experimental craft, optical illusions, what????  this bothered me all day, it is too strange, not to question, doesn't make any logical sense it doesn't fit in to any thing i have seen..I see large  and small aircraft of all kinds day and night in the skies  above and around the area. i live close to a small airport, 50 miles or less from major airports, major army, air force,  and navy military bases..The description of this object is very very close to the description of \"event 20115\" for 10/25/09 in austin tx, very strange, it seems like he/she is describing almost exactly what i watched, what are the odds????...How could i be the only person in this region to see this event it went on long enough for many people to see, but you would have to be a sky watcher, which most people rarely bother to look at anymore...","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

on i 684. it was looking like to shape up to be a beautful spring morning with hardly a cloud in the sky. i was approaching a section of the highway where byram lake is directly adjacent to the southbound lanes when i noted what looked like a strange flickering shining cell tower in the middle of the lake.It was in the shape of a giant stylized cross with what looked like sharp leading edges and tapered to points at the ends of the arms. it looked really strange when the rising sun peaked over the hills adjacent and i noted these sherical mylar ballon like objects moving up and down out of the water. of course my curiosity was peaked so at this point i put on my flashers, slowed my car and moved onto the left shoulder of the road until i got a clear view between the trees. being springtime and the leaves hadn't opened yet on the trees. this cross object was 300 or more feet in height with the arms about 200 feet wide and hovering about 10 feet off the water. i got out of my car, i was viewing this thing from about a quarter mile in distance. its surface was highly reflective and reflecting the topography around it, if it weren't for the bright morning sun reflecting it would have been nearly invisible. i watched a few minutes as about a dozen of these shiny sherical balls kind of floated in and out of the water, some appeared to be dripping water as they rose up slowly from the lake. they appeared to be about 7 to 10 feet in diameter. they just sort of floated up slowly meandering to either the vertical or horizontal arm of the cross and just looked like they melded onto them. the surface of the cross looked perfectly smooth, no humps, bumps or any apertures were noted prior to the spheres appearance or disappearence onto the surface. a few cars had passed in the meantime when this black bronco pulled onto the shoulder in front of me and the driver got out to also look. we both sort of looked on in silent amazement when after another 30-40 seconds the cross just rose straight up into the air, as if being pulled by a tether line at ever increasing speed and dissappeared into the stratosphere. there was absolutely no sound to be heard from the object even as it was ascending at what had to be faster than sound speed. i said to the guy driving the bronco \" can you believe that?\" he looked at me and said\" i don't know about you, but i'm not telling anyone they'll think we're crazy!\" he hopped in his vehicle put on his blinker and drove away. well i know i'm not crazy, maybe a little twisted like most, but i've never heard of an object like this described before and i've been a skeptical believer since project blue book days. i am an air force veteran with flight experience as well as a respected health care professional and think i'm eminently qualified to discern an illusion, delusion or hallucination from reality!","distance":"101-500

Heights","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on my way to visit a friend in yorktown heights off granite springs road. prior to making the right turn i noticed this grouping of triangular lights coming out of the west from the direction of the taconic state parkway. at first i didn't think anything of it as westchester county airport was to the east of me and i assumed that it was an aircraft on approach. than it dawned on me that the light configuation was all wrong and this object was either large or extremely low flying. i am a usaf veteran and know the standard light configurations of militay and civilian aircraft. after making the turn onto granite springs i pulled my car to the shoulder and got out for a better look. by this time the object was headed right for my location and getting larger by the second. when the leading edge was directly above me i noticed the lights on the edge to be evenly spread approximately 30 yards apart. the object appeared to be 500 to 700 feet above the ground traveling at about 40 knots. from tip to tip i estimate its width to have been 300 to 350 yards. other than the lights on its leading edge it was jet to muted black with no discernible structural features. once directly above me it completely blocked out my north and south horizons. no sky or stars were visible except beyond the leading edge. i heard a low pitched modulating motorized sound, nothing like an aircraft engine more like an electrical turbine but muffled. i followed the crafts flight after it passed me continuing east for a few minutes and noted two bright lights coming out of the southwest and heard the distinctive sound of two f4 phantoms at about 5 to 7000 feet descending and headed towards the object. as the jets on descent were about a mile away from the object its lights just sort of flashed and it completely disappeared from the sky. some weeks later i read a newspaper article about this object they called the westchester wing which speculating that it was a hoax perpetuated by a group of ultralight pilots. if there was any truth in that, they must have been the greatest pilots on the face of the planet and had perfectly tuned ,synchronized and muffled their engines. there would have to have been 50 or more of them flying wingtip to wing tip and nose to tail and maintaing the exact altitude and attitude in the moonless dark during my sighting of 15 or more minutes. a feat i know to be aerodynamically impossible for an ultralight.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

about 1000 feet. it had a large bright orange/yellow light in front, with a faint white strobe in the rear. after watching fly slowly around for about 2 minuets, i noticed 4 or 5 more craft flying around in the same manner west, and south west of my position, about 5 miles away. it was at this point that i realized that what i was seeing was not helicopters because there was no noise whatever being made by the craft, and what would a squad of helicopters be doing flying around randomly in the middle of the night? there is only one police helicopter in the area, and the light are nothing like these. a helicopter with lights that is flying around at night will have lights that fade, and change shape and size as it turns. these lights did not change shape as the vehicles turned, they remained large orange/yellow balls of light, with a faint white strobe at the rear. as i contined to observe the vehicle closest to me, which was now south sout west of my position, and about 4 miles away, the vehicle turned, it turned off it's yellow light, turned on a bright red strobe in the front, and the faint white strobe on the rear became very bright. then, it started to fly slowly twoards my position, and then all of the lights went out, and the whole vehicle was illuminated bright red, as if a hat had been put in the air and covered with small bright red lights. it appeared to be flying twaords me and ascending at the same time, then, it stopped forward movement and slowly went streight up. it flew streight up slowly as if on an elivator. in about 30 seconds i watched it penetrate the lowest cloud layer. it flew through that into a small clear space, then into the next cloud layer, where it dissappeared for good. all without sound, and streight up, up, up. not a helicopter after all. \r\ni then looked around to see what happened with the rest of the craft that were flying around. i spotted one south of me, flying slowly dead east, and still an illuminated ball of orange/yellow light. i also spotted another craft that was quite a bit closer to me and directly west, now illuminated in a cigar shape with blue, white, and red lights running along it's length in 3 or 4 separate rows, flying slowly north north west.\r\ni watched this vehicle until it flew out of range of sight behind the tree line, a matter of 3 or 4 minuets, and continued with my walk. when i turned the corner and started walking down the street heading east, i spotted the final craft flying dead east, just south of me, about 5 miles away. it was still an orange/yellow ball with a faint white strobe at the back. s i watched it fly east, it continued flying 5 or so miles, and just shut off all of it's lights, at which point it dissappeared from view. total duration of sightings was 23 minuets. the weather was cool and crisp, low 40's, very clear, low to no wind, and partly cloudy and quiet. the clouds were very high, broken in spots, and in two layers.\r\ni was completely surprised by the one that turned red and ascended streight up. at one poing i thought it was flying twoards me, and i would finally get a good look at what the heck this thing was. but instead, it flew streight up and away, all without a sound, or deviation in flight path because of winds, which must be quite high, as it flew right through the jet stream.","distance":"Over One
