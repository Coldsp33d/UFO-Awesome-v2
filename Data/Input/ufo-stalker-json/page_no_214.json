approximately 4:00 a.M., i was up early and took out my trash to the dumpster in our apartment complex. i noticed a very bright light in the eastern sky. i did not have my glasses on, so i went back into our apartment to get my glasses, camera, camcorder, and binoculars. i looked through the binoculars and noticed that it was not a plane, helicopter, balloon of any kind, meteorite, comet, planet, moon, star, reflection, or anything that i had ever seen before. i woke up my son and fiance so they could witness the object with me.\r\n   i started filming it with my camcorder. i had forgotten to set the time ahead one hour on the most recent daylight savings time, so the camcorder time read about 3:00 a.M. instead of the actual time of about 4:00 a.M. even though my camcorder is a very inexpensive camcorder, i managed to get several closeups which show a very compelling view of the object. since i do not have a tripod, i tried to hold the camcorder still as best i could. the best way i can describe the object is it looked like there had been a circle, and approximately a one-quarter slice of the circle had been removed. \r\n   the object would appear like a diamond at certain points, and appear to retract into a smaller size, and appear more distant, then, suddenly, it would expand into a larger shape, and appear to be closer. the object, (when i would zoom in on it), would appear to glow and pulsate, (somewhat like a heartbeat). the surface also appeared to have several patterns and shapes like craters, mountain ranges, and various other patterns. the color, (most of the time), looked like it was a huge chunk of plaster, (but with various shapes and patterns on its surface.\r\n   there also appeared to be a green outline around the object. i also observed what appeared to be a black or blue object that passed in front of it. at one point, (for about two minutes), another object appeared into the frame of my camcorder. it appeared to be a bright, orange color, and appeared as if it was another type of shape of which i could not identify.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

night around 9:30. at first i just felt like looking up to see if there was anything going on because i heard a soft noise. i looked up to my right and i saw this triangle shaped figure. i tried to tell myself that it was a plane. and i said to myself, \"what is that?\" out loud and my customer heard me. he tried to see what i was looking at and i told him , and tried to tell myself, that it was just a plane or helicopter. i noticed it though, because i have always been into ufo's and conspiracy theories. but i still tried to not think of it as a ufo because it would have been crazy. people would have thought i was crazy. it happened not too fast but i could not have gotten my phone to take a photo because it would have been gone. the object had three bright lights. the top was a solid white, the bottom right was a solid blue, and the bottom left was a flashing white light. the object was moving too fast to be a plane or a helicopter and also flying way too low to be either as well. so i couldn't help myself and say it was definitely a ufo. i honestly felt so shocked and astonished, and i still am. i told my sister and my boyfriend and they listened, they didn't believe me. i know what i saw and i am so stunned. i have seen many before but not this close, not this bright, and definitely not in front of customers. i lost sight of the object when it went over the building. i

my operating position on the afternoon of saturday, 10 may 2017.  my second flight i was facing eastward operating  my drone within the confines of the parking lot of bay point marina, norfolk virginia.  it was breezy which required dipping the drone often to keep it close .  i brought it down changed the battery then took off again only to end up in a tree.  after retrieving the quadcopter i then moved my operating position to the center of the parking lot facing south.  after launching again, a really sharp looking light blue bell jeranger  helicopter came hauling ass eastward over pretty lake and stopped directly in front of me adjacent to bay point marina.  i thought perhaps i had been sited by norfolk international airport as their flight path is about a 3/4 mile away.  i brought the drone down immediately because the jetranger pilot tripped his cyclic hard left/fwd accelerating in a tight arc directly over my position scaring the crap out of me.  i quickly grabbed my quadcopter and hopped in my truck and went home.  \r\n\r\n    the following day i transferred the video filed onto my computer for review.    when i watched the second drone flight video i noted an anomaly at top rh corner at time signature  01:07.  the drone then does one spin and dip and at time signature 01:18 - 01:20 the black sphere clearly appears almost directly over and above where i was sitting on the tailgate of my truck.  i never heard or saw the sphere hovering behind me . based of the proximity go the houses below and the spheres hovering position i would estimate it to be approximately 3.5 to 4 foot in diameter.\r\n\r\n    it was at that moment i realized  that i was not the reason the jetranger overflew me flying my cheap little plastic quadcopter.  i hypothesize that due the proximity and size of that the orf faa radar operator picked the object on his screen and dispatched the  helicopter to investigate.  \r\n\r\n  i sure wish i had seen the hovering sphere with my own two eyes but having it on video as poor a quality that it is, is still very interesting.  the third flight video show the helicopters pursuit of the sphere.   i would sure like to find that pilot and ask him a few questions.  it appeared to be a civilian helicopter as i saw only the n—— number painted on the aft fuselage and no other markings.\r\n\r\n    these are all the details i can

clouds but it only had this perfect shape, no bits sticking out and no pattern or markings. as i spotted it, it was in motion from the start (this thing was huge!) it flew in a straight line over my head, i shot from my chair to see it flying some more and when it hit blue sky it completely disappeared only to reappear when it was under the cover (but not in) another cloud far in the distance??

mounted on the bottom in a empty parking lot at bay point marina where my girlfriend resides at a condominium a block away.  after retrieving my quadcopter from a tree i continued for a second flight.  it was breezy and which required occasionally dipping  the quad to stay within the lot boundary.  once again i lost control and had to retrieve my new flying hobby out of a tree and commenced my third flight when i was startled by an approaching helicopter flying at a pretty good clip straight ofer pretty lake.  i stopped adjacent to fly location on the other side of bay point marina.  it was a really sharp looking bell jet ranger with light blue paint scheme.  i got scared thinking i may have done something wrong and quickly brought my quad down to the parking lot as the helicopter jammed the cyclic forward and left in a arcing left hand turn which brought him directly over me.  i grabbed my quadcopter and controler and quickly placed them in my truck and drove to my girls house on mooring dr.  \r\n    the next day i downloaded the videos from the quadcopter cam and reviewed the footage and was shocked to find that from the first position i selected to fly over by a stone wall was a black sphere hovering over the houses directly behind me.  the attached video picked it up on several frames however the quality is not great but it was a  large solid object hovering over the fourth and 5th home on 30th bay.  the first frame appearance is time signature 01:07.  the quad does one spin and a dip and the sphere appears to second at time signature signature 01:21 to 01:22.\r\n   i then realized that that blue jet ranger helicopter wasn't looking for me.  it was here because this area is close to norfolk international airports flight path and that was most likely the it's origin.  also a point of interest nearby is the us navy special warfare amphibious base directly across the water.  the second attached video contains a few frames of the helicopter hauling butt over me probably in pursuit the the sphere.\r\n\r\n  this is everything i can gather from the events of that day and time.  pretty interesting.  i sure wish i had seen it with my own eyes too but this is still significant knowing that it was likely picked up on radar and a helicopter was dispatched to check it out.","distance":"101-500
