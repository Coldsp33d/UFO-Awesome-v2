contributor (me) wishes to remain anonymous.  i used to work as a reporter at a canadian news outlet in the 1990's.  one day (probably around october 1995) i was working in the newsroom when a man came in and asked to speak to a reporter.  the man identified himself as ken suominen of windsor, ontario.  he stated that he had recently experienced a ufo encounter and asked if anyone else had reported the same event.  i told him that to the best of my knowledge no one else had.  he then handed me a detailed handwritten description of the event and requested that i file a news report to see if anyone else saw what he saw.  i told him i would read his account and contact him if i required more information.  he then left my office.\r\n\r\ni have no specific memory of mr suominen but i had not met him before or since.  i did not write down his address or phone number at the time we spoke, which would lead me to believe he may have been reluctant to provide this information.  or perhaps he did not have a permanent address or telephone number.  i do recall thinking he seemed sincere about his claim at the time.  however i was not willing to approach my assignment editor to do anything with his story.\r\n\r\nthe pages he gave me were copied on a \"thermal roll\" fax machine and stapled together at the upper-left.  i placed them in a \"curiosity file\" and forgot about them.  somehow over 15 years and several career changes the \"curiosity file\" made its way to a box of old papers at my home, which i recently went through while preparing for an upcoming move.  i have heard about your organization and your website and i thought you might find this useful.\r\n\r\nmr suominen's written account is provided as a scanned .Pdf attachment, which i hope will upload correctly.  again, i do not wish to be associated with this report or contacted by your organization in any way.  i have nothing more to add.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20129,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.2564582,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10252009-0014","longitude":-83.0043355,"occurred":773910000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1256537125000,"summary":"Contributor

aircraft, but at the speed it was flying at that height made me remark to my passenger to look also. i slowed to a stop and we both observed that the object was not an airplane but a long, dart like object with a bright, almost led like, white light at each end. it flew in a straight line for what i estimate was 1/2 of a mile, about 1/4 mile away at no more than 300 ft. altitude. i estimated the speed to be over 300 mph. i had the window down and could hear no noise from yhe object.\r\ni am a retired police officer and have received training in speed estimation for use with speeding radar citations. the object then either disappeared entirely, or made an immediate 90 degree turn to the north and accelerated very rapidly out of sight. i thought i saw a diminishing light to the north

anything so bright that could turn the night into day.  looked up and we saw a white maybe a bit bluish fireball heading from east to west at about a 45 degree arc (not at a straight 45 degree angle but kind of curved) it was way slower than a meteor, i would say it took 30 to 45 seconds to fall all the way to the ground. it was  in between the size of a quarter and a half dollar from my viewpoint, so it was much larger than a meteor.\r\n\r\nthis happened back in 96', i had never really thought of it as a ufo before but i was watching some youtube videos and it made me think about the

dark out. through the trees ahead of me on the left i saw some red and white lights. at first i thought it was a plane, but as i got closer i realized the lights were in the same place; i was actually getting closer to them, and they were quite low, just over the trees. i then thought it was a tower of some sort, although i know there is no tower in that area...It is all residential and quite wooded.  i came upon a place where the trees thinned and i could see the lights more clearly. there was no traffic, so i stopped my car in the middle of the road and just stared at it. i remember getting a very strong nervous feeling in my stomach, i almost felt queasy, thinking to myself \"what the heck am i looking at??\"  \r\n\r\nafter doing some calculations later when i got home, i'm estimating that it was about 300 feet away from me, just above the trees.  it was not moving at all.  it had flashing lights, white and red, and a bit of blue; my recollection is there was only one blue light and the rest were white and red. all were blinking, but were not placed in any particular configuration. i was unable to determine the shape of the object; it was quite dark and the lights provided no illumination, but the impression i got was that it was round, but more like a short cylinder. i would estimate that it was about 5 times bigger than a car.  there was no noise.\r\n\r\ni watched it for about 30 seconds before i suddenly thought to take a photo with my phone but before i could get it, i saw the object start moving very slowly to the west--away from me.  that freaked me out, because i think maybe in the back of my mind i was still believing it to be some sort of tower.  the lights remained in the same position, meaning that the object didn't spin around as far as i could tell.  then a car came up behind me and i had to start moving. \r\n\r\ni continued to look to my left and could still see the object intermittently through the trees, moving away from me. at the end of farm to market, i turned left onto route 164, then right onto cornwall hill road and drove to the top of the hill and pulled into the subdivision there, facing west.  i could still see the lights, but by now they were quite small and it looked like an airplane from this distance. it appeared to still be moving quite slowly, and quite low...Way too low for an airplane. it disappeared over a distant hill.  the route it was moving would have taken it directly over the interstate in carmel, so i checked  to see if there had been any ufo reports, but i didn't see any. this happened on 10/21/09 between approx. 6:50 and 7:00 pm.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

go outside- i heard her lift the dog door and go out; but seconds later i heard her bark and run back inside.\r\nour bedroom and dining area -where the back porch door/dog door is- are side by side.So 20ft. away -no problem with hearing her at all.\r\nshe came and got back into bed but kept looking at the window - i figured she was seeing the reflection of the tv in the glass-which often gets her attention.\r\nthe one blind closest to me was closed- the other blind was turned open.This is a huge double window facing our back yard. she finally put her head down and slept.The other two dogs slept on,they never stirred.\r\n\r\nabout 15 minutes later - i heard a rumbling,deep sound in the distance.It caught my attention enough that i paused the movie to better listen.It was coming from what seemed to be the north/north west -and getting closer and louder. the sound was much like the rumble of air conditioning when it kicks on.Our unit was not on. it was a very cool and comfortable night -\r\ni listened and noticed it getting closer and closer -and thinking that is no plane or helicopter -so what the hell is it ??\r\ni was surrounded by the dogs and couldnt easily get out of bed and the sound was starting to scare me!\r\nso i just laid there and listened to it go over.It was all sound; there was no vibration of the house. it sounded like it was flying low. our backyard faces south -the airports are to the immediate east and south/east of where we live.I watched through the blind that was open,which would give me a view of it heading anywhere east- to see if i could see it pass -try to see the identifying lights- but it must have stayed on a direct course south -or south/west -because i never saw it head the other direction. i just listened to it go away.\r\n\r\ne-mail

for what must be the same object that myself and two close friends watched for close to two hours. we were in the area of 27th avenue just west of us1 and it was very early in the morning. the sky was beginning to get light. we actually had the amazing luck to all be looking up and i was asking my two friends if they knew what a particular constellation  was (orion's belt) when one of the brightest meteors i've ever seen went directly over head. i have a place in upstate ny and have long been a fan of watching for shooting stars. it is so dark and clear up there that you can see satellites track across the sky all night long. i know the difference between meteors and satellites, stars vs. planets, i have a telescope and have take classes on astronomy when i was younger. \r\n\r\ni was really amazed at the brightness of the meteor... it really had lit up the sky all around it, despite the light pollution of the city all around us. not to mention that i've never really seen any that bright, and it was incredibly fortunate that all three of us had just happened to be looking in the right direction at the right time. needless to say, we all started skygazing at that point, and even saw two or three more shooting stars. we were on the top balcony on the 6th floor, and the balcony faces west and has a north/south orientation. while looking around and trying to figure out what some of the other brighter objects we could see were, we noticed a brightly flickering object high in the sky south and slightly east of our position. the more we looked at it, the more it became undeniable that it was stationary, and that it was changing colors and the light coming off of it was really bright. the owner of the apartment had gone to bed, but he keeps a really nice set of binoculars in the living room which we all began taking turns looking thru.\r\n\r\nthere was no doubt that the object was within the our atmosphere and not a celestial body. you could see the lights changing colors with the naked eye, but with the binoculars it was amazing. we all knew right away the person writing the other report for miami early in the morning of the 24th was seeing the same thing. we saw planes come and go, saw another two or three fainter shooting stars... but that object sat hovering in the same spot for close to two hours. it looked like it was at high altitude, somewhere over the keys. it was hard to gauge the distance, but it looked like it was maybe 10,000 feet up, and maybe 10 miles to the south. we watched it until we simply couldn't stay awake any longer.\r\n\r\ni am writing this report at the same apartment, came back to watch the dolphins game, and thats when they told me they found the other report. hence, i felt compelled to write this. i've seen three other strange objects in my life, and even wrote in about one we saw in brazil back in 2004 i believe. if i can stick around late enough tonight, i plan to establish that that same light is not still there, thus establishing that it indeed was an object hovering there and not just a star or planet we were seeing. \r\n\r\ni wish we'd had any idea of who we could call when that was happening, would have been nice to get the news with a better camera catching it on video. \r\n\r\njk ","distance":"Over One

how far it was away but it appeared to be some distance. the craft contained 5 or 6 visible lights wich were circular in shape, they appeared to me to be the size of large vehichles or perhaps 15 yards in diameter. it also had some lights near the top of it that didn't go out, they appeared to be rectangular, or like grates or something. the length of this thing seemed to be very long, like 100 feet, or close to that. however with the fact that there are trees in the yard and none were visible, only this craft, it may have been very much closer and it may have been a smaller craft, though it still seemed so large to me. it was black or very dark gray and black, you could make out the shape and such from the flashing of the very bright lights. the spectrum of the lights was nothing like a regular bulb, and it did not project the light but it seemed to stay close with the craft only illuminating enough of the object to make out a basic outline.   \r\n\r\nthese lights flashed in strange patterns they would flash in a sucession with one illuminating for a moment, then it would fade out and then the next would light up, and so on down the line, it also did other patterns of alternate blinkings. i sat there in great fear watching this craft. \r\n\r\ni got up off the couch and tried to wake my mom up, \"mom there's a ship outside!!!\" \"get up\". i tried and tried to get her to awaken telling her repeatedly, but she could not be roused from her sleep. she told me to go to sleep and that i was going to scare my sister, from her mostly sleeping state. i really wanted my mom to see this, or someone. but, i didn't want to wake my sister up and scare her. so i went and lay back down on the couch and watched this craft for a long time. at some point durring watching it i drifted off to sleep, though i do not know how i could do such a thing, it was almost as though the lights hypnotized me or put me in a trance.\r\n\r\ni specificaly remember taking mental pictures with my mind, that i would never forget this thing or what it looked like. to this day it is one of the most amazing things i have ever seen. i very much wished that our family would have had our video camera availabe, as a tape of this thing would blow any known footage of a ufo out the water. this thing was so strange and not normal. it could have been military, but i believe it was celestial, it was my first encounter with such a thing, though i have made other sightings since, far less up close, ones in the air.\r\n\r\ni imediately knew this thing to be a ufo though i did not observe it flying, i would like to go back to the area, and look at the trees nearby to try and see what distance it might have been away, it seems that it was farther away and very very large, but there were some trees in our yard, it may be it was very much closer and that it was actually on the hillside, in the side yard of the house. the one thing that stands out to me most of all were those very large circular lights and the trance like patterns that they flashed, it was calming and unerving at the same time.\r\n\r\ni did not feel like i was in terror, but i did feel aprehensive, were these aliens i wondered. i knew little on the subject, but had heard some adults talk about such things in the past. this thing truly amazed me, and had an affect on the rest of my life. it would not be the last time i seen objects. most recently in the past 2 years, i have had several alien contact experiences that occured in lucid dreams. when these started to occur memories immediately shifted to this first major event that happened when i was very young, might it be that i have been taken on such craft before? i would not doubt it. it seems that i have established a rapport with unknown entities. at this point i'm trying to figure out what's going on with me, and what everything means. theres so much i'd like to share, but this of course is not the place.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of the object due to falling asleep, i don't remember having any dreams that night, just falling asleep at some point and then waking up the next day fully remembering the event. my mother has since passed away, and my sister never saw the object. so i am the lone witness of the event. i did tell most all the adults my mom, her friends, and my sister about my experience. \r\n\r\nvery amazing experience, have been highly interested in ufo's ever since. this was not a hallucination, it was not a made up story, this is 100% accurate. \r\n\r\ni moved from that house about a year later, i no longer live in alleghany county virginia, i now live in central va.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

was sept 1993 not sure of the day in the afternoon. i walked into the gas station/store and everyone froze  and the music cut out there was one customer one guy behind the counter. i walked to the counter about 10 ft away and then the guy moved the music started and i payed for some gas. it was extremely weird but i didn't say anything to the counter guy i walked to my girlfriends truck and she started yelling at me becuase i was in side for a half an hour but it was only a minute. as i was pumping gas i threw some trash in a trash can a black car pulled up with tinted window four door don't know the make or model but a fairly new probably american car the window rolled down and there was 2 or 3 people in the car all in black suits with sunglasses on the one next to window said \"what are you doing here?\" and \"whats your name\" this caught me off guard and i thought for a second and then i said i don't have to tell you anything and the guy smiled and said good answer then rolled up the window and drove away i turned back to look at the car it was totally gone. there was nothing around for miles and the rodes were empty it totally disappeared i was out where its just empty flat fields. that was it i just always thought that was weird i never knew who to tell this too i read about mibs like 2 years later and then of course that movie came out. but it happened i thought possibly it was the secret service because of some of the stuff i was involved in back then but anyway thats all i have to say. the only other thing was on the dash board was a lot of electronic devices like a cop car or something thats why i thought it was feds or something like that. never saw a ufo. if you have any questions email me i prefer to be

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On october 24th at 608 pm gregory h. 13 yrs and alex l. also 13 were outside their rural neighborhood playing in the street. they both noticed a star -like sphere at an etimated distance of 2-3 miles and an estimated altitude of 15 k feet. it was rising from the horizon as planes would from the local houston ic airport but made a complete and immediate 90 degree turn in midflight that appeared to be traveling much faster than commercial aircraft and drew the attention of both teenagers.\r\n\r\nat this time 3 other identical objects also rose from the horizon and matched altitude with the original object.At this time alex went inside his home to get a pair of high quality binoculars.During the 2-3 minutes he was doing this greg said the original object shifted into a diamond and the others remained spherical.Greg also noticed what appeared to be a helicopter 3-5 miles in the distance approaching the objects at a much slower rate.When alex returned from getting the binoculars he also noticed the diamond shape.\r\n\r\nboth report that the other 3 objects begin to move towards the west at a much faster rate than other aircraft normally seen in the area.They both also report that the object shifted into a triangle at this time all the while remaining blue luminescent. as alex looke through the binoculars at the object both witnesses state the object seemed to simply disappear before the helicopter could reach the area. no other helicopters or craft were seen in the 2 hours following the incident.Also strangely enough air traffic in the area seemed unusually slow following this incident.\r\n\r\nwe live only 12 miles from hou ic airport and both kids are used to seeing air traffic in the area.I am the father of greg h. and what gives this sighting credibility to me is that both children are honor roll gifted and talented program children who have proven their honesty and character many times.Greg is in the rotc program and knows basic astronomy and has a good knowledge of the types of local aircraft with above avg time spent observing the sky.Alex is in the scouts and also has some astronomy experience and is quite observant. i was an investigator for the state of texas for several years and took notes within an hour of the sighting from both witnesses independently and their stories were completely consistent in such a way i dont believe they could have recalled a false story with such consistently had it not been true.Both kids are of above average character and intelligence and this carries weight with me because about 3 years ago i saw something like this with another witness in almost the same area and never reported it because i am in a security related field and worried about reprecussions. one final interesting note is we live less than 2 miles from the famous cash ufo encounter in dayton,tx where multiple witnesses saw several ufos and trailing black copters which were caught on film. several very credible and honest people that i personally know were intimidated by \"govt types\" after the original cash incident.\r\n\r\nwhile i am a firm believer in ufos both children appear to be slightly skeptical yet open minded.Both state that the objects were absolutely not wind powered craft and appeared to move many times faster than any aircraft they have ever seen.They both claim to have felt excited as the craft began to change shape and make 90 degree turns that apparently seemed to prove they were non terrestrial.They also felt disbelief and doubt at what they were seeing and seemed quite puzzled and curious when questioned.As a trained investigator i can tell you that the level of consistency from the seperated witnesses was so high that i can only assume it was true and pretty damn accurate.Keep an eye on these skys because we have had an increase in the last few years.We have since bought a digital camera and dvr to attempt to catch activity on film.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":20112,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.9178985,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10242009-0014","longitude":-95.0536112,"occurred":1256432880000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,

twinkle flash light was different......I grabbed my binoculars and was stunt by what i was seeing, it seemed as if the lights were shining diamonds (despite the fact that they were at a distance) i have never seen so brightness coming from a flying artifact.  i couldn't tell how many lights the ufo had but they seemed white and blue*.  after 30 minutes of looking at the object it all of a sudden started moving slowly, and at one point it ascended so fast that it disappear from my view and thought to myself that it was over. shortly after about a few seconds the flying object reappear again (like in the same altitude, at least from my visual calculation) in the same area were initially it was hovering.   again, this continue until 3:00am were the object kept moving slowly as if it was hovering and at times it just seemed as if it was flying at a high altitude due to how smaller the flash light or object seemed to fade and then it would descend.  i had visual contact of the object from 1:54am until 3:00am, i couldn't stay up but the flashing light object stay hovering in the same area......... also a helicopter with a bright light was flying at the time of the incident (at a

already.  but they appeared to be just above the horizon of the mountains.  so, i took a cue from dr. steven greer, and i tried to mentally communicate with them. after a few seconds the second craft sped up and was in then in front of the other, but maintained their course to the west, south west.  i ran inside to get my girlfriend.  but becuase of their blinking lights she dismissed them as planes.  but i didnt hear any jet or helicopter noise at all.  and their blinking lights were not even similar.  if they were military, they should blink in the same repetition. but each of the crafts blinking appeared to be totally random. i know that cseti is having their conference in rio rico right now.  so i didnt want to interfere.  i hope that was the direction that they were heading. lets hope cseti gets come good evidence

the local baseball field at around 9:00 pm in kingston, ma.  this night was clear but dark, not much of a moon. i remember this because i had dared my friend to walk across to the playground as it was unlit and two baseball fields away and it was, a dark night.  the area is nestled in the woods surrounded by trees and sparsely populated. as we started walking we got about to the pitchers mound when the sky in front of us flashed red. the flash was not like a lingering flash; it was extremely quick and seemed to span the horizon. my friend said��� did you see that���.  it was very strange, and the color was vivid. i remember at the time thinking i hope it���s not the nuclear power plant exploding; the plant is about 15 miles down the coast.   as we continued walking east, i noticed an object about 20��� on the horizon coming from our 11:00 position.  my father fly���s as a hobby as i do know and i had grown up around airplanes.  it had red, blue and green lights in a circular pattern that were spinning. it looked like nothing i had ever seen. as we watched it come closer it was at our 9:00 position; it seemed to be flying along the railroad tracks when it suddenly stopped.  i new it was not a helicopter because it made no sound and no aircraft looked like this. at this time it began coming toward us.  i would say around 10-15 mph maybe. i could see it looked like two saucers facing each other with the lights spinning in between. it seemed to have no color that i recall. it was about 100 feet away from us when it stopped and a beam of light hit the ground.  the beam had a sort of bright bluish tinge. the beam of light started to scan the ground, up back left and right. i told my friend not to move or it will see us. the object was around 100 feet high or so, it was hard to tell and it could have been 20 to 40 feet in diameter. the beam then went off and the object proceeded to move about 50 feet to our right and did the same thing with the beam, again the beam went off. now the object moved closer, to just above our heads and again the light hit within 10 or 15 feet away and i heard my friend start to whimper.  the light came to a point so close that i felt i could touch it, then nothing the light was gone the object was gone with no sound. we never saw it leave although i was looking at the light on the ground moving around because i didn���t want it to see us so i never actually saw it vanish, but it was gone in a second.  we both ran to my house five minutes away and told my younger brother and mother what happened.  naturally my brother wanted to go see so we went back.  the three of us walked down a steep hill, it���s a road about 200 yards to the ball field.  once there we saw nothing then we only walked out maybe 25 feet and the beam landed right in front of us. we all ran, my brother got to the top of the hill first and i heard a car skidding down the road, it nearly hit him as he ran across the street. my father, a policeman in our town drove me down in the police car, but we saw nothing. i later found out the police station had got a call from someone else who also saw it. we never saw any sign of it ever again.  my friend and i went down to the ball field many nights after that just hoping to see it again, but i can never forget what i saw.","distance":"101-500

decided to take a break to have a drink and cigarette. as i stepped outside something in the sky immediately caught my eye. it was a ball of light that seemed to be changing colour. i could see it very clearly and knew right away that it wasn't a plane or helicopter, so i ran inside and grabbed my mobile phone to film it. it was moving slowly initially but then seemed to speed up and quickly flew off into the distance. \r\n\r\n i've never seen anything like this before and was baffled, i've always been a bit sceptical of ufo sighting reports and have no real interest in looking for ufo's or anything like that, this was a first and i found it quite an eerie experience. i don't know what it was, i'm not claiming it to be 'paranormal' i'm just baffled and pleased i managed to get some footage. make of it what you will, or maybe someone can explain it?\r\n\r\n i'm sure there are much better reports and footage than mine but hopefully people will find it interesting and i thought i'd better report it to someone because it definitely wasn't something you would expect to see in the sky whilst standing outside your house in the city!\r\n\r\n\r\n i've tried sending the video using the
