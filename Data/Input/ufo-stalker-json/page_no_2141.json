friend a few minutes later. most friends believed it was a star, and one thought it was a plane. but it was extraordinarily bright. then it appeared to be moving at an upward diagonal, and before we knew it, it was approaching in our direction and was immediately above us just one minute after thinking it was a star. it was like it changed shapes and lights formations the whole way and so first appeared to be a plane approaching with bright white lights, then a triangle with blue and red lights on the tips, and then an airplane as it was right above us, i meant directly above us. and it couldn't have been more than 700 feet above the ground but strangely enough, if we weren't outside i doubt we would have ever heard it because it was sooo quiet, and the sound was like that of a super sonic jet, only muffled as it flew relatively slow above us. and a strange thing about the aircraft as if flew directly above us was that it had three very bright lights in a triangle formation on the front of the cockpit and never before have i seen that on an airplane. i am convinced that this is an alien craft that can not only change its shape but also make sounds to resemble an airplane. at the time of the event, all the things i described happened so fast that i my mind couldn't comprehend what was happening, so i simply had to tell myself that it had to be an airplane. i was not scared much but definitely excitedm confused and mystified. i just watched it fly off in the shape of some kind of long airplane until it went out of my sight behind the

no dowt in my mind what i saw and a few family members saw. here is what we witnessed...\r\n i was out side with my new dog it was between 10:30-11:30pm monday october 19 2009,when it started. i was sitting down smoking when i had noticed a loud jet fly by which i thought was strange, then i see a police hellicopter going over my house.(i think 2 hellicopters went by) dogs are barking and it was just weird to see that. i made a joke about \"war of the worlds\" and as i am standing out in the middle of my yard i see this thing going across the sky. it looked like a sattlelight moving. but then the direction changed, it started swaying back and forth like a rocking motion. there is nothing we have that can do that. i yelled for my brother to come out and see. i pointed to what i was looking at and then he had told me did you see it just stop and take off. i told him that i did and as we were looking he couldn't believe what he was witnessing. i couldn't either! it would zoom fast, sway. so basically it went over my house and changed it direction kind of like a u-turn. we ran out in my front yard and continued to watch it untill we couldn't see it no more. we discussed what we just saw and new that it wasn't something of our own. i was so amazed i went back out to my backyard and started to look up again. in my mind i was expecting something to be on the news because of all of the activity in the sky. right above my house there is this star formation that has 3 stars across then below it in the middle was another one. kind of like an arrow shape. the bottom one was moving like it was playing around. almost like a swimming motion. it looked like a star that was moving to where it wasnt noticable to where if you looked up you would say \"what's that in the sky\" it seemed to be out of the atmasphere. (i can explain it much better talking to someone, it's hard to write what i saw so bare with me) it was going in circles and it would go in one direction and then instantly change direction. it was moving to where it was staying in the star formation. it did this for about an hour or more. i notice that when it moved i can almost see tracers from the light coming from it. it would go right to left up and down and like i said circle motions. it seemed to me that it was watching something or waiting. i don't know if it had to do with that jet in the sky or not but it was something else? i can say that i have seen a ufo. i know what sattlelights look like, i know what a plane looks like and this wasnt one of those. we know what we saw and i could put my hand on the bible and swear to what i saw. i really thought there was going to be other witnesses to this or on the news, that's how postive i was. it was an experiece of a life time! i didn't know what to do about this. but everyone keeps telling me to write you guys. so that's where i am right now. all i know is what i saw and it needed to be shared with you guys. just to let you know i am not the kind of person who fabricates things like this. i do believe that we are not alone in this universe. if you have any questions about what i told you please feel free to write me back. i can maybe then explain to you what i saw and maybe then you can maybe tell me what i saw or if there was anyone else that had seen the same thing. like i said this note is a little confusing. sorry! thank you for your time to read my letter.\r\nbye the way i didn't get any vidio or pictures cause i don't have a good camera that can take pictures in the night sky especially stars. i am dissapointed that i couldn't, all i have is in memory. thanks again!\r\nsara churney","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":20097,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.5407962,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232009-0013","longitude":-122.3826133,"occurred":1256022000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oregon","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1256361661000,"summary":"Star like, moving fast, changing direction instantly, swaying back and forth.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Troutdale, Oregon","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:176644"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Westmorland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at my front yard with a family member and a friend. i was facing east when i observed bright object in the sky headed west at extremely high speed from an eastern direction. as the object was headed west it was making sudden stops and it would disappear. the object would then reappear and continue traveling west very fast leaving behind what appeared to be a streak of light. while the object continued to travel west it disappeared for approximately 10 seconds. the object then reappeared and began to travel south. while the object was traveling south it would make sudden stops disappear and reappear and continue south leaving behind a streak of light.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":20094,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0372674,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232009-0010","longitude":-115.6213817,"occurred":1254671400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1256342617000,"summary":"Glowing object","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":19,"locationName":"Westmorland, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:176645"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Brawley","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Source by my neighbor. he told me he was outside his front yard looking towards the east along with other eye witnesses. he then observed a fire ball headed west coming form the east at very high speed. my neighbor said he thought it was a meteor at first. he then said it made an immidiate stop for about 30 seconds and then began to head south in a low rate of speed. he then said all of a sudden it streaked away towards the south leaving behind a light trail. my neighbor says the obeject was approx 1000ft in the air.\r\n \r\ni just want to advise mufon that i have filed this report with the knowledge of the eye witness. since i am very interested in this subject i took it upon my self to report this sighting. i know it is hear-say and also know how important it is to the ufo community to have credable witnesses. i believe my neighbor will come forward if you have any questions.

like to report an incident , which occurred 30 years ago ��� somewhere in october / november 1978. \r\ntogether with a friend , we were traveling by car in the east part of france heading to strasbourg. it was already night , might be 10pm or 11pm , 50-60 miles south of strasbourg on a motorway and still we had to drive 1hour  to our destination. we have been tiered already , so we decided to stop on a park place for to take a little rest and to eat a snack. it was a starlit night and while resting , we looked to the starry-sky. \r\nafter a while , we recognized that out of the star-scene in the west of the starry-sky a bright lighting star dissolved out from the star-alliance and started to move. that light point ( approx. 30��� above the horizon ), moved , even jumped , very rapidly up and down , left and right , zigzag and perpendicular. we tried somehow to estimate / scale the magnitude of those movements by stretching or arm forward for to see how many fingers the movement ranged. so far i remember , the movement from the light-point covered approx. the width of 2-3 fingers on a stretched arm , crossed in less than a second. \r\non the beginning from that ���light-show��� in the sky , we thought that an airplane or helicopter might be responsible for this , but we rejected this idea because: 1st  the movement started from a fixed-position and 2nd the profile of movements was so incredible ��� rapidly in speed and rapidly in changing of move-directions.\r\nfrom our location we could not estimate how far away from us that light-point was , as according our first impression , that light-point appeared just as a bright star. \r\nwe could not hear any noise , either . \r\n\r\nthe light-point movements went on for some time and after a while we decided not to look further to that \"light-show\" in the sky and not to bother ourselves with things we cannot explain. \r\nsomehow deep impressed and confused we left the scene and continued to drive towards to strasbourg. we promised ourselves not tell anyone about that event , because we thought that nobody will believe us and we feared of ridicule. \r\n\r\n\r\nhowever , 30 years past , but the memory on that night is for me still present  as it was yesterday.\r\ni am reporting that case now , because internet does provide now the opportunity to shear those experiences with an

witnessed. my friend i were standing in my driveway smoking cigarettes when we both noticed a bright flash in the sky like a camera flash, it didnt really come from any specific point but more of a general area of the night sky, as soon as the flash subsided (which only lasted for a split second) a large streak appeared horizontaly (it appeared all at once, not extending) where the flash came from. i would have thought it was a meteor or comet except for the fact that the streak was not moving, it appeared and stayed completely still, it was incredibly bright and large, probably about the size of orions belt. the streak was a white light but it looked like it had a blueish gray tint around it, it was visible for approximatly 20seconds then it slowly started to fade away until there was nothing there. i have tried to figure out what this was to great lengths only to find there is no explanation for such a celestial occurence. the flash was white and the streak following it was a simple thick line stretching across the night sky, i can not stress enough the fact that the streak did not move, it appeared all at once and stayed where it was until it faded away. to be honest it looked alot like when spacecraft in science fiction movies make a \"jump to hyperspace\", bright flash, followed by a still trail of light, i know that sounds ridiculous but i just want to describe it to the best of my ability. please if you have heard of anything else like this let me know, i cant let this go unnoticed, its been killing me, i have never seen anything like it before in my

run before we got settled in. the sky was clear and all the stars were visible. i started to notice a star moving straight for a short period of time pretty fast then suddenly it started going diaginal but at the same speed, so i just figured it was a satilite. \r\n  the next 2 days went by and i thought nothing of it, until i was letting the dog out again as usual, at about the same time as 2 days prior and i had noticed that the moon was full and huge that night and as i was looking at it from my front steps i noticed a similar star except only this time it was lower or at least seemed lower, and was moving slower than last time. so this time i yelled into the door way for my girlfriend and brother to come out to see what it was that i had been seeing, they came out and i pointed it out to them in which they both saw it, my brother got bored quick and said it was nothing and went back into the house but my girlfriend stayed. we watched it moving from the left of the sky to the right and then suddenly as we were both seeing this star moving it just stopped and did not move at all, now satailites don\"t do that! \"that i know of\". i called my mother instantly to tell her what we were witnessing and as i was talking to her, about ten minutes went by and it was still there in the same spot. i hung up with my mother and started looking at this star with my girl for a little longer, (now we kept looking because its not everyday stars just stop moving), anyway the star was in the same position for about 15 minutes in tottal when the craziest thing i had ever witnessed had happened. the star got really bright almost as if it was about to become a bigger star then just shot straight up and was gone. the thing is when it happened i felt weird almost like being in a fun house, my brain was not concepting what had just happened almost not believing even though it was staring right in the face. my girlfriend and i looked at each other at the same exact time after it had dissapeared and yes we both saw the same exact star????  ever since i have been obsessed with finding out some truth to everything. i feel mankind can handle change. i know its a little late for me to be talking about it now but at that time i would not have known who to tell.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

tonight i saw something strange, and its been a long time since i have seen anything strange in the sky.\r\n\r\ni see a bright orange light emerge from behind the trees. it had two whit lights on its sides, maybe on the fuselage or something. as i watch this  fly over it does something that surprised me. suddenly it's lights turn off for about a second, and it lights back up again but with a whole new light patten that looks similar to any regular airplane flying over. \r\n\r\ni go in the house to tell my husband what i was, of course he looks at me like i am a freak. i go back outside to watch some more and to my surprise i see another orange light (same as the other) coming over the trees and this time i yell for my husband, and of course he doesn't come. then can you believe it....The orange light gos out and all i see is a red and white blinking light in the distance. this time it seemed to change much sooner then the other one. the first one was closer when the light went out and then changed. \r\n\r\ni live in the country, and i see planes fly over all the time, this is something i never see.\r\n\r\nis this normal behavior of and airplane. can an airplane change its light pattern in the middle of a flight and is what i described seem normal??\r\n\r\ncould this have been a ufo???","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

telephone looking up when i noticed them. i frequently see objects in the sky so am aware when i spot an unusual object.\r\n\r\nthe objects were flying in a straight line and passed over in less than a minute. i mentioned what i was seeing to the person on the other end of the telephone call and mentioned that i was running indoors to get the binoculars. i gave them a play by play. the object went
