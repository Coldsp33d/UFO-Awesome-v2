it's moving through the cloud cover (est. 5-10k feet) at an amazin speed\". my next thouht was \" a jet can't move that fast across the sky, regardless of the relatively low altitude\". when the light winked out completely after 2 to three observed seconds, i felt strongly it was no jet- besides, i relized there was no jet noise. ifit were at a higher than my perceived altitude, i may not have been able to hear it over the ambient city noise, but that would have raised its relative speed to an even higher level, convincing me more that it wasn't a jet. my next thought was \"that may have been the  end of life of a meteoror boloid (is that what a glowing burning rock is called?). the color of the speeding licht was white and bluish, possibly accounted for if it was penetrating the cloud cover. there was no yellow flame appearance, or explosion at the end- it just winked out.","distance":"Over One

that morning.  around 1 am the meteors began falling more frequently then out of no where a huge bright light just showed up behind a tree.  we clearly saw red lights and blue lights alternating with white.  it allmost was pulsating and alternating with the blue and red light.  the red was on the top right corner and the blue was on the bottom left and the white light was constant and pulsing.  it kept moving and disappearing behind the tree and i mention it to my friend \"what is that\" and from that point we stared at it constantly.  he joked around and said oooo its a ufo and i said i wont get freaked out until it gets above the tree line.  i went through every possible scenerio to figured out what this thing was.  5 min approx. after he joked around and i said something about the tree line it did a direct vertical jump and went straight up in to the middle of the sky and began to hover and it was clearly dancing around and going up and down then left then right then down again and it kept getting dimmer and dimmer and over the course of 4 hours it moved from the tree light up in between 2 stars and stayed there even when the stars moved in the turning of the night going into morning the object clearly made it a point to stay within these two stars. then around 4 30 am i went to check on it again and i stayed out there prob 15 minutes and the object began to get very bright and then just disappeared within seconds. i am going to sit outside again tonight to see if i can shed some more light on this but i went through every possible explanation and none of them make sense. i called my mother at 3 in the morning asking her what she thought it could be because she used to be in the air force and i didnt know if it was a type of plane, weather balloon, satelite, helicopter, tower, but nothing could explain it i hope someone can help. please help me shed some light on this i am truely in shock right now. there are no photos of the object because it was to dark to take a good picture but i tried and they all came out

smoking before getting ready for work. i heard the sound of two jet fighters taking off from fat, this is normal and i can always see them during the day or their lights at night because the wind blows from the west here and that's how the air traffic works out of fat, most of the time. i was looking for the air national guard fighters and didn't see them like i always do.\r\n\r\ni looked down for a sec and something caught my eye. i looked back up and saw something huge, dark as the night sky, moving from north to the south, three red lights forming a triangle with one flashing light on the left side. it was moving slow and there was sound like a jet engine. this thing was huge. i can't say how huge or high it was because it's hard to guess. if i tried to guess, i'd say it was 200 ft and the size of a football field.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw it, i thought it was normal air traffic because everything out of fat flys over me. however, all the air traffic that does fly over me has their landing or take off, cabin lights on. this thing was blacked out except for those red lights.\r\n\r\ni was frightened by this because i didn't know what it was. i told my wife and she said she'd saw the same thing a year ago. after i saw this i only told two people for fear of what people might think or say.\r\n\r\ni lost sight of it as it passed over me traveling south and over my roof.\r\n\r\ni think it was something we have because of this. aliens don't need anti-collision lights or jet engines. i would think.\r\n\r\nso here's your report...It still freaked me

the fire because i have to wake up in 5 hours to go bow hunting. as we were walking up my back driveway, my friend dan looked up above the trees and saw the 5 lights. he then told my friend cal and he looked up and pretty much freaked out. this is when we all looked up and were amazed at what we were looking at. we then ran out to the front of my house and went across the street to get a better look. the first thing we did was trying to analyze what we were looking at. my first thought was that they were balloons attached to a line moving back and fourth, but this didnt seem right because the spheres stayed in a perfectly straight line. we watch if for about a half hour just moving left to right. i couldnt tell how far it was off the ground and we compared it to the surrounding stars and it was multiple times bright than any star in the sky. after a while i went inside and my friends stayed outside to watch the ufo. one of my friends brad called some of his friends to come see what we were looking at. they were about 5 minutes from my house on english and frost avenue when the object few from its position across the lake which looked from my house looked like it was above st. paul. so after being in the same area moving right to left the object few slowly towards us over the lake and over my house and as this was happening my friend who was on the phone with his friends told them to pull over and look up because they were on frost avenue. they got out and saw the 5 lights go over them stop, move really fast in one direction and take off. they were freaked out because they thought we were lieing and they were not ready to see what they saw. i have never seen anything like this in my life and i have tired to look up other sightings or pictures of what we saw and i cant find anything. we tried to take pictures with phones and cameras but nothing showed up. we really needed a video camera but we did record the audio of everyone when the object flew over. my friend cal has it recorded on his phone so i couldnt put it on here but hopefully you found this intersting and please contact me if you can help me figure out what we

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am a law enforcement officer in the yakima valley with four years of full-time experience and six years prior reserve law enforcement experience. i was working the grave yard shift which started at 2200 until 0600 hours late last year in 2008 in approx. november or maybe december. i was on routine patrol that night which was fairly quiet, checking the city cemetery which is west of toppenish, wa. off of elmwood rd. which is off of fort. rd.  the time was approx. 0330 or 0400 hours and i was at the far west end of the cemetery looking into the empty field which is adjacent to the west. beyond the field you can clearly see the house lights through out the county and some of the town lights from white swan, wa. which is approx. 30 miles away at the end of fort. rd.  \r\n\r\nthe land is mostly flat and runs into the toppenish ridge to the south.  the toppenish ridge starts south of toppenish and reaches passed white swan and almost to mt. adams.  there is a road that goes from white swan to the top of the ridge called signal peak rd. but turns into a yakama indian nation rd. and isn't listed on any map.  at the top of the ridge at end of that yin road, is a guard house with a guard who will not let you through unless you're a yin member.  as far as i know, the guard house closes at night around 2000 hours and the gate into the closed area is locked for the night. i had to explain this for my report to make sense.  \r\n\r\nas i drove slowly i could see the twinkling of the house lights in the distance and not paying much attention to anything in particular.  i was about to take a left turn when i noticed what appeared to be old fashioned police or firefighter lights coming from the top of the ridge just south of white swan approx. 30 miles away.  i found this to be strange since most everyone in the valley has either strobe lights or led lights for their emergency vehicles.  the toppenish fd has old rotating lights but it never goes passed the casino on fort rd. \r\n\r\ni watched the lights which were on top of the ridge and i couldn't understand why an emergency vehicle would be on top of the ridge which is rough terrain, dirt, and some trees.  as i looked at the lights, i thought it would be best if i shut my car lights off and shut off my computer screen in my car to get a better look.  when i did, waited a few minutes for my eyes to adjust to the night and when they did, the lights on the ridge looked exactly like emergency lights on a fire truck rotating but from a long distance away.  \r\n\r\ni knew at the time, that the only fire call in the lower valley was in grandview for an accident but there wasn't anything going on in the white swan area.  i watched the lights for approx. 10 minutes and they would elevate and descend from the ridge.  as i sat and watched, a second one appeared and now i was seeing two.  the color of the lights were red and white and looked exactly like the lights on a fire truck.  the lights were bright and were clearly visible to me while i sat in my car.  \r\n\r\ni exited my patrol car and i stood in the dark and watched these two pair of lights move up and down and side ways which appeared to be doing some sort of pattern.  as i stood there, i figured i would notify my dispatcher and ask her if she knew of any calls on the ridge.  i got back into my car and got on my computer and i send her an instant message telling her i was seeing some strange lights on the ridge and asked her if she knew of any emergency calls in that area.  the dispatcher stated she didn't know and would inquire.  she later told me the only call the fd was handling was an accident as i stated above.  \r\n\r\ni then im'd another officer on duty who is a ten year veteran law enforcement officer and told him what i was seeing and asked him to come to the cemetery.  when he arrived, we both watched the lights on the ridge for approx. 10 when a third set of lights appeared.  we both stood in the dark and watched these lights for approx. another 10 or 15 minutes.  we could not figure out who or what they were and we just stood there and watched.  they would appear and disappear over the ridge and would some times hover over each other.  some times two sets would go off and one would stay and the one would go off and the other two re-appear.  it was an incredible display which went on for a while. at one point, i tried to record them with my in car video called coban but the lights were too far away and coban could not get a clear enough picture. \r\n\r\nwhen our shift ended, the day shift officer was briefed on what we saw and of course he made fun of us and laughed.  but he later told me he went out to the cemetery and saw the same thing we did on the ridge.  he told us they were probably fire trucks doing some sort of exercise on the ridge and i responded by asking him \" when was the last time you heard of volunteer firefighters doing exercises on the top of a ridge with rough terrain and no roads?\" he didn't respond and told me he didn't know what they were.  \r\n\r\na few months later around june of this year, i was here at home surfing the internet and decided to look up town marshal history for the yakima valley.  to my amazement, i ran across a web site that read, \"toppenish ridge lights\"  i read through the investigation which was very detailed and had some photographs taken at the time of the incident.  i was even more shocked to learn that the lights were seen in 1972 and describes exactly how we saw it that night.  \r\n\r\nthis concludes my report and i have nothing further to add, nor do i have anything to gain or lose by typing this.  what i saw and what my fellow officers saw is still a mystery to us and i want answers to the puzzle. i think mufon should look into the matter and conduct interviews of the people who live in the white swan area along signal peak rd. and fort rd. \r\n\r\nbelow is the link that will take you to the web site i found.\r\nhttp://www.Sacred-texts.Com/ufo/yak2.Htm \r\n\r\nthis statement was typed to the best of knowledge and truthfully.  i have worked in law enforcement and nuclear security for the past ten years and i believe i am a very credible witness to what i saw.  i have taken five polygraph tests and passed them all throughout my career to include four psychological exams.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

sphere as it existed the object and drifted down out of the object. then the white object changed it shape to an inverted tear drop and then both red and white objects faded away. time was about 7:30.

intersecting lights on 570 and 2461, my husband saw a white light that contained some orange color to it, appear and then disappear.  it was low to the ground, around maybe 1-2 miles up.  it was difficult to determine the distance it was from us.  it did not move, only appeared bright and then disapeared.  he did not know what the object was, he only knew it was like a star, but much brighter.  he asked me if i saw the bright light, and i told him i did not.  i asked him if it was a reflection or an airplane, and he said no.  after it disappeared, we both continued to look for it, but it did not reappear at that time.  i did eventually see an airplane's lights at a much farther and higher distance and mentioned this to him, and we decided it could have been a plane.   \r\n\r\nwe arrived home and unloaded shopping bags from our vehicle.  i got some books from inside the house and left again.  i drove up my driveway, turned to the southwest and the light appeared very brightly, only once, and again disappeared.  to me, this light was a light orange color.  it did not appear white to me.  i called my husband, who had stayed behind at our home, on my cell phone and told him i saw his light.  i continued driving to the lamancha entrance and stopped, looking in the same direction the orange light had been.  at this time, i do not recall if i saw it again or not and my husband does not recall if i mentioned seeing it a second time.\r\n\r\ni turned right on 570 heading northeast, followed a curve to the east, southeast, to cross the dam.  at this time, my husband was still on the phone with me and he went outside to look more.  as we were talking, 3 orange lights appeared in the east-southeast direction and were lined up horizontally.  they remained on for 1-2 seconds and disappeared.  we both saw this at the same time.  this was closer to just before 2100, approximately 2050-2055.  after we saw this, i became very excited, but sort of nervous because i did not know what this was.  my husband just told me to deliver the books and get back home.  as i drove to deliver the books, we remained on the phone together talking because i was nervous driving alone, and we saw airplane lights that seemed to be watching the area where these lights were.  when i got to my destination, i watched momentarily and noticed fast-moving airplane lights and another airplane or helicopter below the 2 fast-moving ones.  all of them appeared to be circling the area where the lights had been.
