pulling into the driveway of our home with my parents in owasco ny about 10 pm my father said hey look at that thing, as we all got out of the car this breathtaking craft just came over are house the size of i would say a home depot of today. it was right over are heads roughly 100 ft. it looked   like  a ship out of star wars it did not make a  sound as it just drifted or floated over are heads it had some white lights but not that big in fact very small i did not see any other colored lights the thing that was so amazing is how large it was and it did not make any noise was totally silent the truth of the matter is if i had a video camera  i don't think i could of used it due to the facti was in such shock seeing this thing. the whole sighting took from 3-5 minutes before it went out of sight.\r\nthis was a once in a lifetime experience that has stayed with me my whole life i was 16 then.I read a lot about triangle craft. what  i can say is that the object i saw was going 10 to 20 mph no noise what so ever triangle in shape, 2 football fields large and black and nothing we have today is anything like this no aura ,stealth, human made anything this was from out of this world or

(35.8308 96.14518) for a clear night of observing.  with many years of experience in observing under our belts we were needless to say quite qualified to identify most anything that we would see.  between approximately 6:40 ��� 7:00 p.M. one of the members noticed something off in the west and queried as to what it may happen to be.  first and foremost it was bright, more or less as bright as jupiter, yet setting about ten to twelve degrees above the horizon, due west.  at our first sighting most of us thought that it was nothing more than an airliner reflecting sunlight from the setting sun but that determination was tossed aside shortly there after.  if it had been what we first thought it was it would���ve lost it���s size and brightness fairly quick as it shifted positions in relation to the sun while in flight. but, it continued to maintain its position, did not move in any direction - vertically, horizontally.  if by some chance it were a celestial body it would follow a gradual celestial track that all of us would have noticed in a few minutes.  again, it didn���t move, remained in one position, which eliminated the possibility of it being a celestial body that none of us were unlikely familiar with.  that alone became puzzling since the obvious ��� venus, mercury ��� are now tracking in the morning eastern sky, not the evening western sky.  with that we continued to watch it as one of the guys used his 10x50 binoculars to get a better view.  what was seen initially brought to mind that it may perhaps be a high altitude research balloon but the more we watched it and as it maintained its position that thought was tossed quickly also. from the beginning it remained in one position, never moved.  balloons, of any type, will not remain in one specific position be they weather balloons, high altitude research balloons or otherwise. \r\nbut as we watched it more closely it was very surprising as to the manner in which it morphed into various shapes and sizes.  its brightness would vary some but that was easily seen as being caused by the low-lying clouds on the horizon.  as we commonly call it ��� it was ���sitting in the soup���.  when they would move in front of it the objects brightness would dim some.  otherwise it would maintain its brightness.  that was easily seen via binocular observations.  the longer we watched it the more curious we all became and with that growing curiosity we quickly set two telescopes onto it.  two different sized telescopes were used, one, celestron 11��� schimdt-cassegrain telescope and a smaller orion 4.5��� dobsonian telescope.  between the two we could pull it in for a much closer look in a very inquisitive effort to determine just what it actually was.  charts and web sites were checked also to make sure we weren���t simply forgetting perhaps one event that may explain what we were now seeing.  nothing could be found.  the celestron was using a 40mm eyepiece for a much wider field of view whereas the smaller orion had a 15mm eyepiece to pull it in much closer.  through the orion one could easily see what appeared right off as a bell shape.  the same was viewed in the other also.  but as mentioned before it morphed into what was clearly seen and could be interpreted as the same basic outline of the shuttle that anyone would see as it flies over.  again, the same basic shape as to what you would see looking up at the bottom of it. that distinctive shape was easily recognized. at the rear of it you could see what looked like bluish green waves that would both come and go from the main rear line of the object. nowhere else was this color and wave seen, just at the rear.  the objects color was a combination of the just mentioned bluish green at the rear to a lighter orange yellow up through the main body and then into red orange, much more intense, than any of the other colors at the top or perhaps, from appearance at that time, leading edge.  none of us had ever seen a color distribution of this sort before.  especially on either the shuttle or any other normal day-to-day satellites. from our position/location it appeared to be hovering over either bristow, ok or possibly even oklahoma city. there was no attempt by any of us then to determine its specific distance or altitude from us. the same applies to its actual size. visually, it appeared very similar to the size of jupiter. other than that comparison we honestly don���t know either its distance or specific altitude. it remained in the same position for approximately 40 minutes and never moved.  close to 8 p.M. we started to notice what appeared to be a ring of lights that was rotating around the bottom portion. the lights were seen in the same location that the bluish green colored waves were at. several of us noticed this while looking at it through the telescopes. needless to say this was surprising to us all. this carried on for one to two minutes and then suddenly the object started to move. the movement was slow at the beginning but increased very rapidly. i had my eye glued to the 40mm eyepiece when this began and once it started i could not move.  within two seconds it had totally disappeared from open visual sight but i still had a lock on it in the eyepiece. fast, very fast it moved from dead center in the eyepiece field of view upwards and at the same time was getting smaller and smaller as it flew away. two or three seconds later it was totally gone from view in either of the telescopes. the speed that it moved was without question way beyond anything that we have knowledge of or is publicly known to be in our military.  at the rate it flew away would make a sr-71 blackbird look very old and slow. could it have possibly been a new experimental aircraft? possibly yes but if so what was something such as that doing in oklahoma?  most generally new experimental, top-secret aircraft of that type are being tested at either edwards afb or area 51, not oklahoma.  in a nutshell, we will never know.  \r\nit was unidentifiable, it was in the air and flew away and it most certainly was an object of some unknown kind/type. from this alone it could be justifiably categorized as a ufo. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

using an eyepiece that gives me 49 power.\r\n as i looked at the object which i thought was jupiter  there was what i thought one of the moons of jupiter the smaller object started moving back and

light on the horizon. it seemed to be around 90degrees off the normal flight path of jets going past my parent���s house. i see them all the time and always look out for them. i could not see any craft, just a star like light in the sky. it was on a perfectly straight trajectory and it seemed to be doing a very high speed.\r\nwhen most planes go past my parent���s house, to the front and one side, the planes are leaving the airport and gaining altitude, to the back of the house, the planes are descending and preparing for their final approach.\r\nthe light that i saw did not seem to be slowing or changing its height. it was completely silent. i waited for it to get closer and fully expected for it to be a small plane with its landing lights on. as it got closer, the glare from the landing lights would lessen and i should be able to see the smaller lights on the wingtip and fuselage. at this point i was pretty sure it was a small military jet as it would explain the speed and lack of sound thus far.\r\nas the light neared and i could see it from a 20 degree angle, the glare had not lessened. i realised that the light could not be from landing lights as they are directional. i watched one of the only hazy clouds in the sky as the light went beneath it. i thought it might have been a satellite reflecting light or omitting it. when i saw it pass under the cloud and realised it was obviously not a plane, helicopter or anything else i could identify, i pulled my mobile phone out and tried to record, but it didn���t work. i ran in the house and got my panasonic camera out. i turned on automatic stabilisation, this makes the light zip around the screen as i try and hold the camera steady. i tried to film with only a small zoom, but could not see it clear enough, so i made a new recording at 12x zoom as i filmed it continue on its trajectory until it disappears over the roof tops.\r\nduring the entire time that i saw the star like light in the sky i heard no sound of any type of engine, or any other sound at all that i thought was coming from this light. i could not make out any outline of an object behind or within the light. i did not see any other lights close to it or any silhouette. i viewed this object from two separate angles as it passed almost overhead. at all times the light stayed the same colour, shape, intensity, speed and trajectory. i watched it rise from one horizon and disappear over the other horizon and the whole thing lasted about 10-15 minutes.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

able to easily spot satellites and my girl friend who is 34 can clearly make them out too.\r\n  i was watching a small plane cross the sky just north of john wayne air port. when watching the plane i noticed movement catch my eye. then i saw it. it traveled below the plane at high speed it was only visible because of the three points of light on the tips and the way that it blocked out the stars as a solid object would. i may have been only 30 feet long or so.\r\nit traversed the whole sky in less than two seconds so excess of twenty miles per second or 1200mph. it also did one zig zag manuver that was impossible for a human to withstand. the forces of traveling from straight to horizontal then straight at that speed would kill you. so the pilot must somehow be immune to inertia. it looks like it moves with the thoughts of the pilot. it made no sound and left no trail. i am very sure about what i saw. i feel like it must have somehow been related to the sighting in sad diego that occured at exactly the same time. the craft was definitely in a hurry to get somewhere. what also strikes me as strange was it seemed like as soon as i was tracking it. was when it zig zagged and then accelerated out of sight.\r\n approximately 10 seconds after the object went over. two helicopters flew across the area from the south in a wide circle scanning with spottlights all over in the air

about fifteen seconds of this mist coming out the bottom of this thing, theonly thing you could see was the top two thirds of the sphere sticking out the top of this fog.After another ten seconds of this fog coming out the bottom of this sphere it covered the sphere completely. at that very second these very bright spot lights shot out the bottom of this sphere. it looked like it ha very bright shiny glitter inside the beam of light that wentthe whole way down to the ground. after sitting there for about forty five seconds with thespot light shing down, the spotlight and the sphere blinked out at the exact same time. the only thing left was the blue mist. we thought clouds rolled in because we couldnt see any stars. the color of the fog was the exact same color as the night time sky. the fog took about twenty seconds to dissapate. when it was gone, it was like nothing was ever there.I am stll amazed with what happened.My wife is a non beleiver and keeps saying it was an airplane or helicopter or blimp. iforgot to mention that there was no sound at all. it was completely silent. i still sit out back hoping it reappears.My wife thinks im crazy, but i think i am lucky to have experience this sighting.","distance":"101-500

\r\n\r\ni took several pictures over five minutes, as it changed into a round oval shape with a massive glowing light emitting from it. after about a minute it seemed lose its beautiful glow and became more dull. i then noticed a small cloud or gray object that seemed to be staying near it and at times going away from it. then suddenly, they both were gone. i could no longer find either of them in the sky. before they faded my husband reminded me to zoom back out and to attempt to get photos of something nearby to contrast the object.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home i viewed the pictures, blew them up and contrasted them with various pictures taken of planes at a similar distance. you can always see the wing and or tail, this object was mainly light, no tail or wing.

lived in bayview tx. the housing complex we lived at was used by federal employees as my father was with the border patrol and worked at the immigration base just down the road. 26.150245,-97.35035 will put you exactly where i was standing at the time. we moved out of the base in 74 so this had to have happened sometime in the fall or early winter in 73 as i wasn't allowed out very late being i was only about 6 but it was after dusk and was dark - there were many stars out and i was going to a friends just a few houses over when i had that feeling you get that stands all the hair on your neck and arms up and i froze and spun around and there it was.\r\n\r\na huge triangle as big as a football field floating straight toward me from the west, it was over the open field across the street and moving very slow like it was just floating totally silent.  i was transfixed and scared to run inside to get someone because i was amazed and afraid to look away so i stood there and watched it float straight at and over me and once i was looking straight up at it i spun around on the spot and watched it until it went out of site straight toward the bay and gulf. the whole time couldn't have been more than about 10 minutes or so but seemed much longer.  this thing was also very low only a few hundred feet up if even that high.  i could not make out any markings or distinct features from the underside other than to say it appeared matte black, no reflections from street lamps or anything of the sort, the only way i know it was solid was that it blotted out a good portion of the stars.\r\n\r\nthis thing had 3 bright white lights on each tip and one yellow/amber/orange light that was not dead center but between the center and the back 2 lights kind of if it were a chevron. the night was clear and all the stars were out and it blotted them from the sky so i know it was actually a triangle shape but the amber light was not centered but toward the rear halfway from center to the back.  the amber light was the one that was so strange as it was constantly shifting like looking at a mirage or heat from the road ahead, just shifted with all 3 colors never really yellow orange or amber but all and none at the same time just constantly shifting.  \r\n\r\ni have never seen another one again but after talking to my sister she tells me that all the kids(older) used to lay out in the open field in the block and watch them, she tells me she never saw one down low but always up fairly high and that they would just disappear and she never could point it out to someone else because they were gone to fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

not heard of until today, sunday october 18th). \r\n\r\nat approximately 9:30 pm mt saturday october 17th, mountain time (rough estimate), as i was walking in the alley behind my house just north of mile high stadium in denver, i happened to look up at the sky to see three points of light, arranged roughly in an equilateral triangle formation (if viewed from an oblique angle), moving extremely rapidly across the sky, in approximately the north to south direction. the object(s) were roughly west of me. the speed seemed very high, at least compared to what i expect of a commercial airliner traveling at high altitude at cruising speed or low altitude on approach to dia. i would estimate that a typical military fighter would have to be traveling very fast and very low to have the same apparent velocity that the three points of light had (having had experience with low military aircraft flyovers of bronco���s games at mile high).\r\n\r\nit is hard to estimate how long the three points were visible to me, but i would guess perhaps 3-5 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe sky was extremely clear that night, with no visible clouds.\r\n \r\nin terms of size and intensity the points of light appeared very similar to stars, but without any oscillation in the apparent magnitude (i.E., they did not twinkle). the points had the brightness of a middle bright star, i.E., they were very obvious, but there were both brighter and dimmer stars visible in the sky. the lights were definitely white, not red or green or blinking white as you'd expect from commercial or general aviation aircraft. there was no point of light in the middle of the triangle. \r\n \r\nthe three points seemed to be arranged in an equilateral triangle formation for the majority of the time that they were visible to me, however, as they receded into the distance to the south, the triangle formation collapsed. i cannot say for sure if the orientation of the objects was equilateral or not given the uncertainty of the object's orientation with respect to my viewing position on the ground. it is also impossible to tell if the three points were on the same object, or if they were three separate objects. the collapse of their apparent triangle orientation could have either been a single object rotating or three separate objects changing their position with respect to each other. i listened intently for any sound, expecting to hear jet engines, but there was no audible sounds at all above the ambient noise of the highway (i-25, a couple hundred yards to the east of my position).\r\n\r\nthe object(s) were certainly not satellites, whose slow constant motion across the sky i am very familiar with.\r\n\r\nit is impossible for me to give an estimate of the size of the object or the distance between the points of light as there was no frame of reference available. if i assume that it was a single object, i could not discern any outline to the object as it appeared black against a black sky.\r\n\r\nsearching for more information on this, i found the 1990 brussels video, and what i saw over denver looked very much like that. the primary difference between my sighting and the brussels video is that the object(s) that i saw were not moving slowly or hovering. when i saw it, it was moving very fast in a straight line until it was out of sight.\r\n \r\ni have seen other rare phenomena in the sky, including a soviet rocket engine entering the atmosphere, appearing as a large fireball, and another large fireball that i assumed was a large meteor, but this was absolutely nothing like that. these were three discrete points of light traveling rapidly and in synchronized formation, without trails, without sound.\r\n\r\npersonally, i am an extremely skeptical individual and if i were to hear a similar report, i would normally attribute it to either a meteorological phenomenon, or to simple psychological misinterpretation of the scene, which is very common given our brain's inherent pattern seeking mechanisms that lead us to find patterns where none really exist. however, in this case, neither of those explanations is plausible to me. this is one of the strangest things i have ever seen in the night sky, and i can honestly say that i have no idea what it was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
