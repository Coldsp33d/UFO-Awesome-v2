seeing the light/object 5 of those days. everyday but one, i saw this while i was driving home from work at approximately between 6:15-6:20pm. \r\n\r\noct. 8th - as i was driving home, something caught my eye that was straight ahead of me in the distance that was high in the sky and maybe between 5-10 miles away. when i first saw it i thought it was just a plane reflecting the sun, but then once it all of a sudden shone very brightly and looked more like an artificially powered light, i knew that couldn't be the case. it first looked like a single circular very bright white light that then changed to 2 lights with a small space between them, and then back to a single light. it appeared to be stationary and i could not make out a frame,like maybe that of a plane. i can't be sure but it may've had the appearance of a small dark-colored tail. when it's light got very bright, it seemed to overwhelm and cover whatever other mass may've been attached to it. this was all i could see before i had to make a left turn and lost sight of it completely. i wasn't far from home at this point but didn't see the object once i got there which was actually a little closer to where i had actually seen the object in the sky.\r\n\r\nlater that same night just after 8pm or so, i went out on my balcony and looked in the same direction of the sky i'd seen the object earlier and saw a very bright whitish flickering star. after about a minute or so, i left the balcony to go eat some dinner and when i went back out to look again in about 20 minutes or so, it was gone. the sky was perfectly clear this night.\r\n\r\noct. 12th - while driving home at the same time, i saw the strange sphere of light again high in the sky straight ahead of me in the distance. this time it only seemed to stay as one light before it seemed to fade and then move behind a big cloud. \r\n\r\noct. 13th - today i got home a little earlier from work but took my dog out for a walk around the same time i'd seen the object previously. i kept looking up intermittently to see if i'd catch something, and at one point when i looked up, i saw what looked like an object the shape of a circle with the light filling the circle and 2 small upward sloping extensions on either side of it. i only saw it for a few seconds before it disappeared behind a cloud but it appeared to be bobbing and weaving erractically as opposed to in a straight line like a plane. i never saw it again after that.\r\n\r\noct. 14th - on my way home from work i saw the object again when i'd reached the street where i live. it was more or less in the same position in the sky but seemed to be much bigger than before. it's mass looked dark-colored and was in the shape of cylinder or cone before it flared up in an intense, brilliant white light, almost like a burst of energy like it had done on the other days but this was the absolute brightest i'd had ever seen it so far. then the light faded back down and then i couldn't see anymore because i had to make a turn and then it was blocked by the neighboring building and i didn't see it when i took my dog out a few minutes later either. \r\n\r\noct. 15 - it was very cloudy on the way home today so i didn't think i would see anything today, but through one of the very small breaks in the clouds that was more or less in the same spot i'd seen the object before, i saw what looked like a very small dark colored ball or sphere that just came to one of the cloud openings, but that never completely emerged out from the clouds. i didn't see it for more than a few seconds before i had to make another turn. i didn't see it again. \r\n\r\ni know this all probably sounds crazy and i can hardly believe it myself. \r\nkeep in mind that everytime i've seen it, it's always been between 6:15-6:20pm. i live in south miami and don't know if maybe what i was seeing is actually out over the everglades since it always seems to be in the western part of the sky. i'd be interested in knowing if anyone else has seen this thing. could someone here tell me if they know what this is? i've never seen swamp gas but could it just be something like that? are there any experiments going on with new aircraft by the government in this area? i'd would very much like to hear back from someone about this. in the meantime i'll continue to watch the skies.

out of the courner of my right eye i noticed a star, it was flashing red fascits .It looked like it was stationed over the gulf at about a 35 degree angle w-nw  it appeared to be red, scarlet or saphire colored with black between the fascits. like a star with multipal points on it. in the distance i also cought a glimpse of a smaller star reflecting the same blinking frequency as the one nearest to me. i almost had the feeling that the star was reflecting the anger,anoyance i had felt towards my pups at that moment.

it is very low and too close to cliffs and mountain tops? therefore consider that it is a descending eagle shrunk wings dive towards their prey. i told her friend: \"see: eagle!\" and why the \"eagle\"? maybe i noticed the magnitude. i have often seen similar scenes in the region - and magpie-legged hawks in flight like flying to the prey, but not to this magnitude. then i changed my mind, an eagle in these places i've ever seen. it is therefore correct: \"it must be a hawk!\" \r\n      the site continued to fly and i expect that in a moment or two should start to drop rapidly \"said\". but he continued to fly on its horizontal axis. rather than fly hut and academica. already aware that the object is not a bird, the duration of flying requires the use of wings, which did not see -

better look. i got my telescope and went into the backyard and i kept an eye on it as i was setting up the scope. i heard my neighbor in his backyard so i drew his attention to it as well. as we watched it, we saw a smaller light leave the main object. from our vantage point, it seemed to drop several feet below the main object and then stop. then both objects completely faded out and

traveling south on highway 93 in nevada about 50 miles south of wells, nevada and had stopped at what is called lages junction. there were 20 or so vehicles stopped at a rest area. everyone was outside watching what appeared to be orange lights just above the horizon looking east toward utah. he told me that there were both single and double lights and that they were perfectly stationary. they would appear for a few seconds and then fade to nothing. he said at the time that his young son had gotten scared so they continued their trip to ely. at work we discussed the sighting for awhile and of course the usual kidding took place among the members of our crew. \r\ni am a truck driver at a open pit copper mine in ruth, nevada just east of ely, nevada. on the night of 6 october at about 9:00 pm i was traveling east onto one of the dumps where we are dumping waste rock and i was looking directly east over the schell creek range of mountains. as i looked i saw what appeared to be a very bright star just a few degrees above the horizon. i see the eastern sky at night on a regular basis and was surprised to see such a bright star at that time. i no sooner had the thought than the star blossomed into a sparkling orange sphere and brightened considerably. the size of the sphere was about half the size of a full moon in the sky. it lasted for about 5 or 6 seconds and then faded to nothing. all of the equipment on the minesite is equiped with radios and i immediately called the co-worker who had observed the event on the highway and i described what i had seen and he said that it was exactly what he had observed. i am an ex army officer and served in combat arms units in the army. i have seen just about every piece of ordinance that the military detonates and i have never seen anything like this. it was perfectly stationary. it was definitely not a flare. in fact it did not appear to be an explosive at all. it seemed to be carefully directed as it changed size and as it faded it did not act as though it was being extinguished but rather turned down like a dimming switch for a household light. i have no logical explanation for what this was. this area of nevada is very close to many military and energy department test sites including area 51 and the sites the military has in utah. i do not know but suspect that it could be connected to these facilities. other than that i cannot come up with any explanation. it was by far the strangest thing i have ever witnessed and it left me with questions i will never be able to answer. to put it in one word, \"wow\". i was not the only witness on my crew. an equipment operator who was working on the dump saw the phenomenon twice and another truck driver also witnessed the event once. i must tell you that one of my co-workers says it was the \"great pumpkin\" which is quite funny but this was a real event for which i have no explanation. i took a digital camera with a telescopic lens for the preceeding night shifts but did not observe it again but plan to continue taking the camera for a few more night shifts.

have had experiences with what i believe were alien spacecraft. first time back in 1965 or 1966 when i was about 4 or 5 years old living in buffalo ny. a space craft silently hovered over my house. it was dark outside and what i saw was a saucer shaped craft about 100 feet in diameter with colored flashing lights that circled around the circumference of the craft. it made no sound. i was looking out the front window and it disappeared over the house. i told my mother but she ignored me. probably thought it was my imagination which was not the case. 43 years later i can still see the image of what i saw in the sky. while i was living there i also recall one time a sharp jolting pain in the back of my neck while i was playing outside and then i don't recall much after that. another time recently about 7 years ago i was messing around on the internet searching for area 51 when i came across a website area51.Com. it was totally blacked out. i thought this was strange. i was playing with the mouse and left clicked and dragged the curser across the screen and that opened up a screen that said if you are an alien to email us at the web address. so i played along and emailed them telling them i am an alien on earth and i am stranded. i never got a reply but about a month later i saw a blinking light over my house high in the sky that was about the size of a planet. it was not moving or making a sound. my video cameras battery was dead and by the time i set up the electric cord it was gone. it was there about 10 minutes and i wasted too much time just looking at it. i saw another strange thing over the airport around this same time period when there appeared to be a thick black line in the sky that got smaller and closed out after a few minutes. i reported this to the air force or some government agency and never heard another thing. it wasn't long later that my wife filed for a divorce. she totally changed who she used to be. it was like she didn't even know me anymore and i didn't kow here. my son has reported that strange things have occurred inside the house including a ball of light that floats around near the ceiling. i saw this myself one time when i it woke me as i was sleeping on the couch. he would also tell me he saw something looking into his bedroom window late at night. one time there was snow on the ground and he said to me dad look at those footprints. the footprints were non human and looked to be on two feet. not an animal i was familiar with. i wanted to pass these experiences along to you to see if these are similar to anyone else who has reported anything similar in the same time frame and location. also i wanted to know how i can become an investigator and if you can send me information. thanks.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

time as i was running a little late. after getting home i let the cat out and stood to lok over the bay from the houseboat we live on looking back over mill valley from just east of marin city.\r\n\r\ni'm very familiar with satellites, planes, planets, starts, meteorites etc being an engineer who spends a lot of time researching in that field and i consider my observing skills and 20:10 vision to be strong. i can regularly observe satellites tracking regular orbital paths when they appear horizon to horizon for example. i have observed booster rockets re-enter and burn their fuel off spectacularly, launch vehicles take payloads into orbit, and many shooting stars and regular astronomical objects do their thing. i am also highly skeptical of \"ufo\" sightings and believe 99% of them are non events.\r\n\r\nanyhow, as usual  was looking out over mill valley to watch the stars rise - the sun had already set and dusk was turning to night. the sky was particularly clear and there was no fog tonight. this piece of sky from sausalito to tiburon in particular has quite a lot of plane activity coming into oakland and sfo - so i often take a look at it from the front deck.\r\n\r\ntonight i happened to notice a very faint star like object or possible a satellite tracking from south to north in a straight path. i would put it at about the same magnitude as a star observable at magnitude 0.5 to 1 - faint yet quite visible and constant.\r\n\r\nfrom my observing position it was at about a 20-23 degree elevation from the true horizon, whilst facing i was directly nw.\r\n\r\nat first nothing was unusual - it was however moving slowly and was not flashing, nor had any trace of faa lights like a plane in the distance. i stuck with it, and after it had moved perhaps 5-6 degrees across the s to n sky for about 30-40 seconds it turned to begin heading roughly ene from my observing position.\r\n\r\nthis is where it got very interesting - and hence this report. as it complete the turn from the s->n->ene it began accelerating - accelerating like nothing i had ever witnessed before. in my estimation this object crossed about 80 degrees of arc accelerating from very slow as above to covering this range in about 3 seconds, all the time accelerating.\r\n\r\nfor those interested, the path where the object tracked the longest path was between ursa major and leo minor, closer to ursa major.\r\n\r\ni was stunned - but then as i continuously observed it - eyes glued to the object it turn again - this time in a an incredible smooth arc - all the time accelerating to head w - after which it accelerated out of sight within about 1 second and i could not locate it nor any trail nor otherwise. the speed at which it moved was simply incredible.\r\n\r\nso, here we have what looked like a satellite accelerate radically across a huge degree of arc across the sky in three different directions, make rather drastic turns that were not those one would expect of a natural object like a meteor nor a man made object in orbit,nor multiple co-incidental objects appearing as one - this was a single object making smooth controlled turns.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything quite like it. i did not have my camera, and i doubt if i did i would have had time to set the exposure to capture this in time.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

youtube address seeingufospa and was taken back that this woman lives 40 minutes from my home. she has an open invitation for people to come and help observe these events with her.\r\n  i knew from the beginning she had nothing to hind and i set a date to meet with her. on the evening of september 24th, 2009 we, my girlfriend (sandy) and i arrived in her general area at 7:30 p.M. i followed directions of the location to be by a google earth map location she had shown on her youtube site.\r\n  this area is very rural, hilly, heavily wooded, dark and very quite. without knowing where to start or where to look i decided to start at a golf course i found in her general area. sandy and i walked around the golf course for a while and found nothing of interest. i decided to leave the golf course and drive around the area for awhile. \r\n  while driving, i called alison about 7:55 and informed her we were in the area and asked her where we should meet. at that same time i passed a car along the road and alison asked if that was me that just passed her. i replied i think so. alison said pull over, there is one directly above you. i pulled over and we jumped out of the car and found alison with her camera in her hand recording a bright, slow moving object 300 feet above us. it is now 8:01 p.M.\r\n  i grabed my camcorder to record this event also, i was so excited i forgot to remove the lens cap and missed most of that event. my first impression was this craft is completely silent and moved in a very slow smooth line. i recall it being an amber/golden glow that pulsed. it continued in what appeared to be a straight line and moved at a slow consistent speed. this sighting lasted 40 seconds or so.\r\n  alison, sandy and myself headed back to the golf course for awhile and found and recorded a golden orb as seen in the attached video. while recording this object it moved slowly and suddenly streaked across the sky to reappeared a mile away. we then headed to a farm field alison knew. we stood and talked for 30 minutes or so and began to see lights that appeared in the trees. they were below the tree tops staying half way between there and the ground. i recorded eight(8) separate objects that evening. while alison recorded other objects from a different location at the farm, i believe there were 12 separate sightings that evening. at the farm lands i found a very bright light in the trees, as i set up to record the light it decreased in size and intensity. this object was located on the next ridge about 1000 feet away. these recordings i took are remarkable. the image shows a round globe, white to golden in surface color with red texture/lines under the surface, with an \"eye\" or round design/object within the lines. this interior structure seems to be looking around. after recording it for 30 seconds or so the interior detail disappeared and there is only a whiteish/golden glow. after recording this glowing object for 15 minutes or so, noticed as i zoom out from the object it appears to pulse. as i zoom back in, the detail once again is present for a time and then disappears. this process went on several times.\r\n  after record that object in the trees i began to notice lights in several different locations. i asked alison if there were any homes located near the lights, she said no. several of these lights seem to turn on at different times and would disappear and suddenly a light would appear in the sky above. several recording made by alison were recorded by me from a different angle/location. my camcorder is an older unit so my tapes are not as good as the high definition ones but they are real.\r\n  some of these objects/craft seem to make a plane like noise although the noise seems to be somewhat off or \"late\". something about them seems unreal. most though are completely silent. i am complete impressed and totally convinced these objects/craft are nothing i have ever seen. alison kruse is completely up front and forth right. her recordings, in my professional opinion, are some of the best evidence i have ever seen. i will personally testify that her recordings and her sightings to be 100% creditable and 100% real.\r\n  there are many more hours of recordings by alison and myself that have not yet been seen. i have returned to record more on september 30th and october 1st 2009. i also have plans to return the evenings of october 18th, 19th and 20th to help alison. i also plan to personally trek into the woods as deeply as possible and record what ever it is we find.\r\n  i can not get the video address to go into the address bar so follow this link.\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=pkmgnnrad4c\r\n
