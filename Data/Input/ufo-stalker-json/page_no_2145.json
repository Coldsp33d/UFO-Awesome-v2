youtube address seeingufospa and was taken back that this woman lives 40 minutes from my home. she has an open invitation for people to come and help observe these events with her.\r\n  i knew from the beginning she had nothing to hind and i set a date to meet with her. on the evening of september 24th, 2009 we, my girlfriend (sandy) and i arrived in her general area at 7:30 p.M. i followed directions of the location to be by a google earth map location she had shown on her youtube site.\r\n  this area is very rural, hilly, heavily wooded, dark and very quite. without knowing where to start or where to look i decided to start at a golf course i found in her general area. sandy and i walked around the golf course for a while and found nothing of interest. i decided to leave the golf course and drive around the area for awhile. \r\n  while driving, i called alison about 7:55 and informed her we were in the area and asked her where we should meet. at that same time i passed a car along the road and alison asked if that was me that just passed her. i replied i think so. alison said pull over, there is one directly above you. i pulled over and we jumped out of the car and found alison with her camera in her hand recording a bright, slow moving object 300 feet above us. it is now 8:01 p.M.\r\n  i grabed my camcorder to record this event also, i was so excited i forgot to remove the lens cap and missed most of that event. my first impression was this craft is completely silent and moved in a very slow smooth line. i recall it being an amber/golden glow that pulsed. it continued in what appeared to be a straight line and moved at a slow consistent speed. this sighting lasted 40 seconds or so.\r\n  alison, sandy and myself headed back to the golf course for awhile and found and recorded a golden orb as seen in the attached video. while recording this object it moved slowly and suddenly streaked across the sky to reappeared a mile away. we then headed to a farm field alison knew. we stood and talked for 30 minutes or so and began to see lights that appeared in the trees. they were below the tree tops staying half way between there and the ground. i recorded eight(8) separate objects that evening. while alison recorded other objects from a different location at the farm, i believe there were 12 separate sightings that evening. at the farm lands i found a very bright light in the trees, as i set up to record the light it decreased in size and intensity. this object was located on the next ridge about 1000 feet away. these recordings i took are remarkable. the image shows a round globe, white to golden in surface color with red texture/lines under the surface, with an \"eye\" or round design/object within the lines. this interior structure seems to be looking around. after recording it for 30 seconds or so the interior detail disappeared and there is only a whiteish/golden glow. after recording this glowing object for 15 minutes or so, noticed as i zoom out from the object it appears to pulse. as i zoom back in, the detail once again is present for a time and then disappears. this process went on several times.\r\n  after record that object in the trees i began to notice lights in several different locations. i asked alison if there were any homes located near the lights, she said no. several of these lights seem to turn on at different times and would disappear and suddenly a light would appear in the sky above. several recording made by alison were recorded by me from a different angle/location. my camcorder is an older unit so my tapes are not as good as the high definition ones but they are real.\r\n  some of these objects/craft seem to make a plane like noise although the noise seems to be somewhat off or \"late\". something about them seems unreal. most though are completely silent. i am complete impressed and totally convinced these objects/craft are nothing i have ever seen. alison kruse is completely up front and forth right. her recordings, in my professional opinion, are some of the best evidence i have ever seen. i will personally testify that her recordings and her sightings to be 100% creditable and 100% real.\r\n  there are many more hours of recordings by alison and myself that have not yet been seen. i have returned to record more on september 30th and october 1st 2009. i also have plans to return the evenings of october 18th, 19th and 20th to help alison. i also plan to personally trek into the woods as deeply as possible and record what ever it is we find.\r\n  i can not get the video address to go into the address bar so follow this link.\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=pkmgnnrad4c\r\n

woke up to go to toilet for a pee,at that time i noticed through the window a pulsuating big bright crimson colour light moving lowly and slowly in straight direction from south east innerwest towards northwest going towards richmond.This kind of light i have never seen before in the sky,it was much bigger than the polar star say twice big and while pusuating it was three four times bigger,as i was inside the house with closed windows i could not hear any sound.I kept looking at it though i was feeling pressure to go to loo,i couldnt hold on and went when i came back it was still going slowly,at that time i checked the time it was 1 35 am approx it has taken full five minutes and i could still see it faintly at a distance and it looked faint orange colour.As my wife was sleeping soundly i didnot wake her up.In my life i have not seen this type of flying light,i am not sure what it was but it was not common and night time there are no low fying aircrafts.After this i kept sitting and looking out but nothing happened for about two hours and then i fell sleep.Itried to report straight away on phone but somehow it got delayed and now i feel i must report it as its not normal what

 after filming many ufos coming out of usual patch of woods in front of house from farm field across the road, caught one shooting a beam of some sort--no sound detected, but my car was next to my tripod running because it was cold.  made vapors or excited molecule action that was visible across tree like it was hot, but inspection of area next day showed no burn marks on ground nor unusual marks on tree. frame by frame of video shows the beam bending as it is seen through the glass of my car's windshield indicating it was not a lens flare.  video of it shot in gen3 nightvision here:  http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=gktwmzljxy0\r\nvideo of ground where shot the next day here:\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=rgf8t_ju8su\r\n\r\noctober 11, 2009:  another ufo rose from woods and started to fly across valley (500-600 feet across), then suddenly lit up really bright like a big golden orb, sun-like in appearance,  traveled like that for a bit, then toned down and started flashing like a plane.  filmed in gen3 nightvision,  you can see the shape changing & morphing as it flew.  silent flying.  video to be posted later (when i get a chance).\r\n\r\noctober 13, 2009:  after another night of seeing multiple orbs descend into the woods then crafts rise from woods on surveillance cam, i decided to try and go closer to see if i could film them hiding in the woods before take off.  went to other side to general forbes trail to dead end by blackthorn golf course edge.  filmed several of them in the sky, then noticed a white blinking light that seemed close to edge of woods.  filmed that then to the right another one back by the cable tv line that runs through woods.  having already explored that in the day, i know it's heavy brush & fallen/cleared trees laying about that's difficult to navigate through without hedge clippers.  the multiple objects seemed sphere like with many lights that constantly changed and seemed to hover slightly.  did not seem to be actually touching the ground.  no sound. smaller ones where seen around the bigger ones.  pitch black, the sound of breaking branches scared me so i moved back to by my car to film & saw another smaller one move around the cable lines then disappear.  the full video can be seen here (3 parts)\r\npart 1:  http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=lmd60kewws8\r\npart 2:  http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=yiycaf0efv4\r\npart 3:  http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=ujbcifxbe1g\r\n\r\npart 3 of the video shows after wards when i went to shopping center where i filmed a smaller triangle ufo flying backwards on sept 25th (which, btw, doesn't even show on nexrad radar--only light clouds & light hits).  this time saw another large bright golden orb coming from different woods on ridge south of rt. 22.  while filming it, a small sphere whizzed past and danced around the light pole in the parking lot before it went out of sight.  the golden orb then turned on faa style lights and continued in the direction of monroeville--no sound was heard from it this time.\r\n\r\nthis same almost nightly phenomenon (except for rainy nights for some reason) is also occurring in new jersey where they are filmed by youtube.Com/user/mikie8865 and even as far away as moscow, russia by youtube.Com/user/olegen77 -- indicating this is not the only place this is happening and is not any type of our secret military crap.  if you read the comments left by others from different states and countries on my videos, you can see where else it's happening for yourself.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19964,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4361015,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10162009-0005","longitude":-79.689845,"occurred":1255489980000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

normal signal lights of the heli, then noticed they were way too far apart to be a part of the same aircraft. the blue light, which looked more like an orb with an internal light source, was about a third the size of the heli, and about 300 yards in front and above the heli. all of the sudden, the blue orb light accelerated way faster than the heli, evened out to the same altitude, then stoped and waited for the heli to catch up. once it did catch up, the blue orb made more manuvers \"avoiding\" or more like playing or teasing the heli. after focusing on the heli trying to keep up with the orb for about 2 minutes, i noticed a large flat grey colored craft in front of the blue orb, about the same distance away from the orb that the orb was from the heli (300 yrds). the large craft had no lights, which is why i didn't notice it until later in the experience. the large craft was being followed by the blue orb, was silent, classic ufo shape(but not shiny, flat grey in color), and kept a slow steady pace at around 60 mph. it seemed as though the blue orb was accompanying the larger ufo craft, and protecting it, or trying to divert the heli away from the craft. the orb was an aqua blueish color, somewhat \"seethrough\", had a small trail that followed behind it, and was capable of moving in all directions and stopping in mid air. the ufo craft however kept a straight heading, and had no lights in, on, or around it, besides the heli lights and the blue orb of course. i am certain these were not the traditional blinking lights all aircraft have. they moved independently, went in different directions, and held different speeds. the heli only had one red light, one, not two. it was one red light on the heli, the weird aqua blue orb, and a ufo all moving in the same general direction with the orb being the only object to deviate from a straight heading. i watch the skies every night because i have seen things 2 other times in my lifetime which started my interest. i was outside having a ciggarette and happened to witness this little \"game\" play out between the heli and the orb. the event lasted about 5 minutes, and i didn't about 6 double takes to make sure i wasn't imagining something that wasn't really happening. i am sure this was not normal craft. it looked like a chase by us after \"them\", with them laughing at our inability to keep up with them, and them having to alter their operations in order for us to keep up. strange to say the least. and i am of sound mind and have a master's degree. what i saw was definitely not ordinary. i did not have a camera of any kind at the time of the sighting unfortunately...","distance":"501 Feet - 1

sighting and did an interview. mufon report was sent to ray boeche, nebraska state director, 2/27/1989. i received additional information from jay 4/1/1989 and 1/28/1990. and recently 8/10/2009. anyone wishing to contact jay may do so via his email address. jay lived on a ranch near south bend, ne. he had horses in the pasture, and dogs and cats. on this night his wife and 6 or 7 kids were in the trailer also. they apparently didn't wake up. he didn't know the date at first. weekend or he was on vacation. jay was a truck driver. between 12 and 2 am he was awakened by a loud roar and whistling sound accompanied by very bright flashing or rotating light. he said it was so loud he couldn't have heard the dogs bark. the light was blended yellow-gold mixed with red. they appeared to be coming down. the sound had quieted to a buzz or hum like an electric generator. he was in the bedroom in the west end of the trailer. object was to the north 100' or less away. he believes it came down in the horse arena either landed or hovering. he believes it sat down. there was a window on the west wall. there were lights reflecting off the tin barn and cars. he couldn't see the arena. out of the bedroom and to the left was the north door. he thought to go and look and the object took off, \"like it read my mind\". he feels it knew he was aware of it. almost gone instantly. 3 or 4

what i saw then, every night the weather permits and there is no cloud coverage, i never fail to see the following: \r\n\r\n1. type of craft that is high in altitude, stationed far above the regulation of us air traffic in the same geographical areas without fail nightly. this one is the type that has the colored lights and produces small yellowish orbs that shoot out from it and return. this orb activity is generally in close range to the large bright craft that usually just stays at its station, however the orbs are capable of moving about and i have seen them go long distances form the large stationed ship. the only time i saw this type up close was with a spotting scope (magnification of 60x), which was not powerful enough to really see any more detail than with my normal vision. the main craft does change in light intensity at times. the colored lights seem to rotate from left to right or in a counter clockwise direction. when the orbs shoot out they seem to be fast and flash just long enough to determine their directional pattern, either to or from the large craft. as the earth rotates, the position in the sky usually causes them to drop out of view because this craft is stationed permanently. and not only this one, but there are several of these type and each has its own station. \r\n\r\n2. type of craft that appears as a bright white star. it is intensely white and spherical. these are capable of maneuvers in erratic patterns and tend to be still for a while, and suddenly move several degrees in a split second. the motions of this type of craft are erratic! i have seen them go from left to right so fast it looks like a white line. i also noticed these craft making circular swirls, zigzag, star, and wavelike patterns of flight. there are no flashing colored lights on the white star type but like the first type i mentioned, they do have orb activity associated with them. the orbs are the same yellowish color and seem to behave as with the colored type of craft. \r\n\r\n3. type of craft that is red and dimly lit up. no flashing lights. they are capable of speeds in excess of the speed of sound by several times. on occasion is seen moving across the sky at night and can go from one side of the horizon to the other in eight to ten seconds. i have never seen a red craft change course, always fly in a straight line pattern. \r\n\r\n4. type of craft that is dark with a light grey round dome in the center on its underbelly. like the red, this craft has no fleshing lights at all but this type does not glow. it is very stealth and dark. it���s very hard to see. i have only seen this type once. it was motionless, and suddenly went out of sight from a stationed position. \r\n\r\nwith all the above mentioned craft, no sound is ever associated with any of these. i study these every night the weather permits and do have feelings that are not important. what seems important is this. i see them every night...And generally only hear of when others report a random sighting. not willing to speculate, but if one were to guess, our government knows and is not telling. the biggest question on my mind: are we being introduced to what others have known slowly on purpose? or, another secondary question that goes with that. do these craft, and any possible intelligence or beings associated with them, simply no longer care if they are being witnessed?\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"08:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path

corralling our horses who had been spooked by a major storm when i had noticed a very strange object in a small clear patch of sky. what immediately drew my attention was the obvious circular shape of the object. the object seemed to be tilted at a slight angle allowing us to clearly see that the reddish/orange lights formed a perfect circle. i estimate that the object was approximately 1& 1/2 miles to the east and at an elevation of about 3,000ft. the object seemed to be relatively close to the proximity of our local airport. the object was also above the elevation that planes descending into the airport would normally be. i have seen hundreds of planes land at the airport because the flight path is very close to our house. this object was clearly not on a normal flight path. another fact that should be noted is that the wind gusts that night were around 50mph and there was absolutely no helicopters flying out of the local airport. the object was clearly not moving and was holding perfectly still in extremely strong winds. another obvious detail was that it was very bright and the object was still visible as the thin clouds would pass over it. the oddity of this object was so intense that my wife and i just stood there staring at it even though we had a minor emergency on our hands. the storm had knocked over part of my fence and one of my horses had ran down the road towards our neighbors. my wife and i had just returned with him and were getting him back in the field. when we saw the object we stood there saying \"what is that? what is that?\"  we watched the object for roughly 5 minutes before the clouds became to dense to see it anymore. my wife and i tried to explain it away but we just couldn't seem to come up with a logical answer for what it was we saw. my wife is a bit more skeptical than i am and she was troubled by what she saw. \r\n\r\nthis story was made even stranger two days later on october 15th. my wife was reading the local rants and raves section of craigslist when she yelled for me to come over. someone had posted that at around 10:00pm on the night of october 14th (almost exactly 24 hours after our sighting) that the local police department had been flooded with calls about unidentified lights over the keswick dam area. which is only about 3 miles north of where we had our sighting. the post goes on to say that witnesses reported a bright flash like something had crashed in the mountains west of here towards eureka, ca. i have tried researching the local news reports and police station blogs but i have yet been able to verify the sightings. stories like this don't appear on rants and raves very often and i thought it was too coincidental that these alleged sightings had occurred within 24 hours of my wife and i seeing something we couldn't explain.

in a \"w\" pattern, then 2 would dissapear, then reapear, i have 2 pictures of 2 of them, the other 2 disappeared, one is showing them as crafts with a white light across the whole bottom - then the next picture was amazing to me when i put them on my computer and zoomed in - they look like they were turning- but they appear as 2 little baby lightning bolts, then they disappeared as the storm got here,  my husband was driving up kykendall mountain road, at the time on his way home from work, and he saw them as well.  it was absolutely amazing!!!!  i have always believed, but i never thought i

that time the object was by the trees in front of me. i was able to film some of it. it was so bright it easily shown through the trees! i jumped up from my lawn chair after a few second of taping it and  tried to get a lock on it again. i was able to film it some more as it passed from the trees then in front of the house. i would of run to the front but unfortunately earlier the battery went dead and i was plugged into the power cord, or i defiantly would have. i hope someone else in this area got it on tape. it was huge, about the size of the half moon but was oval shaped. it appeared to be a dark orange in the middle(kind of a burnt orange, i don't think i have really seen that exact hue before) and lighter orange on the outer. it also seemed to be one craft but kind of raggedy around the edges. this i am sure would of looked great with a color camcorder. the 40 second film i shot, the object is green because it was shot with a gen 2+ atn night scope attached to a jvc

mountains just across the washington county line in frederick county, maryland. these are low mountains or high hills, around 300-500 feet. this incident occurred between 7:30pm and 8:00pm; the western sky to the right and behind me was still dimly lit along the horizon, and the eastern sky ahead of me and to the left was black. there was no moon that night. as i drove around a big curve in the road, i saw a light in my upper left peripheral vision, turned my head and looked there, and observed a large bright bluish white light quickly descending from the cloudless, black (new-moon) sky. it wasn't a flash, it was more like a huge searchlight from above in a wide short beam; however, nothing was visible above it, i.E., it wasn't attached to anything. i quickly opened the car window to listen but there was no sound. the light was maybe 30 feet above the tops of the highest trees on the mountain ridge. the span of the light was wider than a helicopter search light. it shot down and remained there for a short count, then disappeared from left to right. it lasted about 5-15 seconds--my guess is about seven seconds. i was driving at approximately 25mph at the time and almost drove off the road i was so astonished. there was a line of cars behind me because i was driving so slowly as i stared up and to my left; i recall wondering at the time if any of the drivers behind me saw it. none of them honked. the light was unnatural-looking in color, size and motion and it was very dense, not diffuse; however, the quick flash of a lightning bolt is comparable in intensity--but this was not, as i mentioned, a quick flash nor was it a slow blink. its color was similar to diode lights, a.K.A. extremely bright bluish white. no trees, no mountains obscured my view. i continued driving and, about 5-10 seconds later, i rounded the mountain and saw the valley immediately to my left. i could see the stationary low lights of the homes scattered around this farmland area of

we thought the sound was coming from, i saw a circular object about 1200 feet directly above and slightly to the left of my position. i estimate the object to be about 75 to 100 feet accross and light grey in color. even though it was the middle of the day, i could clearly see white lights pulsing around the perimeter of the object in a clockwise direction. each pulse last about one second and i viewed these pulses for about 10 seconds before my mother joined me on the sidewalk. we watched it together for about 20 seconds and immediately identified it as a ufo because it hovered for about 30-40 seconds in one spot. my mother then went into the house the get her camera. as she came back out from the house (camera in hand) the ufo proceeded north at about 75-100 miles per hour for about 5 seconds before it made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the left at a very high rate of speed of what i estimate to be about 500-700 miles per hour. i would imagine that no human would be able to survive a g-force like that. from a straight flight line at about 100 miles per hour to an abrupt left turn at at least 500 miles per hour and stayed at that same speed from the exact point in the turn until

plans for the coming year, we noticed a car pull onto the road with some people in it. i waved at them as they drove off into the woods. as we sat there in the dark for another 10 minutes talking and listening to the radio, we noticed what looked like lightning in the distance. \r\n\r\nall of a sudden, the radio started to jump around and not stay on one radio station. as we looked at the radio, the entire area around us became as bright as daylight, we could see the trees and the grass around us. we looked up to see a large object above us, we also jumped out of the car, both out of curiosity as well as scared completely out or wits.\r\n\r\nthe next thing i remember we were standing outside of our car as we watched a large black triangular craft slowly move away from us. the

power yet.I had a friend over andy s. and i was getting tired of all the [cms/tg/pd] that goes on when you have friends over nite.I was looking up through the sliding glass door when i saw a bluish white light moving from spot to spot in the night sky.It appeared to me that it was going from star to star.I told my friend and he laughed at me and told me they were galaxies and there is no way a ship is going to be that big.He came to the window and by then it had stopped and he said \"oh sure i see it !\" and went back and laid down.I kept watching with my brother and it started up again and i yelled at him to get up and look again.It stopped again and he laid down again.Some time had passed i guess a half hour and i was determined to prove that i was seeing something by now my brother was layong down too.It started up again and now started to descend (really it was like it dropped) as it approached it seemed to be blinking a soft red glow and appeared to be about twenty feet in diameter and was blinking on for about four seconds and then off for about the same( it seemed to keep a very dim red glow from within at all times as it moved ).It came to stop about a quater a mile away and about one hundred and fifty feet off the ground.We were all screaming  at my mother who was sleeping in the back bedroom to get up and come look but she was very tired and was yelling at us to go to sleep cause it was a quarter to midnight.It moved west toward ralph h.Sr. ranch at about ten to twelve miles per hour.It put out a single spot light  as it passed over lovelake rd.And then another and another till there was five light one in the middle and four around the center it started spot lighting the corn fields in a wild manner it reminded me of van halen when i saw them twice on the 1984 tour.The light all spot lighted a single place in front of the ship and the ship was now dark and it came to a stop when all the lights were directly under it.The four lights blinked off and the center light seemed to brightened for a second before it to blinked off.We waited for probably a minute before the red glow returned and now the red blinking quickened as the ship sped off and arching back up into the sky and disappeared, it took on a steady bluish white glow as it had before it's descent.My mother would have been a good witness but she arrived in the living room to late.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19942,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.4660974,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10142009-0010","longitude":-110.0874865,"occurred":207205200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,
