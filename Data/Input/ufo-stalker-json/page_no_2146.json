will see stars that are farther away than most of them just gliding across the sky. i've to come make it a habit each night for the past 6-9 months to go outside, prop my head up and watch this amazing thing happen.\r\n\r\ni've learned that they just fly back and forth from over where area 51 would be (miles away from san diego)northwest i think to past where mexico would be (southeast i think)...They are not shooting stars, they are not satellites and they are deifinitely not airplanes or any manmade vehicle.\r\n\r\ni once heard that ufos will sit out there for hours and pretend to be stars, i believe this now. i've made it into a family thing....My husband and children thought i was crazy and did not believe me until they sat out there and watched for themselves.\r\n\r\nthese crafts are like monitoring our skies (especially here in so.Cal), where my house is located, i believe it is like their runway where they take off and return.  it's absolutely amazing to see! you can follow them from the time you see them until they like disappear.\r\n\r\nup until last night, we watched with the naked eye. last night, we got out binoculars and the craft that seemed to be moving slowly across the sky are actually going at a speed that nothing manmade could ever do and they are much higher than we thought.\r\n\r\nthey look exactly like stars! except they are the ones are the tiniest in the sky!\r\n\r\nattached is amateur video of one that we took one night in august of this year.\r\n\r\ncheck it out for yourself and if you ever show up at my house when it gets dark, i will show you something that will be amazing to even you.  unless you are already aware of this.  i'm sure nasa and the government are already.  there is no way that i am the only seeing

had just passed through the doylestown area merging from sr 585n to sr 21n. the light seemed like it could be a spotlight from the ground moving in a counter clockwise circular pattern. \r\n\r\nafter watching while i drove, it became apparent that the light was not being projected from the ground. the light seemed to come from within the cloud. the light was not reflected as it would be if the source were external. i could not see any source however. i don't know exactly how far from the ground this was but it was relatively close, maybe a few hundred feet above.\r\n\r\nthe circumference was pretty large in my opinion. i hadn't seen or heard about the moscow halo cloud until i got to work but it seemed to be about that size and distance from the ground. what i saw looked pretty much the same but the lights were moving around continuously in a counter clockwise motion. there was no steady light in the center, just around the edges. i could see the light circle all the way around at a slight angle which would lead me to believe that what ever was projecting this was either smaller and in the center of the cloud or not visible. this may lend more credence to a spotlight except for the fact that i drove at least ten miles while the light kept perfectly in front of me. i eventually lost sight of the anomaly when sr 21 merged into i-77n near fairlawn (sr 18). due to the size and relatively close proximity to the ground i would think that a spot light would have been passed up long before then. also the way the light moved inside the cloud gave a definite 3-d appearance.\r\n\r\nwhen i arrived at work i told my friend but he dismissed it as a helicopter. i have never witnessed helicopters act like this and the light was much larger than a typical search light, not to mention the spinning motion would not lend itself well to searching. the light rotated around the equator, if this had been spherical. it was more like around a doughnut at a slight enough angle that i could see the light come around the back top left corner. in the doughnut analogy you would not see the center hole from my vantage point.\r\n\r\ni later went to yahoo to look at the headlines were the first thing i see is the moscow halo cloud. i told my other co-worker that that was exactly what i saw. we played the you tube video but this one didn't have the rotating light. \r\n\r\ni am pretty picky in what i term a ufo. a group of friends and i saw a full blown ship while in high school about 14 years back (shreve, ohio summer of 95~). we were in a cornfield and saw what looked like a spot light from a helicopter but with no sound, coming from over a barn. the next thing i knew the craft was directly above us. it must have only been a few hundred feet from the ground. made no noise. all we could do is stare up at it. the ship took up the entire sky. it looked to be flat gray in color but glowing an indigo blueish color. the ship was circular and in the middle had a large ring that was emitting a white light. there were smaller lights positioned around the large light in the middle. i noticed no markings on the craft. we were frozen. then, in an instant, it was gone. for several years afterward i could not talk about the experience without getting chills and my eyes watering.\r\n\r\ni know i'm mixing accounts but i consider pretty much anything less than that logically explainable. what makes me tell you about this most recent one is the similarity of it to the moscow halo cloud. it is being dismissed as meteorological but this is so close to the same thing to be coincidence. if these are the same thing, i don't want the story to die due to lack of accounts and the typical \"weather phenomenon\" explanation. \r\n\r\nanother coincidence that happened a few nights back, sunday morning the 11th of october 2009 around 3-4am, wooster, oh, i was listening to coast to coast am outside looking at the stars. i saw a bright blue flash come from the front side of my house (i was in the back yard) that lit up the whole sky. immediately after, the power in my house went out and then came right back. there were no clouds and did not seem to be lightning. it was around 38 degrees f that night. i didn't see anything other than that but these latest things seem to be coincidental. \r\n\r\ni am sorry if i wrote a book but i have wanted to relay my experiences to mufon for some time now and there is something about this latest sighting that made me want to tell you.\r\n\r\nthanks.","distance":"101-500 Feet,

5:30 pm - while riding the bus back to new york city after attending the nasa astronauts sts-127 tweetup in dc the day before, i happened to see what at first i thought was a contrail in the sky. but after a closer look, i realized that the 'contrail' was moving steadily across the sky from west to east, not elongating, but following this object. it was like the tail of a comet, but only it was white, like the smoke a space shuttle leaves behind while hurtling through space. this 'tail or trail' followed behind the object never gaining length, but remaining the same size as it proceeded across the sky. whatever the object was, it was moving at a fairly fast clip, dragging this 'tail' behind it, but i was unable to see the object. it did not appear to be a plane, if it was, it was so high up as to be invisible at this distance. i tried to photograph it and this is the result. as you can see, the 'tail' is a certain length. it never got longer as a contrail would. instead, it just continued to move behind this object as it crossed the sky. \r\n\r\nthe woman sitting across from me looked up curiously as she saw me take a photo, but neither of us commented on it. i am hoping someone can tell me if a satellite or military plane was making a normal flight that day at that time. the 'tail' was not as thick as it appears in the photo. i don't know why it photographed this way, it was definitely a 'tail' not at all a thick cloud. the first photo is a blurr and not very good. the second one shows the tail as it moved across the sky. i was puzzled as it reminded me of nothing but a space shuttle or satellite and i believe a satellite does not carry a tail and there was no shuttle scheduled to fly that course that i was aware. \r\n\r\nwe were on the road, not yet at the jersey turnpike and there was a treeline to our right as we zipped past towns. i could not see any houses at this time, only trees or wooded area on the ground. we had left dc at 2:30 pm and hit a lot of traffic before baltimore so we were running about an hour behind schedule. \r\nlocation: somewhere between delaware and new

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Date:  thursday, september 3, 1987\r\ntime:  between 7:30 and 8:00 p.M.\r\n\r\nlocation:  outside a mobile home residence in bartlesville, ok\r\n\r\nweather conditions:\r\ntemperature was estimated between 85 & 90f, no clouds, somewhat hazy.  the sun had set at ground level where i was located, but the sky was still bright and well illuminated.\r\n\r\nsighting:\r\ni was at this location to inquire about about an automobile for sale.  the owner was first to observe the object as it approached from a southeasterly direction.  he was facing that direction while we were talking.  he kept mentioning that there was something strange approaching which he thought might be a bird since it appeared dark in color.  i did not observe the object until it was directly overhead.\r\n\r\nshape:  the object appeared to be perfectly circular as witnessed from its bottom surface.  its bottom side appeared to be very dark, almost black, however i concluded later that the bottom was in the shade as the sunlight struck the object from its west side.  \r\n\r\nthe object passed directly overhead and proceeded in a northwesterly direction.  as it continued on (at an estimated rate of speed similar to a light private airplane of 100-120 mph) we both noted that its top and bottom surfaces were flat.  during this period of time, i saw the sunshine reflect off its west side.  it appeared that the object was constructed of a metallic substance which had either been burned or perhaps it was its natural color as areas appeared charred or tarnished.  some weeks later a fellow worker showed me a sheet of titanium which looked much like the outer surface in color i witnessed on the saucer.\r\n\r\nas the object continued to fly away from us we were able to see more detail on its upper deck area.  there appeared a vertical beam (or beams?) ontop of which rested a horizontal beam which was shorter than the diameter of the object itself.  the horizontal beam was oriented at a normal to the direction of flight such that at a far distance, it made the object appear similar to a biplane.  \r\n\r\nsize:  the object was much smaller than a full moon (at its zenith).  because the object appeared very sharp in an otherwise somewhat hazy sky, i deduced that it was quite low (in altitude).  i would guess it was flying about 500-700 ft. above ground level at the time we viewed it.   it flew steady, completely silent with no indication of navigation lights of any kind (though it was daylight of course).   \r\n\r\nduring the following weekend i attended a local \"flyin\" of private aircraft held across town at our airport.  i was able to observe various aircraft flying at varying altitudes which helped me estimate the over all size of the object we sighted that evening.  my best guess was that its diameter was about 18 ft.\r\nthe object appeared somewhat smaller than the wing span of a stearman biplane in my estimation (which is 20 ft.) but about the same as a pitts special (single seat) biplane.\r\n\r\nconstruction:  the sun briefly illuminated the west side of the object revealing an outer surface composed of a metallic substance.  i had the impression that there no plates or rivets showing though they may have not been visible at that distance.  it appeared to be seamless, similar to stainless steel liquid nitrogen tanks in service today.  however the outer surface of this object did appear to have been oxidized (burned or scorched).\r\n\r\nflight characteristics:  the object flew a very stable path, straight and level from a southeasterly direction to a northwesterly direction, directly over our heads.  this object appeared to be moving at a rate of speed similar to private aircraft such as cessna 172 for instance (100-130 mph).  we heard nor saw any wobbling, spinning, lights or noise of any kind.  one might expect that the beams we witnessed on the upper deck would have created some sound due to wind noise at the speed it was traveling.  but we heard nothing at all.\r\n\r\nconclusions:  this saucer shaped object appeared to contain no aerodynamic surfaced deemed necessary for flight in our atmosphere.  also it appeared to have no external engine or propulsion system we could see, no down thrusting fan or engine mounted on the saucer shaped object.  there was no way to estimate its weight (or mass).  of course it could have been filled with a lighter than air gas such as helium or hydrogen for all i know.  \r\n\r\nmy qualification as a spotter:   my experience as a spotter/observer of aircraft began at the early age of seven (7) just before the outbreak of wwii for the us (1941).  i was raised in el paso, texas which served the military as the \"southern flyway\" during the wwii and the korean conflict.  consequently i had the opportunity to witness a steady progression of us technology during those periods from 1941through until i left el paso in 1958.  \r\n\r\ni spent much of my youth outside when the weather allowed and the weather was most generally very good there.  since we had no tv or air-conditioning in those years, we found many things to do outdoors.  many of us became very good at identifying wwii aircraft, both air corps and navy (since el paso served as a cross country refueling base for the navy). also, i was there during the korean conflict, when the sky was again full of both navy & air force aircraft.  i never ever saw anything day or night that looked like the saucer shaped object i saw on that late afternoon in early september of 1987 before or since that time.\r\n","distance":"101-500

pulsing coppery colored light southbound that appeared to be near the broken clouds. the color was unique and reminded me of a previous sighting of the same style that we did not report to mufon a few months previously, that was a southbound object flying over the airport.\r\n\r\n  this object appeared in the northeast over the trees of the park preserve and went straight south at about the same height as jupiter, just past jupiter and then vanished.\r\n\r\n  when i first saw it i ran inside and grabbed my celestron 10 x 80 binoculars, and got it into focus, what i saw was what appeared to be a large rectangular translucent object, (atleast it was a rectangle on the bottom, i could not see the top it was dark) whose bottom appeared to be illuminated by the beacon in the center of its bottom edge, as it was traveling left to right.\r\n\r\n  the illumination from the light source on the bottom was flame like but the color was odd, i dont know what to compare it to. and the bottom may have been v shaped or curved as the light from the bottom tapered off, gradiently as you looked up the side of it.\r\n\r\n  my arms were shaking with excitement so i ran to the porch wall to steady my arms but then it simply vanished. blinked out... gone.\r\n\r\n the entire sighting was approximately 90 seconds, in the beginning when when i first saw it i hear a loud jet blast coming from behind me in the direction of ohare however i never saw a plane, and the jet blasy sounded different from the normal air traffic we deal with every day. im sorry i can not add more details...\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nmufon questions: 1) went out back for a smoke, chairs face east, and ive always been into astronomy, i look up all the time. 2) first noticed it because of peculiar color and modulation of light and fact we are in ohare atc area. 4) when i ran for binoculars i hoped it would not turn out to be juts  a helicopter or airplane. 5) i admit being excited when i could see the object instead of just 'an odd light' 6) it vanished in a blink of eye.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

it turned south, it banked at a 40 degree angle. there was a slight anomoly with the air - it seemed to shimmer as though there was intense heat, a shimmer that one would see coming off of a road during the summer sun, but it was slight. the ship was extremely clear to see, although it seemed to be solid flat black (minus the lights of course). \r\n\r\ni made a quick animation of what we saw (attached) from my perspective.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound.\r\ni was trying to take a photograph of three girls, but the camera wasn't working, when someone yelled 'that's a f'n ufo!'  i looked up and to my right, i immediatly saw it as it passed right in front of us.\r\n\r\nthere was no doubt that it was a huge craft gliding through the night sky.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of the object in the distance.\r\n\r\nnote:  i had lazik eye surgery a few years ago, giving me perfect 20/20 vision.  a negative result of the surgery though makes all lights at night have a slight halo and star effect len's flare.  the three lights i saw off of the craft did not give these effects, even though all of the other lights in the city and the hills behind did.\r\n\r\nps - the exact time was 12:30am 10 oct 2009, i put in the time of 12am and got an error msg, so i'm redoing this with the time of 1am instead","distance":"501 Feet - 1

night, and there was no other traffic oh the intire trip home. we were in an area where the farm land was very spread out, with large fields and no houses. a pair of very, very bright lights that were deffenetly connedted, were comming in our direction, but high in the sky. all of a sudden they decended all the way down to about fifty feet off the ground. at this point they sere still 6 or 700 yards away off to our left. they leveled off at about ten to twenty feet off the ground and came directly at us. they came very fast at us untill they were fifty yards away and then slowed down but still moving directly at us. when i thought maybe it was going to hit us, they went up over us. they didn't keep going because we could see the area around the car and the road ahead and behind was still bright with light from them. at this point we couldn't see the light because they were diredtly above us, and neither of wanted to open a window to look out and up. i don't remember leaving the area, my next memory was many miles dwon the road. at this time i remember telling my wife that it must have been a cropduster. seh replyed \"at night\". that responce hit me like bolt, she was right, there was no way a cropduster could see power lines, trees. and other obstacles. i can't say there was a lost amount of time or any thing like that, because we never thought about time or anything else, except what we had seen. we just  went home and to bed still discussing what happened, but not thinking to check time or anything like that. my wifes memory is excatly the same as mine, as we still discuss it once in a while. even though it happened about thirty years ago. we never wanted ti admit to ourselves that it might have been a ufo, untill the last ten or fifteen years. now we both know what it was, and neither of us can be told differently.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path then

which was about 10 miles north of where i lived at the time. as i was driving and playing around with my radio looking for a good station i noticed my car had stalled. this kinds confused me as just a second before i was listening to music, then nothing. i instantly tried to start my car and nothing happened.  i then looked around and noticed there were no lights anywhere even though it had recently gotten dark. there were no other vehicles or people anywhere either. that was strange because it was a weekday on a fairly busy major route through my town. it was also evening rush hour. i then tried to look around to see what i might do to help myself. i became aware of a kinda low hum? coming from my right passenger side of the car. the windows were electric so i couldn't raise it down to ascertain where the sound was being produced. finally, i opened the driver car door next to me and kinda stood up against the car with the door leaning against me. as i looked up and across the road i saw what appeared to be a huge silent plane of some sort. it did not make any sound except for the low, low hum? i had originally heard?/felt. it was huge and i tried to come up for a way to gauge it's size in relevance to surrounding architecture. the only thing i could think of was it was at least 3 times longer than the football field at the high school right up the road from where i was standing. it looked like it was sitting right on top of the tree line/power lines that lined that side of the road. it was so big sideways and in height i knew i couldn't take the size all in my line of vision. it appeared to have\r\nstarting around the middle of it a row of very tall windows illuminating a strong bright blue light. i was aware of several figures moving about and maybe even watching me watch them. i was not afraid or uncomfortable in any way. i don't know why in the world i would have stood outside my car to investigate this thing. in reality i would have never done something like that on my own. i am an avowed coward to say the lease and this was very out of character for me. as i watched it finally moved straight up higher above the trees silently. it then jetted n west towards newark rd/newark ohio. it accelerated so fast! just up and gone. it didn't turn itself around or maneuver at all, just slightly up and sideways gone like that! the next thing i know i am driving my car coming up to a gas station\r\nright up the road from where the craft had been. all the lights were on and traffic was very light. i had no idea of what time it was or how much had passed since my clock in the car had been disrupted. when i finally got home i saw my trip had taken me well over 3 hours to complete! i didn't know how to explain the missing time even to the sitter who was there for my young children. she was a friend of the family who actually lived with us at the time so that worked out just fine. i almost forgot the incident completely by then. i tried to remember every detail but just kept drifting way in thought or something. when my husband came home from work at 11 or so that night we didn't discuss it at all. i failed to say anything to him about it for about the next three months or so. i don't know why. i just kinda forgot.","distance":"21-100

pockets on the moon where the lcross rocket was supposed to hit. however, nasa says the selected area was chosen due to the extreme cold temperatures where the sun would not have melted any ice.\r\n2 problems:\r\n\r\n1. the thermal camera shows clear pockets of circular hot spots that are in unlighted areas on the moon. this is impossible unless the cameras were adjusted to read a minute amount of heat. if the cameras were adjusted to pick up the smallest amounts of heat, the explosion would have been a very bright white spot on impact. there was not even the slightest hint of heat at the impact point even though nasa commentators said there were definite signatures from the explosion.\r\n\r\n2. from the 1969 apollo tapes you can see there is at least an inch of dust that covers the moon. the second stage of the lcross rocket (which was recording the event) had 4 minutes to see at least the movement of that dust if the rocket had failed to detonate. if not the tnt included on the lc1 rocket would of accelerated anything into the view of the cameras. even dust flying around (especially from an explosion), the particles put off small amount of heat when colliding with each other, when nasa switches to the thermal cameras they recorded nothing.\r\n\r\n**other anomalies in the posted nasa video:\r\nthe second stage of the rocket ends transmission clearly before impact, when nasa switches to the control room you can see a pc in the foreground still recording live images that we did not get to see.\r\n\r\nshortly after the mission is over, some congrads were in order
