(remembrance)\r\n\r\n1.  i have two small dogs.  the first \"dream\" i had i saw my dog (5 lb. one) being drug around viciously by a tomcat and i was shocked and couldn't help her because she was too far away. (fast in & out dream)\r\n\r\n2.  second \"dream\" i see the dog (5 lb. one) closer to me and being attacked by two tomcats and i couldn't separate them so i balled up my fist and raised it up to hit the cat.  (fast in & out dream)\r\n\r\n3.  third \"dream\" my first recollection is being in a state of paralysis and floating through the air with a group of beings, one was an older asian man with a dark jacket (maybe a military garb?).  we moved with one accord and i noticed i was dressed very royally.  we sat at a round table (like a coffee table) and couches like a pit group.  i remember looking (transfixed) at the asian man and i thought we were going to have tea when my smaller (3 lb.) dog was placed in my lap and a knife was placed in my hand.  i instinctively knew to do an operation which i started and then noticed that it wasn't going right and freaked out.  at that point i got up and started walking away and noticed a large what i thought at the time was a dog like figure walking around \"talking\" to me.  i remember \"telling\" him as they brought my dog to another room, please don't kill her as they related that they would take care of it from there.  the large figure had a very narrow face like a doberman but i now believe it to be a reptilian because i noticed a space between the back like a hole which i believe now was the tail lifted as it walks.  it came up to me to take the knife which i was terrified and i gave it the knife.\r\n\r\nafter that i was shown by another creature which i can't describe how to navigate or move from upper level to lower level within the craft.  i was shown how to go off the edge of it and down to a lower level and the creature went with me and we chatted (very friendly).  when i was asked to do it myself, i couldn't a. it is not intuitive to me to walk off the edge of one area of a height for any reason even if i was just shown this b. one minor thought was that my shoes would come off and i was shown a pair of shoes on me that i wore 30 years ago that strapped around my leg, (and c. why was i being asked to go there? (very fast, after this - was out of the \"dream\"). with no explanation.\r\n\r\ni don't believe it was a dream due to the nature of this and the fact that i am a very lucid dreamer.  i had nothing going on in my life to indicate a concern about my dogs and stray cats as they are either with me or at home with a dog door that only lets them in and the 3 lb. one thinks she is a doberman and lunges at anything that moves and the 5 lb. one i think wouldn't go without a fight.  also, after this happened about a week ago i wanted very much to remember more about how this happened because i don't like being taken either physically or mentally anywhere for experiments of any kind and remembered my head being pinned down from behind and carefully lifted up by something that was very afraid of me, seems like i opened my eyes momentarily.\r\n\r\nalso, one a side note, i have a poster print of some art i saw at the kimball in fort worth, tx. and the figures are dressed very royally.\r\n\r\n1.(dog picture is the size of my dogs)\r\n2.

pictures of it just on a whim.  after i shot the first picture of the balloon i noticed (through the view finder) a small white object moving rapidly from left to right within the view finder.  i quickly tried to take a second photograph of the object but was unable to as it vanished before i could focus on it accurately.  \r\nhowever, when i came upstairs and uploaded all of the images i had taken into my computer i noticed that the second picture i took of the helium balloon had the strange white object within its frame.  i couldn���t help (and still can���t help) but wonder what the

the door was locked, and saw out of our large window a bright orange ball of light in the north-eastern sky. through the window, it was slightly obscured by tree branches. even so, i thought i could see it moving, and thought it might be some kind of ufo. i promptly put on my shoes and jacket and went out into our front yard to see what it was. i walked out of our front yard into the street. to my front was a bean field, and behind me was my front yard, which is full of large trees so i could not see any of the western sky. \r\n\r\nthe light was no longer there, but in front of me to the north-east i saw an object that looked almost like a star. it was moving slowly towards the west. it moved much too slowly to be a plane (there are two small airports a few miles east and west of where i live, so i have seen airplanes nearly everyday for my whole life, and i know what they look like). as i watched it move from north-east to more in the northern sky, i saw it rise quickly (compared to how slowly it was moving) in a manner that would have been impossible for a plane. it eventually disappeared behind clouds in the northern sky.\r\n\r\nas i watched this light, i noticed two more. one was not too far from the first star-like light i just mentioned, but it disappeared much sooner than the first. the other light i saw was more in the eastern sky than the others and much higher in the sky. it was similar to the bright orange ball of light i first witnessed, but i only saw this slow moving light two or three times before it completely disappeared in the clouds. it too, disappeared much sooner than the first star-like object. when i saw the star-like objects i was not willing to immediately say they were craft other than airplanes. but because of their behavior i just described i came to the conclusion they were not planes.\r\n\r\nat about 11:40 pm i had to go back inside the house to take care of a matter before midnight. \r\n\r\nthen at around 11:55 pm i decided to go back outside to the road to see if there were anymore lights. i then saw what i would call some kind of craft flying from the north to the south. it passed by the western sky as it went its way, not directly above me. i could see a bright, white-yellow light on the front of the craft. on the back was a flashing white light. i could tell that there was some kind of structure between these lights. as i watched the craft, i could tell it was not a plane because of the slower speed it was moving at, and it made no noise. occasionally it seemed to almost slow to a stop. i then ran back inside to get my video camera.\r\n\r\nwhen i came back out the object i was watching was more toward the south-west by then. i then started to film a craft that was quite similar to the previous craft. i could tell that it was not a plane because it showed basically the same behavior as the other craft (but it moved quicker more often). it actually slowed significantly then shot forward rapidly a short distance. i was standing in the road, so these were all over the horizon beyond the bean field.\r\n\r\ni then noticed below this craft in the distance were two smaller lights. they were star-like, but they seemed to be orange. they were usually moving much too slow to be airplanes. you can see these in the attached video. in it, you can see that the larger craft gets dimmer and almost disappears from the camera���s view, (though i could still see it fine). you can also see three or more bright ground level lights, but can tell that they are at ground level as opposed to the crafts. at about three minutes into the video a car came down the road. i stepped off the road towards the bean field to continue filming. i then counted at least six lights in the sky that i could see. you cannot see them in the footage. i attempted to zoom in on the lights, but they were mostly too dim for the camera to pick up.\r\n\r\nsome time between this event and the one after this, i saw what i thought to be a plane. i thought i got in on film but i made some kind of mistake and do not believe that i did (it also did not seem to come in on the camera very good anyway). i thought it was probably a plane but it was moving much too slow, and it made virtually no noise. the sound it did make i would have to compare to the sound of a breeze blowing in your ear, though also it was something of a soft rumbling noise unlike that of an airplane (especially one that low). it looked triangular. at each of its three points was a bright white light. the front light and left-rear light were static. however, the right-rear light was flashing. the lights seemed to illuminate the bottom of the craft. if that is what i saw, i believe that it was black, but the parts most illuminated looked somewhat gray-ish due to the light. if i had been standing in the bean field, i believe that it would have been above my head. i later saw it south down the road over a corn field, joined by another craft that had come from the west.\r\n\r\nat about 5 minutes into the film, i turn my attention down the road to the south. you can see a green-white spotlight that i believe someone down the road had put up on a telephone pole. to its left is a corn field and you can see a bright orange ufo. when it appears to be beneath the street light it is moving across the road (it is nowhere near the street light).\r\n\r\nas i filmed this i noticed that all of the lights that were in the sky had been moving toward the south. i also saw another triangular craft that i thought might have been an airplane. by then i thought it should have been much farther away.\r\n\r\nthe light over the field that i just mentioned kept going back and forth from being over the field (i���m assuming it was over a field, but it was so far down the road it could have been over anything) and crossing over the road to the other side of the road, where it would disappear behind some trees. sometimes it would just reappear over the field. it often went from being dim, to shining like a bright orange fireball. it would usually shine brightly over the field as opposed to over the road. at one point it was bright over the road and just blinked out and disappeared. on the video, you can see it over the road going slowly toward the trees then suddenly jerk backwards and disappear. it did not usually appear to have a smooth flight path. often it was rather jerky. at one point i did see it rise higher in the sky, but i only saw it do this once.\r\n\r\nin the video you can hear me remark that it sounds like there are people yelling about seeing the light. it turned out it was just my family wondering where i was.\r\n\r\nat that point i ran back to the house to my family. i left the camera recording through that and so i have edited this out (i came back out around 12:33 or so). some of the events i described above could have happened after i came back out, but i do not remember clearly.\r\n\r\nas i ran back to the house i turned around to see that the first light over the field was joined by a second, significantly higher in the sky.\r\n\r\ni also saw more lights to the east as i watched these lights. they were some of the ones i noticed going toward the south (in the video, i mistakenly repeat that they were going north).\r\n\r\nthe one bright light over the field was occasionally joined by others. at one point, i saw two lights above the field. one (to the right) was higher than the other. they slowly moved towards each other, but they were too dim for the camera to pick up. i then turned on my camera���s ���night mode��� and they became visible to the camera. you can then see them flying away from each other toward the left (east) and right (west).\r\n\r\nat one point, i saw a craft i had previously thought was a plane stop over the field and above one of the other lights, thus erasing any lingering doubts as to what it was.\r\n\r\neventually i decided to go back to the house because it was so late.\r\n\r\ni have attempted to recount my experience the best i could. due to time, and watching the video, my memory may have gotten mixed up on a few details and i may have stated a few events out of order (especially toward the end). neither the video nor my retelling gives the event justice. in all, i believe i saw between 15 and 20 flying objects.\r\n\r\nthese events fit well within my worldview so i was not scared. i was amazed and sometimes in doubt as to what was going on, but never scared. i was happy i was able to witness such an amazing event.\r\n\r\nthe video was about 28 minutes long, but i have cut it to 15. i plan to put up all of my footage on youtube.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This was my one and only witnessing to a chain of mysterious sightings that lasted several weeks above the waters surrounding the st. petersburg peninsula 1998.  the highlight to this event ended with phone contact from the department of defense.  i was attending a party hosted at the oldest house built on the shores of boca ciega bay.  in a conversation at this gathering, friends and family members had been telling me about how they witnessed mysterious white lights on multiple occasions that appeared to shoot out of the water 1-3 miles off the coast of st. petersburg beach sometimes followed by high intensity explosions heard and seen as flashes of bright light.  i've always been fascinated with the possibility of seeing something bizzare happen in the night skies and i definetely got my chance that night shortly after listening to the stories, especially because this was an atypical ufo sighting.  later as the party was winding down i was relaxing on a swing chair on the rear house deck that faced the bay.  i was gazing at the night sky when suddenly there was an ultra bright blue or white flash immedialtely followed by a high-intensity, deafening report with a shockwave that nearly blew the windows out.  i remember people screamed and possibly a women crying it was so startling.  my cousin and brother instantly said \"that's what we've been talking about!\".  this was much louder than an exploding transformer or lightning hit.  i could feel the shockwave hit me like a bomb.  i ran down to the shoreline with a few others and saw a fireball and firey debris slowly falling from the sky which appeared to be over the south-eastern part of boca ciega bay or possibly furthur over the inlet of tampabay near the sunshine bridge.  it eventually burned out as it fell for about 15-20 seconds. i also remember thinking how the sound traveled so fast and that was an indicator of the distance of only about 1-2 miles from our location to the object.  my curiosity went on tangents to what it could have been.  the next morning i called the gulfport police dept to see if there had been any reports made or if anyone else had called it in and to my suprise, they said it had been a quiet night. none of the police officers supposedly witnessed anything either.  now my own theories at this point were that it was some marine based military activity being conducted by mac dill afb, such as missile tests or even submarine launched missiles but i didn't think that would be done in such close proximity to civilian areas.  the kicker to all this is that about an hour after i talked to the police dept, a secretary of defense called the house phone.  my mother answered the phone and told me that a secretary from the dept of defense was requesting to speak to me.  my heart skipped a beat and i took the phone.  a receptionist quickly briefed me to who i was going to be speaking with (wish i remembered the name) and what it entailed and asked if i would except the call.  i said \"sure!\".  i was a little scared but mostly excited.  i thought this meant something significant was going on.  the receptionist transferred the call and a man introduced himself and efficiently moved on to questions.  in a polite demeanor he said \"what exactly did you see?\".  i told him about the loud report(explosion noise) and the fireball and falling debris along with other details to location etc.  he said \"yeah, we have been getting similar reports along most of the west coast of florida. we'll contact you again if we need to conduct furthur questioning and let you know what we find out. thankyou for the information\".  the call was short and i found it uncanny that he would even disclose that little information to me about the sightings from others.  i drove to my buddy's house near tyrone square mall to tell him the news in person. approximately an hour later we saw armed sea cobra gunship helicopters flying a low formation over his house 500-1500' south towards boca ciega bay.  i don't know if that pertained to the sightings but i have never seen sea cobras in this area before especially since mac dill afb is home to a refueling wing of air tankers.  it's now fall 2009, i'm 33 y/o. i still wonder quite often about that event.  if anyone reading this has had a similar experience or has some insight i would be very interested in conversing with you.  thankyou for reading!  maildump@tampabay.Rr.Com             ","distance":"Over One

appox 80% the time was 8:05 pm est and as i watched the commercial airlines taking their usual routes i noticed a light maybe 5 times larger than a commercial jet but with the regular flights in the same area i could tell it was at a higher altitude. the speed was maybe 4 or 5 times faster than the regular planes and it took only 20 or so seconds to clear most of the sky. the object started speeding up and the flight path went up at about a 45 degree angle, the lights started getting smaller fast and then split into 2 lights in a y going northwest and northeast at an approximate angle of 30 degrees then in 2 seconds they sped off and disappeared. the light stayed bright white no flashing or different colors during the entire flight. when the object split into 2 the brightness  diminished as if the total mass was split and each carried half the illumination. sorry no time to get a camera and i doubt if a good picture would have resulted snyways it was too far away.\r\n\r\ni was cooking a rather horrid meal at the time and stepped outside for a little air. never try deep fried corn on the cob. my wife daughter and i are all nite time sky watchers as we frequently stay up all night watching meteor showers and we have all had some very interesting sightings of anomolies in the nite skys. i was in a good state of mind it had been a long hot tiring week and had a chance to relax for several hours after work so i was mentally sharp at 8 pm and was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the wife and grandson whom is spending the weekend with us so a great mood was present.\r\n\r\ni noticed the light right away and trained my eyes on it, i was looking for points of reference as i usually do to put things in perspective and followed it to it's disappearance. i am not an faa expert nor am i a pilot, but i am fair at judging relative height and comparing speed from a know to the unknown.","distance":"Over One

my own desk again i looked out the window. the clouds were so beautiful, just like me to love the little things in life as simple as the clouds. then i notice a black dot moving across the sky. at first i thought it was the eagle i had seen the day before.\r\n i quickly realized that this was not the case. it didn't change coarse and had nothing i could discribe as wings. i will admit, i have made the mistake of misidentifying objects (never a plane) so ever since then when i've been identifying an object, i go down a list until a ufo is all it could be.\r\n it's not an eagle, is it a plane?\r\n just then in changed color- from black to siver! this surprised me, of coarse. it couldn't be a plane, unless it had changed angles slightly and reflected the sun different.\r\n then, it turned black again, then silver, and it repeated this about three or four times. then i noticed something else. some rather large flashes were occuring aroud it. they were far enough away from the object to say that they were different objects.\r\n soon, i noticed that it was angling downward and vanished beyond the distant trees. realizing that i wouldn't see anything else, i refocused to my teacher.\r\n i remained pretty calm during the entire expeariance (except for the fact that i wished i could jump out of my chair and yell, \"what is that!?!). of, coarse, i'm pretty used to seing ufos, because i've seen them my entire life!\r\n also, i'm not sure if this had anything to do with it, but before i saw the ufo, it felt like my desk (it could have been just me) was

it. there were no clouds in this section of the sky so what ever it was had completely disapeared.\r\n\r\ni had to slow my vehicle down because the person in front of me appeared to be leaning over the steering wheel of his 2000-2001 (approx) toyota tundra to figure out where the object went as well.  he was point to the same section of sky to his passenger, after a few moments he sped back up to the speed limit of 45.  i cannot verify if the occupents were for sure looking at the same object, but as there was nothing else in that section of the sky it leads me to my conclusion.\r\n\r\ni
