when i noticed a large light in the sky. at first i did not say anything to her as i thought it was just a helicopter with a spot light on, but it seemed much bigger, almost like a large bright star. as we got futher down hwy 78 i asked her what that was, she thought it was a tower light, but the tower was almost beside us and was flashing red. at this point the object was not moving, but you could tell from the size of the lights it was big.. i thought it must be a large cargo plane moving slowly and low, but this was not moving and was to big for that..I looked at the time it was 9:15pm. as we got closer i could see that there was 4 lights and that they were white and very large in size. we pulled over on the shoulder by a local church driveway and i just stared at these lights. then, i seen a small red light about what seemed to be maybe 2 football fields infront of this object were just floating there, it was weird cause the red dot was like dead in front of it, she said it was almost like it was pulling the large object.. i pulled off back on to the highway and made a u turn into the between gas station, at this point i put our windows down and all you could hear was a deep humming, not like a jet or a plane, more like a electric current, we could see up under this massive craft, she descibed it as boomerange shaped and that the lights were split, like 2 on one side and two on the other, with a gap in the middle, same is what i seen as well.. there is no way a plane of that size could just sit there that heavy and without falling to the ground.. at that point it seemed as if the object was moving pointing more towards the west, i got on hwy 78 west, my girlfriend now had her window to the craft.. we were basically under it but it was a little off to her right, she said to me to hurry up it was moving slow but turning and the trees were in the way of seeing it.. this craft was low.. as i got on 78 i seen the red dot in front of the craft split into another round dot that was blue, and the red dot was already small enough. so, at this point there were a red and blue dot infont of the craft and all 4 lights still on. we were on the hwy but going very slow, at once all 4 lights went out and the 2 small lights were gone as well.. i got speed up to 65mph on 78 west up the road and pulled over on a hill, this would have got me in the direction it was going, as i pulled over, i got out of my truck and cut it off, i did not see or hear anyting.. i stood around for about 5 min and nothing... i have no idea what this was.. to be that massive of a craft and to be so low and i dont know how it keeping itself up.. when it vanished, it did not power up or flash away, it just went invisible..","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19870,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.8078889,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10092009-0004","longitude":-83.7984637,"occurred":1255061220000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1255106249000,"summary":"Bright

the north. the object was brighter than a star, had no other lights as a plane would and moved quickly and silently towards us. the light appeared to have some movement in it, almost as though it was rotating. bearing in mind that it was a very clear, very still night with no wind, the light passed overhead and appeared to be moving not only south but also straight up. as it faded, it's flashing became more apparent - being visible for a second, then invisible for a second, regularly repeating. this flashing was only just perceivable as it approached as the light was brighter. definitely not a plane, helicopter or satellite etc. it traversed the whole visible sky in a smooth arc in just 20 second or so and then was gone. once again, it was completely silent. we both discussed it for some time and could find no prosaic explanation for the object or its movement.\r\n\r\nalso worth mentioning perhaps is that for several hours after the sighting, my mobile phone (iphone) had no signal

30���s and her son who was between 8 and 9 years old at the time. i���ve talked with the mother on several occasions and found her to be coherent, intelligent, and very clear about the facts after repeated questioning. \r\n   the event took place on a clear, cold spring morning in 1984 or ���85. they had gotten up early at the request of the son to watch the space shuttle fly by. the 80-year home is located in westborough mass. the house was a 2- story with 3 rooms on each floor. a triangular craft about the same diameter as the house was seen passing about 2 car lengths above her house. her son is positive that the craft had 7 lights in a v formation with one at the top and 3 on each side forming the v formation. she said that the lights were red in color and about the size of a baseball and they didn���t blink. it continued to move very slowly across the top of her house. at one point she felt that the craft stopped for several minutes above her home to observe them, then moved on. the craft took between 10-15 minutes to pass over and it passed so slowly that it was boring for the mother to watch. \r\n    shirley didn���t experienced any missing time although she would consider under going hypnosis to see if there are any lost memories. she said the streetlight was on, possibly blocking out the edges of the craft and she felt this is why she only saw the lights. shirley also felt had the craft been higher up it would have been very difficult to see. she did think of taking pictures but her son who realized the craft was not the space shuttle became very afraid of it and because of his fright she wasn���t able to leave him alone to get her camera. however the son described the craft as being black against a black sky. he could see it had a definite

photo the lights stopped in midair. i drove to the stop sign and turned left on bangs headed east. my hope was to get a closer look and a better photo. i gauged the distance to be past mchenry blvd to the east but when i got to the train tracks just before mchenry my vehicle was converged on from the fields from the north and the south (just before the autodealership on my right). i could see them from my front window approximately thirty to fifty feet with one being above the other. my two year old began to cry and my six year old said \"daddy, i'm afraid.\" i continued to the stop light and made a right. i traveled for almost two blocks through pelandale when my daughter said \"daddy, it is following us.\" i told her to pray and not to worry. as we approached the next light there was construction going on. (many workers repaving the road and a police car) i asked her if she still saw it and she said yes. by the time we reached standiford she said that it went away. i did not get a close look but would guess that it was not much larger than a vehicle. my daughter told me that she saw a window at the top with light coming out of it but she could not see anyone inside of the object.\r\n\r\nthe light to the right is from a barn or house. you can see the difference is clearly in the type of lighting and how the camera picks up the illumination from it. i have been told already that it was venus or mars, but i received an award in high school for astronomy having received straight a's in the course and i know this was not a star. i checked with the central valley citizen's for liberty and a

the morning on the 10th or 11th september. on our way home it was still dark. we drove north on ny thruway 87 and i looked out my front passenger window and saw a really bright star in the skye. in a second the star moved really close, got a little bigger and brighter and i said to my mom \"what's that!?!!\"\r\nmom: i was driving and when my daughter yelled out i looked where she was pointing in the sky. in the moments i glanced away from the road i saw a bright light quite close, about 2000ft high- below cloud level, basketball sized at arms length. the amazing thing was that it was changing as we looked at it. although it started out as a bright star-like object, it became surrounded by a dark-greyish mist or smoke and within, the single white light became a group of lights that flashed in series around an oval shape- the lights flashed around this oval object at least 2 times- i kept glancing back at the road as i slowed down. the mist around it began to dissipate and at the same time the object changed shape again from oval to triangular, but a strange triangle that was very dark with slightly swept back wings. the light configuraton changed at the same time to two large bright lights underneath and slightly back from the tip of the triangle shape- like two bug eyes close together. the mist was almost completely gone now. the object rotated so those lights faced us (west) and then suddenly a small light on the end of each wing appeared and began to blink alternately- one reddish, one white. so fast, so amazing was this transformation. i finally pulled over to watch and the object just seemed to 'float' in a westward direction toward pennsylvania over the thruway and behind a hill and trees. didn't hear any noise, no sudden bursts of speed, but it disappeared rather quickly- i glanced away for a moment to put the car in park and it was gone. on the way home i tried to figure out what it could have been- such as a plane making its approach for landing, maybe we saw various orientations as it dropped lower and lined up with the airport runway- but i've seen hundreds of planes, day and night and it didn't make sense with all the mist and light changes. my husband was a pilot and expert on aircraft through the vietnam war. has anyone else seen similar morphing objects recently in the area?  \r\nwhen i first saw the object i said- \"wow! , that's a ufo!\"- but i became unsure of what i saw on the drive home.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

a glowing light. the captain was positioning the boat over a fishing spot, he had dropped the anchor and backed the boat over the spot. \r\n   just as he rang the bell to signal everyone to drop their lines down, the mate on the back of the boat who was there to help us untangle lines and tie on new hooks, etc, pointed up and said \"look, a ufo.\"  \r\n   thinking he was joking i looked up and saw a glowing ball of light coming down the left side of the boat from the front. it continues past the boat, after it was maybe 100 yards away it turned left, went across the back of the boat, made a left turn and went up the right side of the boat.\r\n as it went up the right side of the boat it gained altitude, then accelerated rapidly up at a slight angle and went out of sight.  it made no sound at all. i looked back at the mate, said \"that was a ufo.\" \r\n   he said, \"we see them out here all the time.\"\r\n   he was not  excited at all, he went back to work helping take fish off lines as the fishermen caught them. it made me believe he probably did see a lot of them, he never mentioned it again. it didn't seem to be a big deal to him at all.\r\n   the ball of light we saw was not very big. it was hard to tell exactly how far it was from the boat but i'd guess it was 100 to 150 yards away and about the size of a beach ball. it made a straight pass down one side of the boat, turned 90 degrees to the left , made a straight pass across the stern, turned 90 degrees to the left again and went in a straight line up the right side, except as it went up the right side of the boat it gained altitude and accelerated. \r\n   it was not exceptionally bright, i would think if it had been during the day we might not have seen it at all. the night was very dark, perfectly clear but with no moon. the object seemed to be under control since it stayed the same distance from the boat all the time. it was like the object was looking the boat over.\r\n   i am not certain of the exact date this event happened but if necessary i could check with friends who were on the boat with me. they were visiting from out of state, would probably be able to help me pin down the date and time very closely.\r\n   i have been in touch with morgan beall from mufon in fort myers, florida. he suggested i make this report. i'll be happy in any way i can to help him investigate

freeway (interstate 5) through camp pendleton when all of a sudden a bright red light caught my attention to the left out over the ocean, maybe about a mile or so ahead of our car.  it was so unusual i could not stop staring at it.  i did not know what it was and it did not appear to be like any aircraft such as a helicopter or plane of any sort.  it glowed very intensely and pulsated at a regular interval, maybe 1 or 2 seconds apart.  the intensity of the light was strong and constant.  the color was ruby-like or light reddish.  my instinct told me this was not any regular flying craft that i knew of.  the light was much too intense to be of any known aircraft lighting system and there were no other lights blinking or stationary on it as you would normally see on a plane or helicopter.  the object was stationary for several seconds and then began to move eastward toward the san onofre nuclear generation station which was on the beach side of the freeway as we travelled north.  as it approached the nuclear plant it disappeared and faded away and then i knew this was no regular or military aircraft.  as its light disappeared i intently kept watching to see if it would appear again and only a few seconds later it reappeared on the opposite side of the freeway across from the nuclear plant near the mountain ridge where it moved eastward for a few seconds and then disappeared behind the mountain ridge into the valley behind it.  its light appeared to fade as it moved right behind this edge of the mountain.  i'm  wondering if this object was flaunting itself as it could be clearly seen by anyone on the busy freeway, and then all of a sudden, it wanted to travel over the freeway unseen and then reappear on the other side in clear view.  now, here you have a military base and a nuclear generating station together where an unusual flying object is seen hovering and flying, could it be attracted to these for some reason?  also, when it reappeared, it was near the several high voltage power lines emanating from the nuclear power plant.  could it have been attracted to the large magnetic fields of these power lines running up the mountain or could these have disrupted it power source as it faded away?  i used to be a skeptic but i am a firm believer now.  this is the real deal.
