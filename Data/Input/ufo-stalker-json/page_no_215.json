was a big white ball that was reflecting the ir-light from my binocuars and my hand held infer-red flashlight. i watched it for about 30 seconds. then my friend said \"what is that?\".  i turned around to see a bright green orb approach us from the west about 50yards away.  it stayed about 6 feet off the ground and moved slowly towards us until it was about 10-15 yards away.  then it stopped for about 15 seconds. it didn't move and never made a sound.  we just stared at it asking each other \"what is it?\". then it slowly moved north in the middle of the road for about 30 seconds till it disappeared. it never fluttered or blinked. both orbs were about the size of a big softball. we just stood there kind of confused. we weren't frighted at all and i had my gun on me.  i still don't

had part concave and convex areas to it on the side of the craft. in terms of shape, it had, as i recall, 5 sides to it, pentagon shaped.  there were no propellers and no sound, so it could not have been a drone. i would estimate it to be between 20 to 30 ft. wide and about 30 or 40 feet above the house. it was stationary and silent.\r\ni was the only witness and i stood and watched it for several minutes.\r\nwhat is odd to me, though, is that rather than getting my  phone and taking pictures and documenting the event, or calling other witnesses, i just went ahead and got the firewood

could see planes flying high above this going at a snails pace compared to how fast this object moved.It maintained a constant pathway straight forwards.The other guest summised that it could be the

to bed at 5am and when i woke at 5:33 am the object was further south west. i tried taking photos and video with an iphone which didn't come out well.\r\n\r\nthat evening my husband and i saw the same object in the same spot in the sky. we we're thinking this must be something explainable, or we're losing it! it was around 11pm. the object was in the se sky again in the same spot and appeared very bright and hovered. i told my husband i couldn't take this its to weird and headed upstairs for bed. as i got in bed and looked at the object it took off! it flew unlike any plan i've seen and seemed to go on its side then horizontal. it moved very fast up and over our home and nw. my husband also witnessed this. we ran out side and could hear a faint humming buzzing sound. we we're both in aww. chatted for a minute and went back to bed. then to my amazement or i'm really crazy i saw the strangest park. a very bright ball of whitish yellow light was to the east of the original object in sky. it was big! above the trees 500 ft or so and hovered and moved irregularly up and then in a blink disappeared.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

stopped then dimmed,changed direction and started heading north as toward indianapolis .Then it looked as though it had landing lights and proceeded north. after about a minute it became extremely bright.Brighter and bigger than any star in the night sky stopped flickered a few times then totally disappeared.I have observed these same type orbs at least 5 times in my life.Dating back to new
