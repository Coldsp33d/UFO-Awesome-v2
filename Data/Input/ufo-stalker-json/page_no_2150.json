it's time. i like to sit outside when the sun is setting and watch for things in the sky (hubble, iss, satellites, ect....), this one night, i was sitting in my chair looking due west when from the north appeared 2 extremely large ufos heading southwest. they appeared to be somewhere near the edge of the atmosphere and if i had to guess, each would be approx. 3-5 miles across. as they headed from the north to southwest, they were crisscrossing with each other and then just vanished! the whole event lasted about 4 seconds. they were silver in color with a black center and had what looked like multiple cracks on the underside. the sun was also reflecting off of them, giving them a gold/yellowish/orange appearance. a month or so later i was watching ufo hunters and realized that what i had seen was done in an animation for the show.You can view it on youtube \"ufo hunters giant ufo's 1/5 :25\". pause at the 25 sec mark. i've had 2 sightings prior to this and 1 since, all different,

commissioned painting of the blessed virgin mary. all of a sudden, i saw three real old little men in the corner of my studio.  they were wrinkled and i knew they must be at least 90 years old.  they looked at me with deep compassion in their eyes as if they were anxious to see how i would react to their appearance.\r\nthey immediately started talking to me through mental telepathy.  \r\ni was at that time teaching about 75 people at a fitness center. i was teaching them meditation.\r\nthese were there words, \"the most important thing your world can learn is meditation because it will lift your vibrations to a higher consciousness.\r\nthank you for teaching this to your people.\"\r\ni cried and thanked them for thanking me and then before i could look up and wipe the tears from my eyes,

about midnight and was going to ironton to cruise with my friends. as i was driving east on old us 52 i noticed a blue chevy cavilere in front of me hit his breaks and slow down then take off like a shot about that time my car started acting like it was stalling out and i pulled onto an old access road to the dow chemical company in lawrence county where my car finally died and i couldn't get it started. i got out of the car and raised the hood not knowing what to do because it was dark and very desolate on that streatch of road at that time of night. i remember there was a high fog bank and it was near the treetops. as i was looking at my car i started getting an eerie feeling that i wasn't alone out there and i figured it was just my nerves then i notice a hum..Not hearing it more feeling it in my body like a vibration. then i notice a \"strobe\" thats how it looked over the road i had just came down. i slowly looked up and my whole outlook on life suddenly changed. there was a light there..It was on constantly yet ever few seconds it would strobe flash. it was in this fog bank but i could make out the edges because they were darker than the rest of the sky above me then as the light flased again i noticed another light out of the corner of my eye do the same. this thing was huge!! almost as big as the field it was hovering over. and as i looked around i saw another light off in the distance but it didn't flash. i stood there staring with my jaw dropped thinking how insignificant i was, how small and unimportant everything i did or ever will do was i wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. i stood there for a few minutes in shock then the thing moved! the lights as one unit move together up deeper into the fog and all i can see is the lights. there is another flash of the lights and it heads off to the north east at a pretty good rate of speed never making a sound but the fog swirled around it as it pulled up and away. not thinking i jump in my car and turn the key and it starts right up as if nothing had happen. i back out of the access road and start driving fast back to my home so i can tell someone about this as i look out my window to the east i see this thing topping the hills near us 52 and as it does it flashes again and is gone. this event is something that i will never forget. the size of this thing was impossible to be flying. i've only told a few people about this and of course they all act the same way so i never reported this until now and only because i watched the show on history i know what i saw and there are people there that are reporting something like what i saw. the one i saw didn't have the red light in the center but those pictures they show on the program was it..You can't tell the size of the object in the picture but thats it. i don't have any ideas as to what i saw i just know that on that night i changed, i had no fear of the object just awe and to this day i still catch myself looking up into the sky and especially in that area i still slow down and look around.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

laying on my back i was looking up at the sky otherwise i would never have noticed this object. i was looking at the clouds when suddenly i noticed what appeared to be a silver object that looked like a \"bb\" just hanging far up in the sky. it was very small and if i looked away i had to look very hard to find the object again. it was almost noon and it was a very suuny day with light clouds passing over. i watched the object for at least thirty minutes and it did not move. at this time i went home and got a video camera and returned to the exact spot on the beach. i layed down in the same spot and again found the object still in the same area. i was able to video about one minute before cloud moved in and covered the area.\r\n i work in law enforcement and the next day while on the job i told my beat partner about the sighting. he was laughing about it until as we were looking up in the sky we both spotted the object again! we were in the ewa beach area of the island about 20 miles from where i had seen the object the day before. after watching the object for some time we decided to go to the pacific tsunami warning center which is located in the sector and see if they had any type or radar that might be able to detect the object. \r\n upon our arrival at the center we were met by a gentleman who claimed to be a phyicist and the director of the facility. it was close to noon and very hot outside but the doctor and several other workers came outside to look at the object. we all spent at least an hour looking at the object even to the point of using my sniper rifle with a very high power scope to observe it. the doctor seemed truely fascinated by the object and commented that he might contact cheyenne mountain to see if they had it on radar. since it was very hot outside we finally left and the doctor told us that he would make some calls and for us to come back in a day or two so he could tell us about his findings. so the next day we came back and met with the doctor agian but this time he seemed to be in a big hurry and didn't want to give us the time of day. he quickly told us that what we had seen was venus and that he had to go to a meeting. it seemed like he was just brushing us off. i also contacted all the agencies in the area that launch weather ballons and learned that there were none up during the time we same the object (most are launched at night and explode by 0200 to 0300 hours).\r\n a few years later i was getting my pilots license and while walking out to the plane at the honolulu international airport i saw the object again! this time it was earlier in the morning, about 0900 hours. it appeared to be a little lower this time and was almost over the tower (as seen from the general aviation ramp side). my instructor and another pilot saw the obect. my instructor contact the tower and asked if they had the object on radar, their answer was negative. after taking off we were no longer able to find or see the object.\r\n i found it hard to beleive the doctors explaination that this object was venus. i have never heard of being about to see planets with the naked eye in the middle of the day with the sun burning bright. \r\n this object appeared to be sphirical in shape and looked mettalic like a bb. it was not bright and if you looked away from it you had to look really hard to find it again, so it must have been really high or really small. since the airport radar did not pick it up i am guessing that it was higher that the class b radar could detect or it was undetectable.","distance":"Over

with an explanation as to why these things were there video taped about 43 seconds of the objects before a fast moving cloud bank covered them up.\r\n\r\nwe have let some airport people see the video and they say it's not aircraft.\r\nthis sighting occured at 3:30 in the afternoon with blue skys.\r\n\r\nthe first idea brad had is that it could be the big dipper,but at 3:30 in the afternoon with blue skys?\r\nwe have also ask a few people that we know about that theory and no one that we know thought that was right either.\r\nthe skys were blue that day except for the clouds that you can see

sparkling whitish lights in a cluster of trees that buts up against a small waterway.  we wrote the insident off initally as being a mating territory for lightning bugs, which it resembled, however we both never saw anything like it before and found that this explanation to be questionable.  when we saw the ufo special where the woman in bucks county described the \"christmas lights\" we  both got goosebumps because her description was uncanny to our experience.  what we witnessed was what appeared to be hundreds of thousands of lightning bugs hovering and floating on and around the tree branches.  the lights were twinkling, but not blinking intermittently like lightning bugs do.  it looked like sparkles all over the leaves.  we didn't think to grab the video camara.  we sat on the deck for several minutes watching from about 60 ft length.  it's odd to me in hindsight that we wrote it off as lightning bugs and didn't try to film.  i seemed so convinced at the time it was lightning bug mating but after researching lightning bugs, it is clear to me that it was not them.  \r\ni wanted to share this because i was compelled to contact you after watching the bucks county woman share her description of what she witnessed.  the simulated images that were generated we're exactly the same thing we saw.  \r\n\r\nit gets even stranger for us because this same woman also saw lights in the sky that were the same as something we a few years after this event at my house on north concord rd. in west chester.  we saw from our back deck what i can easily describe as exactly the same thing the bucks county woman saw in the sky.  three, then four round lights moving slowly in geometric patterns, sometimes coming together and then merging back with one another.  the simulated video of what she witnessed was exactly what me, my boyfriend and his brother saw.  the lights appeared to be attached to something which was oddly shaped.  it was close to us at one point, maybe 30'.  again, we stood there watching it intently but never grabbed a camara.  i didn't have a video camara available at my house anyhow and a still photo wouldn't have done it justice anyhow.  it was just the movement of the lights in what appeared to be a planned, geometric pattern that convinced us of it not being a typical aircraft. this happened in the early summer of 2007 around 9 or

between glenn haven and box prairie. she stated she saw 7 total but i only saw four by the time i parked he van. they were moving slowly from south to north and back. two broke away and came east over fort collins but returned to meet back with the others. we parked the van on a remote country road to watch for 30 minutes. i wish  i had broght my camera or zoom binociars in with me but i did not. with sunset not too far away an hour or less we had a great reflection off all objects. these are by far the largest ufos i have seen to date and remind me of the ones that flew over tucson feb 15, 2009 . my daughters first so she will remember forever at age 10. i wonder why seeing them from our angle was so easy yet wonder why something this large cannot be seen from below perspective. there was a slight hase of polution in the air but not enough to mask these objects at the size. i had groceries to get home so we left hoping there would be others reporting on these from other locations. maybe people just don't look up too often at the sky especially in the day time. i also noticed we had almost a full moon and wonder if the ufos leverage this to their advantage on these nights.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

destination, we were driving through round rock, tx on i-35 south, and i saw these lights ... about 3 white ones, and 2 red ones just hanging there above the interchanges.  at first, i thought it was just a slow-moving plane; however, as we came closer, i said to my husband, \"look! it's just hanging there!\"  he said, \"it's just a plane.\"  i responded that planes \"just don't hang\" in the sky; they must keep moving.  he said that it could just be \"one of those military planes that can do that.\"  i said, \"what exactly type of military plane can do that?\"  he said he didn't know, but he was sure there was one.  the entire time we were having this conversation, i was watching this thing, and i kept telling him that it was still there, and it was not moving.  i said, \"it's a ufo!\"  he said he didn't think so.  i said, \"if god can create our world and all of these people and give us the intelligence to create all that is around us, do you think he just did it for only earth?  i don't think so.\"  he said, \"maybe; i don't know.\"  \r\n\r\nas we continued to drive, we couldn't see it any longer.  i am a believer in ufos as my family saw them on a trip to colorado hovering over us for miles, darting back and forth.  i was about 10 years old at the time, but it is a vivid memory.  now, some years later, i see this thing just sitting stationary over a very busy city and
