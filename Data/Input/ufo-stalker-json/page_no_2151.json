asu's library . the neighborhood of small businesses and offices was dimly lit at that time of evening, and no people or cars were moving in the vicinity, nothing distracting my thoughts or vision. as i walked eastward, a phalanx of seven lights came directly overhead from behind me, flying very low, maybe 60-80 ft., it seemed. my first thought that it was strange that a jet would be flying so directly eastward at such a height; but there was no noise at all accompanying the lights. i strained to make out a shape, but couldn't make out anything between the lights. but they moved with completely uniformity. i felt confusion for several moments as my mind instinctively sought for a familiar pattern, and then i experienced apprehensiveness and a growing thrill as i realized that this thing that was moving just a bit above me, slowly and silently, was completely foreign to anything i'd ever witnessed. it moved with an uncommon slowness, so that at walking speed i was not being rapidly outpaced. i had an impression of its bulk and smoothness of motion; the mere visual description can't capture the feeling that it was moving in a different kind of space, which gave it a sort of presence. i don't mean a sensed intelligence or something of that kind; though there was a kind of leisureliness about it, the sort we associate with a car of sightseers. there was nothing upsetting about it, but a kind of exhiliration and curiosity as i began to follow it more closely; i expected the lights to shift, to take on a more familiar mechanical motion or in some way show that this was an ordinary phenomenon, maybe several small craft, viewed from an unusual perspective. it wasn't. it's speed remained constant, and after a few minutes, never altering its course, it was lost to view.\r\n\r\n   it took about as many minutes to get to my home & i told my family about the experience, but didn't think to report it to anyone. a couple of days later, the 'phoenix lights' sightings took place, and i recognized a difference between the sighting of the lights over the south valley & those reports of an object that corresponded to the one i'd witnessed. \r\n

popped up in front of us again. so i took out my little camera and waited, a few sec later saw it way far off to the north east, really dim then it kind of blinked out and it was right in front of us again but there was 2 of them. they just hung there for about 10 to 20 sec, i got some video of them then they just disappeared. all the cars that had been behind us had pulled over and were watching, and a man pulled up next to us and asked if we were seeing this. while we were talking they re-appeared but this time there were 3 of them, they just hung there then kind of bounced up and down, hung there again, then they were just gone. i also go a little of that on camera. all of a sudden it seemed there were jets coming from all directions, there had been no sound until the jets showed up, and after the jets came we didn't see the lights again. they were very large and bright orange, similar to looking a street lamp from about 50yards away. it really was the most awesome thing i have ever seen. i have the footage on my camera but have not downloaded it yet, i also drew a pic but i have no scanner.  my son was scared out5 of his mind, my husband and i were both really excited, as was the man that pulled up next to us. the whole thing lasted about 20 min or so we stayed and watched for nearly half an hour more and saw nothing else except lots of jets flying around. my family watched out the back window of my truck the whole way home and saw nothing

drowned out by the nearly full moon. while looking at jupiter, 5 minutes later, i noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving underneath it, from south to north. it was a star-sized white light, and living a mile from the regional airport and numerous military airfields, i am confident saying it was probably not an aircraft. i say it resembled a satellite because we've seen the iss, space shuttle, hubble, and other large objects in orbit passing at their prescribed times. this particular \"satellite\" passing by jupiter seemed to light up, or appear, while on a staight trajectory to the north, nearly 45 degrees from the eastern horizon. it's path lasted only about 5-10 seconds, before it went dark. it was far too slow to be a comet or shooting star, and too fast for a plane at that distance. after it disappeared, i followed the same speed and direction visually, to see if it would reappear, but it did not return. i began to describe it to my wife, who had not seen it. while i pointed towards jupiter and motioned the direction of what i saw, an additional light appeard about 70-80 degrees up in the eastern sky, just a few \"inches\" above jupiter, moving in south-southeast heading. my wife instantly saw this other \"satellite\" which we both describe as a star- or satellite-like white light, moving quickly and deliberately. the part that caught my attention, is that the second object, continued on a path that intersected the path of the first object, just seconds later. it continued traveling south-southeast for another minute or so before also just fading away. i have heard that there are many satellites that cross paths, and nearly miss often. but, minutes later when i checked the satellite tracker for our area, no satellites are to pass for another four nights from now! in the past several months, we have noticed, to our suprise and awe, lots of \"runaway stars\" in the night sky between 8-10 pm. most are mundane, but some change directions. tonights objects were intriguing because of their apparently close proximity, and the fact that no satellites were scheduled to be passing over. i have seen hundreds of shooting stars, and these objects were both not shooting stars. i suppose they could be top secret super-sonic high alt. military planes, but they are not very top secret if they have blaring white lights on them. i will keep my eyes to the skies watching these \"moving stars\" at night, as we see them quite often from our backyard.","distance":"Over One

group of flashing/rotating lights coming from the southwest in the direction on the highway. my first thought was i am looking at a helicopter approching. but at second glance the motion\r\nwas all wrong for a copter. it hovered then had a short burst of acceleration the hovered the a very fast acceleration covering what i estimated to be about 5 miles in a matter of seconds. i am still thinking \"this must be a chopper !\" the craft the in a final burst of speed crosses the highway in front of me, i estimate it is about 150 to 200 feet high and its huge! maybe 200 feet across, i can see 2 very bright lights at the ends of a long fairly thin dark structure, as the craft banks to the east it pauses in its turn and tilts slightly and hovers for just a second or two. at this point i can see three lights at the edges of a very large dark structure with a multitude of multi color chasing lights stemming from its center to the lights at its points, as it makes a very tight turn to the right. there is no sound at all ! as it turns the 3 main lights turn to a dim red in color, i can see it is triangle shaped, equal sides. as the craft passes over my truck it seemed to be turning on a central axis as it banks (kind of like a frisbee toy) at this point i have no idea what this thing is! it heads back southeast and i can see that the sides of the triangle are a bit concave and have a \"airfoil\" shape giving it the apparance of a 3 point boomerang ( a bit fat in the center) i can clearly make out a 4 centrally located light orangeish in color as it pulls away i can clearly see it had rows of lights on the edges of the body. the body was black but had a slight \"shimmer\" to it. i was driving about 65 or 70 miles per hour and this thing completes its turn before my truck can pass under it. as it clears the highway it pulls out at a very high rate of speed\r\nand is heading toward the southeast in the direction of what i assumed to be the goodyear muni airport (saw the blue runway lights in the distance) and in a second or two it was half way to the horizon. then it was just a speck of light (still flashing) on the horizon. i was amazed, still no quite sure what i had just seen, then a bit frighten! the totally excited, the images kept replaying in my head! the whole thing had a serreal feel to it. i have never seen anything remotely like this. i kept doubting what i saw trying to come up with a logical explanation for what had just occured. i could not think of anything else to do so i posted it on my facebook page while i was driving. then i called my wife and told her. i had to stop at the very next rest stop to compose myself. i kept watching the sky for most of the remainder of my drive to los angeles. i kept thinking \"it should have made some kind of a sound!\" i have always wanted to see proof of these type of aircraft, now that i have seen this one i my not so sure i would like to confront another !\r\n  ","distance":"101-500

points.  it looked to be that:  a menorah.  my husband, who is retired from the police profession and always very skeptical, saw what i saw.  i don't know what my husband felt, but i felt as if the star was going to \"land\" on us where we were sitting.  i began to move my beach chair at that point (i thought to get out of its way), when it just stopped, and began to develop as i've described above.When it all disappeared up into the skies, i asked my husband, \"did you see that?\"  \"yes,\" he said.  we were both very surprised and puzzled.  \r\n","distance":"101-500

there were no personal computers, scanners, digital cameras, fax machines, hand calculators, hard drives, printers, cell phones, cds, vcrs, video cameras, or microwave ovens.\r\n\r\nfirst let me preface this by saying i was at the time a very light sleeper. i had two young children in an old wooden house and i was very worried about fire. my wife and i slept upstairs and the children downstairs, and i could hear a pin drop. when i related this story to others, their first reaction was to try and come up with a rational explanation. since it happened while i was in bed the first reaction was ���\" you were dreaming.\" i suppose that was possible, but i know the difference between a dream and reality. although a dream can be as real as it gets, once you wake up you realize that you were dreaming. \r\n\r\nthe bedroom upstairs was a converted attic with double hung windows at either end. our bed was situated under the south window with the head against the window and the foot towards the north window. the north window was open that night. it had no screen on it.\r\n\r\nsuddenly i was startled out of my sleep by a flash of light emanating from the north window. i thought it was lightening and was wondering if i should close the window to keep out the rain should it start to rain. then i noticed that there was something hovering about 3 feet outside the open part of the window. it appeared to be about 12 inches long and about 1/2 inch in height. it had an iridescent glow. it was not moving laterally, and appeared quite stationary. i was fascinated. \"what the heck is that \" i thought. i was lying on my back with my head raised slightly by the pillow. it hung outside the window for about 10 seconds when it began to move in through the window. now my curiosity suddenly changed to concern. it was about 3 feet off the floor and moving slowly toward my feet at a rate of about one-foot per second. i watched in fascination, not in fear, but motionless as it hovered past my toes. i decided that when it gets a little closer i would make my move and grab it.  as it floated over my stomach i made my move, or tried to make my move. when i went to grab it i realized that i was paralyzed. i could not move a muscle. as it moved closer to my i head i could see that it's shape was round like a fluorescent bulb, there were no distinguishing features - only this eerie glow. at this point i should have been scared to death, but i wasn't. it stopped moving when it got over my face. it was about one foot above my eyes. then it started making noise. sort of an electronic gibberish that i had never heard before. (in retrospect, it sounded a lot like a computer connecting to the interned through a modem)  it hung directly above my eyes for about ten seconds making these weird sounds. then the sounds stopped. i still could not move a muscle. it hovered motionless above my face for several second then rapidly accelerated toward the open window. as it began to move my muscles came back to life, but i had no chance to catch it because it was out the window within a second. once out the window it veered up and eastward. by the time i raced to the window it was gone.\r\n\r\noddly, when i relayed this event to my next door neighbor a couple of days later, he and his wife had a \"ball of light\" story of their own. they claimed a ball of floating light, some years earlier, had startled them while cleaning up after dinner. it floated through the glass of their closed kitchen window. they said it was about 9 inches in diameter. they were scared and stayed well away from it. it floated very slowly about shoulder high through their kitchen, turned 90 degrees, then moved through their living room and out through a glass storm door. they said it floated slowly across the street and hit a dog that was sitting on the porch of a home across the street. they said it killed the dog.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

helicopter, or airplane light, falling exactly straight towards the ground. it was hard to tell about how far away it was, possibly 5 miles or more.\r\nthe light was not flickering or flashing, it was a steady light, as it fell directly toward the ground, it disappeared about 100-200 feet above ground.\r\nwhen it came into view, it was only as high as we could see it out the windshield. what made us noticed it at first, was the contrast of the light from the cloudless country sky. there where little to no clouds in the sky, as most stars where viable, after just few seconds of focusing on them. \r\nthe light itself was much closer than any star. \r\n\r\nthe velocity of the light falling, was that of an object being dropped, like the force of gravity. it was not slow, nor was it oddly fast. it seemed like an average falling speed, for something like, dropping a baseball, or rock.\r\nlike i said before, it seemed like 100-200 feet above ground, it dimmed out, until it was no longer visible. the light itself was not visible or traceable after it was darkened. the rate that it dimmed, was that of a headlight, or lamp, being turned off. \r\n\r\nmyself and my brothers personal

just slightly towards the west.  you'll see a faint, nearly straight-line path that i've calculated continues at a very steady heading for 100.9 kilometers (about 63.7 miles), all the way to the edge of the high-resolution area of the images.\r\n\r\nthis path is too consistent in size, appearance, consistent heading, and length to be a fracture line, rolling boulder from an impact, or any other

her condo was located across the street from the beach so instead of going to bed i went to sit on the beach as it was unseasonably warm and there was no moon that evening and given fernandina beach is 30 miles north of jacksonville, there was hardly any light pollution making the stars seem brighter than i'd seen them in a long time having lived in a large city for so long. a few minutes after sitting down and gazing east at all the stars over the ocean, something unusual caught my eye.  over the sea - i estimate it was approximately 1 mile away (it seemed to be above some fishing boats moored off-shore) and about 35-40 degrees above the horizon, was something that resembled a 55 gallon drum (not so long as to qualify as a cylinder - but it was the only shape that fit) shaped object having alternating red and blue lights studded on it, slowly rotating counter-clockwise.  of course, at first i thought it was a satellite, but as i watched, it started moving up, down and around enough to indicate it was not a satellite.  still scanning the sky, i spotted another object exactly like the first - north of it, except this one was a bit smaller or perhaps further out, i don't know.  the objects were spaced just far enough apart that i couldn't watch them together.  after approx. 15 minutes, i returned to the condo to get julie so she could come witness these objects with me and to see what, if anything, they would do.  at about 11:30, the smaller ufo to the north disappeared when we were not looking so we concentrated on the larger object.  finally, a little after 1 a.M., the object started rotating faster and faster until the blue and red lights became a blur of purple.  the purple light then got brighter and brighter in color until before our very eyes - it turned into a star!! i was dumbfounded.  i asked julie, \"did you just see that ufo turn into a star?\"  \"yes,\" she said.  the ufo turning into the star took less than a minute.  the crazy thing was this thing now looked exactly like all the other stars in the universe and i've never looked at stars the same way since always wondering, \"are you really a star?\"  too, when i got back to work at the law-firm on monday, i related my experience to an attorney i worked with and she said she'd seen something similar happen in florida years earlier, whereby a ufo turned into a star.  unfortunately, my camera would have never picked up on this object.  \r\n","distance":"Over One

east, and the \"large star\" i had barely noticed was actually moving.  it seemed to be heading towards me.  i looked for blinking lights.  none.  i would say it was at about a 75 degree angle or so from the horizon.  with no blinking lights, and a similar sighting to this back in may, i was betting it wasn't a plane either.  after about 5 seconds of traveling in a south westerly direction, it veered to the left (my left) and turned around, going back in the direction it had come from.  then, moments after that, it started getting dimmer and dimmer and smaller and smaller until it completely disappeared.  the whole experience only lasted a few seconds, and after having done one mufon report during the summer, i thought quickly and looked at my watch which said 7:29 pm.
