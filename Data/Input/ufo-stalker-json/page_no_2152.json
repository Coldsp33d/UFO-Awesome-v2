the building that i work in, in philadelphia . it materialized about a foot away from me, blocking my way and making a buzzing sound, it then took off and dematerialized in approximately a 6 feet distance. at this time i decided to turn around and leave the roof.  \r\n\ti found a photo of the object here.      http://www.Ufoarea.Com/aas_ufophiladelphia.Html\r\n\tabout an hour later at 3:45am i was walking through a machine room on the roof, near the same location of the orb, when i encountered a 3 foot tall triped creature. it was standing by an electrical transformer looking up at the conduits.  i observed it for about 30 seconds from a distance of four feet before it turned around and noticed me. i was looking down at it! it had a beautiful baby blue eye which was moving rapidly, just one, a long eye lid and rubbery looking legs with bulbous feet. i could see it was starting to panic because it started stomping his feet like a mad skunk or jumping up and down and making a high pitch squeaking sound almost like a cats toy. i was blocking it���s way to the open roll up door leading to the roof behind me. i put up an open hand in a gesture to let it know that i wouldn���t hurt it and backed up towards a different part of the machine room, away from it���s path to the door, but kept my eye on the creature. i watched it walking down the isle slowly when it started to move. it stopped where i had turned to get out of its way, it then turned and looked me over for a couple of seconds. i couldn���t help myself and started to laugh at it. i felt like a child who saw a monkey for the first time or something! i got the impression that it was thanking me but i think i also offended it because it started to leer at me and it's eye changed to a lighter color. i could be wrong, it may have took a bow! the triped then took off running in the direction of the door disappearing behind machinery in the area. i didn't feel threatened in any way by this creature but i was quite sure that cornering it was a bad idea! in hindsight of this encounter i'm left with a feeling a of wonder. the buildings electrical generator was permanently shut down about a year ago.\r\n\t on this same morning i'm doing my paper work in the control booth, and a larger than man sized praying mantis comes up to the window and just stairs at me for about a minute. i did not feel comfortable with this encounter considering the nature of this kind of insect. i sat there and didn���t move a muscle until it left. i have also heard screeching sounds in the roof machine room, in the direction of the roll up door which made my hair stand up on the back of my neck around the same time for 2 nights. \r\n\tthe next night 8-16-09 i'm mopping the floor in the machine room, on the roof and i come back to the sink to fill my bucket and there was a little springs and clip neatly arranged next to each other on the floor in front of the sink. i think the triped came back. there was no one else in the machine room. was it trying to tell me something, were they gifts or was it trying to help me? i don���t know. its a mystery! the triped may have been back the next night too, but i didn���t see it! it had moved stuff around like a toddler would have. it was into everything exploring i guess.\r\n\ton 8-18-09 at around 3:00am i was witness to a giant bird above eakins oval with a 40 foot wing span or better, it had rectangle shaped wings and no tail feathers, i didn't see any feet or head either. all i could make out was the huge wings with all of the feathers moving in the breeze and there were hundreds of them, there were no primary feathers that i could see. it looked like a enormous kite. i'm a bird watcher and never seen a bird like this before. i was really quite fed up with all the paranormal stuff happening to me at this time so i watched it for about 4 minuets and decided to just ignored it and go on about my business before it did something really weird and unexplainable. \"wow \" a sumerian god come to earth! an angle maybe? i can take see an alien off my bucket list! nothing else has happened since.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19742,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2097416,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09302009-0004","longitude":-77.1906447,"occurred":1250329500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,

i went out on my deck to investigate.  i glanced at the rare, clear northeast ohio sky and noticed a very bright sparkling object in the northeast sky at least twice as bright as venus.  it was approximately two fists at arms length above the horizon and two fists at arms length on a 30 degree angle to the left of a very bright moon. it looked like a plane with green, red and white flashing lights, but it was a lot brighter than a plane or jet would be.  we are near akron-canton airport and see many jets coming in for landings. this object stayed stationary in the sky for over 5 minutes. i called my 21 year old son to the deck to see if he could tell what it might be. he suggested i get the binoculars to get a closer look. when i focused the binoculars i could see  an undetermined shaped object with sparkling red and white flashing lights across the bottom and a flashing green light on the top. it sort of had an egg shape or oval.  the lights were interesting because they seemed to brightly sparkle like a pyrotechnic device and not just blink on and off. the white light would hold for a moment now and then and seem to light the adjacent night sky near the object like a glow.  we watched the object for 45 minutes, and then i thought i would call the airport to see if they had anything on radar, but the airport information line was closed.  my son called his friend at hiram college to the north to see if he could see anything unusual, but he reported negatively.  my son also called another friend straight east of our location in atwater (about 4 miles away) and he did not sight anything. my wife (who does not believe in ufo's) came to the deck to see what the commotion was all about, and even she questioned what it could be as she looked at it through the binoculars. later, my son said he thought he saw another faint sparkling object in the binocular frame to the lower left, and sure enough, there was another dim sparkling object similar to the original off in the distance.  the space station had orbited at approximately 8:30 p.M. that evening.  this object stayed stationary for the hour that we observed it. i finally had to go to bed, but i just wanted to know if there were any other sightings that evening in northeast

the sun was just comming up and beginning to illuminate the eastern sky. i saw what i thought was a star directly overhead yet it was moving quickly in a straight line in a west to east direction. i thought it might be a satellite or even the space shuttle until another smaller glowing object broke away from the main object and began traveling in a northern direction at a hight rate of speed. the main object continued east at an extremely high altitude and had covered the distance from directly overhead to the eastern horizion in less than 10 seconds! this made me believe that it was no satelite or space shuttle because of the immense speed at which it traveled. as it neared the eastern horizon, it briefly illuminated brightly as if it were metallic and reflecting the rising sun. there was no vapor trail or anything to make me believe it was a jet or shooting star. the smaller object breaking from the main object, both travelling in straight trajectory, and both travelling at extremely high rates of speed made me believe i may have been witnessing some form of experimental aircraft or spacecraft.","distance":"Over One

yard watching the game and grilling around 10:00pm i witnessed a ball of light that was moving at the speed say of a shooting star.  initially that is what i thought it was except for how low the object was in the sky and no trail like a meteor would have.  low enough that when it tumbled through it was obscured by the tree line.  total sighting lasted less than 1 second.  i was the only one to witness this light and it had for lack of a better description spikes of light coming from it.  so on our way home we were discussing my sighting.  we were on kennedy highway in bellevue ne around 11:15 pm.  just outside offutt afb!  i am now looking in the night sky because of what i had witnessed earlier.  i then saw what looked to be a star just appear in the sky.  this [portion of the night sky had no objects in it no stars, no planes, i asked my girlfriend what is that and she replied it looks like  a star.  i said i don���t think it is a star keep your eyes on it while i navigate the highway.  she then replied omg it just disappeared.  i looked and there was nothing there.  it didn���t fly away it just disappeared.  the sky was wide open nothing to obscure our vision of the object. \r\n\r\nso we were merging to interstate 80 when my girlfriend replied omg there it is again.  i looked and this time we had a clear shot for about 10 minutes.  it was bright but was yellow with lights coming from the bottom and shooting from the top and the sides just like a diamond.   this time it was descending!  she exclaimed omg its getting lower. it got low  enough that it was obscured by the tree line but you could still see it shining through the trees.  so again i said you watch it while i merge.  to merge on interstate 80w from kennedy freeway we had to go around a curve as we got on 80w  i said i see it but now it was on the other side of the highway and my girlfriend exclaimed there���s two of them. they were identical in every facet!  look, height in the sky, movement! at this point it was now serious!  i was looking at one to my left and she was looking at the one to our right.  they were at the same place in the sky height wise.  she asked me to pull over.  i got off the highway and pulled on to 60th st.  we took a left turn off of 60th st onto grover street with both objects in plain sight.  i asked are they moving i knew they weren���t i just wanted her confirmation.  i said tei i am going to get as close as i can i am going to try and park right underneath it. crazy thought but i just had this need to know what i was looking at!   as soon as those words came out of my mouth the object just started moving slowly away.  the second object was no longer visible as i was concentrating on the object i wanted to park beneath.  i am retired air force.  i have worked with f-16���s, f-15���s, f-4,s  helicopters,  b1, b2,  u2 and sr71!  i have seen the space shuttle in flight!  i worked satellite intelligence for over 14 years and held a top secret security clearance.  i know aircraft and what i/we saw last night  on 3 separate occasions was not a plane! take it for what it���s worth but this is an accurate account of what we witnessed 28 september 2009!   ted\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:15:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

on my recliner in my living room. i was watching my television and i noticed something in the trees. i looked through my big glass window that looks onto the back of the apartment building. i saw three aliens or some kind of beings in my trees. at least i thought they were in the trees. the tree line is about 10 feet my window. they were about 4  feet off the ground. i was scared to death, i could not move, i just froze with fear. there were three of them. they were sitting side by side. at least i think they were sitting, hard to tell because they were translucent. i could see right through them, seeing the leaves move behind them. like in the movie ���predator��� they were kind of see through but the outline of them was visible. they were on a platform. they had very long arms and the width of their bodies were about 6���. their height was maybe 1 foot, hard to tell since i was not sure if they were sitting or standing. this was about 10.Am around the first week of july, of 2009 in milwaukee wisconsin. i am in an apartment complex that is two stories��� high and 10 apartments wide. mostly very nice mexican people live here. i am from georgia. i mention that in case this becomes significant since there are so many sightings of  ufo���s in mexico.\r\n in no way were these grays aliens that people talk about. the face was cone shaped. i could not really make out eyes or any features. obviously they were cloaked or thought they were invisible, i do not know. they stared at me the whole time, never looking around, just right at me for about 4 minutes. finally i got the nerve to stand up slowly and make my way to the front door. i knew the window was open; i wanted to close it because i was afraid they would come in and abduct me. or do experiments as we hear about what happens to people.  as i had my back to them for only a second, i turned to look back but they had gone. i then went too quickly to my neighbor���s apartment. she asked me if i had seen a ghost. i said just something very weird. i would not tell her for being afraid of her thinking i was crazy. i was so afraid i told no body. not even my boyfriend who was out of town for the next two weeks. i was there alone.\r\ni want to let you know. i am a 48 year old woman from georgia. i do not do drugs, i do drink a beer here and there but i had not had any beer for about a week. i have never hallucinated or imagined anything in my whole life. i am not on any prescription drugs and have never been on them. i was really seeing this and wish i had never had. so when mark came home from working in canada i did not tell him even though i was still scared. a couple mornings after he was home he woke me to ask if i have ever seen anything weird out the back window.  i said yes, why are you asking me? he was scared, i could tell as he started to tell me that he saw three beings out the back window in the trees that he could see through. it was about 5:30 as we slept in the living room all night since it is cooler then than our bedroom. we have had placed our mattress on the floor near the front door. he said there were three of them side by side with cone faces, long arms and almost he could make out eyes or holes where there would be eyes. he described them exactly as i had seen them and also they were on a platform. he said the platform was a milky color but still translucent. he could see the outline and see the leaves right through them. he said their heads were moving up and down, to the right to the left looking at the back of out apartment building. he was sure they did not see him since he was so far from the window near the front door on the mattress which is on the floor. when i am in my recliner i am only about 4 feet from the window. he said they were there for about 4 minutes also then they disappeared. when i asked him to point right where he saw them, it was interesting because they were on the right side of our window but when i saw them they were on the left side. remember now both times were in the morning and same description. he said they were doing something with their hands, maybe working controls? i don���t know, i am just scared out of my mind they will come back again. i was happy i could share this bizarre happening in out lives.\r\nso about two days after mark had seen them i was in my recliner watching television. it was around 9 a.M in the morning. i saw movement in the trees again and this time there was only one of the beings. i saw him for about only about 1 minute or minute and a half or so. this time he was in the middle of the window about the same height in the trees. \r\nhis cone shaped face and long hanging arms, looking right at me. i was very scared and had a look of fear on my face. mark was in the room and when he saw my face he saw i was scared but when he turned his head to look it disappeared.\r\nnow i have been analyzing this highly unusual event. i am scared all time. i am in fear they will take mark or myself to where to do what? why appear behind an old run down apartment building in virtually the same place area in the trees? \r\nthis has reoccurred three times in the morning hours. from about a minute and a half to about 4 minutes they stay to study mark or i? to take readings of the earth, say maybe they are measuring the earths magnetic field, gasses in atmosphere?\r\nare they planning an attack on mankind? do they want to become our friends? learn our language? are they just as curious about us as we are of them? do they want to reproduce with our species? do they want to use us as food? so many things run through our heads, why why here? why not appear at the white house, a museum, a school, a park or in a science laboratory? why behind an old apartment building at our window? are the other people in the apartments seeing them also? i am not ready to ask around. i want to move out of here as quickly as i can but for financial reasons i don���t see that happening anytime soon. maybe they will never appear again and my nerves can calm down.\r\n\tmy girlfriend mary is vey excited about this. she wants to see them very badly so she can take photos or video tape them to show the world. she says this is very important for the world to see that beings are showing up here repeatedly. she says they probably are not from another world but from another dimension. that maybe their laboratory in their dimension is situated right there at all times but the veil from our dimensions are opening up. they are not really in the trees at all but in their time and a different dimension. they could be opening and closing them. they are showing up as almost invisible, is that because they are scared that we will shoot them? they know enough that this is a common reaction among humans, shoot first ask questions later. do they even know we see them at all? mary says we can roll up a ball of yarn with a long string on the end. when they appear throw it at them, it might go into their place and we might see just a string hanging in mid air when they closed the veil. the yarn will not show harmful intent because we could put a note on it saying :become our friends, talk to us, we know your there. we could put a little present inside the ball of yarn. \r\n\tshe wants to bring in a high tech video camera, digital camera, regular camera, infrared camera, aura camera and a meter she has that can pick up very low frequencies that turns it into voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n

skywatching all summer.  we had witnessed many \"moving stars\" that would appear to flare up and sometimes go out.  it sparked an interest.  my brother, a supervisor at muhlenberg ambulance, brought home their night vision goggles...That apparently homeland security felt they needed.  he had also purchased a lasor pointer that summer.  earlier in the month, we had been flashing the pointer into the night sky and something flashed us back.  that had happened about 6 times in a row.  i remember as a small girl living in the country always staring up at the sky, just watching and waiting.  i don't know why i knew, but i knew there was more.  i had a sighting sometime in my teen years in a very public place.  it was around the area of reading, pa and looked oval, but very bright.  others saw it also, i called the reading airport and they said it was a blimp.  it didn't look like any blimp that i had ever seen.  i also had dreams into adulthood.  a very vivid dream i had was being inside a circular room.  i knew i was barefoot because my feet were cold, i looked down and saw a metal floor.  all around me the walls looked like blue jello.  inside the jello there were babies, fetus' actually, growing.  they looked normal...I  mean like normal babies, but they were pretty small to know yet.  i wasnt scared though.  then at the beginning of last spring, i woke up during the night.  it has been a lifelong occurance for me  to see things during the night.  it's just that since i was a little kid, it was only people or blob/bubble shaped things.  last spring i awoke to see a small gold disk, it almost looked see thru, not like you'd imagine it to be more like metal.  this looked almost like particles in a way.  it moved slowly toward me, but angling away...As if to not scare me.  it passed along side of me, and got into the corner wall up past my head and went straight up...Disappearing before it hit the ceiling.  so, back to this summer night.  we were looking.  my kids thought i was silly but we were all talking about being positive and believing that if there is intelligent life, they probably function at a higher frequency than us...Which is why digital electronics pick them up and not our \"dumbed down\" human eye.  i thought to being a child with no judgements or fear and said,\"lets sing twinkle twinkle little star\"  so we did...All of us.  we were laughing at ourselves and singing.  thats when my older son said, \"oh my god what is that!?\"  coming from the south right overhead, i don't know how high was this thing...It was nightime, but this thing appeared not solid, it had the oddest shape.  all i could say is that it looked like a gigantic cheetos, or wavy like the shape of coral.  it was maybe a peach color.  but it was moving, like an rolling but definately moving.  i had the night vision around my neck and looked up into it and saw like a hundred white specks or dots.  i just remember thinking maybe it was transporting something.  it was not illuminated, almost like just seeing a cloud in the night sky.  it looked like you could've put your hand into it.  it moved over us and just seemed to disappear.  we sat there dazed and were just in disbelief.  my older son said, thats it i'm going inside.  he did and thats when the 2nd object came from the west.  this was i guess oval or like a big pill, it was orange and had 3 lights that were definately illuminated right in a row.  when i looked with the googles the lights seemed shaped like diamonds.  it also wasn't solid, plasma? energy?  i have no idea.  it came directly over us and then turned on an angle to the south.  we all remember feeling very cold, perhaps it was us being freaked out.  my younger son said he saw something triangular shaped and black after that.  he was the only one.  but i knew what he meant because i had seem similiar black shapes move in the sky often.  i consulted my good friend, maree mulgrew, who is a well know intuitive in our area.  she believes that i have a connection.  my birth middle name is orion, which my dad said he doesn't know why he gave that to me.  she has told me pretty freaky things about my connection.  she said one was from the pleides and the other was from the orion but they shouldn't have came thru so close to eachother.  i just don't know.  both objects just seemed to disappear right after they passed over my property.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

something.  it was not illuminated, almost like just seeing a cloud in the night sky.  it looked like you could've put your hand into it.  it moved over us and just seemed to disappear.  we sat there dazed and were just in disbelief.  my older son said, thats it i'm going inside.  he did and thats when the 2nd object came from the west.  this was i guess oval or like a big pill, it was orange and had 3 lights that were definately illuminated right in a row.  when i looked with the googles the lights seemed shaped like diamonds.  it also wasn't solid, plasma? energy?  i have no idea.  it came directly over us and then turned on an angle to the south.  we all remember feeling very cold, perhaps it was us being freaked out.  my younger son said he saw something triangular shaped and black after that.  he was the only one.  but i knew what he meant because i had seem similiar black shapes move in the sky often.  i consulted my good friend, maree mulgrew, who is a well know intuitive in our area.  she believes that i have a connection.  my birth middle name is orion, which my dad said he doesn't know why he gave that to me.  she has told me pretty freaky things about my connection.  she said one was from the pleides and the other was from the orion but they shouldn't have came thru so close to eachother.  i just don't know.  both objects just seemed to disappear right after they passed over my property.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19725,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5556484,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09292009-0008","longitude":-75.9818772,"occurred":1217487600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,

(i graduated as valedictorian).  anyway they were interested in ufos and stood on empty stretches of beach (padre island, texas) and made circles and tried to call them down - without success.  i was never along on those nights and in fact it frightened me.  why it frightened me more than raw peyote is curious question...\r\n\r\nanyway.  the night in question i had drank some semi-concentrated peyote tea.  i'm going to say that straight out.  the reason i was out dancing in the field alone was that i felt wonderful and in tune with what was.  and it seemed to be the next step to invite them to respond. it was fully dark - at least 10 pm.  \r\n\r\nshortly after i did so i went back into the house.  there were 3 young men there.  we were staying in a farmhouse near round rock which had not been lived in by farmers for a long time (it was rented.)  the whole area was largely deserted.  two of the men were my friends and they had invited me to come out of the city and be at the farm and help keep the fire going around the large cauldron of cooking down peyote.  they had been working for days - getting it there, grinding it up, and they were tired.  neither of them to my knowledge had used any substance that night.  i do not remember there being any marijuana around.  the third man belonged to a band who used the house to practice in.  he did not know any of us and certainly did not know me.  i believe he took something - probably acid earlier in the evening.  \r\n\r\nwe were on an upstairs porch that faced hmmm, maybe southwest (i could be wrong about that.)  there were skudding clouds and few stars that were obscured and then shone.  it was a beautiful peaceful night.  \r\n\r\nthen the light arrived.  it zigzagged in front of eyes in long looping zzs.  then it steadied directly in front of us.  and then it landed slowly and straight down until its light was obscured by the scrub trees in that direction.  we watched the light shine through the trees.  and then the light went out.\r\n\r\nthe mood was still jolly at that point.  we decided to go see what it was.  there had been no sound of plane or helicopter and we thought it probably was a ufo.  the jokes were:  \"would jc come back in a ufo?\", \"should we carry a flashlight or will that look like a weapon?\"  \"maybe smiling (and showing our teeth) would not be polite.\"  we were ok with all of this.  one man had gone to bed pleading exhaustion.  i had awakened him to witness the light and landing and then he grumbled off.\r\n\r\nwe went outside and the mood changed immediately.  there were dogs barking (far off in all directions), mooing cattle...We walked about half the distance that we thought was the right amount to walk and then we couldn't walk any closer.  the hair was standing up on my neck, i was terrified, and my companions weren't in better shape.  we turned around and walked back to the farm house.  my friend gave up on the thought that i would tend the fire where the peyote was cooking.  in fact we were concerned that they might sample it, thinking it soup (peyote tastes horrible but who knows about alien palates?).  we went back upstairs but did not lock the downstairs doors as we felt that if \"they\" were coming for us that a mere wooden door wouldn't stop someone who had crossed a galaxy.  \r\n\r\nwe gathered in the living room.  i felt that they were close by.  by that i mean that i felt an intense feeling of contact of some sort.  i am somewhat pre-cognitive but this was far far more intense that anything i had experienced in any state of mind.  incidentally i had thrown up the peyote tea almost immediately and had had no hallucinations or such.  just a euphoria (which was now long gone).  my friend said, \"i'm going to go check the porch.\"  i really felt something was close and started to say \"no!\" but then thought.  if something is on the porch, we'll know momentarily.\r\n\r\nhe went and checked and said, \"there's nothing there.\"  which made me realize that maybe the closeness was a mental thing not a physical visitation.  however i had waves of fear and my friend knew that.  so i was amazed (in a bad way) when he said, \"i'm tired; i have to sleep, sorry...\" and stumbled away leaving me there.  the other unknown man had at this point disappeared; i never saw him again until the next morning when he tore out of the driveway after saying, \"i don't want to talk about this.  i never want to see any of you again!\" and i never did.\r\n\r\ni lay down on a bed with black cat which seemed to be living in the house.  it alternately purred and scratched me - but not to get away.  it and i were terrified, my heart was pounding and finally i thought, \"you are killing me.  i can't handle this.  i'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\nwith that my vision narrowed to tiny point (like an old black and white tv) and then i woke up fairly late in the  morning.  we all showed up downstairs at the same time and shook our heads and said, \"what happened here last night?\"  no one suggested that i had created it or had been hysterical or bad tripping.  we thought about walking down to where we thought it had landed (?).  but the circumstances of being in the middle of a botched mescaline batch and the thought of calling - who?  a county sheriff?  the press?  this was redneck country.  the legal consequence of being caught with even a joint was hard time in a prison.  we could not afford to tell anyone and no one would have believed us even if we had.\r\n\r\ni knew then that no one would believe us and particularly me.  i also knew that drinking or eating even a small quantity of peyote precludes sleep for at least 8 hours.  it is not a \"recreational drug\".  i never believed that i just \"fell asleep.\"\r\n\r\nthere are a few postscripts to this story.\r\none, years later a friend of mine who had heard my story told me that a man who was mayor of round rock told him that he had been awakened one summer night by two mexican kids who had ridden a burro over to his house.  they pounded on the door saying that there was a ufo in a field near their house.  he finally was persuaded to get up and get dressed and drive them out to where they said it was.  when they got to the empty field, they said, \"it's gone.\"  he had always assumed he had been hoaxed until he heard my story secondhand.  i never talked to him (i had moved away by then) and am not sure that we were talking about the same night or even the same year.\r\n\r\nthe farm we had been on was about 20 miles from a small air force base.  it was also near a large electrical transformer field or whatever those fenced yards full of electrical stuff are called.\r\n\r\nwhen i had my firstborn child at age 32 i ended up needing an emergency c section.  they rushed me into the operating room and were running meds into my arm to knock me out and my doctor (gowned and masked) leaned over me and said, \"goodnight paulette\".  i had a huge panic reaction because at that moment, before i went out as a terrified young woman in texas i remembered fading out and in that brief flash before i went seeing someone/thing leaning over me.  when i woke up and was handed a baby i was still traumatized by that memory flash.\r\n\r\nok.  and my kids have had their own experiences.\r\n\r\nand i've had subsequent experiences (not as dramatic).\r\n\r\nin my dreams frequently (even now) i am watching the sky and see, way way above me the stars start to move.  no one else seems to notice.  then one drifts down and down until it is over my house or outside my window.  i go outside.  i also go outside to meet with them. there is never any more to that type of dream.  (it is possible that other dreams are about aliens who are shapeshifters or can make people think they are people.  the reason i think these dreams are related is the compulsion to meet with them.  \r\n\r\ni was hypnotized by a woman who knew nothing about aliens or ufos but i had had a fear reaction in a workshop (about 1982 or 3) she gave in which she gave us relaxation inducements.  all good until she said, \"you are a child, laying in a field of flowers and there is a little cloud above  you..\"  and i jumped up screaming, \"it's not a cloud!\"  so she took me back in a session (later at her house) and i didn't remember any more details except on the tape i am speaking with a pronounced texas accent (which i had tried to get rid of, living in canada).  on the tape she says, \"and even though you were asleep, you remember what happened to you then.\"\r\n\r\ni sorta remembered her induction but i never heard that part until i replayed the tape.  i just lay there breathing until she brought me out.  there were fragments (and i am somewhat leery of hypnosis)in which i said that i associated the color deep green with whatever i contacted and also that my impression was that it/he was not comfortable here on earth - the air the gravity, whatever. \r\n\r\nthat's it.  the other incidents could be spoken of too.  i was not always stoned; in fact that was probably the turning point of getting that stoned.  i graduated from college, worked as a nurse and eventually i got my master's degree in counselling here in canada.  which is what i still do.
