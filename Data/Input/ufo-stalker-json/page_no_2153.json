i noticed that in the month of september there were a number of ufo sightings in the great lake area. this prompted me to limit my live webcam search to the great lake area specifically lake huron whose live webcam located on the shores of the city of lexington of michigan gave me a clear view of the lake. that sunday afternoon 4:30 in clarksville and 5:30 pm in lexington, mi the  weather forecast for that area was clear with sunny skies with a reported temperature of 70 degrees. like all live webcam cameras this one would refresh every few minutes which showed clear skies and it was in one of those refresh frames that i spotted a white object around the 1 or 2 o'clock position on the image. my first thought that came into mind that was a bird or a plane that was photographed by the camera. needless to say, i opted to save the image into \"my pictures\" window media and using the zoom tool it immediately became obvious to me that the white object in the image was not a bird nor of a plane. it appeared to me that this white object had a saucer disc with a faint shadow on the bottom of the object. i am not sure what it is and for this reason i respectively submitt this report for your analysis. attached is the original downloaded image.","distance":"Over One

called us, we run to the door and he pointed at the sky, asking: do you see that: what is it? and i saw some bright lights, that i first thought were stars, but soon realized they were moving very fast in a north-east direcction, and behind them was this huge red \"blob\", with an amorphous shape, moving and then seemed to stop right above us, still changing shapes constantly, then the bright lights in front of the \"blob\" for a moment only, seemed to start dancing around it, then, disapeared on top of the roof, continuing in ne direcction. the \"blob\" was red, not bright but it seemed to have its own light, and there were more lights inside it, also not so bright, but we could clearly see them. then the \"blob\" disapeared in the same direction of the lights. i rushed to the kitchen window at the other side of the house but i did not see the bright lights or the blob anymore. i think we watched this for 90 seconds or so.\r\n\r\nedgardo's account:\r\nlast saturday night, in san pedro california and around 8;15pm. my son,my wife and i saw several groups of lights traveling northbound(only my son saw that), when my wife and i came out the front door the movement was eastward. \r\nthe main or the largest group was an amorphous figure that look like a transparent net with about seven not so bright red octagonal pieces trapped inside and moving around the net thus making  continuous changes to the shape of the figure.It was pretty and geometrical.\r\n\r\nthe other groups were more like single lights following the big medusa described above.

had almost the luminosity of jupiter. the color was very close to that of jupiter as well. i watch the sky often and am very familiar with satellites, planes, etc. and this immediately struck me as something i have never seen before. my wife and child were with me and saw this as

though it were a star at first then i noticed an oblong shape to it. i carefully watched to see if there were any flashing lights on it but there were none. i listened for it, but there was no sound whatsoever. i watched for a few seconds as it headed south. it couldv'e been anything... was my initial response, there was nothing special about it, until it kind of veered to the right, then backwards and then back on course. freaky. if you ask me, whatever these things may be know more than we do. i swear each time i have wittnessed this occurence it was almost as though they saw me looking and wanted to make their presence known by manuevering in some odd manner. my heart raced as i watch this phenomenon, but something in me told me that everything was okay. crazy crazy crazy,

to san diego to help out my  grand parents.So my brother and i decided to ride our dirt bikes and were going through the check list of things we both asked of each other.I had to stay cause of summer school and i hoped of spending the fourth through the rest of the summer in california.So we started south on lovelake rd. and croseed the cattle guard between our land and ralph h. jr and leonard m. property(the road was gravel back then).We saw ralph in his apple tree orchard and tending to his potatos that he had tried to grow that summer.All of a sudden i got a real creepy feeling worse than the ghosts i've encountered and i had gone from feeling great that vacation had started to dread like i was going to die.I looked up the road and down and saw no cars and i stopped my brother and we sat their on our bikes for a while looking around, when i spotted a cigar shaped object a mile away and about a thousand feet to a thousand five hundred in the air.We thought it was a plane or jet liner but after ten minutes it was not getting any closer and now we could detect heat waves coming off of it whenever it moved left to right or went up or down i told my brother i thought it was a u.F.O. he watched for a while before saying he agreed.Our neighbor ralph looked where we were looking and watched for a while and yelled at us that he thought it was a plane.We ignored him and what he said cause now about twnety minutes elapsed and the damn thing still was bearly moving from it's original position.At this time i really had a sick feeling to my stomach but i could not stop watching it.It was about four-thirty then and a jet liner was approaching from the east and heading west and the skies were clear and no wind.It suddenly disappeared i looked south toward the white mountains toward sunrise which is visible from our house.I spotted what seemed to be a rectangeler mirror reflecting the sun light.Once the jet liner had cleared the area the object returned,by now i estimated the size to be about thirty feet in diameter and about twelve to fifteen feet thick and was a dark gray (it looked like two saucers put lip to lip)but when it would shoot off it looked like it was reflecting the sun light.It started to go up and down and circle some place i would guess was east of snowflake.Now a small plane approached from the west from the taylor airport (about the same height as the object and heading toward st. johns)) once again the object shot off (i never did see it till it was over sunrise where it seemed to be brighter) once the small plane was gone it returned and continued in that same pattern for the next hour.At about five-thirty we headed to the house and told my mom who got a friend to bring the binoculars and we watched as a jet liner appeared from the east again and the u.F.O. silently followed it while gaining altitude up behind it and followeed it into a dark cloud the jet liner emerged but the saucer did not.All the grown ups involved in this said it was a plane but they did not watch it like me and my brother for two hours.Plus the bad vibe i got from this thing was real bad.It's still is the most amazing thing i've ever seen! my father arrived about five minutes later and he usually arrived home at six p.M..","distance":"Over One

lights (yellowish-white in color) that appeared to be flashing in a rotating pattern around the object (which was dark and hard to see;but appeared to be blimp or disk shaped).  for a moment, all of the lights lit up at once in a 'solid' belt around the object. the lights began flashing again as the object continued its slow course.  this pattern repeated about every three seconds or so.  i estimate it happened about ten times; maybe more... the object continued to move along the i-17 corridor at low altitude (about the same or lower than some helicopter traffic i've seen in the area).  the object appeared to be very slow compared to an any aircraft i've seen around this area as well. we continued our trip home and also continued to watch the object.  upon arriving home, i went in my house to get my dad and a pair of binoculars; but when we went outside the object was gone.  i had a hard time understanding how something moving so slow could disappear that fast.  my dad and i scanned the sky for a few minutes; but didn't see anything else unusual.  we decided to report the incident; but think it may be possible that the object was a 'blimp'.  my mom disagrees and thinks it wasn't a blimp; but says she doesn't have any explanation for what it could be.  my dad did not see the object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
