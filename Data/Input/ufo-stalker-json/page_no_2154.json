eastern time on friday, september 25th, 2009. suddenly i saw a 4 point star shaped object that had a bright orange center surrounded by a hue that was mostly blue but looked green for a moment. it appeared high in the sky, very far up (i have no idea of how high it was) and fell in a slight arc, going slightly left to right across my vision, straight down, out in the direction of lapeer (east of me).\r\n\r\nit seemed to pulse slightly, although that detail is a little hazy. the entire event lasted just under 3 seconds. it was one of those situations where i didn't realize what i was seeing until it was already over. \r\n\r\nthe shape was a 4 point star, with points at 0,90,180 and 360 degree points. it seemed to have a curve going from point to point. the object had to be pretty good size, i would estimate it to be at least 200 feet around given how large it looked to my eye. it seemed to only be about 30-50 miles in the distance, but that could be perception playing tricks on me.\r\n\r\ni have seen shooting stars, i can promise this was not one of those. it could have been a meteorite or \"space junk\" or whatever, but the 4 points i saw distinctly and at night seemed to not just be a piece of random junk.\r\n\r\ni hope someone else saw this and can give their description of what was seen, it gave me chills!","distance":"Over One

tubing at ginnie springs. about 45 minutes into our drive, my brother, sister-in-law and i (the friends were passed out) noticed that the inside of our van was being lit from the outside. we were on route 121 (a dark, lampless country road with trees on either side), somewhere between the cities of high springs and raiford. eventually, my sister-in-law got of a glimpse of a light up in the sky from the corner of her windshield, but she was driving and couldn't get a long look. however, she got a good enough glimpse to be puzzled since she noticed it didn't have the same light or movement pattern of regular aircraft. my brother was in the passenger seat and on the wrong side of the road and only experienced the flashing in the inside of our vehicle. i happened to be sitting in the very back and was able to swivel around and stare out of the back window. what i saw was a large, round blue-white light which seemed a bit brighter and condensed at the center and had a diamond-like brilliance. it blinked steadily every few seconds and i would have thought it was a navigation light except for the fact that it was much too big (about the size of a full moon), much too bright (its flash lit up the night sky and the ground below as much as a full moon) and it was not stationary (it moved slowly in the same direction as ourselves and the road but we eventually left it behind). i stared at the object for the several minutes it was in view and i could not figure out what it was. as my sister-in-law observed, it did not move as fast as a plane would, there was no noise of a helicopter or steady helicopter beam, i don't think weather balloons have such a bright light source nor move so steadily. even after the object was lost to curves, distance and trees, i could still see its blue-white flash light up the sky for a few more miles. the entire encounter lasted about 10 minutes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19652,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.0638497,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09262009-0002","longitude":-82.2364997,"occurred":1253503800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1253978530000,"summary":"Large,
