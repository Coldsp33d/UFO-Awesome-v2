investigator report for a sighting i personally received outside of the mufon cms and is being submitted in accordance with mufon policy and should not be considered a \"second hand\" report, as it was investigated first-hand by a certified mufon field investigator who is part of mufon. the witness' contact information has not been given for this case, since the investigation has already been completed by a mufon field investigator and the witness does not need to be contacted again with a preliminary questionnaire.\r\n\r\nmufon ufo sighting field investigator report by mufon va fi/sip:\r\n\r\nthe witness was standing on his mother���s front porch with his son and daughter when his son drew his attention to an object in the daytime sky.  the witness first thought he was looking at the full moon when he first glanced at the object, as that is how large the object was in the sky.  the witness saw a very large, round sphere that was extremely bright orange in color, like the shade of an orange fruit.  the object was completely and evenly round.  the sphere was glowing with the color orange evenly over the surface of the object.  the sphere also had an aura extending outward evenly around the orb of a dimmer color orange that looked to be about one-sixth of the diameter of the object.  the witness also compared the color of the sphere to that of a harvest moon.  the approximate size of the sphere was that of an aspirin when held at arms length.  it was about 45 degrees above the horizon and very high in the sky, being at about the same altitude as a jet would travel that would leave contrails.  the object was moving in a straight line, slower than a plane travels.  the sphere crossed approximately 110 degrees of the sky in its flight path after the witness first noticed the object.  the object left no trail when crossing the sky and also made no sound whatsoever.  the witness observed it until it disappeared into the suburban tree line.  the witness stated that later a plane came overhead and had no reflection from the sun on it, so this verified that the object was indeed glowing with its own luminescence.","distance":"Over

walk the dog as usual. we got to the corner of the street and began to walk across.  i was half way across when i heard the thrust of an engine which seemed to be twice as loud as usual. i looked up in all directions thinking that it was a low flying passenger jet and saw nothing. the engine thrust lasted 5 to 7 seconds. i then looked stright up and saw a brilliant white light that seemed narrow in diameter. best description of light-take a laser pointer, change color to white, eliminate beam of light and look directly into light. there seemed to be what looked like static electricity form posibbly underneath for about 3 to 4 seconds then stopped.The object started to slowly move and i caught a split second look at what seemed to be a wing. i yelled at my wife to look at the object as it started to accelerate. as it started to move 3 lights came into view. as in a jet airliner, left blink followed immediately by right blink. the count 1 missippi for the 3rd light. this continued as it crossed the horizon. the object was noiseless as it moved. it moved from a crawl and within 5 seconds it moved like a japanese super train. it came to a stop at a certain point, but before it did, what seemed to be static electricity was flashing from left to right side. the object appeared to stop and hover and had a blinking light as it stayed in that position.  i took a step down from the curb to cross back to the other side of the street. when i stepped down, i looked over and saw that the object had moved what seemed to from a 45 to 90 degree angle and still had a blinking light. when i got to the other side of the street, i looked back and noticed that the light changed form a blinking to a solid light, the same as i initially observed. i talked things over with my wife and she mentioned the fact the for some reason, there was no traffic during this observation. the street that intersects as well as our street has a good amount of traffic at any given time. it seems as if we were in a time warp, if there is such a thing. also, in the horizon where the object stopped is where i always see planes taking off form the airport. neither may wife or i remember seeing any flights taking.

cottage.  at 9:00 pm i stepped out on the deck to call my wife to let her know i had arrived all right and while i was talking to her i was gazing at the stars as i do often in the clear north sky.  while i was looking i spotted what i thought was a satellite running from southwest to northeast.  as i watched it seemed to have a slight wobble to its pattern that i figured was do to a spinning motion in orbit and the reflection from the sun like an optical illusion.   this all changed in my mind when the object i was watching stopped just above the horizon (maybe if you used your hand in front of you and stacked four fingers from the horizon line to the object you would have the rough area.)  this object stopped briefly and then reversed along the same line to rise in the sky up a short distance and then stop again.  this object stayed in this location for at least a half hour but this is not the only one i saw.  i spotted what i thought (and may have been) another satellite moving in the same area in the northern sky near this object.  it moved from the west to north and just as it reached a parallel (from my perspective) it vanished.  i know that this is not unusual with satellites as they cross they will lose the reflection of the sun but this object was still high and centered enough to be getting the solid reflection.\r\n\r\nwhile i was watching the object a very bright intense flash from behind me distracted me.  i turned and spotted this flash in the south sky.  this flash was not regular, i would see like one flash then a pause then three quick flashes.  this was at 9:20pm and only lasted a minute or two and then the flash moved directly east of me in a heartbeat.  there were a couple flashes than it stopped.  so i went back to keeping an eye on the original object that was still in the same location.\r\n\r\nat 9:30pm while i watched the original object i kept scanning the sky for the flash or now anything else.  after a couple planes went overhead i took a glance at the west and spotted a much lower very bright white spot.  this object moved in from the west to the east and i thought it may be a plane but there were no navigation lights.  this object moved slowly in a straight path to directly overhead and then faded out and gone.  this was not a satellite as it was way to low in the lower atmosphere.  i am also convinced it was not a plane as the final view was solid white and i was under it so i would have seen the navigation lights easily.  this was a glowing orb!  with this a few moments later the original object vanished.\r\n\r\nwhile all this was going on my wife logged on and found some similar reports on the net of these objects located in northern michigan at the same time.  very odd!   i was sober and it was a very odd experience!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

sphere and light,green in color heading northwest towards me.  the were two other dimmer lights converging on the sphere.  direction of objects 40 mi southeast of tucson and davis monthan afb. i initially thought it was an airliner heading for the \"suns arrival\" into phoenix airport. i had noticed that there were no additional position lights, and the two other ojects were dimly lit with a slight reddish silver tint.  as a trained airline pilot, i found it odd that there was no starboard green or port side red, and the white marker beacon was non-existent.  this got my attention.  once the objects converged upon the brightest, the two dimmer spheres encircled it several times, and then dramtically increased in brightness.  after several \"spins\" at a high rate of speed (and it seemed they were accelerating in the rotations)in extremely close proximity to one another, the brightest (green) remained stationary, while the two other spheres accelerated to what appeared to be \"pre-set points\" to form a perfect right triangle in unison.  once the other two spheres broke from the green, the green sphere went dim. the spheres were stopped on \"points\" estimated at 40 miles apart.  estimated altitude of objects 60,000 feet.  size of all objects at estimated altitude would approximate the visible size of an md80 at 30000 feet of altitude. the spheres remained stationary, yet the right triangle began to rotate slowly in a clockwise motion while maintaining spacing and triangular shape.  once the sphere encircled the green, and broke for the \"points\" the neighborhood dogs, coyotes, and even my dog began to howl, bark, and whine.  this was also pretty strange.  the dogs and coyotes continued to howl for about 8 minutes, my dog was very nervous and \"whining\" and wanted to go in.  \r\ni watched for several minutes, and called my son out to look.  he immediately spotted the triangle and noticed a slow clockwise rotation of the triangle using the green object as a reference point.  the objects maintained what appear to be a perfect formation.  i went inside, and came out about 10 minutes later and the \"triangle of objects\" was gone.\r\nthere were 3 very distinct objects, and very discernable as \"spheres\".  there was no sound audible to my ears, and the neighborhood was void of city noises, but \"something\" clearly agitated every dog and coyote around for 8 minutes or so. after the objects disappeared, the animals quited down.\r\n\r\nmy feelings after watching these objects are of wonderment.  i was amazed at the sheer speed and the acceleration of these objects.  it took them maybe 4 seconds to travel from the green object to \"set points\" estimated at 40 miles apart, and then come to a very distinct \" on a dime\" stop. the precision and timing of the maneuver was nothing short of amazing.  the only odd feeling that had was the reations of the animals.  the noises that they were making were not your \"normal\" barks and coyote \"yips\".  it was just odd.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path

22:00 i received a call from a friend who lives nearby that they are seeing a weird triangle shaped object on the sky behind their house. \r\n\r\ni grabbed my camera and jumped in to my car and went to my friends house who lives ca 900m from me. \r\nwhen i arrived, there were tree people all watching the bright light over the treetops that was on west (it was already dark, the sky was clear and lot of stars were on the sky)\r\n\r\nmy friend parents were the ones who first discovered the object when being outside, they said, that at first it emitted a strong purple light quite blinding to look and seemed to be a lot closer and about a half of a meter big on the sky, after first discovering it they asked their daughter (my friend) to also come out to look at it.\r\n\r\nmy friend told that by the time that she arrived she saw three lights that were positioned making a triangle shape and flashed red and purple\r\ntones not on regular manner. lights also seemed to rotate so the triangle formation of the craft was understandable.\r\n\r\nby the time i arrived to the scene they had monitored the object for some 15 min and told that it had moved quite a way further (was now viewable about 20cm above treetops, the trees were some 50m from us. so overall, it was some 1,5m above horizon.\r\n\r\nwe looked the object for some 30 min, and during that time, it was slowly moving away from us to the west and seemed to rotate etc because different colors of lights were seen, it also made sudden erratic movements on several occasions and the observation was turning to be very interesting when out of nowhere bright dots started to be appearing  further away on right side and left side of the object for some time an then vanished.\r\n\r\nabout 30 min later, the object was moved so far to the west that was dropping behind the treetops, so me and my friend decided to go to the car and drive some 2km futher to the west to the other side of the forest.\r\n\r\nwe drove to the other side of the forest and parked the car on the side of the road, the object was still viewable, but it was now went much futher away and was noticeable only as a bright dot (about 30cm higher than the horizon) we monitored it for about and hour, and in that time frame it still had periods when it was emitting different kind of colors oand seemed to turn. \r\n\r\nafter an about 20min of slowly descending to the horizon, it suddenly made some erratic movements to the right, left and down (felt like filming something bright and then shaking a camera) and was getting brighter again, so we thought it is moving back at us. we were alone on the middle of dark road away from houses and it was getting quite ....Scary :) at this moment.\r\n\r\nhowever, a cloud formation was then coming between the object and us, we watched for about 15min more and then decided to go home, before that however we saw few bright flashes near where the object was, probably so far away and behind the clouds it was not seen any more.\r\n\r\nso for a conclusion:\r\n\r\n*it was a object with bright lights and shaped like a triangle.\r\n\r\n*it was seen on estonia, p���rnu, at around 22:00 on 23.09.2009 moving to the west\r\n\r\n*there were four witnesses monitoring the object for about an hour.\r\n\r\n*it seemed to turn over it axis at some times and was making sudden \"jumps\" like it had no weight, so it definitely was not a satellite, plane or anything like that i have previously seen in the sky that was explainable. the witnesses seeing when it was closer said it was a triangle with different colors of bright lights.\r\n\r\n*i have about 20min of video footage of that observation, most of it is just black screen with observers comments on the background, it was just so dark that the compact camera had no focus lock, i managed to get some 10-15 seconds of a footage of the bright object after configuring the camera to manual focus lock. it shows a bright flashing dot when zooming in. when i downloaded the video into editing program and sharpened it, then when looking frame by frame there are several frames where there can be seen, that the object had three lights on rectangular shape.\r\n \r\n*when it was closer, there were some bright dots appearing on the sky near it at times that disappeared after few seconds.\r\n\r\n* not knowing how big the object was, i would guess, that when i started observing it it was some 20km away and in the end of it some hundreds of km away. the comment from my friends parents were that at first it was almost straight top of them and was some half a meter long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with

bigger then that airplane going the other way,as i was watching these lights i ran back inside to get my boyfriend he came outside to see and it was still there flying or moving slow what ever you would call it we both could not belive what we were seeing and i have never seen anything like that,now i realize i've never seen anything before this ever in my life, i dont know how to explain it but was big.My boyfreind went inside to get his mother they went out the front door im still in the back and still see it.  as it goes farther  away i see the lights go to a straight line i cant

viewed and filmed from both sides.  video showing locations in daytime can be viewed here on my youtube.Com channel:  seeingufospa\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=czkjlf7haly\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nmultiple types seen on now nightly basis:  white, red, orange orbs--sometimes flashing or pulsing.  travel freely through tall thick patches of woods and filmed doing so.\r\nred round one mimics tower beacon, but moving through trees gives it away.\r\norange ones seen in plasma type form and more solid metallic surface.\r\nwhite ones seen flashing brightly and traveling through sky with flame-like effect which later morph into fake helicopter on film (september 17th).  dozens of them seen almost every night we look.  they transform into aircraft looking crafts, complete with flashing lights of different colors, usually start off as bright golden orbs low in sky, which hover for a while before transforming.  series of videos regarding such can be partly seen here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=hib4hjknhya (part 1)\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\r\ntransformer ufos now being seen along with others - 3 times in 4 days.  they first appear moving freely amongst the high trees as white or orange orbs, then rise up above them and transform into what appears to be our aircraft--but they're not. \r\n\r\nseptember 20, 2009 (pictures with report) - 10:36 pm (farm field) - video here:

into jet plane and you can actually see it spit out a wing which unfolds.  the scary part is they are not only imitating our aircraft looks, but now convincing engine sounds.  presumably so they can fit in, fly unnoticed all around us, without being bothered or shot at. \r\n\r\nsmart enough to get here - smart enough to fake us out.\r\nif no one comes here to witness it themselves, they are missing out on the biggest phenomenon in our recent history.  i've provided the locations, shown what they look like, and can spot them... yet no one has even come to see it with us--yet!  (although a few with guts have expressed the desire too & am trying to coordinate a group effort to witness & film them from multiple locations surrounding the area).  we need hi-tech gen3 nightvision zoom lenses (like astrovision) on pro camcorders (like sony's new line with exemor chips) and/or spotlights to get better footage--plus radiation detection and other scientific measuring devices while the activity is going on.  remote battery operated motion sensing equipment too.  i can think of more if you give me time.  i've never seen one actually sitting on the ground and exploration of the overgrown fields & woods with hedge clippers produced no signs of disturbance nor landing.  the \"taos hum\" low-frequency sound is heard around my house & pro shop at an annoying level for several years--no direction can be determined & not heard by everyone.  photographs of valley on flash reveal multiple orbs and white small \"tail\" shaped lights frequently also. faint small orbs recorded on nightshot video around us sometimes.  i can see the faint orange orbs drop from the sky occasionally after dusk... my 'military grade' surveillance cam had recorded them before in b/w and i couldn't understand how what i assumed was 'space debris' could be so big as to disappear beyond the treeline which is 500 feet away.  now i know.\r\n\r\nsounds too incredible, doesn't it? is no one coming out here because they're afraid?  or is it because i copyright all my work so the ones who charge for this kind of knowledge instead of sharing it for free like me have to pay?  i have shared the footage with all the major tv stations and no one has even acknowledged it. \r\n\r\nit seems the time is ripe for the public to demand answers from the powers that be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19615,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4362815,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09242009-0005","longitude":-79.695755,"occurred":1253689200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,   Triangle,   Other,   Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1253803528000,"summary":"Murrysville:  nightly sightings of multiple crafts of different types filmed in hd","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/19615_submitter_file1__20090920223650_41bigC.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/19615_submitter_file2__20090920223650_30bigC.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/19615_submitter_file3__20090920223650_31bigC.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Murrysville, Pennsylvania","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:184017"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2155}
