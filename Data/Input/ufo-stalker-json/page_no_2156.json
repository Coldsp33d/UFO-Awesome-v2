generally south to north at approximately 70 degrees. as i watched it,  a flashing light appeared in that general vacinity of the sky,and although it was still very high up, it was clearly much closer than the satellite i had beeen watching. this light was moving at a fairly high rate of speed, comparable to a jet liner. the light was yellowish and flashed very brightly. this light flashed five times as it moved across the sky, and then it simply stopped flahing, and was no longer visible - this occured on a very clear night, so there was nothing to obstruct my line of sight to the light. within two or three seconds of this flashing light \"going off\", another light appeared in the same specific area of the sky, but much higher, and travelling at an incredibly high rate of speed. soon after this light appeared it split into two lights and continued at the same relative speed as they angled away from each other. i had to choose to watch one through my field-glasses as they split up, and it was hard to follow as it was moving so quickly - it crossed the sky in no more than 2 seconds; an then faded out of my vision. after the one faded out, i tried to find the other, and could not. but; as i was searching the sky around the area where the first light had faded out, i saw what appeared to be two lights travelling in unison but separated by a considerable distance - these lights were perhaps 100-150 feet high in the sky and were at least hundreds of feet apart. these \"two lights\" were moving in tandem and were travelling incredibly slowly; just creeping across the sky, and making no apparent noise. it wasn't until i noticed the neighborhood dogs barking like crazy that i noticed a low, but very potent, hum. as i watched these lights, not sure what they were, i realized that the area between these lights was literally blocking out the stars as it moved between them and my perspective. it was huge! the shape appeared triangular, but my perspective and the pure blackness of the object against the black night sky made this difficult to be sure of. this shape travelled slowly across the sky for perhaps three minutes and then vanished, or at least became no longer visible to me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":19612,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.7617229,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09242009-0002","longitude":-122.4847849,"occurred":1253764500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1253783125000,"summary":"Series

shortly before and at the start of the display, while the other two traveled through during the display. it was evident at that time, that they were up much higher and further off from the display area than what it seemed like. the fireworks display had no effect on them and they did not react. it was as though they wanted to be seen as they moved just fast enough to draw attention, but not fast enough to not be noticed. the lights were mostly reddish-orange and were moving in what seemed in a circular motion around the circular ship. the videos i took were zoomed in as far as i could

and wow, what looks to me to be a ufo. i���ve been looking and waiting to see a real ufo myself my entire 55 years, this is a first for me. images taken before and after of the same view show nothing.\r\n\r\ni am a photographer and use photoshop allot and i know imaging, but i haven���t messed with this image at all other than to zoom up and clip out the ufo section and enhanced the resolution a little, also made a negative out of one of the clips to get and different look. looking closer i became more convinced it was something out there in the sun and was 3 dimensional, not on my lens or a digital blurb. the mid day sun was high behind my left shoulder about 15-20 degrees and looking at the clip the object seems to have highlights and shadows matching the sun's position. it also has what seems to be a dark band around it's middle and a light area (aura if you will) around it, especially under it. \r\n\r\nwatching ufo hunters last night online i saw an old sketch made in

there for at least one minute after turning the tv off and saw what appeared to be a very bright light, circle first through the lower windows of my living room and then the upper level windows. i have a high rise vaulted ceiling. i am usually a night owl and i go outside from time to time for a short bit. my first thought was that was really strange especially because i do stay up and had not seen anything like that in this house (lived here almost 4 years). i looked out through the blinds and did not see any vehicles (i did do this immediately after seeing the light) and looked for people who may had been on the sidewalk or for any sign of anything to explain the light. i kind of shrugged my shoulders and thought it was strange and was a spooked but i just couldn't explain it so i sat back down for a moment to gather my thoughts and things that i wanted to bring up to my bedroom. i probably sat there about 3 to 5 more minutes when it happened again and this time it was brighter and circled through the room at least twice, going from all the lower level windows to the upper level back to the lower and then again to the upper. i didn't wait to see what else was to happen and that is when i ran up my stairs to my bedroom. i arrived to the bed panting out of breath and scared. my husband had already gone to sleep so he had no clue as to what had gone on and why i came in the bedroom so frightened. i can guarantee i had not fallen asleep yet and as i've said i tend to stay up late so to see those bright lights was indeed unusual. i can't say for sure that it was a ufo but i did not see anything to explain it and the motion of the lights that circled my living room certainly seem unexplainable. i am very skeptical of the paranormal but i guess when an event can't be explained it's time to admit that it can't be explained.

i was on vacation in istanbul,turkey for a month. was taking a pic. of the sunset over the skies of istanbul with my brother,from our balcony at 18:30 hours. the pic.(one)that was taken,at first glance seemed to show the targeted sight and the moon. after a closer look,my husband told me it was not the moon,and thought it was not of this earth. the shape was a perfect sphere,with what we could see with our cave age eye's were two or three belts going around the bottom of it. when the pic. was taken,it was floating at an angle it seemed(compared to the structures in the pic.). it also had kind of a round door hatch on the very bottom of the craft. the outside of the sphere had a very bright,white colored,lace like surface,and as mentioned before,the belts going completely around its' round shape. the belts seemed to represent windows or different levels or floors of the craft. my husband told me,that if we took and set a tripod with a camera out in the balcony and waited for the special shots,we still could not get what we have here. i know this for a fact,....That this craft (as large as it is),was not in my viewing screen of my camera,when i was taking the pic. of the sunset. my husband said,that these crafts are very hard to take pics. of,he thought and to have one frozen in time and space,in a pic.,is almost like a miracle,for our generation of: non believers and believers alike. i would appreciate your feedback on this letter of mine; and if there are possibly a few photo's taken,of the same craft as i described in my letter,(re: the sphere seen in istanbul,turkey). taken anywhere else,i would pls. like to have them confirm the incident,time and place. thx. s.K.
