approx. 7 pm, i noticed the 1st star in the east, southeast sky. it was just coming over the mountain top across the river. that mountain's elevation is approx. 1400 ft. it was very bright. i've seen this star many times before, but for some reason as it was only dusk, this star was bright white. i then thought of the wise men and the star that led them to christ, then wondered if that star had meaning for me. i was cooking at the time and kept going to my fire and the picnic table and always checking the star. then one trip i looked up and did a double take. i saw another 'star' next to the bright star, only this 'star' had a triangular beam coming down from it. i will refer to the 'star' as the object from here out. the object was 'headlight yellow' as compared to the white star. the triangular beam appeared to be made up of many rays. i thought possibly the atmosphere may have caused these to appear as rays.\r\nthe height of both star and object was about 15-20 min. above the mountain top from when the star rose. the object and the star were closer to each other then they were to the mountain top. i could see both easily without moving my head to compare the two...Just slight eyeball shifts.  it was an awesome sight. i then thought to myself i have to go grab my camera and get a picture of this, turned but made a decision not to as i was afraid the object would disappear and i'd miss looking at it,so i turned back to watch the object. just as i refocused on the object, it then disappeared, but the triangular light was still there and it then too disappeared in sections from top to bottom. all disappeared quickly, but it was noticable there was lapse of time from disappearence of object to the bottom beam of light. i wondered if light travel had anything to do with how far the object was from the bottom beam of light!? i thought of an airplane or helicopter casting light, but when the objects light went out, there was not plane or helicopter in sight. it was a beautiful sight. i felt priviledge to have witnessed it. i was never afraid or scared. probably the distance away had much to do with not being afraid.\r\nthanks for providing this outlet so

walk around the neighborhood.  it was about 6:00 p.M. and the sun was almost setting. i often look up into the sky when i walk, and as i turned a corner and faced in a northeast direction, i saw a bright white, highly reflective teardrop shaped object stationary in the sky about 40-45 degrees above the horizon.  i couldn't say how high it was, but a plane coming in for a landing at the abq sunport was lower than the object.  i was already returning home, and did not have a camera with me, so i hurried, thinking i could get home and with my camera, zoom in closer and get a better look at what it was.  it never bobbled, but remained perfectly in place the whole time i observed it.  i got home and told my husband to take a look. he got the binoculars out and i got my camera and we went out in the backyard.  he said it was teardrop shaped, and could possibly be a weather balloon, but neither of us saw any tethers, ropes,or payload boxes underneath such as weather balloons usually carry.  it did not drift with the wind, or bobble, or otherwise move at any time during the approximately hour and a half of observing it.  i did take some pictures with my camera, but strangely enough, could not make the camera focus on it.  it hardly even showed up at all with a regular daylight setting on the camera.  however, with a night time setting on the camera i managed to get some pictures, even though they don't do justice to what i could see with the naked eye. my husband and i have seen weather balloons before, since they are seen in this area sometimes, and this was significantly different because of its brightness or high reflectiveness, as well as because it did not move at all for the hour and a half or so that we observed it.  there were some clouds that drifted by, obviously moved by some wind, but the object did not drift or move in any way. after i attempted the pictures of it, we went in the house.  we looked again about a half hour later (around 7:30 p.M. by then) and it was

us had been drinking.  a street fair was going on along with a bsu football game, we passed an open-air sports bar and as the others were trying to determine the score i was looking up and saw the red light.  i pointed it out to others on the sidewalk...Met with drunk indifference.  when i could point it out to all of our group, we stood and watched.  a bright red light, much larger than stars/planets, was hovering over us.  it would pulse light slowly, then no pulse, then pulse again at a different rhythm.  when it pulsed the sky looked hazy around it...Or sort of mottled.  the rest of the sky was perfectly clear.  it made no sound.  it seemed to move north very, very slowly, so we crossed the street, and then it, well, it sort of jumped forward, and the pulsing began again.  my husband and one of the others in our group felt very uncomfortable with whatever it was, so we cut off of the main street to take a route of side streets to walk back to our friend's home.  we stopped, and the red light seemed to be receding, but not really moving?  i took a picture with my cell phone (9:20) which i can send if you want but it mostly looks like a red blob in a black field...Though none of the other stars/planets in the sky showed up in the cheesy cell phone picture, so that's how bright the red circle/ball of light was.\r\nwe came across three other people watching the same red light, they'd been watching it longer than we had, and had binoculars.  i looked through it, and the red circle of light was made up of lots of individual circles/balls of red lights.  it still was doing the irregular pulsing...Slow rhythm, no pulsing, faster rhythm, etc.  the other three people said earlier it seemed closer, and they could see things 'falling off' the big circle...Like red streamers of light that didn't reach the ground.  while we were watching with these people, one called friends and had them go out and look from their places of residence, and they too could see the red circle.  this was brighter than any light i've ever seen in the sky, including laser lights.  we continued to walk to our friends, and all totaled, had the red pulsing light in sight for about 30 minutes.  \r\nmy husband and i drove home to east boise, and could not see the light from our home (we live at the bottom of a mesa...Lots is blocked out looking north).\r\nfrom the beginning none of us could identify the light...It was not the size or light intensity of anything i've seen (and i am 55).  we all felt uneasy with what we saw...Including the three people we came across watching.  we joked that it was a search for intelligent life, but none could be found since everyone at the hyde park fair and in the bars watching the football game were too tweeked to respond.\r\ni just want to know if others saw this...It was really unusual.  nothing showed up in the papers (which is not unusual, as the paper is barely afloat and prints drivel at best).  the photo

move like it did.  it was by far the most beautiful and mysterious event i've ever seen in the sky.  after about 6-8 minutes the object faded from sight by either moving too far away or simply faded out.  as far as i can tell it was 40 miles or so away to the northeast somewhere above eastern santa rosa, ca or northern sonoma area.","distance":"Over One

comming from the sky towards the earth. it was a white lite not intensely, bright, but very bright. i didnt have to squint , or it didnt blind me. the \"cone top\" was pointing towars the sky and the light got bigger and brighter as it came towards the earth. i did not see a ship of any kind. \r\n  although, we both saw a cloudish substance that the light was shining through. there were no clouds in the sky that night. the light came from the clouds or a fog as it looked like to us. i have a gut feeling that it was a cloaking or invisability type of camo that made us think we are seeing nothing or a cloud\r\n there was no noise associated with what we saw that night. i would like to know if phila north east airport, wich is 5 min from this place noticed anything on radar at around 8:30  that night .\r\n  it was not a plane, a helicopter, or lightning , or a meteor falling. it was a bright cone shaped light that came from the black sky towards the earth, did not quite reach the earth then faded away invisibly into the nighht.\r\n  when i first saw it i said what the f is that, i wasnt scared as i was wondering to myself, what is that light? as it grew larger and brighter i thought , oh my god, here we go im going to see something crazy. then it sarted to fade away , and i was freeking out , telling the guy i was with that was crazy.. i asked him what he saw and he told me exactlly what i saw, i wasnt crazy..\r\n\r\nim not sure if what i saw was a natural phenominom, or a ufo light comming down. but we did see it, and it was not a usual thing it was totally out of

looked into the sky to find the object being reflected from the water's surface and saw the bright light had become a black sphere. we called my uncle ed over to see the object. \r\nwe witnessed the sphere moving slowly and silently from behind us (west) pass overhead, and continue east over the lake. my uncles told me to run up to the house for the binoculars they keeps by the door for bird watching. still without sound the sphere continued flying. we all saw the object closely and clearly through the binoculars. a sphere with 3 lights flashing on the back end, no wings, no engine noise, no jets, no props.  from the west 3-5 (my memory on the exact number is cloudy at this point) prop planes flew over our heads possibly from dutchess county airport and approached the object. the object was at least a mile away at this point. all of the airplanes flew out toward the object and turned back toward the airport in one pass each. the sphere and planes were at the same altitude, or so it appeared. from this inference i would assume the object was approximately the size of a single engine private prop plane and only a few hundred feet in the air. the object disappeared from view as it went over the trees and horizon. uncle louie and i thought that was had seen a strange flying object that appeared to have no means of staying aloft. uncle ed seemed shaken and did not want to discuss the object. i'm certain it was in late july or mid august of 1987. there were no news accounts that i have been able to find.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

appeared at first to be a star in the north east sky.  what struck me as odd was it was flashing more quickly and more strongly than a typical star and that the flashing was in different colors.  i was able to discern white, red and blue flashing with my naked eye.  \r\n\r\ni called my wife to come see this object so that i could get a second opinion.  she too agreed it didn't appear to be a typical star nor a plane or helicopter as it didn't move at all over several minutes.  the object was stationary so i had her continue to watch it while i went to get our digital camera.  i was able to take some pictures and some video of the object.  i went out again a couple of times later, and the object was still there.  the last time i checked was around 00:30 on 9/21/09 and the object was still there, maybe a little dimmer but still there.\r\n\r\nupon reviewing the video in slow motion the next day, my son showed to me that it was actually changing into more than three colors.  since
