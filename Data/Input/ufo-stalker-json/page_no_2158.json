me. she sent me a few texts that i didn't respond too, but the last one was far too enticing not to respond too. she wrote \"there's a space ship near my back yard.\"\r\n      i thought this was a joke to get me to come over to see her but we did encounter a u.F.O. maybe 5 months before hand that was like a jet but it was vibrant yellow, moved so slow, and made no sound. that one looked identical to the old toy model of the roswell u.Fo. i decided i'd bring my laptop & webcam just in case. when i got there i asked her if it was one of the stars in the sky that i was pointing too. she said no and led me to her back porch. \r\n        about 2 miles away just above the trees & above the mountainside there was a circular red light. it didn't even seem to move. so i hooked up my webcam and tried to adjust the visual. unluckily it wouldn't capture anything more then around 100 yards away. my camera on my phone is broken & my girlfriend couldn't find her moms camera that she uses occasionally. we looked for her camera for about 10  minutes. nothing. \r\n     at that moment i was excruciatingly frustrated because i saw a u.F.O. that was maybe 100 feet above my back yard and now i'm seeing one in my girlfriends backyard and i couldn't capture it with anything. i opened the door and peeked out side again. now it was below the tree line. i stared at it for a good minute and it didn't move at all. i was mad. i closed the door and decided to watch the movie \"point break\". about an hour later i looked outside again and it was still there but now there was a large amount of red light to the right of the craft and it was pitch-black outside. the light looked like it went all through out the trees but only in the area directly beside the craft. the crafts light around it seemed to intensify a little as well. seeing the large amount of the light beside the craft made me shut the door. it was just too bizarre. i finished watching the movie then looked outside again. i thought it was gone. but my girlfriend said no look closely. i stared for maybe 10 seconds to get a good focus & now there where 2 lights that where extremely small and maybe 2 football fields apart. i was still extremely mad because i wanted to capture the object on some kind of film but i didn't. i left her house last night then i just asked her if it was still there a few hours ago. she said no, it's gone. i'm going to buy a camcorder that has decent focus as soon as i get a few dollars in case something like this ever happens again. so far in the past 2 years i've seen 2 real bizarre

western sky just above the tree line that was unusual. the color was orange and flared in intensity, and the shape was that of ball, except when the colors flashed (or varied in intensity), where in the shape expanded, but still remained ball shaped.\r\nwe were sitting at a house on chicago street in elgin, il at dusk smoking cigarettes and cigars chatting about our day when i expressed that i was unable to identify the object and indicated to the other people where i was looking. nothing specifically caused me to look for the object, but as a person who regularly watches planes overhead, i often find myself looking up.\r\nrowan was the first to come off the porch and immediately expressed to lily to retrieve his camera, next off the porch was bethany and our other friend. they stepped down off the porch to see what i was looking at and we all expressed that none of us could identify the light as any kind of aircraft that we recognized.\r\nwe continued to watch the object as it moved in both lateral and vertical movements that were not indicative of aircraft or hot air balloons. the sky was light enough to see well, but the light of the object did not allow us to see any structure. the sun was below the horizon on the far side of the object from us and there was no light source that would have cause reflection against an object in the sky. there was no sound.\r\ndistance was hard to identify, but the object likely moved towards us and then receded as the size changed from smaller, to larger and then smaller again as it appeared to move away. speed also was not able to be estimated as the object was only visible for about 2 and a half minutes before it was gone from view. however comparing it to standard known aircraft it took about half the time a normal aircraft does to recede from view. there were no other aircraft visible at the time of this sighting.\r\nlily returned with the camera, and rowan attempted to photograph the object. with his 12 mega-pixel camera two shots recorded the image, one showed a ball approximately 10 pixels across, the other which was shot with at a slowed down speed, showed some shaking and ghosting from the shooter, but also showed a distinct light trail.\r\nafter the object was no longer visible we talked about it and the fact that it qualified as a real ufo as non of us were able to identify it. we were all glad that there were multiple people there to witness it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

a week he would see something, his eyes are not as sharp as mine so i prayed for a bright light to show up for him. it appeared in the no. sky about 1/4 way up from the so. skyline ,dimly lit, a orb trying to be a star, amber color, when it was half way across the sky it stopped and flared up very bright, (dime sz. if the moon is a silver dollar). a very white light, 10 times the size of the brightest star and just as brillant. it then moved a little further so. then disappeared. a few min. later at 8:28 reappeared overhead wavering as if to wave good-bye then dissapeared again. my feeling was it was a special sighting because i prayed for it and also it came right after flashing a flashlite in the sky while thinking these thoughts. i felt it was showing the love :) and a promise of a better future.  well its a nice thought even tho it may not be the case. the timeing was perfect tho. my boyfriend was very happy as well and commented he was now a believer and had never seen anything like it. he has some pilot experience and stated it could no way have been any lind of regular aircraft.A small note here he had a bad headache before seeing this and after.\r\nalso before the flareing orb i saw orbs at 5:40 am, 7:28pm, 8:12pm, and 1 other after the event at 8:35 which went no. then ne then no again avoiding a plane but keeping its semi-bright light where most of the time i see them disappear.\r\ni would love to hook up with others here in las vegas that are shareing their experiences, if any. one other note, i tried to take a picture with my phone camera but

were returning to our camp after fishing in a boat. the object was spotted by someone in the boat. we had no idea what we were looking at. the object was in the southern sky. it did not seem to be moving but our boat was moving so it was hard to tell. the object was a oval white circle with a white cone at the bottom. it also seemed to be misty or in a cloud but the night was clear and crisp. a couple of minutes after we noticed it the light, it just dimmed and we could not see it any more. another group that was returning from another location on the lake saw the same thing. my first impression was a comet but the direction and size of the cone i knew it was not a comet.We were all pretty mater of fact about the siting after when talking about it that we had no idea what we saw and it could be something from the americian space program or something we just can't explain.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":19518,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.0558574,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-09202009-0058","longitude":-77.8548814,"occurred":1253415300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1253511900000,"summary":"A

city, nj when we both witnessed a bright white light in the southeast sky over the ocean approximatley 45 degrees off the horizon.  the light appeared larger than any star visible in the clear sky, and was much larger than a light typically seen on an aircraft.  at best, it might have been the size of a helicopter search light, but there was no sound to indicate that any such craft was in the vicinity.  the light then reflected a cone-shaped aura, shining downward for approximately 10 seconds.  a mist then developed first below, then surrounding the light source.  the light then gradually dissipated (~5 seconds), disappearing while the mist remained visible for approximately 2 minutes.  there were no clouds in the otherwise clear sky.\r\n\r\nwe both questioned whether/not we might have witnessed a ufo....Not certain of what else it could have been....I later reasoned that it might have been a distress flair from a ship, but there were no such reports that we could find in that locale. we were surprised to find, however, a number of similar reports of sightings along the east coast and middle atlantic states around the same time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1
