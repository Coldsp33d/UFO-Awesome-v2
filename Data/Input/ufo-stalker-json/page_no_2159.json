(that was from my perspective from my front porch) as we were standing there talking he was facing me and i was facing the road. all of a sudden i just saw this round glowing ball moving quickly then it disappeared beyond the treeline. i said look! 3 times and by the time he had turned around to see what i was seeing it had already disappeared. to me it looked as if it was falling. there was no tracers, no sounds, just the object. i thought at first that it was some sort of flare or it reminded me of fireworks being shot up in the sky before they actually explode in the air. the thing is, the object was traveling across rather than up and stayed a solid green/blueish glowing color. i came in my house maybe 1 minute after and my clock said that it was 12:55 am. i immediately got on my laptop and e-mailed a person that i know who works for a paranormal investigating team based out of south burlington, vermont. he emailed me back and said that they were on the road coming back from a reported ufo sighting area and he could not believe that i had seen it from my home because him and his team had seen the samething in the sky from essex, vt. essex is about 30 miles from me. his team of investigaters were in separte cars, one car was ahead of him and one was behind him and they all had seen the samething. i am very interested in finding out how many people had actually seen this, or if anyone else reported this to you. it was a great experience i am very anxious to find out what i and others saw. thank you for your time,   danielle benoit, sheldon, vt, 05483 this event occured at 12:50am on sept 20 2009 this form wont except my time. again thank you for your time. contact me with any questions you may

east) to see a very bright point of light, much brighter in magnitude than a star. from this point came a cone shapped beam of light that descended to the ground, much like a fan, but with extremely well defined, sharp edges. once it filled the sky between what would be the ground and the origin, the area appeared to become even brighter, before retracting back to the point of light, leaving a smokey or cloudy sky in its wake. i remember thinking, \"it got cloudy\" because it had been a clear blue sky all day. as i looked closer at the area from which the beam had emerged, i noticed a shimmering section of the sky (like you would see on a hot day above a long road surface on the horizon), above the cloudy section, and this space began to slowly move from left to right. the entire episode lasted about 9 seconds, no time to even think about grabbinng a camera. it immediately became apparent that others had seen the same thing, so i began to talk to others, confirming my report

the band to begin at 8:00 pm.\r\n\r\ni was facing the barn (where the music was about to begin), facing due west. my friend tapped me on the shoulder and said \"ufo, ufo, ufo!\" i turned around (facing due east) to see a very bright point of light, much brighter in magnitude than a star. from this point came a cone shapped beam of light that descended to the ground, much like a fan, but with extremely well defined, sharp edges. once it filled the sky between what would be the ground and the origin, the area appeared to become even brighter, before retracting back to the point of light, leaving a smokey or cloudy sky in its wake. i remember thinking, \"it got cloudy\" because it had been a clear blue sky all day. as i looked closer at the area from which the beam had emerged, i noticed a shimmering section of the sky (like you would see on a hot day above a long road surface on the horizon), above the cloudy section, and this space began to slowly move from left to right. \r\n\r\nthe entire episode lasted about 9 seconds, no time to even think about grabbinng a camera.  it immediately became apparent that others had seen the same thing, so i began to talk to others, confirming my report above. there were at least 50 witnesses to this event.\r\n\r\none final note is that as we stared at the sky just seconds after, we noticed a few private planes in in the sky in the general area, so these pilots could have seen the light and reported it to a control tower.\r\n\r\nit was really amazing to see.","distance":"Over One

rocket they fired at 7:46 is the cause. the article i read on cnn is poorly written, and does not describe what i saw, nor does the explanation provided by nasa quite jibe with my knowledge of atmospherics and light behavior (more on that below.)\r\n\r\ni was in my front yard, sitting by a small wood fire, enjoying the evening. the sky was clear, with very thin, high cloud 'veins'. the clouds were so thin stars were visible through them. i was watching the sky when i noticed a bright spot appear to the east, approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. in about 8 seconds the light point grew to app. 5x the brightness of jupiter (also visible to the south). at about the ten second mark, a cone of light spread out from beneath the point light. this cone spread quickly, in about 3 seconds the cone, at its widest, was about the width of 6 full moons. it had two darker 'veins' in it, sort of like crepuscular rays, that extended down and out (and slightly to the left (or north) from the light. the point of light faded out after another 8 seconds, and then the cone slowly lost its brilliance and became fuzzy. the whole thing lasted 60 seconds or so. there was no sound and i did not notice any movement to the point light during the sighting (other reports indicate they saw a slight drift to the light.)\r\n\r\nperhaps the cnn article i referenced above is just poorly written. it mentions a \"series\" of lights, but i only saw one. also, according to the article, the sightings were 'from massachusetts to new jersey.' i'm in northern virginia, and some of the reports here in the mufon database are from west virginia, pennsylvania, maryland, and virginia. also, nasa seems to be indicating that this was caused by sunlight reflecting off of high altitude clouds, seeded by this rocket. that does not explain what i witness last evening; if i were to try to explain it using nasas info, i would think that the rocket ignited its stage four booster (the point light) which in turn illuminated the vapor / exhaust particles in the atmosphere. this does not explain the cone appearing after the light was already at almost full brightness, nor does it account for the 'afterglow' of the cone once the point light went out. this event being related to sunlight on high altitude clouds seems (as is intimated in the nasa explanation) is way off: this was not sunlight on clouds.\r\n\r\ni am not saying that nasa is full of it, i am just saying the article is poorly written and the facts presented there do not fully explain what i witnessed.\r\n\r\nregardless of any explanation, it was an extremely beautiful sight and i am glad others were witness to it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19485,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1246415,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09202009-0025","longitude":-77.5544515,"occurred":1253415300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1253475713000,"summary":"Bright
