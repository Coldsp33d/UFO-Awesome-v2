am very familiar with planes and flight paths. this was nothing like that. if it makes a difference, i went to school for meteorology, being certified in radar and observation taking. a plane traveled

a black orb looking object with luminescence. i then ran inside and grabbed my camera. the object was slowly moving south east, but stopped and changed directions several times, even moving north. there were times when it was not moving at all. it also seemed to cloak at times and bi-locate once (jump from one space to another) and there may have been a couple other white orbs in the vicinity. it's hard to describe the shape of this object, and i will let the video footage speak for itself. it was not a balloon because it was changing directions, stopping, appeared to cloak a few times, and was even motionless at times. my neighbor and i witnessed these strange aerial phenomena for about twenty minutes. they just seemed to vanish into thin air and disappeared out of site. i was unable to capture on video the other orbs because there were no background clouds for reference, so i couldn't see them in my camera. i was astonished at what i was seeing. the object just seemed to vanish in thin air as it was heading north. i have two video clips. the one with me talking is at normal speed. it is quite shaky, because i did not have a tripod. in the second clip i slowed the video down two times and added a sound effect for entertainment purposes. you will see at 53 seconds, in the slow video, that the object appears to materializes out of thin air, or decloak. my neighbor was with me, but could not see the black object, but he claimed to see three others nearby.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

bright star like object which was moving occasionally within its area. then, smaller star like objects started to come out of the bright object and fly away quickly in different directions. also saw at least 5 'shooting stars' in this time one which moved in an arc. i sat up after watching this for 30 minutes and saw a large bright object about 400 meters from our tent. it was hovering about 50 meters above the sand ne and started to come closer. it then changed from one bright light to 6 smaller lights (like it had changed from high beams to park lights!) before moving away. over two hours it moved away slowly and i have video footage of the image spinning and when i zoom in you can see the lights. it stayed there until sunrise and was there until the sun was so bright we could no longer see it. up in the night sky i saw 20+ of these objects, some which flashed red and some which would disappear and re-appear, some which zoomed off at incredible speed. since then, we've seen the bright hovering light up the east coast the past week. \r\n\r\ni noticed it first by the bright light moving, then other lights emerging from it. then lights flashing red and large bright light spinning\r\n\r\ncould not be explained. too large and fast for a drone (plus it was silent)\r\n\r\ni did not have a feeling of being threatened, more that it was just there to observe. it also did not seem bothered by being found as it was so prominent and did not appear to leave.","distance":"101-500

my friends and i spent quite a bit of time searching the skies that summer. i do not know the month because it was so long ago. beside an airport, to the left of the airport is a crop field, and again to the left a farm complex surrounded by trees, is the location where we stopped our car on upper valley pk. over the field, in heavy fog, we saw a ball of light dropping straight down through the fog. it may have come down as low as 300 ft or more off of the ground. we were parked in front of a lane which belongs to the house, which is to date, surrounded by trees. we exited the car and as the ball of light reached its lowest point in altitude we saw car lights come on at the end of the lane. then the ball of light went straight back up and was going out of sight as an elderly man drove up to us from his farm lane and asked if we were having car trouble. the object made no noise and the one who asked us if we were having car trouble knew what we were looking at. we didn't. it went down and back up in heavy fog. it was not a helicopter and airplanes can't do what this did. it made no noise.The light was maybe 200 to 300 ft in diameter. it was between 1:30 and 3 a.M. the runway is to
