i put the rental movie in the dvd player and went out to my car to look for the book i brought to read.\r\n\r\nit was a crisp, clear september night in fairfield, ct with not a cloud in the sky and a million stars.\r\n\r\ni looked all around the front and back seats and even checked in the trunk before i realized that i had left the book at home.\r\n\r\nas i was walking back to the house, about three feet in front of the door, i happened to look up and stopped in my tracks.\r\n\r\nabout 150 feet above the treeline a bright circular orb of light hung in the air. it looked like a meteor but stopped in its tracks, really low to the ground and as bright as the moon would have been.\r\n\r\nwhat was really strange was that it seemed to be emanating a fog just around that area. that was what first caught my attention, not the light, but this patch of fog, connected to nothing, 400 feet in the air.\r\n\r\nunderneath the orb, the fog was catching the light so a cone (like from a flashlight beam) appeared underneath the orb.\r\n\r\nthe orb started to descend until it cleared the patch of fog and was visible just by itself and then ascended up into the fog again. the fog was transparent enough that i could still plainly see it was an orb. it did this twice before finally pulling deeper into the mist so i couldn't make out any shape and it just backlit the mist.\r\n\r\n(the way the moon looks when you can't see it at all but you can see its light in the clouds around it.)\r\n\r\ni ran inside to tell the boys i nanny to come and look for maybe all of ten seconds, came out and it had vanished.\r\n\r\nnot only had it vanished but there wasn't any fog anywhere.\r\n\r\nthe sky was perfectly clear and there was no trace of where it had been.\r\n\r\n\r\nit didn't make any sound. there were no colored lights. \r\nit moved very smoothly and specifically.\r\nthe fog remained after the light seemed to start pulling away from it.\r\n\r\nthe size of the planet venus is the equivalent i'll use and it looked like five or six of those combined. also, it was very bright.\r\n\r\ni didn't actually see it disappear as i went inside.\r\n\r\nit didn't look like a machine, a plane or any kind of craft. it looked like a big star that seemed to be moving vertically up and down.\r\n\r\n\r\ni was never afraid, just really curious and trying to figure out what on earth it was.

mostly visible, but there was still a faint light from sunset left.  off to the south approx. 30-40 deg elevation appeared a bright light shining downward that was illuminating a cone directly underneath.  the night was crystal clear without any clouds so it seemed very odd that the sky should \"glow\" under the light almost as if there was some powder released just before the light began.  the light lasted about 20-30 sec before extinguishing.  all the while it remained motionless and did not change position or direction.  it was then extinguished, but left a very faint glimmer of a cloud in it's wake - a white area of the sky that was barley visible and seemed to keep dropping slowly earthward.  the light appeared in the vicinity of skydiving activity (a local airport serves as its base of operations), but even though i recall seeing a jump plane drop off jumpers just around dusk, that was over 30 min prior.  in fact it would have been too dark to skydive safely at the time the light was spotted and i remember looking very closely for any nearby airplane activity that might explain the light (i am a private pilot) and did not see anything nearby.  due to the position in the sky and the brief appearance, it was almsot impossible to judge distance.  it could have been a 2000-3000' in the air, but at first glance looked to be much higher in the atmosphere.  i have never

witnessed three blinking lights in a triangle formation to the northwest of my home. the lights were distant, however they were in the direction of bangor mtn and the borough of stroudsburg (approx 10 miles away). i called my wife outside who witnessed the lights as well. our 16 yr old son joined us as well and attempted to vire the blinking objects with his telescope. in the over 10 years that we have lived in our home, we have never witnessed such an event. the blinking lights would become dull for a few minutes, then they would all begin to blink in tandem. additionally, the triangle formation remained in one location while the stars moved as the earth rotated. after viewing the lights for about an hour, we noticed that two additional blinking light were to both the right and left of the triangle in the distance. all the lights would blink together then become stationary. \r\n\r\nmy wife is an assistant principal at a local high school, i am a retired police officer, and now a federal agent with the irs. our son is a honor student. we are not mentally unfit or challenged. both my wife and i possess ms degrees, and my wife is nearly complete with her ph.D.\r\n\r\ni am providing our backgrounds because i can't stress enough of what we witnessed. i would be happy to assist with any questions you may have. additionally, there was a news report on the 10pm news of odd lights in the sky over the lehigh valley and berks co, areas of pa. this was seen on wfmz tv chan 69 in allentown, pa. \r\n\r\nthank you!
