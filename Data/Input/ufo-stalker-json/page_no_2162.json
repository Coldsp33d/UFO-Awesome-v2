the same slow speed as the previous one, these to gradually dimmed and vanished. i recalled while watching that i had read a story in the news a few months earlier, that a similer sighting had been recorded in which people were told that the phenomenon could be put down to paper lanterns. the lanterns had apparently been released close by from a party. the lights my sister and i observed were

november 25, 2006, just a few days after i had sent an email to british authorities (london's university college hospital, where litvinenko was being treated and later died) on the afternoon of november 23, informing that alexander litvinenko was poisoned with polonium. the panicked polonium culprits decided to attempt retaliatory action while i was asleep: i was awoken by a disturbing sensation in my head, somewhat like abnormal pressurization being applied to the brain. when i opened my eyes in the dark room (it was still night), all my surroundings including the sky visible through the uncovered windows appeared neon yellow. i shut my eyes hard to shake off the illusion, but when i opened them again i saw the same effect. this moved me to mentally counteract the sensation, and the false-color vision gradually faded until i could see normally. at that moment i saw two blinking points of light that did not resemble aircraft beacons in both color (electric blue-white) and manner of flashing (led-like). it was apparent that they were two separate bodies, but they were moving in slow and perfect unison, one trailing the other no more than a few hundred feet apart, and both blinking at identical but not simultaneous intervals. radar archives will show that no civilian or other conventional aircraft were in that location and at that time (around 3am probably over bethesda, md, less than five miles from my location at perhaps 1 or 2 miles altitude), on that flight course (curving from southwest to west and then northwest).","distance":"Over One

shapped object in the distance right above the tree line and it was flashing blue, red, and white. we all looked at it an agreed that it was a plane, but we then realized that this thing wasn't moving at all. we all looked at this thing for probably 10 mins. and during that time not any movement at all just staying still which we all thought was weird. then when we all were gonna had back to my hosue this thing starts moving up and down at some pretty incrediable rates of speed. it went up and down and left to right. once we saw this we all were stunned. i live right next to an airport and i have never seen anythng like this that could move the way this object was moving. as we all watched this thing got higher in the sky but now it was moving a little more slow. we watched for about an hour and went back into my house. around 430 am when it was time for another cig we come out and see the same thing in the sky excepte this time much brighter and it had a small ball at the bottom of it blinking blue, red, and white. this thing was massive im talking big at least a football feild this thing just didnt move just stayed in the sky. at this point we called our friends which got up and looked out the window and saw the same thing about 6 or 7 miles down the road. i woke up my mom and see saw the object to and see said first thing to me that its not a plane. while we were watching this we could pick out the planes in the sky at the time. at least 3 planes were in the sky and those pilots had to of seen this in the sky it was impossable to miss brighter then the stars and head turning that simple head turning. we watched intil the sun started to come up and this thing moved up in the sky and disappared so quickly. what ever we saw was indefinitly not a plane or any
