of at this time the extent of it but i am quite sure it affected at least four buildings (each one has 24 residences). as of this morning, dominion power did not list anything on it's real-time outage map. i may contact them to get more information on the outage.\r\n\r\nduring this blackout i awakened a couple times in hopes that the power had come back on. around 1am in the morning i woke up and walked around to check on things. i walked over to the bedroom window to look out the window blinds briefly and as soon as i did i spotted what looked like 4 or 5 bright lights *star-like\" right next to one another or overlapping each other creating a rectangular-object effect. from my window, this object was sitting in the visible sky just above the roof of the apartment building right next to mine. it seemed like it was probably a good couple miles at the least in the distance. no more than a few seconds later this object just vanished in the spot it appeared to be hovering in as if covered by a quickly moving invisible cloud or if the lights came off quickly one after another.\r\n\r\nto me, it was not your typical aircraft in the distance light signature and i have never seen that type of signature before. i believe it is possible it could have been an aircraft with a particular light formation that i am not used to seeing, maybe even a few f-22's flying very close together or hovering together during an unknown night exercise from the nearby langley afb. we are near newport news international airport and do have maybe a medium-level of aircraft traffic in the sky. not sure what to make of this one however. \r\n\r\nand afterwards, i couldn't help but feel like it knew i was watching it and disappeared so i at the very least could no longer see it.

community south of sells and i was just past the community of three points and was driving towards the border patrol checkpoint that is permanently stationed there.  just above kitt peak which was to the left of me on the road my girlfriend commented that a light in the sky was a ufo that she had seen many times in the past. the light was brighter than a star, a planet, or an airplane light. we stopped and looked at it for a few minutes. she said that it typically has multiple lights, that the lights would strobe, that the object sometimes would move great distances in the sky almost instantaneously, and that she could make out that it was elliptically shaped sometimes.  what i saw confirmed some of the phenomenon that she described.  it started out as being one bright light, then became two, then three, then four, the lights were in a straight line configuration and then were in an isosceles triangular pattern.  then the lights were in a straight line again and began quickly strobing.  then the lights appeared to be rotating fairly quickly in the sky.  the object moved like a precision machine.  then i saw the back of the object.  it looked like it was leaving and the afterburners were briefly illuminating the back of the object.  the back looked like it was trapezoidal in shape with the bottom of it being wider than the top.  it had some detailing on the back that looked like a protruding metal feature on the back of it.  it had a dull grey color and looked very solid.  there were no wings on the object and it was completely silent.  it definitely was not one of the surveillance blimps that are in the sky in this area at times and are used by the border patrol.  it looked too mechanical and moved too fast to be a blimp.  it was also very large.  as big as a 747.  after i saw the back of the object it disappeared.  my girlfriend says that she sees it near her home on a frequent basis and it moves to different parts of the sky.  it really freaked me out i can tell you that.

her house. we were sitting on a small hill in the grass.  the slope we sat on had a clearing about 500 meters from where we were. the trees were fairly low so that did not hinder our view of this event.  we both saw what looked like a very bright star at first,  it then glowed 10 times brighter than it was at first and  shot strait up in the air.  it was hard to judge exact distance  but i would say the trail it left in the sky had to be at least 4 feet  (  if i was measuring right in front of me )  again it's hard to judge exactly how long it really was  but if i had to guess i would say it shot out  a least a mile.\r\n\r\ni have been told that i saw a shooting star, but i have seen many shooting stars before and for one they usually go from side to side  they are usually small and hardly visable - at least the ones i have seen.  this object i saw went strait up  and it was very large. it's hard for me to judge size with out seeing a re-creation of the event  but it was much bigger than a star ( probably because it was a lot closer?  )  .  \r\n\r\nthe really weird thing about this was the light trail it left in the sky  and the speed of which the object shot up.   the

house in roseville, michigan (a suburb of detroit). it was around 10:00 pm and there were some wispy clouds, patches of clear night sky, and what appeared to be a full/new moon and a few stars. looking up at the moon to the east, i noticed what i at first thought was a bright airplane light heading from the east to the west, in line to pass directly over my father's suburban backyard. almost immediately it became apparent to me that the plane light did not resemble the typical size or color one is used to seeing on commercial or private aircraft. the color was amber and the light seemed to be a radiant light similar to the red hot rings on an electric stove. i pointed the light out to my 13 year old daughter and asked her if she could hear the \"plane.\" neither of us could hear the typical sounds of an airplane motor or jet engine, despite the fact that the light passed directly overhead. the light seemed to be gliding and moving at a steady speed. we could not make out any object or shape above, below or around the light. the light glided into the cloud layer and was gone from sight. we discussed it and both agreed that we had seen something odd. not any type of plane or jet that we've ever seen. we went back outside to the car about 10-15 minutes later and gliding in from the east were two more of the lights we had seen earlier. again, they passed directly overhead at a fast but steady speed. the lights were all of the same size and the two lights were gliding along at the same pace, one slightly trailing the other. no commercial or private aircraft would fly that close together. it is possible they were military aircraft as selfridge afb is located in macomb county and lies to the northeast of my father's backyard. however, these military aircraft would have had to have been silent. most jet engines are noisy or would create some sound. and there were no contrails or exhaust. my daughter got a good look at the lights the second time and described a bright round amber light in the middle surrounded by a bright amber ring of light. in between was darkness. these two lights also flew into the cloud cover and they have never been seen from my father's backyard since.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

and my husband left early december 10 to run an early morning errand, so unfortunately i was home alone.  i smoke cigarettes, so i was sitting out on the patio enjoying the morning sky, smoking a cigarette. my view was towards the west.  i saw an egg shaped haze, (about the size of an egg if you held it up to the sky with your arms extended), and the best way i can explain it is, it looked like an \"out of focus\" patch of blue sky, as though you were looking thru a gas haze.  this patch moved from the southwest toward the northeast.  the intersting thing was the points of light within the haze.  they were in a haphazard pattern, (a least 10 of them) but as the shape moved they remained stationary.  as the haze moved, more tiny lights would appear in the front of the haze, and the lights in the back would disappear.  it was as if you were shining a flashlight against a wall in a dark room, as you move the light across the wall, the pattern in the wall remains stationary, but as the light of the flashlight moves, whats in front lights up and whats in back of it fades out.  it didn't move fast, just slowly moved across the sky, until it was out of my range of vision.\r\n\r\ni was very upset no one else was at home to witness what i saw.  just as it moved out of view my husband returned home. dang!  \r\n\r\ni really didn't know what it could be, but my gut feeling was, and still is, that it was something that was cloaked.  possibly a craft that has the capacity to reflect back what is surrounding it, (and on this day, it's cloaking abililty was just kinda out of whack). i know this sounds like i've watched to many movies, but it just makes the most sense to me.  at the time i called the local radio station, hoping maybe someone else saw it and made a call, but no, i was told no one else had reported any usual sightings.\r\n\r\ni still think about it, and wonder.  that's why i needed to record what i saw with this email.  maybe it will make sense to someone else.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nkathy hamberis\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

cutlass), on our way to stay the night at her brother's in-laws house. the house was on a rural peninsula of the tenn. river, in the scottsboro, al area.\r\n\r\napproximately a few hundred yards into our trip (with no house immediately close by), the clear, cool night was interrupted by a startling event. the car lost its power, the street light went out and my battery-operated seiko lcd watch (one of the first, which i still own but never use anymore) lost its power. at the same time, maybe a second or two after this occurred and having the car safely come to a stop, an incredibly bright, white light appeared off to our right side (tree side, not the side of the water). i opened my driver's side window and heard no crickets as we heard when we left her brother's house... it was dead silent.\r\n\r\nthe light stopped over our car and we tried to peer out the windshield to try and catch a glimpse of the object. after being blinded by the light, my fiancee wanted to get out to look. i cautioned her to stay in the car as we didn't know what it was. we locked our doors and sat there, trying to see what it was. after what appeared to be only a few minutes when my fiancee's watch restarted, which seemed like an eternity, the light disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. a few seconds after it left the scene (with no swoosh or other noise that we could discern), the idiot lights on the car came back on, the radio came back on and the headlights came on. i looked at my watch and, it too, had begun to work once again, as had fiancee's dial watch. i started the car and noticed the street light came back on and i heard crickets outside again, as i still had the window open (so much for using the locks). we finished our trip to town where we spent the nights during our trip.\r\n\r\nwell, 28+ years later, we still talk about that night. every so often, on long walks at night, in many areas of where we live and even places we visit, we have the street lights go out on us, but not all of them... just one or two... which may not mean anything at all in this context, but it is weird.\r\n\r\nwe once heard from a niece who grew up in alabama that her grandparents (whom we stayed with on that trip in 1981) had similar events all the time on that stretch of road, at night, on their way home.\r\n\r\nin conclusion, i have since read and heard many stories of a similar nature, and have seen some ufo type of explanations. however, i have no idea what it was that was present that april night in 1981. i do believe in ufos and the possibility/reality of there being people other than ourselves in the universe. and, i have heard double-talk denials of something or someone in the hangers at wpafb from (now deceased) relatives who worked there. were these people just pulling my teenage leg at the time? probably... but, what if...\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

mechanical the way it rotated and the lights changed in patterned color.  we looked it up on the web and it was explained as the atmosphere making a star change color.  we questioned that explanation

it was the same light as before, but as we looked at it it started to fall very quickly and move left to right and then it would rise.  the whole time this was going on it seemed to be moving farther away from us.  the previous months sighting they did not noticibly move.  we could tell the were moving because the neighbors tree line is visible and the lights would fall to just above the tree line

borrow a telescope from my wifes parents so we can see it up close.  i would take a lie detector test.  my wife is someone who does not have an active imagination, so to have her see the same thing

was on my balcony haveing a smoke as a light plane flow over my house i noticed in the distance (south) a flashing light, it was not a plane as the lights where flashing non stop there was no pause in between the flashing as i was watching this light crossing the sky i through it was strange that this object passed in front of the light plane, i watch planes all the time and have never seen one cross infront of another one being so close together, now the flashing light seem to be a bit higher in the sky then the light plane but i still found this weird as it was moveing in an east direction it passed behind my tree in the back yard i looked north and saw anoer object in the sky same flashing lights as i waited for the other unkown object to reappear behind the tree the second object seem to head south heading for the other object then this object stop paused there for a good 30 seconds at this point the first light reappeard heading for the second object, at this point i noticed the second object start heading down then paused and vanished,\r\nthe first object keep its caurse and after about 20 second it re appeard it was above the first object now just in front of it its flight path was strange it would stop then move again then it would almost vanish but i could just see it the first object seemed to slow down when it was near the second object at this point i ran downstairs grab the scope of my telescope to get a better view but when i went back out side the two objects had vanished they where completely gone, i only took about 10-20 seconds to grab the scope.\r\nat first i through mabey a helecopter but i never seen two helecopter in the sky in adelaide so close together and acting they way they did after it crossed in front of the plane i through that was very odd and the fact that they just vanished was strange to

apt. every night from at least 7-9 pm. i have recorded in a log at least 1-9 objects everyday since then, most are high up and only an amber light is seen crossing overhead and over mcarren airport and some like this one worth reporting as it defies the norms. \r\nfirst note that all the amber lights i have seen are just that, one light, no flashing or other colors ever in all my logging days. at 7:30pm i saw a dim amber white ball heading sw very high up, like a star. at 7:33pm i saw what looked like a shooting star going nw, but it looked like it was only approx. 100' up from me. . i made a note . at 8:07pm another ball appeared over my head heading e then instantly headed se with a ziggy motion for a few sec. then it dissapeared. i started to look elsewhere then a plane appeared there where there was none heading sw. made another note. then at 8:12 a bright semi-white ball shot a looong 5 sec.(1-1 thousand 2 ect) from my tree tops w (35' high) to the ne and 1/2 way across the sky over my apt. it was not as fast as a shooting star. it laft a trail behind it , like vapor with a few sparks. i couldn`t see the trail after it was gone.No sound.  alas no picture, i tried but my phone camera is not fast enough. will invest in a good night film in an unopenable package for the future. \r\nif you would be interested in my log book i can send a copy. it starts on april 23- aug 12 sporatic siteings and from aug. 20 to date everyday from 7-9pm everyday, sometimes longer and as some mornings i can`t sleep so sit outside.
