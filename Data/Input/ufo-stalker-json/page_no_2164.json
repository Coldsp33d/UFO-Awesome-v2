that it was a huge black triangle, except that the back part of the triangle was concaved toward the front point. all black except for the dim light that it produced from the center front middle of the under belly. the dim light was what had originally caught my eye when i first noticed the object, it was completely silent as it glided overhead. i watched it for a few more seconds until i lost sight of it in cloud cover as the craft travelled south in a straight line same altitude. i'm not sure how high it was, only that it was flying a lot higher than say a cesna airplane but not as high as a commercial airliner. i'm not sure how fast it was traveling, only that it took about to 6-8 seconds to fly over from one side of the sky to the other, but that is including the clouds that were on the horizons. it was about the size of what a half dollar would look like if it were in your hand with your arm fully extended toward the sky. it was big, it was fast, it was silent and it was an

maitland blvd) and as i was leaving in my car, i stopped at a stop sign and saw an triangular object flying towards maitland summit blvd just over the tall building under construction there. first thing i noticed was the two white lights in the back of the object and one white light (which looked to be in the middle of the two lights in the back but in the front of the object). it was nighttime and i couldn't make out any form between those lights, so i came to the conclusion that it was triangular from the configuration of the lights alone. it also had a red blinking light right smack dab in the middle of the two lights in the back. it seemed to blink on cue, same interval each time (every two seconds or so).\r\n\r\nshortly after viewing the object, the front light shut off and i didn't see it come back on the rest of the time i viewed the object. it didn't pass in front of any clouds when the light went out so nothing was obstructing my view of the light. it was moving away very slowly, and at this point, i shut my music off and rolled down the window and couldn't hear any sound coming from it. it seemed to be close enough that i would have heard something.\r\n\r\ni lost a visual of the object when i had to pull up to an intersection with my car facing in the opposite direction the object was traveling in. i live less than a mile away in the direction the object was moving and i couldn't see it on my way home. while driving home, i called my wife to see if she could see it and she couldn't. she had brought our dogs outside to use the bathroom while looking in the sky and we noticed that all the dogs in the neighborhood seemed stressed out and they were very noisy. my own dogs were very upset and stressed when they came outside too. i don't know if it was related at all, but it sure seemed quite strange.\r\n\r\nit's possible that this was a plane i guess, but it was flying slow enough and looked strange enough for me to want to report it at least.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

something strange on the face of the mountain behind us (wilson mountain, sedona).  while i was getting dressed, i happened to look out my apartment window that faces the mountain, and i noticed this extremely bright rectangular (column) of light, perfectly rectangular in shape on the face of the mountain.  when i arrived next door and made my way to the deck facing the mountain, there were now two columns, identical in shape on the face of the mountain, one slightly up and behind the other column. we estimated that, from the distance we were (approx. 1/2 mile), these must have been approximately 15 feet in width, and about 40 feet tall.   they both were separated in 4 segments, equal in size, (as if you were to stack four smaller rectangles equal in shape on top of each other), and within minutes there seemed to be these \"orange\" spheres of light blinking and appearing in the area around these columns.  as i, my neighbor and her 21 year old son stood on the deck, i proceeded to set up my telescope to get a better look. this was all taking place in the dark, on a perfectly clear starlit night.  while setting up the telescope, my neighbor was watching them with binoculars.  she commented that these almost looked like large \"windows\" or doorways in the side of the mountain, which after looking through the binoculars, i agreed.  as we were watching, the column behind the first suddenly became extremely bright.  after setting up the telescope and trying to angle it in the direction of these lights, the brightest column suddenly dimmed, and remained visible for about 20 minutes... then totally disappeared.  the first column remained, but dimmed as well.  i was unable to focus the telescope, and so i asked my neighbor to see if she might be successful.  she was able to angle the scope, which showed what appeared to be something that resembled a \"shuttered\" rectangular window.  all three of us witnessed this, and initially argued whether this was a house ( which we knew no house existed at that level or height on the mountain.. but agreed that we would keep an open mind until daylight.  note: we left the telescope angled at this sight, and looking out the deck in the morning it was clear that there was no houses or buildings where these 'lights' or doorways/windows appeared.  ) after viewing this \"shuttered\" formation for about 10 minutes, it too disappeared.  for the next 30 minutes, there was nothing more on the face of the mountain.  i have seen orbs, orange lights, and the like moving about the formations here.. but i've never witnessed such a thing as this, as large or tall, and perfectly shaped.  i believe without a doubt that there are 'bases' of some sort or portals that exist here in sedona among the formations.

there are many trails for people to travel along and i walked into a clearing.  the clearing is just down a path from the ansonia nature center in ansonia, ct.  i was simply meandering through the clearing aimlessly gazing around when i noticed an object towering above some trees.  the part of the object i saw was conical or the pointy end of an egg.  there appeared to be geometrical shaped paneling that was gray and a black panel, maybe a window or viewing bay roughly at the center of the side of craft.  the object was stationary and apparently was on the ground roughly 100 yds away.  i only saw the top half of the craft as there were trees blocking the lower portion.  at first i didn't think much of the sighting at all and continued to meander around a bit more as if the object had always been there or was nothing of significance.  after a double-take i walked back to a spot where i could see the craft and found myself in rather a state of disbelief, mystified, scared, in awe, shocked, and a eerie sort of sinister feeling came over me that the object wasn't from earth and just didn't quite belong here.  i continued to move around a bit and strangely found myself stopping and putting my nose up against an errant plant limb.  i stood there with my nose touching the limb for roughly two minutes as if i was frozen or unable to move and as i was doing so something very lightly and gently began to rub up against my nose as if trying to comfort me or something. after this occurrence, i began to move again and decided to get away from the area and walked back home rather quickly and scared.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),  Patterned

conditions were clear, unlimited visibility, no clouds in the sky. temperature 69 deg. wind o, humidity 96 percent. observed star low to the west about 10 degrees above the horizon. the star seemed to be changing from silver light to red light. i went in the house and brought back my binoculars which are military surplus, unknown magnification. i laid the binoculars on top of my pickup bed and was able to see the object in a steady state. the light was also appearing to change colors through the binoculars and was a great distance away. size was slightly smaller than venus.I went back in the house and looked up the current position of mars, thinking that was what i had seen. learning that mars is not in the west, and not visible at that time of evening, i went back outside. the object had disappeared. i continued to observe the western sky quadrant i am able to see, (light pollution, trees, and buildings are present). after about 15-20 minutes i saw what looked like a rapidly moving small cloud approaching from the north at 3 o clock position. when the cloud was directly above my position it reminded me of a moving searchlight illuminating the bottom of a cloud layer. as the object/cloud moved on to the south i was able to see more details. the object/cloud was very dim, no lights at all and no sound. elevation to the object/cloud was approximately 5000 feet, boomerang shape and wing span was about 400 feet. wing width was 50-80 feet. there was some taper of the wings from center to tip, the center was probably about 1/3 greater than the tip width. there appeared to be several alternating bands of grey cloudy to dark sky bands that were ahead of the wings starting about halfway out on the leading edge of the wings, curving around the tips, and extending back past the trailing wing tip edges.  this gave the impression that the wing tips were extended backwards for quite a distance, but i think that was an illusion due to the bands of cloud flowing around the wing tips. the object/cloud was obscured by a tree as it continued to move and i did not see any further details. i continued to watch the sky thinking that i might see something else, and also thinking that if what i saw was indeed a searchlight illuminating a thin cloud that i would see it again. this did not happen. if this was a searchlight (such as an airport beacon), the airport would have to be due south of my location. to my knowledge there is no airport in that direction. duration of this sighting as described above was approximately 30 seconds. the object/cloud moved in a straight line, no variation in course and no apparent change in altitude. i have a sketch done with autocad in an attempt to demonstrate the alternating bands of cloud seen flowing around the wing tips on this object, i am unable to attach the document to this report.

that there were a couple flashes of light out her windows and a few seconds later the electic in her house was going crazy. \r\nright away i drove to her home where i witnessed flickering and zapping going on with her front porch lights. she had her kids and their friends outside as i met her in the driveway. from there we went in the house and down into the basement to the circuit breaker box. it was a bit unsetteling because of the lights and i could hear buzzing, zapping, snapping...Like the sound downed power lines make when touching. i honestly thought she was having shorts in her wiring as i'm following her through the room to the circuit box. \r\nnow at the box, i could hear the same zapping and buzzing coming from the wall all around it. she didn���t want to open the box, so i did. there was nothing, no sparks, no fire, no burnt smell, nothing. it all looked normal. she had said earlier she called the power emergency line and they didn���t answer so then she called 911 and then 911 called her back as we were standing there in the basement and told her that they had other numbers for the power co. and finally got a hold of someone and were sending them out. \r\nthe light flickering and buzzing/snapping continued as we walked around her basement. a few moments later when i was standing by her back door in the other room of the basement i seen a flash of bright light from outside her door window. i then stepped outside and we stood for a little bit looking around trying to determine where the flash of light came from. \r\nat around 10:30 pm the guy from the power co. shows up and the electrical activity had already died down. he checked her basement, the entire house, the garage, all outside her home, the poles, everything...He even put a monitor on her circuit breaker. he was at her house for close to 3 hours checking everything, including the poles and wires up and down the road she lives on. i stayed with her for a little bit longer after he left and then i left myself. i think i got home around 1:30am. after i was home for a bit she texted me again saying that its starting again. \r\nthe power guy found nothing wrong with anything inside or outside her home. he was very professional and did a very through job on checking everything. he found nothing, yet with what i was seeing and hearing his findings didn't make sense to me. her house

approximately 4:15 am, sept 14, 2009.  looked out of ground floor bedroom window which faced south toward our dog kennel and saw quick strobe flashing white light.  appeared to be a couple of miles away.  1 1/2 to 3 miles away.  which would put it just over south delaware.  i am along the scioto river just west of delaware.  strobe light caught my attention.  there was an occasional red light and i just assumed it to be a small aircraft.  what seemed curious to me was the complete lack of sound and irratic movement unlike plane or helicopter.  object appeared to be 1500 - 2000 feet in the air and kept my attention because it bobbed up and down at that altitude staying in the same general area while always moving a bit but in a completely irratic manner including zigzagging, drifing up and down, to the left, to the right, sometimes having a red light, sometimes not.  sometimes bright, sometimes not.  much higher than a police helicopter looking for something or someone.  and again without any attendant sound.  it stayed in the same area for 90 minutes just while i happened to be awake watching it. i was feeling after a few minutes like i was watching something i had never seen before.  the sky is pretty dark here in the ostrander area between delaware and marysville and it is always interesting to look at the sky with or without the possibility of ufos.  this object was different in that there was no flight path from one location to another.  it was above the height of a typical helicopter but below the height of a commercial aircraft and had a very uncharacteristic bobbing and zigzagging drifting motion all in the same general area just not going anywhere.  it appeared to have a motion most similar to a fishing bobber in choppy waves only in slow motion.  i left in the van at 5:40-5:45 am to find what the object was hovering over and found it impossible to keep sight of object and drive at the same time.  it was just gone when i looked up after driving for a

short time we could see that it was not a person, but a metal colored cylinder.  it appeared to be attached close to one end of the chutte and dangled erratically.  at first i thought it was because

vanished; but vanished instantly as if it hadn't been there.  then the cloud started to come down very quickly, as if it was coming right at us.  we started to get out of the pool and head in to the

alberta.  it was a bright, beautiful morning, and not a cloud in the sky.  i woke up late for work, so i jumped in a work truck and headed for my co worker who was a back hoe operator.  it was about 8:30 in the morning.  i was waiting for the back hoe driver to finish digging out a hole in the ground.  i sat in a truck in a huge clearing in the woods.  i was about 200 feet away from the back hoe.  the clearing was huge, and was made to build a particular part of the pipeline.  i seen something in the distance just over the treeline, around 9:10am.  it was a small white object.  moving very slowly, maybe 5 feet a second.  i thought it might be a plane or helicopter, but it was too close to the ground, so i kept watching.  it was coming closer and closer, and right in my direction.  i jumped out of the truck to see it more clearly.  i turned the truck off to see if it was making any noise, but it wasn't.  my heart started pounding as hard as ever, when i realized it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  soon, it was right above the clearing, and right above the back hoe and the operator inside it.  i waved and yelled as loud as i could to get his attention, since the back hoe was loud itself.  he noticed me for a second, so i pointed above him.  he looked up for a second, but didn't see anything, because of the cage that was built around the operators area for safety, and not seeing anything, he kept on working. then the slow moving cylinder was exactly right above me.  it was about 100 feet long, and 20 feet wide.  a perfect, pure white cylinder.  i couldn't see any seams, doors or windows.  it was travelling in a perfectly straight line.  it's like they wanted me to see them.  it kept on slowly creeping in the sky away from me to the opposite side of the clearing and i watched until it left my field of sight.  when i couldn't see it any more, i franticly ran to my co-worker i asked him if he noticed anything, but he didn't.  i told him what i seen, and he said, \"it's probably jesus!\" since he was a devout religious man. this stuck with me, because since then, i found out that it was written in the bible that moses followed a giant white cylinder,(but moses's cylinder was emitting flames) to where the 10 commandments were written and moses also followed one for 40 years through the desert.  i also found many videos on the internet of white cylinders, including a video from the russian army. they chased it with super sonic jets, and couldn't keep up with it.  in that video, they have a cgi comparison of a russian jet to the cylindrical object.  i think that it is about the same size and description of exactly what i saw.  i have been watching the skys ever since.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19331,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":58.510343,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-09152009-0013","longitude":-117.132954,"occurred":1049732100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1253054893000,"summary":"Pure

the balcony of our hotel, which was ocean front.  i was looking up at the sky and saw a flash of orange light.  it appeared instantly like a flash, then faded away.  i yelled at my boyfriend to come watch.  about 5 minutes later we both saw it, and this time it had a second light that flashed after the first one disappeared, but the second light was positioned farther down and to the right of the first light.  he said \"oh it's just landing gear on a plane.\"  then i asked where the other lights were if it was just a plane...He agreed with me.  about 15 minutes later we saw it appear again, except it was in a different part of the sky.  the light was definately orange, and definately brighter and bigger than any of the stars.  we could also see one of the planets, and the orange light was bigger than the glowing planet.  this all happened between 10-10:30pm.  we went to bed.  my boyfriend woke up around 4am to go to the bathroom and he stepped outside and saw the light flash again....Which was 6 hours later, which threw the whole idea of \"it might of been a plane\" out the window.  he grabbed his dsl-r camera and set it on the tripod.  the flashing light came back and he was able to snap a couple of pictures before it went away.  the next couple of nights that we were there, i went outside to see if the light came back, but we never did see it again.","distance":"Over
