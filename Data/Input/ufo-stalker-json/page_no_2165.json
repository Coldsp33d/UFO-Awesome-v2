bodyguards were walking home. just when we go out of the cinema, i looked up in the sky. two spotlights were shooting up in the sky from the cinema. i love spotlights in the sky, because it looks so cool. so, i kept looking at the pillars of light while slowly walking across the marketsquare. then suddenly, i see a light that flies by very fast. i thought it was a meteorite or something, because i only saw it for a second, and then it disappeared over the roof of the mall called \"pub\". i was really happy, because i love rare events such as meteorites. but then, still looking at the sky, i see a new object! however, this one gets hit by the spotlight and reflects the light like it was a mirror! i quickly realise that a rock doesn't reflect light that well, satellites are too far up, airplanes are also too far up to cause the size of the reflection and so on.\r\nwhen the reflection was at it's biggest, it was probably... a little smaller than my pinkynail. both objects were flying at the same direction i think, and if so, both were west-bound. the second object came approximately 5 seconds after the first one. i was really shocked afterwards, because i realised that this was my first sighting were i actually had a clue about the material it was made from.\r\n\r\nanother maybe important note; at the premiere there were many swedish celebrities, and i saw 5 or more highly ranked politicians, most from the current government. there were also actors, movie-makers, famous journalists etc. i don't know, but it just seems a little intended that two objects flew above the cinema just when a huge number of famous and loved people were starting to exit the building.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

smaller but that is what the coloring reminded me of was the moon on a smokey night. the large size of these objects was very apparent. in order for the objects to appear as they did while we were driving meant they had to be large, flying low, and a distance away. i believed the lights to be in the direction of phoenix. we were both quite excited by the sighting. it was like being a little kid again, seeing something for the first time. there were some poor quality pictures of the objects which are no longer in my possession. we lost sight of the objects as we neared the mountains and i never seen them again. the next day i was at my father's house and he was watching tv and a commercial for the local news came on and i seen the video of what i had seen the night before. i told him chanel \"my ex\" and i had seen those ufo's the night before. i sat down to watch the report and it said it was a phoenix sighting and some air force goon had said it was his neighbor who had tied

very dark still. i looked up, saw a bright light to the east/south east that appeared to be flashing and changing position sightly. it was acting like a hovering object that was \"bobbing\" up and down and to the left/right some. it was not stable in place, but it was not also moving in any particular direction, just maintaing it's position more or less. randomly much smaller whitish lights would flash at various ditances from the main light. some would be very close, some would be quite far away (maybe 30 or so widths of the main light). watching, it became quite obvious to me this not ust a star or planet. i looked around the sky. and to the east i saw another one, brighter that the first. same \"bobbing\" movement, same random radial flashing lights. i watched them for about 10 miuntes. at this point i went inside to get my wife so she could verify what i was seeing, and we observed them from our bedroom window. after about 5 minutes, i went outside again, stood the same spot and noticed that the second light had drifted to the south east some. it's location over the trees had changed, yet the first one had stayed more or less in the same location - again using the tree tops as reference and being in the same spot as i had previously been. i began to look around the sky some more, and began noticing other ligts doing the exact same thing as the first 2. these were less bright, some not much brighter than the stars (2 were right near the stars in orion's belt and not much brighter). all had the flashing lights that blinked randomly around the main light. i counted 7 total. the arrangment in the sky seemed random, some were lower toward the horizon, some higher, but all were to the east and south east. after maybe a total of 35 minutes watching them, the flashing smaller lights seemed to stop, leaving only the main light in each of the 7 cases. i watched them until dawn, at which point they began to fade into the light. all except for the second one i observed seemed to stay in place more or less.

we know the smell of every farm chemical and this was nothing she had smelled before. i\r\n i read where on july 24, 2009, a crop circle was discovered at wibur, washington. if you take a ruler and lay it on a washington state map the  line would be a straight going north-north west and in the exact line the copters flew over town and headed away the first night i saw them.\r\n then on the  night of september 11, 2009, my daughtr and i went outside to star gaze. we saw a \"star\" headed across the sky from west to east in a straight line, about 15 degrees above the horizon. it got very much brighter, and accellerated up and away from it's position at a high rate of speed disappearing into the dark. i hate to say it, but it looked just like star trek when the ship jumps into hyperspace. we then saw a \"star moving directly overhead and zig-zagging from it's center position to the west,back to center, back to west, back to center. the degree of zig-zag was small, but very discernable. i then saw another \"star\" move, stop, turn in a circle, then disappear. my daughter then saw a small globe of light, perhaps 40ft off the ground streak past her. we went inside, scared but a little excited.\r\n then last night, september 12, 2009, at about 10:30pm, we went back outside and saw a bright object, much like an aiplane when seen head on in the sky near the mountains. (it was not an airplane..There were no running lights, no noise). we were watching it, when it suddenly moved at a very high rate of speed directly towards us, covering 25 miles in seconds. we were terrified. it stopped at the edge of town, which is only 3 blocks away and hovered perhaps 200ft above the ground. it was very bright,very menacing, silent,shaped like an orb with spikes coming out and seemed to have a compainion light under it to one side. we were very scared. we ran into the house and we peeked out of a window and it stayed positioned for about 2 hours. at one point i watched the light blink out, only to go back to the window later and see it was back.  we turned on all the lights in the house, locked the doors and windows, brought in the cat and huddled in the living room afraid to sleep. at about 3am my daughter went to the kitchen window over the sink. that side of the house is very dark with no outdoor light and a large tree in the yard. she turned off the lights, pulled back the curtain and screamed. she saw a grey shape, about 4ft tall, grey colored from top to bottom, in an approximate human form moving rapidly across the yard from south to north. \r\n  i cannot begin to tell you how frightened we are by what has occured. we are not hoaxing you, we are just regular people caught in an abnormal and frightening situation. i just read where a pilot from oregon witnessed a bright silent light hover over his home. his \"ufo\" sounds like the same type as we witnessed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

pattern that can be likened to a chevron but in boomerang formation. there was one blue arrow-like spot in the front. there were 4 others behind it slightly staggered, but equal distance apart. it was large and appeared in a faint cloud formation to the east of our home. in the blink of an eye, it had jumped quite a distance and just blinked in and out and was gone. it looked like it could have been the under lighting of a large craft, but being ex-military, i don't think we have technology that moves in the blink of an eye. my wife is especially sensitive to electromagnetic and static

makes me think of christmas.  : )\r\n\r\non other nites, i have seen them in the western sky also. \r\n\r\ni am a believer because of my passed experiences. one in summer of 1966 when i was outside walking a path to my aunts house next door to where i lived. i was 12 years old and seen the ship(disc) going down in our field about 200 ft away. i ran back to my house and sat on the couch facing the picture window. scared to death. within minutes, i seen a glowing ball(soccer ball size) pass from east to west across the window as if to say \"we know you seen us\"! \r\n\r\nin april 2007, it was a clear nite. i pulled into my driveway, got out of my car and a glowing ball (soccer ball size) appeared right in front of me about 10 feet out. it was there for 2 seconds and disappeared with a boom.  (same as i seen in the year of 1966)\r\nmy boyfriend was in my house and heard the boom also.\r\n\r\nthen 3 weeks later 5/11/07, i and another person had a small ship fly very slowly approx. 50 feet above our heads at the establishment where we work.\r\nnote !!... at around that time period, i was wishing that i would see a ufo again before i die.(wishes do come true) i thought this because my nephew who was in the navy observed and reported a red light over the smoke stacks at puget sound in wa state march 2007. (my nephew was contacted by peter davenport of nuforc and it was listed as a creditable sighting on the main page of that website.) as far as this 5/11/07 incident goes, my navy nephew commented that the government would not have aircraft flying over massillon ohio.\r\n\r\nmaybe our government is capable of making such airships.. but i can't believe a glowing ball suspended in mid air or floating and just disappearing in front of your face!  \r\n\r\nsomeday, the truth will be known to all. we are being watch over .. \r\n...We need to be!\r\n\r\ni am on the ufo sites everyday. thanks to all who do report their truthful sightings.\r\n\r\ngod bless.  live long and

a very large dark rectangular shape in the sky north/northwest of dia. it appeared fairly stationary and i my first thought was that dorothy wasn't in kansas anymore. when she saw it she said what i had been thinking. it looked like a huge house--with no roof.\r\n\r\nthe bottom and sides were very straight and squared off. the top was straight but not as linear as the other sides and was a bit fuzzy on the top and right. there were low clouds being built from chemtrail grids at the time as well, but the object was below those clouds. \r\n\r\nthe object was a good distance away--ten or more miles, hard to tell--and the perspective on size was difficult until a plane appeared adjacent to it. the plane was very bright silver and very small in perspective to the rectangle (maybe 100 to 1 or greater). other planes landing and taking off that day did not have the same appearance as the silver plane near the object. \r\n\r\nmy friend and i watched the object as we drove and it may have begun to move, but we were moving so can't be sure of that. when we looked back, it was gone. we had sight of it for a minute or so. i would love to know if anyone else saw this object as
