towards the north i spotted at first what i described to my sister as a plane on fire but one i exited house an viewed it from yard it looked more like a cone/triangle shaped object that shifted forms somewhat as i viewed it. it was sometimes more triangle shaped than cone but the light on bottom remained what looked like a sphere of fire. after about 30 seconds i got off phone and told my sister to call my mom and tell her to look outside. i then called up my neighbor and talked to him for the duration of event. unfortunatly he was not home at the time but wanted to listen to my descriptions. i was honestly so amazed and scarred at what i was seeing i was glad to have his presense over the phone. i watched the 1st object for 2-3mins move slowly eastwards and hover before it slowly moved upwards and northeast gradually going over horizon. i rememeber telling my neighbor it was gone but i couldn't stop watching sky. my skygazing was rewarded about 30-45 seconds later when another similiar object appeared. this one hovered in sky near the location where 1st one did for about 1 minute before moving north and upwards thru the clouds. my feelings during this event were that i was seeing something i wasn't supposed to be seeing. a ufo here? how come theres not hundreds of other people able to see this. i left event deluding myself into writing it off as a flare and maybe it was. i'm no expert in non commercial aircraft. lately i'm feeling that i was lucky to see it. glad to share.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

vicinity of the blackwater trading post, at approximately 1815 hrs.  the object was significantly brighter than anything else appearing in the northern sky at this time.  the initial impression was that it could possibly be the landing lights of a commercial aircraft on approach (which frequently fly over the area).  however the size and brightness of the object would have indicated that the aircraft would have been flying much lower than usual.  given the time of day, there was still a significant amount of sunlight which should have made the shape of any aircraft visible, none was observed.\r\n\r\nupon closer inspection the object seemed to maintain a stationary position.  the initial color of the observed object was a very bright \"clean\" white light.  the exact shape of the object was difficult to determine due to its luminescence, but was roughly circular/spherical.\r\n\r\nthe object was observed further upon arriving in coolidge az, approximately 5-10 minutes later.  the object had not seemed to change position, luminosity or color during this time frame.  \r\n\r\nthe object remained stationary in the sky north/nw of coolige az for the next 25-40 minutes.  the brightness of the object remained constant with the exception of a slight dimming effect when occasional clouds seemingly passed between the object and observers.  the color of the object changed from a \"clean\", bright white light to an orange/yellow to an orange to a red color during the 25-40 minutes it was observed.  this change in color seemed directly proportional to the degree with which the sun past below the horizon.  during this time, while the color changed, the brightness did not seem to change.\r\n\r\nas the sun dropped below the horizon the object had taken on a distinctly red coloration.  a few minutes later a cloud seemed to pass in front of the object which remained visible, though slightly less bright.  during this time behind the cloud, the object steadily faded in brilliance until it was no longer visible.  when the clouds passed and clear sky appeared the object was still not visible.  the object did not reappear.  no sounds, sensations or movements were

which was due north. the flash was so quick i chalked it up to my eyes just playing tricks on me, but a few seconds later another blue/white flash which appeared to go just from above the horizon, to straight into the ground. the weird part is, it seemed to be within a couple of hundred feet of me. i grabbed my cell phone to check the radar and local lightning data for my area(i have weather service on my phone) and all was clear. this all happened around 01:30 a.M. i'm a photographer, so i decided to go inside and grab my camcorder and camera to see if i could get something strange on video. as soon as i got up and started walking to the house(02:07 a.M.) i saw a cobalt blue flash toward the ene. it only lasted as long as say a camera flash, but it had a fairly distinct shape to it, like a cigar. a few seconds later an even bigger blue flash in the shape of a square on a slight uphill tilt towards me. it lit up the same area for about 1.5 seconds and then just disappeared as if someone cut off a switch . everytime it appeared to be semi-transparent. i know it is not likely that it was some kind of power failure due to no lights inside or out flickered, dimmed, etc at the time of said event, or shortly after. 10 minutes later another white flash, but no definite shape. i am a huge skeptic when it comes to ufo's, ghost, esp, etc. i don't believe in any of it. i know there has to be a logical explanation for this phenomena.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

looked up in the sky. a bright circular light in the north east, that resembled a little moon, caught my attention. the closest i can describe the size of the circular light is the size of a traffic light from across street. it was much too big for an airplane or a star/planet. this was at 6:48pm pacific/mountain time. the light was about as bright as the moon on a clear day and didn't seem to move the entire 13 minutes or so that we watched it. within the first few seconds of me watching this light i asked my wife what it was and she replied that she didn't know. so i told her to call my brother who has binoculars. as she went inside to call him i remained outside watching the light as clouds would pass in front of it yet i was still able to see it quite clearly from behind the scattered dark clouds. for a brief moment i wondered if it were just the moon hiding behind the clouds but then i remembered that when i first seen it there were no clouds in front of it. my brother and mom had come out to see this light and luckily got to witness it as well. unfortunately though as soon as we were able to find the binoculars the clouds had covered the light which was barely visible from behind the clouds yet still visible. eventually at about 7:02 pm the dark clouds had covered the light completely and when there was an opening in the clouds we no longer seen the light. i'm very aware that there was a space shuttle landing this evening but it landed in california at 5:53 pm as to where i witnessed this ufo at 6:48 pm. not to mention the light was stationary for nearly 15 minutes, from what i had seen. needless to say, all of us that had seen it, were very baffled and would like to know what it was that we had seen.
