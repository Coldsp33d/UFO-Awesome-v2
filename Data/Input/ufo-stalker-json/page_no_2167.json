her job at lowe's and departed from me in the parking lot of the store, i remained in the car with the plan of staying there until it was a little later on in the day when my friends would be awake. i noticed that all around me it grew strangely dark and the sun shone so brilliantly and some feeling or force took hold of me and made me grab my cell phone and jump out of the car and start to take pictures of the event. suddenly two objects appeared out of the sun moving in complete unision with each other and i was in awe unbelieving i was actually witnessing this, i looked all around me and no one else seemed to be aware. one object appears to be an eye and the other is a sort of sphere or u.F.O., these objects moved as if they had life. the sun clearly has a sword piercing through it. the eye went all around moving incredibly fast and the other object followed in the same manner as the eye seemed to be looking upon the earth. also above the eye appeared what looked like a face of fire looking down from the heavens. the objects then went back into the direction of the sun and dissapeared back into the heavens. i still cannot believe it but it happened to me, i would be much obliged if anyone can shed light on the images i have taken because from that day i have been perplexed as to what the event meant for my sake and for the sake of the human

sun was down but it was summer and it was still light out.  we pulled up on york drive and noticed a whole bunch of people standing in the street all looking in the same direction (to the west) - upwards of 30 or so people i'd say.  we walked down and asked what was going on.  they pointed up to the sky.  there was a large, stationary disc-shaped object just hovering there in the sky, with white lights around the edges and four larger lights on the bottom.  it's hard to describe exactly but i remember being aghast, like you can't believe what you're seeing.  my mother ran inside to call the most trusted weatherman and newsperson in the dfw area, harold taft at channel 5, to report it and see if anyone there knew about it.  i was running back and forth between her and outside.  her fingers were shaking as she dialed.  they didn't know of anything in the sky that could cause that and said they'd gotten several other calls about it.  i remember them scrambing to find a camera, but back then they weren't kept on the ready like they are now.  military fighter jets arrived and chased it.  the object would move to a different point in the sky with incredible speed, then again just hover there while the jets had to make a traditional turn to try and pursue the object.  it moved so much faster than the jets that it was almost comical.  it was almost like it was toying with the jets, playing with them or teasing them or something as it darted here and there, making the jets try to follow.  finally it appeared to tire of the game and took off to the northwest and disappeared from sight within seconds due to the sheer speed it was travelling at.  there was a short article in the star telegram the following day, and about six months to a year later there was a follow up article saying they had done research and still had not been able to determine what the object actually was.  i've always wanted to do the research at the star telegram archives or have the other neighborhood residents interviewed just to see if any of them had movies or film.  my father also saw it and is still alive, and i'm sure there are other people still in the neighborhood who could testify what they saw.  i just thought i should document this in case anyone else could benefit from the info somehow, especially since it was documented in the newspapers.  feel free to contact me with any questions - thank you.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path

with my friend still on the line i told him what i thought it was and we ended the call.  i proceeded to get my binoculars (celestron upclose 10x50).  i was able to locate the object and found i couldn't focus it in easily.  with the sun going down i quickly located something in the distance i could test my focus on and found that everything came through clearly. i again located the object and found that it didn't resolve in focus like a star or planet and that it was gradually getting dimmer.  it color was going from white like a star to dimmer orange and that's when it occured to me that it was reflecting sunlight rather than emitting its own light.  at no time during my obervation did it move.  i called my friend back and advised him of what i was seeing.  i also retrieved my digital camera (kodak easyshare c613) and snapped off one shot.  it soon became too dim to observe even through binoculars.  i called it quits at approx. 1855 hrs.  i felt odd viewing it once i realized it was reflecting sunlight and remaining stationary.  i've viewed stars and planets as well as aircraft through my binoculars and this felt different.  i just don't know what it was.  the

was sitting in a lawn chair, facing south, the sun was just setting, it was a warm balmy, very clear sky, no clouds, no discernable winds...I then noticed a (only can describe as,pulsating orange-ish (golden) light, descending from the sky) and heading in my direction, about 5 miles away, moving rather slowly. as it got closer, i got out of my chair & moved toward the sidewalk to get a better view, trying to figure out what was that pulsating light(not flashing,not stobing) as it got closer i could see that the light was on the very front of the craft, in fact it was the whole front that was the light. i then saw my room-mates wife near the front door and yelled \"lisa, lisa come out here!!!\" she then came out & we both watched as the craft was passing by and over the roof-line of the apartment,approx 600 feet/altitude is my best guess. we could see that this cigar/blimp shaped object had no wings of any kind, no tail, no cockpit, no undercarriage, no propellers, no nothing, & it was not making a sound @ all, it was approx. the size/length of regular blimp, but was not a blimp, as it was passing overhead, we ran into & back of the apt. to the balcony and watched as it (slowly...65mph?) headed north...@ the rear of the craft we could see two small round (apertures..Both had a pale blue glow)...We were amazed and because, it was from south to north like many commercial aircraft frequently travel, daily, & monterey's airport is south east of my lacation by about 5mi's, could only say it's probably a craft that we have never seen.....But we decided not

journeyed from ne pa. to raritan nj in order to attend the wake and funeral of our aunt who just passed away. the wake was held at a funeral home in raritan.\r\n\r\n about 9:00pm it was getting pretty warm in the funeral home so i decided to go and stand on the steps outside to get some air. the first thing i noticed was that the sky was very overcast and the clouds were rather low, not a star to be seen. by the way, i am a member of mufon and i have had a previous sighting over 15 years ago.\r\n\r\n as i turned to my left i noticed what seemed to be one lone star in the sky. the first thing that entered my mind was how totally devoid the sky was of stars except for just this one. it was orangish and about the size of a bb (as in bb gun). i turned my head back to the front just enjoying the cool air. about a minute later i turned toward the star again but this time i noticed it was moving toward me. i followed its movements from my left until it was right over my head but somewhat in front of me. suddenly the orangish \"star\" just blinked out and no sooner did 2 lites ,one bright white and the other a ruby red appear, each just a short distance from each other. each of these lights were half the size of the \"bb\". they continued in the direction of the original light for a few seconds then they also blinked out, not to be seen no matter how i strained my eyes to glimpse them. through out the entire sighting the lights emitted nothing but total silence as far as sound was concerned.\r\n\r\n i was told that this area is a busy corrider for commercial aircraft. later that nite we all gathered on my cousin's patio and i observed a number of aircraft fly over which were immediately recognizable as such going by lite pattern and engine sound. what i observed earlier

we saw what looked like a very close, bright, whitish yellow star fly into view. its flight path was following the curvature of the earth. i looked away and my girlfriend saw the object turn different colors and grow larger. the colors included vivid orange and green. she then witnessed it explode. i saw a flash and heard her scream. i looked up and noticed just the star like object, but now it had a translucent bubble, oval in shape, surrounding the object. the bubble expanded. it was hard to see. the object then followed on its course across the curvature of the horizon. a second star like object at the same slow speed then followed the first objects path exactly to the same location, this one did not change colors or explode. i have seen satellite and shuttle flybys but these looked too large and traveled too slowly. my girlfriend was genuinely terrified by what she saw and i had to calm her down, which took a while. i was also very surprised to see that and i do not know what to

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This craft was observed while standing outside a home in carter lake, ia on 9-10-9 at approx 8:40pm.  fortunately, i had a new witness with me, though he wishes to remain anonymous and will go by ���jim���.  we had just finished discussing my 8-30-9 sighting and i pointed out the ne area of the sky by the constellation cassiopeia where we had seen that previous object.  at about that moment, we both saw an eastbound craft at jet cruising altitude, just under the second v in cassiopeia.  i remarked to jim that it really didn���t look like jet plane lights, when a series of brilliant, silver-white flashes were seen on the craft.  they were easily as bright as jupiter, which was hanging in the sw sky, but smaller.  more like the size of sirius, but not quite as bright.  the craft continued on the same easterly path for a few seconds showing only some fine red lights, then instantly disappeared from our view.  although there were scattered clouds in the area, there were no clouds to block the lights, nor did they fade in/out.  this craft simply vanished or went under cloak!  jim was absolutely astonished at this point and couldn���t comprehend how a plane could simply vanish.  he works with an aircraft parts supply company near eppley airfield and has seen many planes in his life.  he also witnessed with me the awesome fly-over of the iss and discovery on 9-9-9 that has helped generate so many ���ufo sightings��� over last few days.  we both agreed this was nothing like those human engineered and piloted craft.  i would strongly urge that a foia request be made for the radar data from eppley!  although it���s likely that if they can cloak, then they probably won���t show up on our radar! \r\n\r\nwe then proceeded to tell the 5 other people in the house, but my girlfriend who has seen many other objects with me was the only one to come out to try and see it again.  she was unable to perceive anything after 20-30 seconds and went back inside since we were about to start a second game of cards.  then to the amazement of jim and me, the same craft reappeared at about the same height, but now almost directly overhead and moving in a sw direction!  again, we could see some faint red lights, but no clearly defined shape since it was so high up.  the craft proceeded to flash the same brilliant strobe-like lights a few more times, shifted position and vanished again right before our eyes!!!  i should also state there was no noise or contrail from the craft.  in fact, this one seems to resemble closely the ones caught on camera in pa over last couple of months.\r\n\r\nthis craft is also very similar to what we witnessed on 2-16-9 over offutt afb while driving down hwy 75 in sarpy county.  especially the brilliant flashes of light and the fact that craft also seemed to vanish from view after banking to the north.  clearly, we are having repeated observations in the omaha metro area!  whomever or whatever is operating these craft is perhaps sending signals of some type.  i don���t feel ���blessed��� or ���chosen��� to see these things, but they keep manifesting themselves over and over.  now, i have another unbiased and independent witness to the phenomenon.  that really helps lock in the fact that there is a real, physical intelligence that desires to be known in our conscious minds and daily lives.  i do feel grateful that this is finally going to become a reality for all of humanity!  there will be challenges to be sure, but the benefits gained will far surpass the initial shock to our systems.  i am in agreement with those that believe this will be a peaceful experience leading to a newly formed coexistence with other intelligences from beyond our solar system or even galaxy.  there have been many, many hoaxes and erroneous reports caused by lack of information.  these are different.","distance":"Over

we know of, they are certainly capable!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Utopiasprings.Com/bt.Htm\r\n\r\ntheir small saucer craft reveals some structural secrets they are not supposed to tell.  see the thin curved rod structurals protruding from the mylar?\r\nthe structural secret of extremely lightweight support is in curved springy carbon fiber rods, much like those in common tents, just a little bigger.\r\n\r\ncarbon fiber \"bows\" are the secret to the structure of the large black triangles as well.  these bows allow a very taught flat under surface that can hold the central rail for equipment mounting, and overall flat profile for the triangles. some are just 3 to 4 feet thick!\r\njust enough to lay back on lightweight patio furniture like the kettlar lucca ergonomic recliner ! with full avionics and gps, gas/water valves and electical switches right over head, it really takes off !\r\n\r\nonce fully airborne, starting the fuel cell driven electric motor system is easy, but really expensive, the simpler hydrogen fuel injected combustion engine sputters along quite fast actually, although makes a slight silly noise. the nice carbon fiber propellar works great like any

seconds later another one went up in the same direction- my partner saw this one and we followed it up. this one got very bright (neither had a trail) then dimmer then brighter again, went straight up then faded and disappeared. it seemed to both of us as if they were moving up out of the atmosphere.\r\n  i kept watching the sky, saw some planes and satellites but nothing like what we had just seen. it really seemed as if something were being launched into space from the same trajectory as the first one. i thought to look on the internet if there were space launches that night but haven't looked into yet. then i realized that launches are never done in quick succession of each other.\r\n  the whole event lasted about 2 minutes and neither of us could say what it was, even though we can

house.  it simply looked like a landing light on an aircraft and as i saw it move through the trees i realized that it was quite low.  when it was directly over my house, out of the leaves of the trees and in clear view, i could see that there were no navigation lights.   as a former helicopter pilot i know what a commercial aircraft looks like in the night sky and there were no navigation lights at all.  just one bright light about 1000-1500 feet off the ground. it's hard to estimate the height at night but it was clearly very low.    it traveled for about half a mile or so towards liberty lake washington, the next town over, and then it appeared to either fly out to space or the light simply slowly turned off and disappeared.  the light was at least was 3-4 times larger than the brightest star in the sky. when i first saw the light, out of trees, i realized that this was not a commercial aircraft and called my wife saw who saw the light as well. i ran to the other side of the house to get a better view of the craft as it traveled towards liberty lake where again i watched it travel a short distance and then disappear.  \r\n\r\ni continued to stay outside and watch the

lights.   one was quite close to my house and literally became a bright light out of nowhere and then traveled a short distance and faded out again with no navigation lights or sound at all.  \r\n\r\ni have seen this pattern before in the night sky around spokane.  but nothing so close that i could truly be identified as a unidentified flying object.   i have seen a craft up close before (30-35 yards away) in 1977 which made me a believer in ufo's.  at that time, i didn't know there was a formal way to make a statement about the incident so it went un-reported.  i am however, a true believer and have done a lot of research and i am an avid listener of coast-to-coast, which is probably the best and most informative (only) real media that addresses ufo's at all. it would be great
