reasonable explanation for what we saw so we classified this event as a ufo sighting.  \r\n\r\ni walked outside to get my backpack from my car while my friend was out letting her dogs goto the bathroom.  i stood outside her finishing my cigarette, when i was staring at the stars (it was a pretty clear night).\r\n\r\ni watched a plane fly over head towards the portland airport, port and starboard lights blinking, flying at a lower altitude, preparing to land at pdx... nothing abnormal there... then after that plane passed over head, a minute later i notice a really bright star travelling at quite a fast speed, and maybe a few hundred feet behind it another one followed.  at this point i called to her and said \"hey, what do you think that is?\" (she is a plane buff)\r\n\r\nat first i thought maybe they were satellites or something, but my friend said that she knows what sats. look like as she used to sit out as a kid with her father and watch the satellites over heard.  she said satellites are much more dimmer than what we saw.  it was the brightest thing in the sky.\r\n\r\nshe ran into the house to grab her binoculars, and i continued to watch these lights as they quickly traveled across the sky.  as i watched, the first light started dimming, dimmed to the point where it just disappeared.  when she came out, she handed me the binoculars and before i could track it, she said the other light did the same thing.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound at all, and no other lights (no red or green lights), no blinking lights either.  it was hard to gauge how high it was but she said it appeared to be pretty high up (around 30,000 feet).\r\n\r\nthe next day after thinking about it, she rationalized that it was a military plane and the reason for the dimming light was the fov as it was passing us.  it kind of made sense to me, but why at that altitude would both aircraft (traveling at the same speed) have those very bright lights and no port/starboard lights?)\r\n\r\nwe talked it over for about 20 minutes on all the different possibilities, but nothing really seemed to be rational.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

approximately between 2000 and 2100 hours. hale bopp had been visible in the sky for several nights by this time, however, this night was different. on our way to meet friends, we kept noticing orange lights glowing in the sky in a vertical line. these lights would glow briefly, then go out, then glow again at different intervals with no dicernable pattern. (we later heard that these were alleged \"flares\" that the \"military were practicing\" in the sky.) so we arrived at our destination and upon exiting our vehicle, something above us caught my eye. i looked up and saw this huge craft, triangular in shape with small orangish-red lights on the under side, (which also appeared to have the pattern similar to that of a computer chip or motherboard) moving very, very slowly through the sky, appearing to be just above the treetops directly above where we were standing. it literally flew over my son and i in an eastward direction. i didn't know what to think of it at first. i just stood there frozen and stared with my chin hitting the ground. my son saw it also, however he was more interested in getting inside to have pizza, as i continued to stand outside in the parking lot until it flew out of sight. what struck me as being so eerie was the fact that it was moving so slowly, right above me and that there was absolutely no sound or vibrations coming from the craft. one of my friends had actually come outside the door of the establishment to see what was taking me so long. she stood by the door at the railing yelling to me and then when i could no longer see this object, i walked up and told her what i had seen. we proceeded to go inside, eat pizza with friends and sing some kareoke songs, not bringing the issue up again at that time. upon leaving and later returning home, i told my spouse at the time about my experience. of course he thought i was crazy and i never really spoke much about it again. i have attempted to contact persons about this experience one other time, but never followed through with it until now. only because i saw your program on television, and thought maybe someone would take me seriously. i know what i saw and would stand by it no matter what; even if it resorted to taking a polygraph test.","distance":"101-500

with any one else.��� please forgive me if i ramble.��� \r\n\r\ni was sixteen years old.��� i had been up talking to a friend of mine on the phone and decided to go to bed.��� my mother and step-father and younger sister were already in bed asleep.��� we lived in a modest size single level rancher in tennessee. i went to sleep and was woken up at 12:34 (yes, i remember the exact time) by a painfully bright light outside of my window.��� i remember thinking to myself, \"oh great, drew (a boyfriend of mine at the time) has wrecked his stupid car in the yard...I'm gonna get in so much trouble\"...So i got up out of bed to go see what was going on.��� i pulled my hair back because it was just a mess and quietly opened my bedroom door.��� it was an old house and the floorboards creaked, doors popped, etc...So i had to be particularly cautious getting outside.��� i put my hand over the keys in the lock so they wouldn't make any noise when i turned them, and stepped out onto the back porch.��� the light was so bright it looked like daylight outside but i knew it wasn't.��� i opened the back door on the porch and started to step out onto the steps....But instead....I started rising up...Very quickly...I was shocked...At first i couldn't understand what was going on...I looked down and could see my house and street getting smaller...I could feel the wind around me but (even though it was february) i wasn't cold. i also realized that for whatever reason, i was not scared. i saw my high school....Everything.....Then i realized i was over a nearby park....And looked up.��� there was an array of three lights tightly together, almost like stars, that i began ascending toward.��� the lights \"opened\" into a triangular shape and i seemed to pass through that interior space.\r\n\r\ni was in a room of sorts...It was a huge room.��� it was filled with people.��� humans. i could see....Hundreds of them it seemed.��� they weren't afraid either.��� we all stood in lines and there were other people that seemed to be asking each one of the humans a question.��� just one question.��� i could hear voices responding....I knew my turn would be soon and i knew no one knew where i was.��� i saw, what i thought was a telephone laying on a shelf and stepped out of line and went to call my friend chris to tell him what was happening because i knew he would call my mom, and my other friends right away.��� a small woman, older looking than anyone i have ever seen before, came over to me and gently put her hand over mine and said i should \"put that down\" because \"it wasn't what i thought it was\".��� she was kind and gentle and led me back to my line. it was my turn at that moment.��� they asked me my question...I remember responding...Then suddenly i felt like i was being sucked back down fast.....And was back in my room.��� where i fell on my bed and went into a very deep sleep.��� i never said a word about what happened to anyone....I knew that they would say i was crazy or something.��� so i kept it to myself.\r\n\r\ni have tried for 25 years to remember what my question was, what my answer was....And i can't ever seem to recall.��� i wouldn't even be writing now, if more had not happened to me in more recent history.\r\n\r\nwhen my daughter was 7 (i was 29) my second husband and i had a small apartment in an extremely rural area of tennessee that where he and i and my two children lived.��� it was attached to his sister's main house and was over a work shop.��� i was woken up, at 12:34 am...Yes, i looked...And that is exactly the time it was...Again, by a tremendous bright light shining in my second story apartment window.��� i tried to wake up my husband but i could not get him to rouse.��� i heard the door to our apartment open...I heard footsteps coming up to our living area from the workshop....I got up to see what was happening....As i came out of my bedroom, i heard the footsteps reach the top.��� i should have been looking at someone/thing...But there was nothing.��� there were two or three large skylights in the apartment and i could clearly see the entire room. after a second or two of silence...I heard the steps go right in front of me, pass me and head toward my daughter's room.��� my eyes kept straining to see what they should be seeing...But i never \"saw\" anyone.��� i saw her door open...I ran...Fast....Through her door and into her room and said out loud...\"you stay away from my daughter!\".��� the light blinked out instantly.��� i was left standing there shaking and still seeing \"blue spots\" from the light.��� for the record...My daughter was not home that night...She had decided to spend the night with a friend of hers.��� her room was empty.������ the next morning, i went down to my sister-in-law's house for coffee...And casually asked her if her son had gotten home late that evening.��� she said no, he had been home all night.��� she asked me why, so i mentioned that i thought maybe someone had headlights or something and was trying to play a joke on me...And told her about hearing the footsteps.....She laughed...Then said, \"oh! you saw the angels too!\".��� i was numb.��� i asked her what she meant....And she told me that she had a visit from something she decided was an \"angel\" that night around midnight....And that she has had those visits before.��� i excused myself from the conversation....I was feeling more than faint.��� it was the first time i had ever had anyone else verify an experience for me....It left me quite shaken.\r\n\r\nmany years have passed.��� i am now 41. ��� i no longer live in tennessee.��� i live in maryland.��� i have only told two other people about this...My mother...And my husband.��� i have never breathed a word of it to my children or anyone else.��� \r\n\r\na couple of months ago, my youngest child, who is 6, got up one morning and asked me what the bright light outside of his window was during the night.������ he said it was so bright it woke him up.��� my husband and i are exceptionally anxious...This time i didn't wake up....I really don't know what else to do.��� we deadbolt our doors and make sure our home is as secure as possible.��� but, i am not convinced there is really anything i can do to protect him. ��� i don't even know for sure there is anything to protect him from...��� i have a couple of loose theories but nothing that really adds up...I just really feel...Alone.��� my experiences don't seem to be like others.\r\n\r\ni have read so many of these commercialized experiences of being abducted, etc.��� i do know several things for facts...1) i was not dreaming..Nor was i suffering from \"sleep paralysis\" at any point.��� 2)��� this has apparently been going on for some time now....3) i am not crazy��� 4) no \"experiments\" have been done on me that i am aware of, 5) i have no \"traumatic\" memory of anything bad happening to me whatsoever, 6) there were no little gray people with big black eyes (although the woman that told me to put the item down was shorter than me and seemed extremely old...), and 7) i was not the only human being on that ....Ship?��� i know other people have had this experience...I saw them having it....\r\n\r\ni am just scared now...And i don't even know of what.��� i am sure you must get a million messages like this a day.��� i thank you for your time and if you do not have any answers, i understand.��� i don't have any either.��� i just desperately needed to tell someone about this... just...In case.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

unable to determine without knowing distance. much slower than a passing satellite.\r\n\r\nduration of sighting: ten minutes. during that time the object slowly dimmed out and became barely visible to the unaided eye. about a minute later it came on bright again and continued so for several more minutes as it continued to move very slowly to the south.\r\n\r\ndistance covered: about 15 degrees of a 360 degree circle.\r\n\r\nwitnesses at my location: five including me.\r\n\r\nwitnesses at other locations: none. i called a friend in san mateo which is 30 miles to the north, and another person 60 miles to the south during the event. neither person could see the red light. the person 60 miles to the south could easily see jupiter which i used as a nearby reference point (almost the same elevation although jupiter was about 45 degrees to the south of the red light).\r\n\r\ntools used: 10-40x60mm binoculars without a tripod. no camera or video.\r\n\r\nwhat i ruled out. mars or any planet. just too bright. aircraft didn't seem likely to me either. i've seen both day and night missile tests before and know how they appear, and this didn't look like a missile on re-entry. when satellites move across the sky their movement is apparent. the red light was barely moving when compared to background stars as seen through binoculars.\r\n\r\npossibility: space station and shuttle activity related. the shuttle is currently docked to the station, and according to the sightings page for my area they had just passed that area of the night sky ten minutes prior. however, i have seen the space station pass on numerous past occasions and it's orbit is much much faster than the red light i observed. the proximity and timing are close and i think it's likely related. maybe something was either accidently or intentionally dropped from the space station that burned up on entry with the atmosphere.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19209,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.3468757,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09102009-0003","longitude":-121.8900255,"occurred":1252306800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1252578090000,"summary":"Red

am,\r\ni observed what i thought was simply one among many stars, suddenly begin to move. it moved slowly for about ten seconds, before taking a 45 degree turn and disappearing behind the treetops.\r\n \r\non that same night - again at a great height - what appeared as a \"cluster\" of dim lights that were not as  clear or as bright as the stars were, began moving very slowly. the

off. the sighting itself kept appearing and disappearing, as if it were turning it's own lights on and of, and it finally dawned upon me that it may have been responding to my signals.\r\n \r\nwhen this thought enterred my head, what impressed me was it's extreme \"clarity.\" the thought did not seem to come from me, but instead, seemed to have been placed there. \r\n\r\ni don't recall exactly

with a green light moving around the red lights . the second set of lights with the green light i recognised as an aircraft but it appeared to be cicleing the other lights that did not appear to move.\r\ni called my son out telling him to tell me what he could see and he said he could see the 3 lights togethher as part of 1 thing but what was the plane doing there? the plane begane to move away and head back acroos to france as the plane took about 90 seconds to move to just above our postion the other lights disapered and reappeard in front of the plane and to the north travelling a distance of at least 10 miles in 1 second.\r\nstayed for about 10 to 15 seconds and dissapeard.\r\ni know this might sound stupid but the thing that me and my son found strange was the fact that our airport closes at 9.Pm unless for a seriouse medical emergency and we know the area we notice the lights in was french airforce air space. the plane was also flying over channel island airspace, but directly over the island and about 5 to 10,000 ft this does not happen ....Ever. \r\ni have decided to tell you this as my son has posted that we had seen something on facebook and one of his friends commented that people reported seeing strange lights in august in guernsey. some have reported chinnese lanterns but they were to far away and sorry but dont move at that speed.","distance":"Over One

overhead. it stayed on the same path which would be sw to ne. the thing that caught my eye was there were no strobe lights or red and green nav lights,  only bright white lights at the front and back. it was maybe at 1000 ft. and made absolutely no noise. as it moved the tailing light would move to the right 20 degrees back to center for awhile and move 20 degrees to the left. it left my sight at a high rate of speed as it moved up and over the hill to my northeast. when it was overhead it made me a little apprehensive and the dog acted a little strange wanting to head towards the house up the

pm, at about 24 degrees altitude started from the nnw and faded out almost due north.  what was unusual about it was that i could see that there was a cloud or exhaust trail that appeared to be hooked shaped and changing shape.  the plume must have been many hundreds of yards long because the shuttle was a tiny dot and this plume was about 4 degrees wide.  it was beautiful.  i imagine the plume was the result of a burn to change orbit, because the cloud was only visible for about 85% of the sighting and changed shape.  the trail looked almost like a comet tail.  \r\n\r\nthe iss passed by about one minute later with no plume.  i decided to report this because of all the 'two moving stars that followed each other' sightings reported yesterday across the country, which was in all liklihood, the space shuttle followed by the iss.  check out this website for current sighting info on the space station and shuttle.  \r\n\r\nhttp://spaceflight1.Nasa.Gov/realdata/sightings\r\n  \r\nthe shuttle and the iss appear as rather bright stars, brighter than jupiter,  and if the angle is high enough, the sighting can last several minutes. the objects will appear to travel straight or with a slight arc, moving a bit faster than a passenger jet, but will not have abrupt zig zag movements. this sighting ranks up there with real ufo sightings i have seen due to the beauty and unexpectedness.  fastest cloud i ever saw, over 17,000 mph following the tail end of the shuttle.  keep your eyes to the
