decided to stand outside for a few minutes. the sky was mainly clear with some clouds low in the eastern sky, but the stars were easily observed. having a background in artillery survey and land navigation in the military, its normal for me to look for survey/navigational stars and constellations in the sky. as i looked up at the big dipper(ursa major) i noticed two star like objects traveling about three finger widths apart at arms distance moving from west to east on a steady course and maintaining a constant interval passing just below the north star(polaris). the two objects were of about the same brightness(magnitude) as the pointer stars in the big dipper. they did not blink or sway as they moved through the sky. i called out to my girlfriend who was working on her computer in the living room to come as a witness and to get her perspective. we observed as they continued on a steady course until they faded away. they did not go beyond the horizon, but looked as though they were climbing out of the atmosphere. i noted the time and date on my wrist watch as 9:18pm 09-08-2009. the observation lasted approximatly two minutes from beginning to

be a saucer like craft heading east - southeast. stopping and hovering approximately 3 to 4 miles from my location, 2 beams of light radiating from what then became a star-like object (because of distance) with rotating colors of red, blue, yellow, green and brilliant white. object was moving eradically in all directions but, staying in close proximaty to (ocala national forest) bombing range. hound dogs in the neighborhood started whining and howling and barking, while my dogs ran about in all directions and whined alot. the horses in the field next door were acting strangely also. there were no sounds of insects or birds except, that of an owl hooting.\r\nmy reactions are as they always are and have been for many years, saying to myself, it's about time. it seems that throughout my life they come every 3 years. i'm an old veteran at this. since i was 3-years-old, up to now and i'm sure years to come. i have worked with m.U.F.O.N. before and have been requested to go on investigations of other reports in my area because, i am tuned in to whatever they are. i have in the past worked with alien abductees, was for awhile a crop-circle interpretor and have come in contact with the men-in-black. i was an advisor on ufo landing sites in various areas across the nation and have given lectures on the subject.\r\ni lost sight of the object by coming back inside to report the info to you. i thought since it had been 3 years since my last sighting that you would be most interested hearing from me again.\r\n\r\nnote: haunted woods, a place where a lot of very strange activities happen. two unpaved roads run through it from east to west and drivers have reported to the local sherrifs department, sightings during day light and after dark of phantoms, ghost, aliens, strange crafts flying at tree top levels, creatures, cryptids, brilliant orbs floating along sides of road and sometimes seen crossing, voices, screams, sounds of running and people going missing. this is where my last encounter was. i was traveling west with some friends, a saucer craft followed along the north side of the car a little over a hundred feet away, when i stopped it stopped, when i proceded it proceded, when i went faster it went faster. but, when i reached the edge of the woods, it vanished. all in the car witnessed the sighting.\r\nlocal sherrifs department

look up at the sky (as i do seemingly do wndlessly nowadays) and spot a bright white orb coming from the south. this is no surprise to me, for i have seen them often, yet i still become excited. it's coming from the far south, traveling at a steady speed to the north. as it gets closer, i watch it wobble a bit. i decided to sit down on the path and watch it hover over my head, but soon realize that it it slowing down. it's traveling at such a slow speed, that it's difficult to detect any movement at all. it then speeds up again, travels about an inch (from my perspective), stops again, repeats, then moves about an inch to the left. this is when it suddenly hit me. i thought, \"wait a minute, where is jupider?\" i had seen jupider every night-gazing at it's bright presence. this is where it is extremely difficult to explain. i realized that the entire time that i was watching this orb move from the south, that it was the only light in the sky. when it stopped, it stopped exactly where jupider has been every night. there was no jupider present at the time of the sighting. as far as my mind in concerned, the orb stopped right where jupider should have been. i can look out of my window right now and see jupider in it's normal spot. my head was tinkered with at that moment what happened. this isn't my typical orb sighting. i still feel extremely confused right now! ;) part of my brain is saying that jupider, at this time, is indeed itself. the other half is saying that it's still the orb that stopped there 30 minutes ago. i have been getting frequent \"brain buzzes\" ever
