sorry if this is not the right way to provide this information. however, today i saw on history channel a documentary about the 1996 varginha-mg brazil ufo \"incident\" and i would like to pass this information to you.\r\ni believe that we are not alone in the universe but, i select and judge everything i see based on source and facts. among some ufo events, the \"varginha ufo\" event is the one that i consider a real/trustfull case.\r\nin 1996 when it occurred, i tried to find out, to read and to watch as much news about the event as possible. \r\none thing that i saw and i never more heard and/or saw something about is the testimony of a old lady that seems to me to have more than 60 years old.\r\ni watched the testimony of that lady on a rede globo de televisao´s jornal nacional (globo network tv - national tv news).\r\naccording to her, she listened a noise in an empty ground beside her house. then, when she opened the door to the street, she saw a \"creature\" with big head and large eyes crouching leaning against her house wall with its \"arms and hands protecting her face/head.\r\nthis was shown only one time on tv and i never more saw anything about that lady and her testimony. you can try to find out on globo tv and or talking to people in varginha.\r\nin addition, i listened testimony of some doctors from campinas-sp brazil that were brought to varginha-mg brazil to evaluate the creatures that were found at that time. however, they stayed hours in room without to talk to anybody until a brazilian arm solder comes and sends them back home without any explanation.\r\ni hope this help.\r\nbest regards,\r\n \r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving on a very clear day, without a single cloud in the sky. at an intersection, i noticed a silver object in the sky, which i presumed to be a very low flying 747 which struck me to be odd as i was 60 to 70 plus miles away from ohare and midway airports. looking at it closer i noticed it was not moving. i took off my sunglasses to see if i could see it better, but as soon as i did that it disappeared. putting them back on, you could easily see it again. i figured this was related to the polarized lens....Veru weird though. i immediately changed my direction to head north towards it. driving very fast, i was only about 2 miles from the object that was only about 3,000 feet in the air. i had never seen anything like this in my life. as i got closer the object began to move. at this time, i immediately felt light headed and a headache ensued (which i rarely get...Related idk). at the same moment hundreds of birds began to flock away from the object.  it changed its direction a few times and began to head north. i hopped on i-57 towards chicago and drove very fast so i would not lose sight of it. as i did this the craft picked up incredible speeds towards increased altitude dramatocally. if i had to guess, roughly 15 times faster than a typical 747, but this is likely an underestimate. i was dumbfounded concluding the only explanation is new military technology or extraterrestrial. unfortuantely, the object moved so fast that it disappeared in the distance in less than 30 seconds. i decided i would turn around at the next exit at this point as it was long gone. i slowed down a bit because i noticed an unmarked all black police car flashing white, yellow, red, and blue lights pulled off on the side of the interstate. i could not identify the model, as it was a car i had never seen before and i know my cars very well. i would say the closest car would be a chrysler 300 with a sleek body kit, maybe it's the 2018 version. who knows. as i approached it i noticed it had us government plates with no other vehicles pulled over next to it and i could not see into the windows as i passed, they were tinted which striked me as odd. i thought it might be related to the presence of the craft so i kept driving past the next exit. i continued on the expressway for another 10 to 12 miles to see if anything odd would appear. as i began to merge into the right lane to get off the expressway i saw it again...Maybe 10 to 15 miles west of me hovering above a radio tower. at this point i tried to snap a photo, but figured it would not work as i could not see the object without my polarized lens. i got off the freeway and headed west towards the object which was likely above frankfort, il.  at this point i noticed a prop plane heading towards it from the east and two dark planes flying in formation from the north. at this point i was about 5 miles away from it, but as the jets approached the craft it accelerated south at a very high speeds. the best part was the fact you could see it breaking the sound barrier within a matter of a few seconds. it picked up speeds so fast and headed into the skies where i lost sight of it within 10 seconds. i pulled off the road to turn around and see what types of planes where approaching. they were two fighter jets, maybe the f35 but i couldn't say definitely. they had no chance of keeping up with the object though. i hopped back on the freeway and on my way back home i noticed a strong presence of police cars. i saw 15-20 in the 20 minute drive home. as i approached my town i noticed more police lights, a fire truck, and ambulence which was weird because it was right where i began to have a headache. there was a car in the ditch on one side of the road and two cars that collided at the intersection. maybe it was just all a coincidence though, but it was very odd coincidence as i live in a farming town. i reviewed the photos i took and i managed to capture the object on one of them, which i will upload. i watched the six oclock news to see if anyone else reported it, but no news at all regarding craft, military testing, fighter jets, etc. hoping someone will see this post and possibly confirm some of these events. lastly, i have been keeping an eye out for an odd activity over the last few days. i noticed a strange, constant light that traveled much faster than the any of the other planes that fly over my house the night after. additionally, i worked outside the day after and today on the landscaping. i kept hearing roaring jet engines over the house. this occured 6 or 7 times since i saw the object on june 7th. unfortunately it has been cloudy here since then, but i can only confirm that i saw a fighter jet on two of these occasions during the day. i've lived hear since 2004 and have only seen a fighter jet once so all of this is very odd. hope someone else can provide an explanation. thanks. note: the attached photo is the original unedited photo. it has the object on the right side, if you zoom on you can see the radio tower in the distance 10 to 15 miles away or so. it is directly above the radio tower.

was cool outside and humidity was very low, being a clear night i decided to go out. i sat down facing north in a small screend in porch. i noticed a ref light pulsating in the distance. it was thru some open tree branches but slightly to the left of them in clear view. it looked similar to some lights i had seen before sitting on my moms front porch in henderson ky. which is across the ohio river from where i live and was located. there i was also facing north. because i never got a very good look at what i had seen in henderson i decided to step out of the small porch to see if i could get a better look. at first i thought maybe an airplane because of the light some what blinking. but unlike an airplane light which blinks one color then another this was just a ref light i could see and it never went off. it just got bright then dim. it moved very slow almost directly towards me. i kept waiting to hear a sound so i could see if it was an airplane or a helicopter. but as it started to get closer it started to slightly turn. as if it was making a very wide turn heading west. but once it was almost out of view it corrected itself and started heading south again. for a moment i could not see it and waited maybe two mins. i then stood on the stairs of the porch going to the yard and turned toward my house holding on to the railing and leaning back to see if i could look over the roof of the porch that's when i seen it floating slowly over head. it was a triangle with rounded ends and it had three white lights that were round but seemed bigger then they were because they too were pulsating. the red ligjt was slightly  towards the back from the middle. not dead center. it was so odd how quiet it was. it also moved slower then a glider. it seemed to be less then a hundred feet above my house. but being night tilme and not knowing for sure how big the object was its hard to say how close it was. i'm someone who's always believed in the possibility of extraterrestrial life but have always said most ufos look fake or they are just mistaken. i expected to see a military craft o some kind. it's not unusual to see or hear them above where i live. there's an air force base few hours away by car. i know they do touch and gos around here. so when i seen the object above my house and realized there was no sound at all and the shape and lights i just felt caught off guard. so to believers and non believers alike triangles that fly slower then planes need to get lift with lights unlike any i've ever seen on airplanes commercial or  military exsict.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

was west (the opposite direction), but for some reason, i felt very compelled to turn around and look up. what i saw was very alarming, it was very bright in relation to distant stars in the sky and the lights on the ground. i thought it was a supernova or some kind of really bright star, but within seconds i knew otherwise. at first it was the shape of an orb, constantly morphing (not a perfect circle). i took out my samsung and started taking pictures of it, because it was so bright and mesmerizing. within a minute, it changed shape rapidly: going from a ball into a short wide line, and than from that into a long thin line, eventually returning to a ball/orb. i stopped taking pictures and began walking home because i felt weird standing there taking pictures of the sky for longer

was contacted by aliens.  at least that is what i believe.  i know most people won’t believe me, so i don’t tell them.  i’ll never be sure what is and that bothers me greatly.  i know i’ll never have an answer i trust.  i will continue, in my paranoia, to try and understand.\r\ni was in iraq in late 2004 on lsa anaconda.  this was shortly before a lunar eclipse that turned the moon red.  i was awoken in the middle of the night by a huge thunderstorm and had to use the restroom.  i pulled on my body armor and put on my kevlar helmet and headed outside to the porta-potty.\r\ni can remember that the storm was huge, but was still to the south.  there was a heavy static in the air and there was absolutely no wind.  it was an open space between our building and the porta-potty.  tall trees were about 100 yards to the west.  there was another short building nearby and a small shower facility we had built.  if i remember right, there was a pole and a light over the porta-potties.\r\n\r\nthe last thing i remember before losing some time was a huge flash and a boom.\r\nthen i woke up on the ground.  i don’t know how long i was there.  it could have been a second it could have been an hour or more.  i soiled my uniform.  my first thought, of all things, was that i hoped no one had seen.  i struggle to remember if i went back to my room first to change or if i went back to the showers to clean up.  i threw my uniform away.\r\nthe hot water in the shower hurt on the sides of my head.  afterwards, in the mirror, i noticed that i had two burns on each side by my ears and underneath my chin.  right where all the metal parts on the old helmet straps are.  to this day, i still grow much less hair at this spots in my sideburns and not at all where the burn under my chin was.\r\nthe next day i checked to see if there were any mortar attacks that night.  there were not.  i immediately drew the conclusion that i was struck by lightning.  i was an ambitious second lieutenant and was afraid that if i told anyone i would be sent back home for some sort of testing.  i didn’t want to leave iraq.  i had worked so hard to train for this part of my life.\r\nmy burns healed, my uniform was gone and i told no one.  aside from a small stain amongst a sea of them on my body armor, there was no evidence that anything had ever happened to me.\r\nif this was a lightning strike, then it wasn’t the first time.  according to the national lightning safety institute the odds of being struck by lightning (in the us, where their data is from), is 1 to 280,000… and i’ve been hit twice.  the first strike hit a power pole next to a window i was sitting just inside of.  it left a burn on my hand that was next to the window frame and on my foot that was on the floor. my guess is the foot was some sort of exit-wound.  my father witnessed this incident.\r\nthe way i see it is that there are four distinct possibilities for my incident in iraq:  i was struck by lightning; there was an undocumented mortar; nothing happened at all and it was some sort of vivid hallucination; or it was some sort of alien encounter.  we can eliminate the mortar because of all the state-of-the-art equipment that would have detected it and we were so far in the center of the installation.  we can also eliminate nothing happening because i couldn’t hallucinate the small burns.\r\nof the two remaining items i completely understand that lightning makes the most sense.  even though my disease of schizoaffective disorder was non-existent or very young and minor at the time, it could have been a source for my delusional and irrational beliefs.  there is some evidence that points away from lightning though.  if i was hit hard enough to super-heat the metal on my helmet enough to burn me and to knock me, maybe only for a moment, unconscious then shouldn’t it have hurt me worse?  shouldn’t there have been an exit-wound like my comparably minor strike many years before?  shouldn’t the storm have been overhead and not off to the south?\r\ni’m left with the remaining item that it was some sort of alien incident.  i have no vague memories, no dreams about it.  i only have a feeling, no, a firmly held belief.  i have no idea if i was taken or not.  there is no big reveal here, i didn’t see little grey men or any sort of craft.  but i do believe that something in me changed that night.  this may have been the moment that my schizophrenic symptoms began.  the dragon, my schizophrenic entity, hadn’t shown up yet.  i was only an eccentric.\r\nand this uncertainty is what really frustrates me.  i can remember before schizophrenia had a grip on me.  i can remember when my thoughts were organized and i could trust them.  i can remember before i invented entire memories.  i can never know anything for certain anymore.  i feel like this is what is really cruel about a late-onset condition like mine.  i can remember how i used to be, back when i had a vivid imagination but an understanding of what is and is not true.\r\ncould an alien encounter made me schizophrenic?\r\ni don’t know if i had an alien encounter.  but i believe that i did.\r\ni would greatly welcome the opportunity to discuss with an expert if there have been similar encounters - if there are cases of 'madness' developing after an event?
