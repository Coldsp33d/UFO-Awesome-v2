like two moving stars. i thought i was seeing things, as it appeared to be like two stars from a constellation just moved. so i squinted my eyes and realized i was not seeing things, but that there were two star like objects flying in perfect unison. they were extemely bright and whitish in color. there was no blinking, just the constant bright white. there was no sound. they flew slower than planes do. one was in front of the other, but this is the strange thing. they kept the same distance between them the etire time. it was too perfect. they flew from my right crossing over my house and my neighbors to my left. i then ran in front to continue watching until they disappeared over some trees that then blocked my sight. the entire time i was in awe at what i was seeing. i was describing it all to my dad who i was on the phone with. i have never in my life seen anything like this and am pretty perplexed. after visiting this site i have seen that other people are decribing the same

county area. this is the first sightings we have ever seen in our life, and it has been a wild summer watching the night sky. all of these objects seen have been seen low to the ground around 1000 feet up or so.\r\n\r\n1. three weeks ago over brighton we saw four large orange glowing lights in the sky, they were scanning the ground and moving slowly towards the south east, and a few went north. they were about the size of a full moon.\r\n\r\n2. twice in the past two weeks we have seen odd/fake looking meteorites hitting the ground to the north/east of us. they come down slow, are a brilliant white firey disc. i know these are not meteorites becuase the speed they are traveling and they are fully ignited and do not burn out, and they are much larger. \r\n\r\n3. tonight while walking our dog outside, we saw what looked like two planes comming our way. both were lit up white like a star, once they passed over (slowly) we relized thses two objects were way to close to be planes (they would have hit each other) and they were moving in a fixated form, and the wildest thing is that they looked like big stars in the sky moving together. one in front one in back about 300 feet. the catch here is that this was one object because as it passed over it covered up the stars behind it. once it passed us the first light went out follwed by the second. we thought a cloud had covered it up, but relized that the stars were still visible. \r\n\r\nall we can say is there are alot of objects in the night sky, that are fake looking, or shall i say do not fit the description of aircraft,helicopters,typical meterites, are all silent,slow mowing,scanning like,and why is this happening over brighton/howell area?","distance":"Over One

didn't twinkle like a star, but it varied in brightness, not much at first but after about 10 minutes it faded and flickered as it faded. after about 15min, it had all but disappeared, then it started getting brighter over about 2 minutes, maybe only reaching 1/2 of the original brightness. after a few more minutes it faded away and never came back. i didn't stay outside waiting for it to return,

happened. i am reporting it here for others to see as well but i am the author of this description. there are independent reports on the ufowisconsin website from others in my area from this same night as well, to corroborate my story.] i went to pick up my son from boy scouts tonight, march 19, 2009. i was a few minutes late and saw the place was locked up, so i waited, my van and field of vision directly to the west. i noticed a very bright orange-ish colored light off in the distance. i thought it was mars but it was a strange sight because it was so very bright. i was watching this light when my son came from a playground area nearby, where there were others (parents and kids) waiting outside and watching the skies. the scoutmaster came to the side of my van and we were talking, but i was watching this light. apparently the others on the playground were watching it too but i didn't know this until later. my son saw the single light too. the scoutmaster and my son were not aware of what i saw. suddenly, i realized the light was no longer there. i thought maybe the star or planet had moved due to the earth's rotation, gone behind some trees. i wasn't really thinking anything more about it, other than i moved my head to see if i could make it out anymore. just as i was losing interest in where the light had gone, all of a sudden i was aware that there was a large craft with very bright orangish yellow headlights coming towards us, probably about 1/4 mile away, possibly over the middle school building in town. i'd estimate it was 35 to 50 feet in diameter but that's a guess. it seemed large and close. it hadn't been there before and it took a moment to register what i was seeing. i had a clear shot of this craft, with a bank of 3 or 4 of the same-colored orange lights in a semi-circle out in front [parallel to the ground]. it seemed rounded in front and moving fast, coming directly towards us from the west, going due east. then the lights blinked out [dimmed] quickly, the outside ones, then the middle one. there was no sound. i had my window open as i talked with the scoutmaster. i could see or hear nothing after the lights blinked out, even though it was obviously above the city and should have been overhead at the speed it appeared to be going. i didn't say anything to the scoutmaster as i was unsure what i had just seen. i kept expecting to see the strobe lights of a plane or hear something but there was just sky where the object should have been.\r\n\r\nmoments after the craft disappeared, i drove around with my son, trying to describe what i saw and trying to find what happened to it. it was like it hadn't happened, but i know it did. i would estimate the object was about 1,000 feet above the ground before it disappeared. it was just past sunset, skies were clear and star-filled, air temperature 29, no smoke or other apparent obstructions. there were trees and houses in the vicinity where i saw this but they did not block my view. time i saw the object was 8:09 p.M. according to my clock. i had not been drinking or fatigued. i saw many stars and a couple satellites tonight, some planes and even a helicopter. this was nothing like any of those.\r\n\r\nit was just very strange that the light in the distance could move so fast and then suddenly to appear so close with those lights, then the lights blinked out in sequence and it disappeared.\r\n\r\nthis was an airborne object in our lower atmosphere, a bright single light off in the west, then a bank of bright lights, propelled forward and then the lights blinked out almost simultaneously (but not quite) and it disappeared.\r\n\r\ni reported this to the fond du lac county dispatch and also to the waupun pd. they did not have any other reports about this, or so they told me. i am wondering if anyone else saw this and what it might have been. my son said the other boys and parents were watching something exactly where i was watching and making jokes about it. he thought it was odd what they were saying but he didn't tell me this until after we were driving away and realized what i was telling him i saw. i'd just like to know what it was and see if my story matches anyone else's. thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

verify it wasn't a satellite.  this may be the same type as the one reported over pittsburgh mills mall on september 5th.  it did appear transparent at times.\r\n\r\ni was on phone while filming with a pilot (infinitysends on youtube) from atlanta (who is originally from this area) who's volunteered to try and catch one closer in the sky with me on the ground as spotter.  jimmy wenger in new kensington is also on the phone watch list, as well as energeeeresearch from north irwin.\r\n\r\nthe night before, pilot missed an orb rising from the edge of oakmont's country club's golf course woods that line the riverside edge of course( he was over murrysville at that time).  it rose slowly straight up, transformed into two white lights with blinking red one in middle--trying to mimic a plane.  it then suddenly disappeared or turned off all its lights while on film (not uploaded yet).\r\n\r\non this night, however, he chased something that showed on radar that was not visible to the naked eye until it stopped showing on radar.  he also had his plane's computer reset while he was flying--something it never did before.  i was glad that was all as i had warned him not to go within 500 feet--because after an orange orb was 500 feet away, the next morning i found my car stereo's station presets wiped out--like the battery was disconnected.  he saw other orange lights on the ground around pittsburgh area but couldn't confirm anything since they were too far away.\r\n\r\nhe also saw a strange looking 'something' that flew overhead of him with pulsing red lights that was silent.  i believe it was the same one that flew up river (and captured on my video) at 8:54 pm.  this is also included in my video:\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=tbuytwbut1s","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19136,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4422348,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09082009-0009","longitude":-79.9901164,"occurred":1252294140000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

dr.) as we backed out of the driveway my husband asked who could be walking at that time of the morning. i just glanced and said it must be some middle eastern or arabic woman that can't walk around in the day time.This (thing) was compeletly shrouded in full length black garments from head to toe. he remarked on the height and the fact that the light from the street light in the background could be seen between this being and the ground. there was total space between it and the road. it was not touching the ground? it wasn't flying per-sa it just didn't touch the ground!! it was coming toward us at a slow deliberate pace.\r\nwe made a decision not to stick around until it got close to the car and sped off. we also decided not to call the police because they wouldn't have believed us. i called the police from the airport and they said maybe it was darth vaderand the ignorant redneck laughed at us. they also laughed at our neighbors later.\r\nwhen we returned from our business trip six weeks later my husband was on the driveway when a neighbor stopped to talk to him and warn him about a peeping tom. apparently their son was up watching tv very late one night and noticed a movement on the outside of the window in the den. as he looked up he said he saw an enormous hand. he discribed it as being a huge human hand. he also said he couldn't see a face but a large black hooded figure. our next door neighbor ray got a ladder and was climing on his porch roof to see how someone could get up there! he confided in my husband that he thought he was seeing things when he looked up in the middle of the night and saw someone watching him. that is when my husband told him he saw someone on his porch roof and ours as well. instead of telling me and scaring me he kept this to himself.He didn't sleep well and kept the blinds open in the room ne insisted on staying in alone.\r\nwhen my husband called me outside to listen to this story i became realy frightened because on several occassions i woke up with the sensation that something? was watching me through the open blinds on the second floor bedroom. also at night and very early in the morning when i was waiting for a towncarto pick me upi had an erie sensation of being watched closely in the dark. i left before daylight a lot. there is more to the story , i saw a show on sightings and they showed a large humanoid figure in the sky over brazil or argentina same being same dress with several smaller ones flying into it's (cape?) i had surpressed this memory after my husbands sudden death.When i saw this show on the history channel or travel? i was in shock for two days and couldn't think of anything else. it all came back. he passed in oct.05
