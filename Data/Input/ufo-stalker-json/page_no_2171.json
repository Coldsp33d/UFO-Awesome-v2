username, as admin of the site, is pantherfan007):\r\n\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nselect this post for moderation posted 16 july 2008 - 12:19 pm \r\n\r\ni was just sitting on my front deck talking on the phone to my sister as i sometimes do during the day, smoking a cigarette and minding my own business (more or less...Lol), when i saw the craziest thing i've ever seen.\r\n\r\nfirst of all, let me say this, i live not far from charlotte, perhaps 15 miles from charlotte airport as the crow flies, so i often take a break and sit out here watching planes flying to and from the airport. that's normal and a usual routine for me.\r\n\r\nbecause i was talking on the phone and otherwise distracted, i wasn't paying attention to planes or anything else. the sky is particularly blue and clear other than a few puffy clouds here and there, but something flashing in the sky (like a mirror reflecting) caught my eye as i was talking to my sister.\r\n\r\ni inadvertently watched the object, thinking it to be an airliner headed towards charlotte. there was something odd about it, though, because even though it was long and silver shaped, i couldn't see any wings on it, but it was definitely flashing as if it were rotating in flight and reflecting the sunlight (like a cigar spinning). i stopped talking to her for a moment, watched the object (which was large and very visible), when it suddenly disappeared as if it just faded out of view. i was stumped and completely lost my train of thought.\r\n\r\ni interrupted my sister and told her what i had seen and was describing it to her, and about three or four seconds after it \"disappeared\", there was a flash of silver streak as it reappeared and zoomed back in the opposite direction, 180 degrees from the direction it had been traveling. this thing went completely out of site within a split second. that's the part that floored me more than anything else. again, speechless, i stumbled for words and finally told her it had just reappeared and had zoomed out of site the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nwithin five minutes a military awaks type of aircraft (the ones with what looks like a large satellite dish on their back) came from the direction of charlotte and flew to the same area which i had seen the... thing... disappear. in comparison, this thing i saw was at least three times larger than the awaks plane and it had no wings whatsoever, just a long cylinder shape.\r\n\r\nanyways, i had to tell somebody, and you can laugh if you want to, i would if it were me reading it instead of having just seen it happen.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nhere is the link showing the timestamp:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Panthersfanz.Com/forums/index.Php?Showtopic=14438&st=0\r\n\r\n___________________________________\r\n\r\nas far as my feelings or reaction, i was stumped, dazed, and was a little shocked that this had happened to me in broad daylight.  \r\n\r\nas my post stated, what originally brought the object to my attention was flashes coming from it, appearing as if the sun was reflecting off a mirror or something.  as i looked towards it, i first thought it was a very large airplane, but immediately noticed the revolving or rotational movement of it.  \r\n\r\nmy first thought, for a split second, was that it was a plane in trouble and that it was going to crash (due to the rotation of it), but as it rotated, i realized there were no wings on the object.  as funny as this sounds, i was about to consider it to be a blimp (even though it was traveling too fast), when it literally faded from blue into the clear blue sky.  the reason i say \"faded\" is because that is exactly as it appeared.  it took approximately 1 - 2 seconds for it to fade from view, but it did not \"instantly\" disappear.  \r\n\r\ni blurted out something, interrupting my sister's phone conversation, and told her what i had just seen.  about three to four seconds later, before she could finish making a joke about it, the object reappeared and in a flash it zipped out of site 180 degrees in the opposite direction.  nothing \"we\" have could fly as fast as that thing flew.  \r\n\r\nthere was no sound involved, although when it reappeared and flew in the opposite direction it left a sort of short trail from where it originated.  it was not like a cloud trail, but more of a vapor or heat trail, which quickly faded from view.\r\n\r\nall that said, i can promise you as a grown man (and owner of that nfl fan site), i would never have made such a post and risk ridicule had it not affected me so much and had it not happened.  \r\n\r\nthanks for listening.\r\n\r\ndewayne

light trail that looked like it was in the shape of an arch. the light was a cobalt blue with a white hue. and as it disappeared it released a very bright light. the light was looked as if you starred at a star for awhile and you saw the light rays. i could say it looked like the star in the stories of the northern star in the stories of jesus being born. and the arch of light vanished into the

football shaped.  our best estimate is that it was 500 yards away.  it seemed to slightly bigger than a helicopter.  we watched for 15-20 sec. in silence then amber says \"that's not a helicopter...\" and then i said, \"and its not a plane\". my cousin said something like \"holy crap dude\" and we watched again.  we then notice that the area around this object seems kind of hazy, or wavy.  it looked like there was some kind of energy around it.  we all confirmed that to each other but i can't remember what we said.  this is when it seemed to start changing shape.  about 1 min after we all first see it, the object started to wane like the moon on the right side, which would be east side from our viewpoint.  the sky was completely overcast because of the storm, grey and and lighter grey shades over the whole sky.  the area that seemed to disapear was the same color as the sky.  it then moved into the middle of the object and created a horseshoe shape. a crescent with the opening at the top.  the spot then moved up and to the left, which is the west side from our viewpoint.  the object is now back to its original shape.  we all get very excited at this point and we have been watching now for 2:30.  my cousin says i should get a camera.  i hesitate for about 30 secs and watch the object inestead.  the whole time it has been moving from east to west at a constant rate.  it was climbing in altitude slightly as it moved.  it had been dirctly north when we firts seen it, and by now it had moved to north west of our view point.  at 3min 15sec i decide to go grab my cellphone and take some pictures.  i run in and scramble to find my phone for about 20 secs.  when i get back outside my cousin jordon says it has started moving faster after i ran in to get my camera, and it did.  it was now far off in the northwest moving closer to due west, but still visible to our eyes.  i take 4 pictures as fast as i can, then i take a short video.  i take 1 more picture and stop to watch what little we can see still for the last 1min and 30 seconds until it moves into the overcast clouds to the west-northwest of our viewpoint.  then that was it.  we looked at the pictures i took and you can barely tell it is there.  its just a speck of pixels when you zoom in but i will send them to you just the same.  i can't even see the thing in the video.  i was just too late to take good pictures.  feel free to contact me if you need anymore info.  i am interested to know if anyone else reports this same object which is why i am reporting it.  thank you for your time,\r\n\r\nderek milner","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

i noticed a high amount of plains flying around, even over known no fly zones.  they were all flying in random directions, but remarkably resemble sweeping the air by grid.  i paid no heed to it, because it is an american holiday weekend (labor day).  anyway, going on... i went home that night and on one of my ciggorette breaks at 2033pst i saw a fireball that resembled the phenix lights almost directly to the west of me, and about 35deg high from horizon and never seemed to move.  i was in my robe and my camera was in my car so i didn't take pictures (plus it was fairly far away).  \"he fireball looked to change between 3 colors white, blue and orange.  i had a cigorette about 45 minutes later and it was gone, with a new one about the same distance and height to the north with the same color changing properties.  still didn't move.  anyway at 1157pst i was going to bed with my window open and all of a sudden \"plane shaped\" lights appeared in my window not too far off the ground.  it was not out of the ordinary for planes to be flying low (there is a small airport about 45mi to the south and down about 2000 ft into a valley).  what struck me as odd was how i did not have any sound at all as it should have passed over my head.  alright, so i decided to call it a plane until it started hitting a treeline accross the street and two flashing lights (probably jet strobes) came rushing in from the west and the ignored craft seemed to hurry down past the trees.  the jet lights followed toward and disappered behind the trees.\r\n\r\nat this point i think that the \"triangle craft\" is just a plane, just a really slow one which would account for me not hearing the noise.  although what really troubles me is what happoned afterward.  i was raised in a metropolitan area and have seen helicopters with spot lights follow cars and people in all types of areas.  i saw a plane through my window flying northwardly around the 101 with a spot light pointed from the aft of the plane pointing upward doing slow sweeps around.  this is when i knew everything was not normal about the evening.  i ran outside, and by the time i got to the front the planes search light seemed to be off.  the night was abnormally clear because of good winds that suddenly started around 1700pst that evening and it was a beautiful night.\r\n\r\ni would not suggest in investigating this claim unless others report seeing odd behavior as well.  oh, and i was texting someone in atascedero and she saw the balls as well (but nothing else)","distance":"Over One

out of the vehicle, when i looked up, the best description i can give is, 7 to 10 of these glowing orange balls of light were traveling from east to west fairly slowly. these things were very high up, the only reason i am sure of this was because they seemed to be in the clouds,the clouds made a very hazy circle around them, they were in a weird pattern. there were 3 objects that made a straight line, then directly behind them was four more in an almost triangle shape,there were two seperate lights from the pattern one was about 100 feet or so off the back and 1 was a lot higher than the rest and was the last to dim out. the customer who was with me was just as shocked as i was. the line of these things was huge i can guess that it was about 300 feet long, maybe more. we watched them for about 3minutes before i realised i had my camera phone on me. i video taped them on my camera phone for about another 2 minutes and 30 seconds. as they moved west they seemed to just fade out, or dim

thought it must be an airplane, probably approaching the huntsville airport which is probably 15 miles away. my wife and i watched it for approximately 3 minutes as it drifted at a speed that seemed much too slow for an airplane. at one point it almost appeared to stop just before it descended behind the tall trees on the west side of hwy 53. it also appeared to be quiet a bit larger than an airplane maybe 3 or 4 times the length of an average passenger jet. it had more lights than i expect to see on a single plane maybe 6 to 8 lights. if it was more than one plane, they would have been flying extremely close to one another and in a fixed relationship.  the lights were blinking at varying intervals. my wife noted that the lights appeared too large for airplane lights. after it

north east and maybe see it. no luck; anyway as i was panning my view from the northeast towards the east, i did a double take. it looked like a ornament suspended in the clouds. my first guess was that an air liner was aiming directly towards me,but that was not right. the object was a sphere with a solid black{?} band through the center with reticular boxes spaced above the black line. it did not have wings ,nor engines visible, also i saw no tail assembly dorsal/ vertical lift wings. i spent 10 years in the navy as an o.S.,the last four at nato.\r\ni have a fair, to better than average

 the first was in 2000 or '01 and myself and 4 others witnessed a huge triangle object very close to the ground near burns flat afb.  since that sighting i have been an avid skywatcher but it took 8 years untill i saw something truly unidentifiable.  on the evening of dec. 24  '08 (christmas eve) i was traveling north on rockwell ave  between nw expressway and britton rd. heading to meet family for the holiday and i happened to notice a starlike amber light at about a 40 degree angle directly in front of me almost directly in line with rockwell which runs north and south.  now my first impression when i noticed the light was that it was a light on an airplane coming in for a landing at wylie post airport which is 2-3 miles to my southwest from the location i witnessed the lights and i remember thinking the plane had mud or dirt inside the light because of the amber color without any glare or flicker, but the color was just so strange i kept looking while driving north and in just a few seconds after first seeing the light a smaller light of exactly the same color and with no glare or flicker whatsoever eminates from the first light.  the second light slowly falls to earth and when it appears to reach ground at the exact same instant the larger light in the sky winks out.  when i first saw the second light eminate out of the first light my heart jumped because i felt at that moment that i was witnessing a spark come from one of the small planes that land at wylie, until i noticed the light was identical to the larger one and fell too slow to the earth without losing any intensity of its light.  i pulled over in a store parking lot as soon as the second light reached the ground and the other winked out so i could see if  it indeed was an airplane but there was nothing there it was just like the light vanished.  even though the lights were starlike i had the impression that they were very close.  i stayed and watched that area of the sky for apprx 15 min without seeing so much as an airplane and i went to my family and told them of my experience, i was very excited.  i just cant believe nobody else in oklahoma city saw these lights but since ive been searching extensively for another witness but havent found one.  i hope these lights sound familiar to somebody else.   thank you mufon for letting me share my experience!\r\n\r\n\r\n

told me to look out in the sky. i ran outside and looked to the west toward monroe/middletown, ohio. there were 2 glowing orbs hovering in the sky. they looked like giant fireballs around a third to a half the size of the moon. they werent too far above tree/ house level. within 10-20 seconds they changed. one of them got bigger streaked slightly to the left. when i say streaked it looked like someone just speared the light slightly. it looked as if it was coming toward me in a diagonal direction, as if moving southeast which would leave a steak that i could only see from the front. it did however stay relatively in the same place in the sky, just appearing to get larger and streak/smear slightly to the left. simultaneously the orb directly to the right looked as if it disappeared from the outside to the middle staying in the same spot. it fizzled and appeared to disappear into itself, like it was being flushed down a drain. i assume that it flew away in the opposite direction, causing it to appear to disappear into a point in the center. the other one then drifted out of sight, almost appearing to land but i could only see it disappear behind a house. a plane had been in the sky to the northwest and came toward me, then circled in front of me around the area in which it had disappeared, eventually heading back in the direction it came. i could clearly hear the plane but the only thing were loud pops unlike anything i have heard, but these were not often and did happen after it was no longer in sight.\r\n\r\nthese were definitely the largest thing i have seen in the sky in my life, other than the moon and sun. but they definitely looked like flames. and they were not similar to meteors i have seen. they stayed in one spot until they moved and/or changed irregularly. \r\n\r\n\r\nmy buddy, before calling me, saw upwards of 6 of these all just hovering in the sky, not moving. he also said they looked like giant fireballs. and he said it looked as if white sparkles of some sort were dropping off of them. he then saw some of them disappear. he was in the car and called me and watched them as best as he could for the time we were on the phone. ill have him post his sighting.\r\n\r\nmy grandma watched one of these orbs to the south east of lebanon toward waynesville, ohio. she reported watching it for a good 10 to 15 minutes. it was around the general time of my sighting, more than likely before as she said it hadnt been dark long. she said it was like a big fireball flying around the sky. she described it as having a tail behind it, as if it was shooting fire out of it. but it flew in different directions not just from one point to another. it appeared to be throwing off blue and red sparkles. she did hear some kind of pops and did hear an engine noise but could not see a plane or anything else in sight. it eventually disappeared behind some trees.\r\n\r\nmy brother saw 6 similar fireballs in the sky in cincinnati tonight on the 6th and took a relatively useless pic but ill have him post his sighting and pic tomorrow as he is not home yet. he described them as flying around each other and disappearing and reappearing.

15 seconds at which time it just dimmed out. i kept watching on the chance that if it was a satellite, maybe it was tumbling and would reappear. it never did. no sound, no other lights, no vapor trail. it was a bright white light. to estimate the distance it traveled in relation to my outstretched arm, it would have been maybe 2 or 3 inches. i noted the time to be about 7:10p.M. i seemed to me that if it were a satellite, it still should be visible since the sun would still be shining on it. today (9/6) i tried to find out if there were any satellites crossing that area at that time on 9/4 but could find nothing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19109,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.665556,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09062009-0014","longitude":-89.655278,"occurred":1252116600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1252299920000,"summary":"Very bright, moving slowly, roughly west to east, overhead, just dissapeared -

and laughed, my heart jumped for joy because i had been looking for just such a sight ever since i have heard of ufo,s  i stood transfixed because i knew that this was the real thing and up close. i also knew what was transpiring within the ufo. they were punching in cordinates for their journey. as i watched the light became intensly white and i wiped my eyes, looked up again and that light was already almost out of sight. it took 3 seconds to disappear.It went directly east over the atlantic ocean. there was no sound at any time, it hovered perfectly still until it moved east. i have been

the dog out to use the bathroom. he was telling her to go out into the yard and i yelled out the window at him to say hello and to see why he was awake.  as we were talking, he pointed up in the sky and said, \"look at that big star. i never saw a star so bright\". my dad used to always joke with me when i was young and tell me that he saw ufos. i told him that he was goofy, but he begged me to go look at it, so i walked outside onto my front porch and there it was.  \r\nit looked like the north star except brighter and more yellow. my dad told me to go get my digital camera so i did. at first i was scared to take pictures of it because i didn't want whatever it was to come down and get me like you see in the movies. my heart was beating fast and my hands were shaking. after a while, nothing happened, so i just kept watching it and taking pictures. i had trouble finding it at first because it kept moving. when i would place the screen up to the sky to find the object, two lights were visible. there were red and blue lights shaped in the form of a triangle and they kept moving around the bright \"star\". my dad and i couldn't believe what we were seeing because we liked to watch this sort of stuff on tv, but never imagined we'd see it in real life! to the naked eye, nothing was moving. when i put my camera up to it, the objects would move side to side and up and down very fast. my dad even went and got his telescope, but we couldn't find a visual because it kept moving. \r\nafter about an hour or so, nothing else happened so we both went to bed. i went to bed about 5:30 a.M. and before i laid down, i felt a little freaked out, so i walked outside on the porch and it was still in the sky. i have not seen it since that night.  \r\n\r\nin the pictures on my digital camera, you can see the red and blue lights around the object. if i were to zoom in on them, you could not see them anymore. i also noticed that there was another set of red and blue lights on the other side of the object. when i uploaded the pictures to my computer, the lights were no longer visible. i wish i would have kept them on my digital camera so i could still show people the lights. i have shown many people and every time i show them, they get freaked out. hopefully, maybe someone can lighten the pictures up or something so the red and blue dots show. also, the pictures of where it looks like a boomerang, i zoomed in as far as my camera would let me and i put the camera on \"objects in motion\". as you can see, the object changes ways. the other picture is just a plain zoomed in picture of it in motion.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":19104,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4418248,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09062009-0009","longitude":-79.9944064,"occurred":1247814000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,
