(it started raining that night.) my side was dry for the most part. i can't remember exactly which campsite we used, but i'm pretty sure it was lot #60. it was located directly across from the parking lot. i didn't see any signs of a craft nearby, but i did see the creatures. i know what i saw was real, as i was wide awake when i saw them.\r\n

driveway in front of my house. i took my dog outside to go to the bathroom around 9:20/9:25. as she sniffed around my front lawn, i looked up at the sky to see several glowing red lights coasting through the sky above me. unlike anything i had ever seen, i watched for a few seconds while several more of these glowing red spheres passed over my neighboorhood, at one point there was a proccession of maybe 5 or 6 of these objects fly in a group. the first one of tese redlight fireball spheres i saw, i assumed it was a plane, but then realized as there were more and more appearing over a patch of trees, that these were in no way, shape, or form, merely airplanes.\r\n\r\ni snapped a picture with my cell phone before racing back inside my house to let my dog in, and yelled for one of my parents to come check out what i was watching happen in the sky. i ran back to my driveway, and signaled by dad, who had come to the front door to see what all the comotion was, to come out side and watch. we both watched more than a dozen of these red glowing fireballs fly over our neighboor, then seemingly \"disappear\". my mom also had joined us by this time in the drive way. by the time this strange event was over, i had snapped 8 pictures of these flying objects with my cell phone.\r\n\r\nmy emotions during the sighting can be described as simply in aw of what i was watching. kind of a surreal feeling to be watching these things fly over my neighboorhood. after words, i started getting very curious about what i just witnessed, and broke out an old telescope and binoculours

happened about 50 years ago and i'm reporting this just to get it off my chest.  \r\nmy event happened in the late summer, early fall of 1959, when i was in the air force stationed at whellus ab, libya, north africa.  i was an airman second class, a radio intercept operator with the 6938th radio squadron mobile.  i had no experience with aircraft identification but did see fighter jet aircraft from europe which came down to use the gunnery range at whellus.  the only \"strange\" aircraft i saw was the british vulcan, which we watched taking off almost straight up.\r\nanyway, another airman and i were walking back to the barracks after watching a movie on our side of the base (we had our own outside and indoor theatre inside a metal roof building).  i don't remember who he was but i wish i could.  \r\nas we were walking back, a light flew over our heads and disappeared over the tree line.  total time was less than 15 seconds.  we both thought we had just seen \"sputnik\" or anothe satellite and commented as such.  no sound!  \r\nthat was until the bright light came back over the tree line travelling right to left and disappeared over the horizon.  that was a real

woods in front of my valley.  having seen them before flying over our house on may 13, 2009 and coming up from that same area on may 18, 2009, i kept watching that area.  one after another came up from the woods, turned on what appears to be plane faa lights, then they speed up and fly off.  some appear to start flashing only out of nowhere higher up from this area without the orb appearance first.\r\n\r\nknowing no one is believing this phenomenon is actually occurring, i looked on google maps to determine the best location of its origination.  that area is a patch of woods and trees at the edge of a private community golf course in jeannette, pa, just past the murrysville line where i live.\r\n \r\nat dusk, i first took photographs of the area at 1600 iso with flash towards the area as i could see faint flashes.  those pictures reveal multiple orbs, several of which are orange or yellow (didn't look at them till next day).  i drove to the maintenance road by the golf course and could see pretty close an active plasma ball orb hovering above the golf course (and perhaps its pond--i never walked it to know for sure).  started shooting... it moved to the right behind some trees.  backed out of there and drove around to where the houses where to the highest point which was the job trailer (new community- not finished being built yet).  saw from opposite angle and started filming (so you can't say it's a plane's approach lights).  it did the usual transformation into a fake plane by starting blinking a colored light on each side of the big orb, which tones down into a headlight type appearance usually, then turns off to reveal what appears to be regular wing-tip navigation red/green lights with flashing white strobes.  as it flys over, the white strobes illuminate what, with the naked eyes, appears to be a tail.  upon blow up of each still of those flashes, however, the \"tail\" is a structure that changes and transforms a little between each flash.  this is not the first ufo i've filmed to do so, so i'm not surprised.\r\nnasa has photos from sts88 mission on their website labeled as \"space debris\" that changes the same (link to those pictures on my youtube channel page:  seeingufospa)  several of those crafts are identifiable to those i am video taping.\r\n\r\nthe video is in hd and is viewed here:\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=qgrz0vfvqiw\r\n\r\nhere is a couple of stills--first two of the orb and its fake plane appearance (one of many) and the third is just one of the many i saw after that (over a dozen total).\r\n\r\nthey only seem to be most active from monday night through thursday night--not much activity usually on weekends, but i suppose with the increase in sightings lately... that could change.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19082,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4318815,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09052009-0007","longitude":-79.694515,"occurred":1251961200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1252195455000,"summary":"Jeannette:

minutes after 3 pictures have been taken. i have had this camera set up watching my feeder for about 3 months and the camera has taken over 1,000 pictures. when i checked out one set of pictures looking to see wild game i came across 9 pictures that appeared to have some sort of light that was in the air and it was there while a wild boar was around the feeder. the light never changed it's plane and didn't seem to bother the boar. the light started from right to left coming up an old path that comes from a creek. the first set of pictures shows the light coming from behind a branch, thus showing that it couldn't be on the front of the camera, also there are times when it is close to the camera and you can see a definite size difference by measuring the size of the object. the location of the camera is such that a hill is behind the deer feeder so that there is no way that a light source from a road or plane might be the cause. the first set of three pictures starts at 11:05 and ends at 11:05 the second set of three pictures starts at 11:17 and ends at 11:18 the third set of three pictures starts at 11:28 and ends at 11:29. when i first started to look at the pictures i almost deleted the pictures but then i noticed the light. i tried to figure out what the picture might be but i just couldn't explain what the light could be. after showing the picture to several people not one person could explain the lights. i have done a lot of research on the internet and have not been able to find anything that looks anything like this light. th fact that the boar is around the entire time really puzzles me because they spook easily. the size of the light appears to be about the size of a bowling pin. unfortunately i personally never see the light so i can give no personal testimony. i am going to attach 2 pictures with the light and one picture in daylight without for review.","distance":"21-100

ever so slightly back and forth i thought i was seeing things and a few times the objects appeared to move closer to me getting much brighter. it was nuts at one point one the the object which seemed the closest to me the entire time got unbeleivably bright and looked like it was moving towards me pretty low in the sky and i actually got scared and got out of the chair i was sitting in and started walking towards my house. then a 3rd and forth similar looking bright light appeared in a different location. they were all almost sliding around the sky not really moving in a certain direction. every few minutes the lights would fade out then reappear even bighter than before. this is the 4th or 5th time ive seen something like this in the same location in the past 3 weeks. everytime ive seen these objects they get more dramatic, i was baffled thinking of someone i could call that late to go outside and check this out. i seriously want someone to set up a camera crew and videotape this footage in the next week or so its unbelievable. i live surrounded by farms in a real rural area and the whole event lasted till about 5:40 am right when the sun started to come up thats when the lights faded out. at that point i literally looked up to scan the sky and saw like 5 star like lights moving westerly in the sky above zig zagging. and another thing it was a partly cloudy night and

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  the events involve many abductions over a 3 year period.  i have never seen a ufo per say, and i believe this is intentional.  why?  i can only guess the reason is they don't want me to categorize them.  there are many accounts of ships and how they are associated with various species.  my only conclusion is they want to hide their origins or if you like the faction they belong to.\r\n\r\n  the first abduction i recall was vague, and at first i believed it was merely a dream.  i would like to mention that over the years i have never been able to recall my dreams very well, and if i do the memory of them fades quickly.  these however are vivid, and the memory of them persist years later.  \r\n\r\n  the first abduction i recall i was sitting at a round table with other people surrounding it.  an adult male in his 40s asked me if i would join them.  i replied 'join what, what is it you want me to join?'  he more or less broke it down and described them as a group of decision makers.  from his description the impression i got was that they were a think tank.  when i asked if they were a think tank he laughed and said 'sort of'.\r\n\r\n  he then ask a few people at the table to describe to me what their responsibilities were.  he asked a very young look girl sitting on his left to describe her \"job\".  it consisted of making sure that people were happy and had fun things to do that made them happy.  i suppose someone in charge of moral.  i replied that i liked that, and it seemed to please her a great deal.  he then ask another woman sitting three chairs to his left to describe her responsibility.  it consisted of something like an efficiency officer.  she more less described something like insuring maximum productivity at all costs.  now i use that description, because it is hard for me to describe exactly what it is she does.  my visceral reaction to what she said, was 'that is fascist!'  this seemed to anger her, and she acted a bit put out.  there is more to the abduction and borders on the fantastic, but what i did account more or less covers the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n  another abduction involved me waking up with 2 beings standing over me on either side.  the one on my left looked to the other one and asked 'is he waking up?' all i saw were vague shapes, with a sort of halo effect around their heads.  like intense lighting from above.\r\n\r\n  i was laying on my back, and didn't appear to be strapped down or anything.  i went back to sleep at that moment.  this is the moment that permeated every incident after that.  i realized i was not asleep and from a subconscious to a conscience level i realization that i was awake and not alone.  in the back of my mind i conceptualized how i should react.  'how i should react to someone doing something to me without my permission?'\r\n\r\n  my reaction was to choke the person on my right.  i reached up and made contact with someone's chest.  i was surprised and preceded to feel this person next to me.  it felt artificial and yet organic at the same time.  to try and articulate what i felt it was like pot marks.  these were not crude pot marks like scaring, it was more like organized pores.  the person did not stop me or even flinch.  i felt enough to realize whoever it was was humanoid and then proceeded to try and choke them.  the throat felt like there was nothing underneath, just some sort of skin covering a void.  after that i fell back asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n  the next abduction involved me waking up to a man asking me questions.  i am going to omit the questions simply because they are frightening and i don't think they will be understood.  needless to say i reacted obstinately.  if you knew me you would understand.  i replied angrily that they should be doing something a different way.  and all he replied was if they could do it the way i described, that they wouldn't need to do the other.  so i said 'don't you think that is what you need to be working towards?'  a large person sitting on my right kind of looked back at me worried.  from what i gathered he was an abductee as well.\r\n\r\n*to note, during these abductions my vision was obscured.  by that i mean blurred.  not to the point of totally blurring my vision, just enough to make it hard to make out detailed features.  although i don't recall specific events about my dreams, i never experienced something like this.\r\n\r\n  there were many abductions after these and at one point i held conversations with one in particular.  they told me things, some i believe to be true and others i am not so sure about.  they played on my assumptions and clearly saw me as inferior.  now that is not to say they didn't like me, i got the feeling they saw me as cute.  i appears that their 'attachment' to humanity seems to run deeper than superficial.\r\n\r\n  a few of the things they told me?  well, they claimed their species is 30 billion years old.  when i replied in astonishment that our current universal expansion was only 15 billion years old they laughed and said 'we know'.  they said that they are very similar to us socially... love, family, culture, even crime.  needless to say i was floored.\r\n\r\n  i am not the only person to have been abducted and experienced something like this.  i am not special, i am just one of millions on earth who have been contacted.  there are others on earth who have had the same thing happen to them, and are afraid to repeat it.  although some are not and have bravely come forward and recounted their experience.  i applaud these brave people.\r\n\r\n  the aliens clearly asked me not to mention this to anyone, and in reality i haven't recalled even a quarter of my experience.  whether they were concerned about how i would be perceived by my peers or merely didn't want their existence to be known, i am not sure.  i suspect it is the later.  they want to keep their presence hidden, that much is clear.  and when i told them i wouldn't keep my mouth shut about it, they didn't seem surprised.  i told them if they really didn't want me to say anything they might as well kill me now.  needless to say i am still here and do not fear them.\r\n\r\n  i saw six different species and interacted with four of them.  now i know our universe is more diverse and wonderful than we ever imagined.  i do not expect people to believe me.  it doesn't matter, i know in my heart and mind that what i experienced was real and i will never forget it.","distance":"20 Feet or

point the object got close enough to see that the strobing white light was giving off an immense star-like glare effect. it was difficult to make out the shape of the object because it was getting dark, however the 4 lights on it indicate it was a rectangular shaped object, with the longer side moving forward. the four lights from left to right were white, red, white and red. the first white light was incredibly bright while the remaining three were much less so. also, i'm not 100% sure but i think the white and red lights were alternating. i lost sight of the object as it flew past over

a bright star.  it was 45 to 50 degrees up from the horizon.  you hardly ever see stars here in eureka, so i watched it for 15 minutes, and it was moving very slowly first a bit to the right, then a bit to the left, etc.  i went outside to view it.  it actually looked like two objects, one on top of the other.  after 40 minutes it had slowly moved south behind a redwood tree, out of my sight.  i tried to find a number for mufon, but was unsuccessful, so i called nuforc.  the yo-yo i spoke with told me it was jupiter.  now, i'm not an astronomer, but there's no way that was jupiter. jupiter doesn't move that fast, and even if it did, it doesn't go south, north, and south again.  it wasn't an airplane, helicopter, blimp, or satellite, of that i'm positive.  it was moving too slow to be anything i'm familiar with, but too fast to be a planet or star.  i'll watch to see if it ever comes out from behind the tree, and if it does, i'll send in another report.

we both observed the object as it slowly moved south, becoming hidden behind the new building. i need to add the fact that the object also seemed to change shape from what we originally observed as triangular. it seemed to \"morph\" into a nondescript shape; maybe roundish, oval or kind of circular, then back to triangular, then back to whatever shape and so on. it also seemed to have a strange and very faint, fuzzy \"filter\", so to speak, surrounding the object which made it all the more difficult to discern the shape(s) of. both my friend and i commented about this observation. it was as if it, the \"filter\", was meant to obscure, or blur ones vision, and that is what it felt like too, oddly enough. the height of the building is 40 stories in total, and the object appeared to be at an altitude of perhaps 15 to 20 stories up and approximately only 3 to 5 blocks behind (to the east) of the building. two other patrons were outside as well and we pointed out the object to them when one of them stated \"that's something you don't see everyday in seattle\", and that was about it for their interest in the object. however, my friend and i were very intrigued by this point, and lamented for not having binoculars handy. at any rate, the object moved slowly from view behind the building. we sat back down, continued on our beers all the while looking for when the object would reappear from behind the right (south) side of the building. 5 maybe 10 minutes went by when i noticed the object was now above the building, and still exhibiting the same strange shape morphology. the object now seemed to travel on a very slow south-west direction toward the puget sound. it also appeared to slowly gain altitude as well. in fact, the object remained on this direction and altitude gain until we could no longer see it. the total observation time was approximately 20 minutes. the objects' size is difficult to discern;i'd say maybe the size of a compact car. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":19069,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8991218,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09042009-0007","longitude":-77.0345358,"occurred":1251757800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle,   Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1252095233000,"summary":"Daylight ufo sighting from downtown seattle.","tags":["ufo","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":3,"locationName":"Washington, Washington","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:192939"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2172}
