1964 i was working as a fitter and turner at a mining repair work shop, late in the afternoon  i was asked to help a mate we had to go to the next building .As we went out side i noticed something in the sky the sun was reflecting off it, it was a large cigar ufo, i called the men in the workshop out and aprox 30 men saw this craft.This craft was motionless in the sky, we watched for aprox 5min and then one end raised about 15 deg and it sped off at a huge speed from the size in the sky about a meter to a speck in a micro second. everyons jaw dropped.This was the first cigar ufo that i have wittnessed but not the last. when i was about 12yrs old i was in the boy scouts my dad was the scout master, one night my dog was barking like i had never heard before, my dad came into my room and got hold of my scouts wooden staff i had behind my door and went out side as he thought there was an intruder in our yard. next thing was my dad calling me outside i went outside it was about 1am in the morning and a still clear night. my dog had its paws on the front gate barking at the sky my dad said look graeme a ufo, there was a large yellow glowing disc hovering over our home, slowly it moved away to the east and dissapeared. my dad told me not to say anything as people would think i was mad.In 1969 i had built a new home  south of sydney, over looking the ocean. as i was putting the milk bottles out that night i wittnessed a cigar ufo very low and close to where i lived i called my wife out and she also saw it. only about200ft above the sea travelling north towards sydney at only 40mph (aprox)no noise.I told my engineer at work arthur . he told me to keep an eye out, maby you will see more.Arthur told me what happened in the north sea during ww2 he was on a destroyer that a large disc had hit all the radar and radio anteners every one ran to deck to see this large disc mooving away so i kept a watch from 1969 to 1971 i wittnessed dozens and dozens of orange glowing discs all travelling the same way and on certain nights they would land at a remote spot in a bassalt quarry.On one occassion there was seven discs three landed and the others hovered above them. with the naked eye they glowed yellow to orange but through bonoculars it became a heat spectrum the faster the disc moved the hotter the heat spectrum (towards the blue end)when they hovered the glow would go out. three yrs running i wittnessed a huge mother ship probably 10 to 15 miles to the east of me over the sea,this craft always came in the same month september. these discs i have mentioned aprox 70 ft in dia would come out of the top of this mother craft,about three quarters along from the fronti counted at least80 discs come out of her and travel in file to land where they hovered above homes when a area was done they moved to another and so on. i could tell more if you are interested. i was threatened in 1971 and 1997 not to talk to anyone. i have had some trouble all ready so dont give my email adress etc to anyone.Ps when i first started to wittness these events i would phone the naval base  i was told on one occassion yes we have them on the radar but what can we do.My brother was in the navy he suvived the voyager sinking when the aircraft carrier run them down in 1964, the h.M.A.S melbourn. i was on leave from the air force that fatefull day.My brother has told me that even in 1964 they had a eletronic unit that could discriminate earth craft and et craft flick a switch and the ufos would go off the screen.

saw 2 aircrafts high in the sky, and off to the right above a tree i could see off in the distance a twinkleing light which i had neer seen there before in that position. i opened my window and watched it very carefully and with my naked eye i could see that it was changeing colors. i watched the other 2 aircrafts to see where they were headed but the were out of sight. i quickly ran to the other room which was closer cause it was on that corner of the house and opened the window and watched it for a few minutes about 4. i realized i should grab my mothers 10 mega pixel camera and take pictures with all different kinds of setting and take a movie of what i was seeing. i ran in her room, grabbed the camera and headed back and could still see the object in the sky.I began shooting picture after pictture, movie after movie. i could see clearly in the picture the many different colors. i tried to capture pictures of the constelation orion that was higher in the sky, but being as bright as they were to the naked eye, they were not as easy to capture on camera as the object, or ufo. i returned to my room to look at it through my window again after about 15 mins. of watching it in the other room from a different angle, and by the time i came back the ufo had moved higher and further in the sky, but not by too much from my point of view.I called the police and asked if they had heard of any object in the sky in the southeastern direction and the lady sad no, not that she knew of. i came back upstairs from looking at in from my driveway and contacted mufon. while notifying them, and glanced back out the window about 25 mins. later and the object was still there changeing colors in the sky, moveing in the same direction very slowly, further now, but still

light object in the nw sky about 45 degrees over the horizon.   at first the object appeared to be a plane at night, with red, green, and white flashing lights.   however, over several nights i noticed that the object does not move - at all.   i can track star positions and note their movement across the sky, and can often see planes at various altitudes - all exhibit movement, even though it may be extremely slow.\r\n\r\nthis object does not move.   however, on one occaision it changed position in the sky dramatically, at least 30 degrees to the east in a matter of seconds.   then returned to roughly the initial sighted position.\r\n\r\nit is in virtually the same position each night, however there may be very slight differences, as measured against tree or building positions.\r\n\r\ncasual observation would dismiss this as a very distant plane.   however, over month of close observation reveals puzzling inconsistencies.  these observed differences, inconsistencies are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) clouds will obstruct view - even very high cirrus clouds, indicating to me that is above the cloud layer, ruling out helicopters or ballons.\r\n\r\n(2) it is at least 20% brighter than any plane, except for planes that are at very low altitude.\r\n\r\n(3) except for one or two cases, there is no measurable movement for entire event, which often lasts several hours.\r\n\r\n(4) it \"suddenly\" appears, and \"suddenly\" disappears.  like turning a switch off and on.\r\n\r\n(5) besides red and green lights, it sometimes emits blue and yellow/white lights.  on one occaision, i observed a blueish-purple \"streak\" of light.\r\n\r\n(6) all lights flash, and do not appear to be fixed location on the object.\r\n\r\n(7) even though the object is very high (indicate by clouds), and is estimated to be 60-80 miles downrange, it appears large and very bright compared to planes.\r\n\r\n(8) i have witnessed numerous planes at various altitudes coming and going that pass between the object and my line of sight with no deviation in the flight plan/path of the plane.  the assumption is that it is therefore well outside any flight path or altitude vector of commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\n(9) changing angle of view (such as driving across town to a friends), i often cannot locate the object, but it is once again visible when i return home, or if i call home and ask someone to look.\r\n\r\nafter much careful observation over many night, i am more puzzled than ever.   the only explanation i can think of is a geo-stationary satellite - but i have not heard, nor can i find any information, on satellites that have large flashing lights, or that would suddenly \"turn off\", or make occaisional movement, or wouldn't be located in the exact inclination in the sky.  i cannot imagine why there would be red and green \"navigational\" lights on a satellite, nor the other colors documented.\r\n\r\nseveral friends have seen it with me, but quickly dismiss it as a plane and will not spend the time to watch/document it for hours to see that there is no motion across the sky, nor wait around until it suddenly \"blinks off\".\r\n\r\ni am hesitant to report to the authorities based upon my friend's reactions -  as i sure no leo will watch it for hours to verify what i am reporting.\r\n\r\ni can easily show to anyone most any reasonably clear night.   it is visible when most stars are obscured (it's that bright).\r\n\r\ncan anyone in mufon shed some light on this? it is really beginning to nag on me the more i watch it.  is it a satellite?  help!","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

organization that  i believe was ground saucer watch at the time. they suggested a meteor had split at the  time and that's like what it was. i was driving to  work before sun-up. driving north on 59th ave, north of camelback rd and before i reached montebello ave. i saw a giant green ball with a broken red tail. the ball seemed to be as big as a beach ball at arm's length. it was low in the sky, traveling horizontally. it was not spinning and it maintained its circular shape without losing size as it moved across my frontshield. i didn't have to bend my head to see it. there  were no  flames or anything  like that coming from the green ball. as it reached moved across the road, it was low enough in sky that it  disappeared behind some large trees on west side  of road. i  remember thinking i would  see it once it cleared the trees, but it never cleared the trees as i never saw it again. it puzzled me because it didn't diminish in size through the duration. i  want to say my car was less than half a mile from the trees when i first noticed the ball. the  one thing that  stands out is it never diminished in size as it moved across  my windshield, which perhaps  took about 10-15 seconds. it wasn't moving downward. it was horizontal and remained that way until i lost sight. i don't recall thinking what  it might be. just was amazed at the sight. i'm just hoping someone could tell me that, yes, it does sound like the description of a meteor.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to do walking with ben. it is six miles from our house and elevation 400 feet. a park about 300 acres with running track, fish lake, lots of trails and small walking tracks. it is between la cienega bl and la brea ave. by the time we are there, usually is about 5:20 am and we would start walking, jogging or warm up immediately. ben is 67 years old but walks faster than me, i am 64 and walk a smaller loop than him. the loop i walk is about 150 yard, on one end facing the panaramic view of los angeles from san gabriel valley to beverly hills - many miles across. i would sit on the park bench enjoying the beautiful scenery. few people come to this park at this hour, total no more than 3 or 4 people visible. on that particular morning (the day i don't remember anymore, the day i filled in is not correct, i filled in because needed to go forward, but the time of the day is correct)there was not a star in the sky. it was twilight time, the sun still way under horizon. i sat on the bench comfortably and looking up in the sky. i found one single star right on top of me. it is a star, it is bright and way up in the sky. i gazed at it for a while, and felt i am being watched and the same time, i noticed this star is weird. it was moving in a very small circle. i thought, may be my eyes are not good. i looked carefully, still circling. it was moving, not stationery. i deducted - it is not airpline, because airplane would not move like that. it was not a helicopter, it is too high and helicopter don't move in a circle for more than 5 minutes. i felt i was communicating with whatever being inside, but no particular idea. this time, another jogger walked by, i stopped him, and asked him to pay attention to this star. this jogger listened to me and politely said some nice words and continued jogging. in order to break the deak lock, i had a thinking that, if i walk away, showing no interest anymore, the being up there might have some reaction. so i stood up follow follow the track walk seven to eight steps and stopped. and slowly i walk back to the bench and looked up  in the sky. the star disappeared. nowhere to be found. so i extended my search area (there was no star anywhere on that morning). i found this star had moved 25 miles north east on top of san gabriel valley. i am an ethic chinese. san gabriel valley have concentration of chinese there. it still move in a circle. i did not know what else i could do. so i continue my execise. but this incident  stayed on my mind ever since. to-day, i found this website, so i just report it like a good citizen should. \r\n\r\nthe reason i take my time to report this, partly, i just watch ufo on history channel that some astronault reported found things they knew not a star but don't know what. i have the same experience.

the intersection at studebaker rd.\r\n\r\n                   i was in the driver seat and first witnessed the object in the area shown in slide 1 of the attached re-created photo. at first i thought it was a blimp...Then wasn't so sure...As we approached i pointed it out to my friend in the passenger seat-he could not see it (either because he wasn't looking right at it, or the tree's were obstructing his view.\r\n\r\n                   as we approached the intersection i noted that it looked almost like an enormous advertisement banner towed by a plane for those on the beach. the reason i say that is because it appeared as if there were breaks in the solid shape...Like lettering...But not lettering-something else. once i noticed it did not appear to have a lead plane (towing it) and the fact that it was not at a slight angle (as most banners are) to the horizon i began to question what it was even more.\r\n\r\n                   i would approximate that it was wide (1x to 2x the length of a b-52 and twice as tall (as shown in a side profile)). i would estimate that the height to be twice that of a b-52. the approximate altitude would have been 6k-10k feet. i am a student pilot and aerospace engineer.\r\n\r\n                    after we turned the corner (onto studebaker rd) i looked to my left hand side to point out the location of the object to my passenger and it was not there. there was nothing at all in the sky.\r\n\r\n                    an objective observer would note that the craft approximate location shown in the attached recreated photos have similar shapes as that of the telephone pole wood horizontal supports. i witnessed this craft for 2 minutes....And there was no indication it was part of anything attached to the ground (telephone pole/etc.). as a pilot with 50 flight hours i would hope to be able to differentiate.\r\n\r\n                   f-18 fighters were heard accelerating (unknown if they were taking off or merely patrolling as usual from los alimitos at 11:52am.\r\n\r\n                   interestingly enough the fires are still burning today...The sky in the background of the object was 'smoggy' but not much different than a very hot, smoggy day in los angeles-only this air certainly had the added particulates from the fires. another interesting fact is that there were fires burning on the same day when other objects were observed in november of 2008:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Ufocasebook.Com/2009/californiatrisightingnov2008.Html\r\n\r\ni would recommend that any follow up call the following

diamond-shaped box, fairly thick and long.  the object was ahead of me, over my road, heading north west.  2 cars sped by, who appeared to be others chasing the item.  (a white suv and a yellow sports car)  i followed, driving through the neighborhood.  i quickly lost sight, but continued following the other cars, and saw it again, this time headed south west.  i separated from the other cars (there were 3 by this point, a maroon suv joined us at some point) and took what i thought was a quicker route, and soon came to a dead end against a canal, to see the object go beyond the trees to the south west.\r\n\r\ni then headed home, and once i was out of my car in my driveway, i saw a helicopter flying the same path as the object had originally been flying, and then abruptly turned in the south west direction after it had gone further out.\r\n\r\n(see attachment)\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the object, i didn't know what to think, i just remembered wondering why a plane or a helicopter was so bright.  i immediately realized it was moving far too slow for a plane, and with such a quiet neighborhood, i would have expected to hear something.  seeing the other cars chasing it from what seemed to be the direction the object was coming from made me really take a closer look, and noticed the odd glowing bottom which i had at first dismissed as a trick of the light on my windshield or a low cloud.  upon looking at it, there seemed to be lines all over the object, like sharp grooves along the surface, and the bright glowing red center which were three thick arch-shaped points of light that together formed a circle which had gaps between them, appearing almost like supports between each piece.\r\n\r\nit was the shape of a diamond, but its thickness was probably a sixth of the length, which struck me as oddly thick.  \r\n\r\nthere were only very few clouds very high up, far above the constant height of the object.\r\n\r\nother than being shaken

out and we all ran down a dirt road . the lights were about 100 feet above us still holding still . when we got down near them there was a really loud hum like a transformer or a big swarm of bees ,it was so loud it actually made your ribcage vibrate . i was initially excited about getting near the object but now got an overwhelming sense of unease , i said to my sister what if they are not friendly. the boy who was behind us was getting frustrated because he was trying to line one of the lights up in a pair of binoculars he had and could get it in focus. just then the humming stopped and we noticed that the lights began to move very very slowly , they moved with such precision that it made it look like it was a solid object. it was a full moon that night and i told my sister lets wait until it passes in front of the moon so we can see its sillouhette. as it passed in front of the moon there was no solid object between the lights they were seperate objects.I snapped the picture before they started moving . we ran back up to the car as we continued down i 81 towards binghamton we could still see the \r\nlights they had taken a new formation shaped like this v. we watched them out our left window . suddenly over state hospital hill the shot off in \r\ndifferent directions and disappeared. when we got home we called the police they stated they had received multiple calls . we called the tri cities airport they stated whatever it was it was not showing on their radar. the next day the press and sun bulletin had a story stating that the objects were planes with the bottoms painted black . i dont know of any plane except a harrier jet that can stay that still in the sky and thay make a racket of noise. our neighbor thought we were crazy that night her brother and his girlfriend came home and told her what they had seen they were near state hospital hill parking . she came over and told us she couldn't believe that they had described the same thing we saw . the picture was developed but was very dark and the lights were small , my brother in law scanned the picture and this picture is the result .\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

with my wife and my son. i am 30 years old, and have had an assortment of occupations in my short time here so far. i started working as a bricklayers helper out of highschool for about three years. from there i managed a furniture store warehouse,then worked in technical support for aol from '99 to '01, back to brick work, then a 5 year stint with the pepsi bottling group, and now am a paramedic for east texas medical center at the age of 30. i'm telling you all this to give you at least some idea of who i am. i met my wife at the age of 17 and have been happily married ever since. i love my family and happily work hard for them. \r\n\r\nfirst experience\r\n\r\n         i am writing you because i dont know where else to go. i have been \"visited\" by an unrecognizable object on three seperate occasions. now your probably thinking, \"big deal, people have been seeing ufo's since mans beginning.\" thats kinda my perspective on the topic. however, four nights ago, a thought came to me that made me wonder why i didnt think it sooner. the thought was, \"of all the stories and reports and accounts of \"alien encounters\", i have never heard of or read about any report that was even close to mine. i am almost hesitant to continue, for i am not sure if you will even read this, but here goes.  i have had countless abnormal experiences in the twilight hours,  but these three are the ones that demand my attention.  three visitations, the first one around may 22 or 23 of 2007, i was by myself.  we were living in a house in union grove which is a very rural area just outside gladewater, tx.  we had moved there in june of '06.  i had quit my job at pepsi in december after my fathers death in november of '06,  and was preparing to start emt-basic school in january.  i worked at a telephone operating center while i went to school.  i worked mainly afternoons through nights,  during the slower hours.  this proved advantageous,  as i was able to study and do work in between calls.  i was still working as an operator,  just finishing emt school. that spring i had discovered information on the mayans and other topics such as edward leedskalnins book magnetic current,  which sparked interest and curiosity like i had never known.  this was also the time when i started almost mindlessly drawing all these geometrical shapes at work.  i would get in this zone and just drawing all kinds of equilateral triangles and evenly section them off and make all these beautiful designs.  i had bought a compass and a protractor and would make a grid of evenly spaced dots and begin to make perfect circles with my compass,  making this flower fo life pattern.  i occasionly  to this day will sit down and make flower of life.  now, first encounter was around my dads birthday,  which was may 22 - i remember that much about the time frame.  i'm not absolutely sure of the exact date, but i would say it is accurate within a week either way. i didnt record the date of the first event. it just never occured to me to do so. i saw it at about 11:30 at night and my wife was asleep. i had stepped out on my back porch for a smoke,  which i did every night,  as i am some what of a night owl.  standing on my back porch i had a greatly limited view of the sky,  as there were two giant oak trees,  one on each side of my view,  along with my garage/shed on my left and the house on my right.  i would say i could see about 1 percent of the sky from that spot.  as i stepped out and lit my smoke,  i noticed a very bright, large star directly in front me (it was due west), about twice as big as any star i had ever seen,  and much brighter than any star i had seen.  initially i didn't give it a second glance,  which is odd because i was out there every night and never recalled seeing it before.  well,  about halfway down my smoke i look up at the sky and noticed the large bright light again.  this time it caught my attention.  as i looked at the star,  i remember asking myself,  with my head slightly cocked and intense curiosity, \"what is that?\"   the next thing i remember thinking was that it looked like it was moving.  i stilled my head and squinted my eyes to maintain focus,  and sure enough it was moving very, very slowly and subtly to the right,  barely even noticable.  at this point i was hooked.  i became ignorant of everything around me and about me,  and anything else i might have been thinking on.   as i stared at this single bright light,  it began to seem like it was now getting lower in the sky,  then i noticed it was getting slightly larger and brighter.  i was frozen.  all my focus, energy, and intention was completely engulfed by this light.  in what seemed like seconds,  the light's altitude in relation to the horizon was cut in half.  the light became much larger and brighter and very clear,  with no glare, halo, or haze surrounding it.  it was at this point that i realized this light was descending and approaching me at a very fast rate.  at this point i had stepped out in the yard and had a much better scope of the sky,  including directly above me and back over the house a good way towards the east.  once i realized this light was descending towards me,  it only took what seemed seconds for this flying craft to be directly over me at a very, very low altitude,  probably around 400-700 feet.  now,  this craft had absolutely no sound signature,  except for a very low humming/vibratory effect that i felt more than heard.  right before the ship was directly above me,  at some point i became oblivious of the large bright light that i guess was on the front of the ship,  and my full attention was shifted to the light display on the underbelly of the ship.  i'm really not quite sure how to explain this part,  for the under lights acted in a way that seemed more organic than artificial.  on approach,  i saw a mixture of red and yellow lights.  the lights reminded me of little seperated l.E.D.'s.  at this point i could make out a vague outline of the craft,  although i cant recall the exact shape for the lights had me somewhat \"hypnotized\", feeling very disoriented and confused as i watched the bewildering light show.  when i first saw the lights they seemed to be in a square pattern,  consisting of 15-20 individual red and yellow l.E.D.'s.  now this is where it is hard to relate the account.  i cant think of any one word to accurately describe the action of the lights. while staring at the lights,  instantly,  with fluidity,  the lights were now in a circle shape,  with me never seeing any lights go out or new lights come on.  i never looked away,  as my exposure to the underlights was only about 10 -15 seconds long it seems.  the lights rolled or shifted,  or whatever you want to call it,  into two or three different patterns before it completed its low fly-over.  as it passed over the house,  it started its ascent and as quick as it approached it was gone,  first a farely bright light,  and gradually dissappearing within a minute or so.  i cannot describe the intensity of emotion that came upon me,  i was exhilerated.  i have never felt that quality of excitement up to that point.  i ran inside as fast as i could to try to wake my wife up,  shaking her and telling her i had just seen a ufo!!  she wouldnt wake up. i went back outside for a little bit before retiring.  i told her about it the next day.  she knew i had seen something,  but i think she thought i had just seen some kind of military aircraft or something else explainable.  the very next night,  as my wife and i sat inside our house,  she watching t.V. and me on the internet (probably researching the mayans,  as i had just gained knowledge of them and thus much interest),  i felt/heard the low humming vibration.  i looked at my wife wide-eyed and remember exclaiming \"thats it!!\"  i ran outside just in time to see the ship ascending towards the east,  just as it did the previous night.  this is where i think my wife became convinced that i saw something,  for i described the event to her earlier that day,  describing the humming sensation it emitted,  and now she felt it too,  only she didnt make it outside in time to see it.  i was a bit bummed because i knew that without seeing it for herself,  she would never fully believe or appreciate the experience as i had.  the very next night,  for the third night in a row i heard the ship,  running out too late to see it.  thats the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n second experience  \r\n\r\n               the second time was on febuary 13 of 2008.   at this time we were living about 5 miles north,  with my wife's parents and her brother.  we could no longer afford the house in union grove due to the tremendous paycut i accepted by leaving pepsi.   we moved in about july of '07.  after that first encounter,  i spent alot of time outside at night,  peering into the night sky,  looking for something else spectacular to happen.  then one night it did,  and when i was least expecting it.  right around 11:00 p.M., my wife and i had stepped out on the back porch of her parents house,  a medium sized commercially built log cabin with a covered wrap-around porch.  the back porch faced due west.  we had a 35-40 foot tree line for our horizon about 75 yards behind the house.  there was forest on both sides of the house,  so again our view was fairly limited.  we stepped out and approached the northwest corner of the house to smoke.  thats also the corner of the house our bedroom was in.  as we turned and stopped, facing the backyard(west),   i remember noticing this incredibly bright looking star,  and upon recollection,  i remember thinking that it must be some planet,  but for some odd reason it didn't catch my interest initially,  which was abnormal for that season of my life.  the light was hovering,  as still as a star, for about the first five minutes we were out there,  just over the tree line.  then my wife broke the silence,  inquiring seemingly to herself,  but out loud, \"what is that?\".   i responded, \"what?\",  not really sure what she was talking about.  she pointed at the bright light and said, \"that,  what is that?\".   as we stared at the light,  we almost immediately thought we noticed slight, slight movement.  at this point,  something clicked,  and i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was the same thing i witnessed the previous may.  i remember putting my left arm on her right shoulder,  as i was to her right,  and jumping up i shouted, \"thats it, thats it!!\".   i quickly ran inside to our bedroom to retrieve our camcorder,  which used mini cassette tapes.  i ran back outside stopping a few feet short of my wife,  who was now a couple of yards off the parch in the grass.  i looked up, and to my amazement i saw two very clear, large, bright lights descending out of the sky,  coming directly at us.  it was as though a giant car was floating in the sky,  as the lights were next to each other horizontally,  like headlights.  i tried to hold the camera in the direction i thought was correct,  for i was unable to pick up the lights on the fold out screen.  at this point i was repeatedly telling my wife,  \"thats it,  thats it,  watch for the lights,  watch for the lights!!\".  less than a minute later the ship was passing directly over us,  slightly higher than the first time i seen it.  as the headlights were \"out of view\",   i say that because i never remember seeing the headligts go out,  its just like one second your looking at the white lights,  and the next second all you see is the red and yellow lights underneath the object.  just like the first time the red and yellow l \"l.E.D.'s\" became apparent,  and just like the first time they did their little \"dance\",  shifting from one obscure pattern to the next.  the humming sensation wasn't quite as noticable as it was the first time,  i assume because of its slight ly elevated altitude,  and i am quite sure that there were more red and yellow l.E.D.'s when i had seen it the first time.  it seems like this second time there were only around 10-12 lights displayed.  i was fascinated.  i'm thinking \"what in the world is going on!!??\"  the lights stayed visible for approximately 10-15 seconds,  just like the first time,  then it reascended and was gone in the east.  i couldn't hardly beleive it,  yet there it was.  my wife received first hand experience,  and it was like a huge weight was lifted,  because now i had somebody else who had seen it,  and could attest to the validity of my experience.  i recorded the date and the time that it happened.  i'll never forget it.  i checked the camcorder,  but for some reason nothing was recorded.  im guessing the settings weren't ready for nighttime viewing. i was outside the next few nights,  but it didn't appear again.  i told many people close to me about the experience,  both family and friends,  including our three closest friends,  brian whom i worked with at pepsi and his wife michelle,  and a bricklayer friend of mine name joe.  however,  i could tell that nobody really thought we had seen anything \"unusual\",  with the exception of michelle i think.  that would all change.\r\n\r\n\r\nthird experience\r\n\r\n            the third encounter occurred on november 19 of 2008.  we had moved out of my in-laws house in april of '08.  i left my job as an emt at the end of feburary '08 in exchange for a job for a fellow named al ozment,  who owns usfoam,  a company contracted to put out coal mine fires in north america.  mr. ozment,  who previously was a firefighter in oklahoma,  patented the process to effeciently extinguish fires in underground mines,  as well as recieving a patent for the formula of the foam that they used,  which they also manafactured.  i was offered a handsome salary,  much more than i made on the ambulance,  and a position putting out fires.  as it turned out,  he had only hired me to help finish a firetruck that he was going to enter into a show in indiana,  firing me two months after hiring me,  after all the business with the show truck was done.  i returned to my emt job,  getting re-employed that june with the same company that i had left that febuary.  the silver lining to that experience was that during that short time at usfoam,  one night while shopping at a local dollar store,  i ran into an old bricklayer friend,  joe,   whom i had worked with in masonry out of high school.  we fell out of touch around '01,  and i had always wonderd where he was,  driving by where i knew he had last lived,  but with never any luck.  i feel that if i hadn't left the ambulance position,  my path would have turned out differently and i probably would have never ran into joe.  we moved into a duplex in a town called gladewater, tx,  about 8 miles south of my wifes parents house,  and only about 3 miles south of the house that we had lived in during the first experience.  two duplexes down lived some friends fo ours,  brian and his wife michelle,  whom we had known since i had worked with him at pepsi.  a few times i had poured my case out vohemently to brian, michelle, and joe,  who all politely listened to me,  but afterwards would always try to convince me it was just some kind of manmade aircraft.  so now the stage is set.  there we all were,  all at my duplex on the evening of november 19.  it was around 10:30 or 11:00,  and i was heading to the backdoor of our place to join my wife shelly,  and our friends brian,  michelle,  and joe,  who were all already outside on the back porch.  my back door faces south and our neighbor we shared the duplex with is on the east side us,   as i stepped outside onto our small 8' by 8' concrete pad,  i took one step out,  and with my very next motion, for some reason,  i stretched my neck up and peered back up over the roof,  towards the front side of the house,  which faced north.  as i was doing this,  the other four were continuing to talk about whatever it was they were discussing.   turning my gaze to the northern sky i immediately noticed a solid,  nonblinking light above the northwestern horizon of my rooftop,  which was the size and brightness of an average star in the sky,  that was moving east at a fairly moderate pace.  i was floored.  i shouted for evreyone to look.  now we were all focused on this light moving steadily across the sky.  as the non-blinking light steadily moved east,  we noticed a couple of planes wiht their anti-collision lights blinking that appeated to be passing close to this object.  then we see a much smaller steady red light that briefly appeared near the light.  as the light was now to our right(northeast) and getting close to being out of view,  it did something totally unexpected.  instantly,  in the blink of an eye,  this solid white light was reduced to about half the size and instead of white it was now a bright blue,  dissappearing completely in less than 2 seconds.  i was stunned.  it seemed that whatever it was moved across the sky at the same rate and distance,  and instantly moved very far away ver, very quickly.  as we all stood there,  staring at where the light used to be,  all of us simultaneously telling what we saw,  without even thinking about it,  i whipped my around to the left,  facing west,  while everybody else continued to look north/northeast.  due west,  just above the power lines that ran down the next street over to the west of us,  was this huge cluster of individual yellowish orange lights,  kind of like this:       \r\n                \r\n                                                                                                     ooo\r\n                          ooooo\r\n                         ooooooo\r\n                          ooooo\r\n                           ooo\r\n                                                                                                                                    \r\n                                                                                                                      \r\n                                                                                                                                   \r\n                                                                                                                                  \r\nthe pattern was more of a round shape,  not as linear as the diagram above,  more like a balanced matrix,  and i'm not sure exactly how many individual lights comprised the cluster,  but it was close to the number in the diagram.  i am standing in awe,   taken by this sight.  i remember,  almost in a dazed state,  asking everyone to look over here.  it was like someone had quickly erected some kind of stadium light over there.  my mind was wrestling to decipher what i was seeing.  out of excitement i remember repeatedly saying,  \"ooh,  look over here,  look over here!!!\"  we all stared frozen in awe.  joe broke the silence by saying, \"aw,  thats some kind of tower.\"  i spent many nights outside and never had i seen the hovering cluster of lights,  so i knew that it wasn't any kind of tower.  i told joe this.  the next thing i remember was noticing that the cluster looked like it was rising in the sky.  when i frist saw it it was very low in the sky,  just above the western horizon of the neighbors house,  just above the power lines.  the lights rose for about 20 or 30 seconds.  as it rose it never dimmed or brightened,  nor did it get any bigger or smaller,  which i guess means that it was going straight up,  slightly towards us as it rose.  after it reached its apex,  it starting gradually getting bigger,  as though it was descending towards us.   it isnt realy clear when or how,  but at some point after we noticed it descending,  i dont remember seeing the cluster lights,  but instead two fixed, white,  non-blinking lights on what initialy appeared to be wing tips,  and one single red light,  non-blinking as well,  in the middle of the two white lights,  all appearing to be on the underside of some type of craft coming right at us.  somehow i knew at this point what it was.  i remember falling to my knees,  staring into the sky the whole time,  yelling, \"thats it,  thats it,  watch for the lights, watch the lights,  watch the lights!!!\".  as it approached us at an altitude very close to the altitude it was the first time i had seen it,  the fixed lights seemed to become unnoticable,  and the single red light in the center underneath was now joined with many other single little red and yellow lights,  just like the other encounters.  just like the other visitations the lights did their little shifting \"dance\",  doing patterns different than the ones it did the first two times.  also there wasn't near as many lights this time,  maybe 10 all together.  the same humming/vibratory effect was present.  as we all watched this pass over our heads,  no one said a word,  except me maybe,  i do know i was very excited and remember repeatedly yelling, \"watch the lights!!\".  it passed directly overhead,  slowly started its ascent and within a minute it was gone,  completely out of sight.  now they believed.  no three night flyby this time either.  it was just on the 19th.  i remember a couple of nights later,  for some reason i started thinking about the dates of the encounters,  and began wondering if maybe there was a pattern.  what i discovered was that each time i saw the \"ship\",  it was on a half moon.  i measured the days and found out that it is exactly nine moon cycles between each half-moon occurence.  then,  just recently,  i started thinking on the fact that i had never heard of a ufo case like mine and began researching ufo reports and cases.  i decided that i could use a fresh perspective,   and i would much like to hear what you think.  \r\n

orange disk.\r\n\r\ni took a night picture from were i was standing the night before at 1:30 on the 1st of september. it shows the moon where it should have been on the 31st of august, and where i saw the disk.\r\n\r\nthe disk was at an elevation of 60 degrees from where i was standing and the size of a quarter with my arm stretched out at my fingertips. i was facing south.","distance":"Over One

incident that occured in our area about four months ago? i saw and heard it from norfolk. no clear explanation has ever been given (found) for this mysterious occurence. it was an extremely bright light that was stationary for a bit and then just flashed to the east. once out of view a loud boom was heard across both cities. this was not a sonic boom from military jets. some claimed it was a meteor, but there has been nothing found to prove this. i know what i saw. please let me know if you have heard anything about this. thank you.  \r\n\r\ni was in bed watching tv when i was distracted by a bright light appearing out my window out of my peripheral vision. i did not know what it was, but it was the brightest thing i've ever seen in the sky at night (literally lit up the night sky). it stayed stationary for about 1-2 minutes and then just shot towards the east at an unbelievable rate of speed. then 1-2 minutes later there was a loud boom that the entire region heard (made the news) with no good explanation. i could not believe my eyes or ears, but it was quite obvious it was not a meteor because it stood stationary for a good while.","distance":"Over One

road, and good weather. half way up the hill where my then girlfriend lives i could hear a low pitch humming sound coming from over my head, when i looked up, i saw through the light cloud cover, a rugby ball shape yellowish light, with alot of dim white round lights circuling around it at speed , it was moving very slowly overhead i can remember feeling tingles all over my body and so did my girlfriend it kept moving slowly untill the lights going round it went out and all was left is the rugby ball shape in the middle the humming sound stopped and it just dissapeared., i cant really say how high it was, but my observations at the time then, and looking back at it now i would estimate this thing was alteast 3 football pitches in size.  the next day there were people saying that all the electrics and computers went down at the same time in a few local factories.\r\nand if i remember correctly it was also on the local news the next day, and the explination that was given is that, on the night in question there was a fun fair about 20 or so mies away, and the lights that was seen in the sky was the lights from that fair. i live in a valley, and between where i was and where the fun fair was, id say it was impossible for the lights to reflect of the clouds like they said. the dates i have given is not accurat as it was quite some time ago, the only thing i am certain of is the year and the time, this is because my girlfriend at the time had to be in at 22:30 lol.","distance":"101-500
