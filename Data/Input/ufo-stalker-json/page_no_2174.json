worked night shift.  a front was coming in and it was windy, low clouds moving briskly and cold.  as we stood there smoking our cigaretts, i happed to look past my friends as i saw something moving in the area over the rail yards behind our docks.  at the time it looded to me as a giant foil pillow ballow that you buy, but it was at least 25 feet in diameter.  it was about 600 ft above the lights of the railroad yard, and it was moving in a erratic slow pace as it was fighing the windy conditions.  but then it stopped short of the post office parking lot,changed directions and moved south toward the union terminal.  we watched as it moved toward the terminal, it then stopped directly behind the terminal, as it started to ascend straight up and through the low flying clouds .  we lost sight of it as it entered the clouds, but then the clouds lite up as if the object must have turned into a bright lite.  at this point all we could see was a bright lite through the clouds.  it then reversed direction and traveled directly into the oncoming wind, we watched the illuminated light travel mybe three quarters of a mile back against the wind, it stopped and then started moving directly towards us.  we then got scared and started walking briskly back to the steps of the loading dock.  as we hit the loading dock steps we stopped and looked up at the approaching light, it was almost straight overhead,  i could make a visual sighting of a outline of the lighted object and i noticed that there were three small red lights on the bottom as it passed overhead.  scared and shaken i mumbled to my friend (what the hell was that} as we walked onto the dock he said back to me {you know what it was}.  we told a few friend was we saw, but i didn't say to much to anybody i

standing outside too and said, \"sarah, look at that light!\"  i looked up towards the left and saw a very large white light.  you could tell it was very high up and was not making any noises.  it was moving fast and in a straight line.  no lights were blinking on it like on aircrafts.  was almost perfectly circular but the bottom of it looked like it had a little line of light that extended from the main mass. but was very small in comparision to the ball of light. i also about 10 minutes later saw a shooting star but that was obvious, esp since i have seen those before. this was completely different. moving in straight line, fast but still took maybe three minutes until i lost sight of it as the building blocked its path.  did not appear to blink or twinkle or any flickering.  my first thought was maybe the space station? but each time i've seen that it was much higher and smaller and dimmer.  this was very big in comparison to all the stars up there. largest light in the sky but it was very high up and must have been very large to still look so big. now thats it over i keep thinking about it and picturing it in my head. i have never witnessed anything looking like that and i have a telescope and star watch quite frequently. don't really have much belief in ufo's but this has got me wondering.  going to research to see if there were any meteors or satellites or even the

am currently located in oregon but will be back in indiana around early october, where the incident originally occurred.  \r\n\r\ni remember playing just outside the house on the patio while my mother was in the adjacent kitchen.  i was not allowed to wander too far if she was not with me.  i saw a white-ish/metallic \"airplane\" as i knew it then, because anything in the sky was an airplane at that age.  i don't know where it came from or how long it had been there observing me if it in fact was.  it made no sound so i only noticed it when it became very close.  linear distance from me was probably around 100ft away and the height at which it was hovering was maybe only 20-feet above a large tree in the neighbors yard that it passed directly over.  i recall being fascinated by this because at that age i was afraid of the loud sound airplane and jet engines made and would always run inside or hide next to my parents when a traditional aircraft flew near of any sort.  this craft made no sound, literally no sound, so i was happy to be able to watch an \"airplane\" up close for the very first time.  i wasn't frightened at all and enjoyed the event.\r\n\r\nas it continued at what i would say was a brisk walking pace it eventually crossed over the rural road and continued over an open field.  at that time i saw what i remember to be a ball-shaped object fall from the bottom of the craft and land in the field.  it fell at about the speed any object that was dropped would fall, no slower or faster than gravity.  i moved towards the ball and do not again remember seeing the craft unfortunately, i think i was fixated on picking up part of the \"airplane\".  i know this was real and not a dream or otherwise because to this day i remember the feeling of anxiety in my stomach, not from the object but from crossing the road by myself, something i was never allowed to do at that age, not even to get the mail.  i realized i wasn't supposed to cross the road but my curiosity was overwhelming.  i easily found it, walked up and leaned down to see it closer but have no further recollection of the object and only remember being back on the patio after an unknown amount of time, tho i know it wasn't much later because it wasn't noticeably darker and my mother wasn't worried about me.  i believe i was very young because i knocked on the glass door rather than open it myself, and when my mother slid it open i anxiously told her i saw an airplane and part of it came off.  she humored me for a moment and brought me inside and the event was forgotten.\r\n\r\nthe craft itself was very smooth, i consider it an oval or ellipse, but i have never seen another image of a craft like this one in any ufo shows or photos i have seen.  i say it was different because it had what i later associated as looking most like an antennae mast from an aircraft carrier.  if you haven't seen one of those, it's a large antennae array with many smaller pieces sticking out in all directions, jumbled and looking somewhat unorganized which contrasted with the otherwise smooth and sleek profile of the object.\r\n\r\nlater i had several experiences seeing silhouetted figures in my bedroom door way, and on one occasion i know i tried to scream out to my parents only to feel the attempt being made, but no sound was coming out.  i then passed out, or fell asleep somehow.  the second time i saw a figure was just the silhouette but this time it didn't scare me for some reason and i was much older, probably a teenager.  i just stared at it as it faced me, then again fell asleep quickly for whatever reason.\r\n\r\ni never thought much of this until one night in my 20's when a friend of a friend asked if i ever saw ufo's or aliens and i said \"no\", but said that i would give anything if i could have since both of my sisters had sightings in their lives.  he further questioned if i ever saw any object of any sort or person i couldn't explain which instantly reminded me of these events that had long been forgotten as trivial.  suddenly, through the scope of adulthood, i realized no airplane looks or behaves like that craft, and when questioned, my parents had no explanation for the figures in the house.\r\n\r\ni apologize for not leaving my full details as of yet, but i am unclear as to who the \"third parties\" are that may contact me with my approval.  i would be willing to provide more detail upon clarification and i authorize mufon to contact me directly at the email address provided for said clarification, thank you.  in fact, i would welcome information to help me solve this lifelong riddle.  my sisters may be willing to provide their stories as well, but that would be up to them.  i plan to question my parents if they ever had any sightings when i return to indiana.  i will be residing in the house where the incident happened when i do get back.\r\n\r\ni did find a drawing i made later in life of the craft as i was packing, but it is likely in a moving box at present and i won't have access to it again until october when i complete my move.\r\n","distance":"21-100

production of his documentary film, and i fear that (for geo-political reasons), even if it were to be completed, he would meet with extremely stiff resistance when trying to release it to the cinema circuits (or even tv media) here in the u.S.    oddly enough however, abc television will soon be airing a sci-fi  thriller movie on tv that is primarily based on the facts related to his findings.    in any event, he is beginning to lose heart for his project, and is now skeptical that he will even find anyone who is credible and respected on this subject (here in the states), to even view his material - not to mention support it.    nevertheless, i believe that collaboration between the two of you would be mutually beneficial, and i have included his personal bio and contact info below.            \r\n\r\n\r\nas i���m sure a person of your common sense, deductive reasoning, and logical intellect already knows, the ���official��� story we were given by our government about the events of september 11, 2001 was nothing but lies intended to cover up what really took place that day, and the real motives behind it.    as an independent researcher, investigative journalist, and freelance author, i (along with about 100 other fellow 9/11 truth seeking colleagues around the world) have been comparing notes for the past 8 years, and can now prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that 9/11 was a multi-national covert inter-governmental conspiracy (that was about 25 years in the making) - and was not perpetrated by a bunch of bare-footed cave-dwelling goat-herding moslems (led by a crippled 6' tall one who was actually dragging around a kidney dialysis machine in tow at the time), contrary to what we were told!    the only problem is that, due to the financial/political/influential forces working behind the scenes (and the logistical controls held by the real perpetrators), it has proved almost impossible to bring our fact findings of the real truth to the general public, in an effective widely accessible format that would expose the underlying plot to the american masses, ample enough to spur the wheels of real justice into motion.    the biggest problem is that the real perpetrators have been acting under the disguise of being major friends and allies of the u.S.;   and in recent decades, members of their organization have infiltrated so much of our society that they now control most of our media - and regulate its content.    \r\n\r\n\r\nwhile we in the 9/11 truth movement are now prepared to present overwhelming evidence of just exactly ���who done it��� (as they are commonly known, in ���earthly��� terms), and why they did it (from an ���earthly��� perspective),... obtaining a massive public forum from which to present our evidence has thus far been illusive.    while the powers that be currently maintain full control over our network tv, radio, and newspaper media; they don���t yet own all of the book publishing companies, nor have they yet gotten a complete handle on the internet.    while the later two venues still offer an outlet for such controversial material to see the light of day, only about half of the american public has the ability to access it, or the propensity to seek it.    i personally will soon be releasing 5 books that break 9/11 down into 5 relatively easy-to-digest categories:  (a comprehensive expansive time-line of related events, a book of quotes and other official admissions, a book containing more than 1000 questions that were side-lined by the 9/11 commission, a book presenting documented evidence and scientific facts that conflict directly with the official story, and a book outlining the motives of many of the major players - stopping short of mentioning any possible et affiliations *for obvious reasons*), but i fear that these books will fall into too few hands to do any significant good.    \r\n\r\n\r\nbe that as it may, the reason why i wrote to you is not to debate this issue, but rather because one of my recent colleagues has shown new light on this subject that seems to be much more in your ball park than in mine, as his evidence seems to indicate very strongly that, while the 9/11 truth research network has nailed down the international group who was really responsible for most such atrocities throughout our history, we still had no idea exactly who (or perhaps ���what���) these entities really were.    \r\n\r\n\r\naccording to my russian colleague, ���they��� are in fact hybrid alien humanoids of extra-terrestrial origin, who have been steadily and secretly evolving among us for centuries.     \r\n\r\n\r\nobviously, i���m not about to go anywhere near mentioning that in any of my books, for three reasons.    first of all, it is going to be hard enough for most mainstream americans to swallow the fact that a supposed long-time friend of our nation was actually just using us for evil purposes the entire time, and caused elements within our government to attack our own country - let alone sugesting to them that these imposters are also ets!    secondly, except for the proof recently offered by my russian colleague, i found no previous evidence that suggested any such thing, and consequently have no other previous documentation to support it - possibly because none of the rest of us were ever specifically looking for it.    and third, from a prosecutorial standpoint, the ancestral origin of a criminal element should have no baring on the preponderance of evidence against that criminal element, nor the prosecution, conviction, and punishment sentencing thereof.    however, this does not mean that this is an insignificant matter (actually, quite to the contrary), but swift accurate justice would certainly be hampered (if not totally avoided) if we in the rest of the 9/11 truth community began to prepare a prosecution case based along those lines at this early stage.        \r\n\r\n\r\nwhile his evidence appears to be quite solid, i will also admit that much of it is in areas of science that are a bit above my paygrade - so to speak.    because of my inability to fully comprehend some of the science behind his findings, and due to my reluctance to publicize it in my efforts to spur the convening of a new and totally truly independent 9/11 investigation (unhampered by anything that might be construed as being ridiculous or ���outlandish���), i will be of no significant help to my russian colleague - but you might be !\r\n\r\n\r\nthe name of this researcher is dr. vladimir gouliaev, and

investigation, but i wanted to add mine in the hope that maybe you had found an answer to what it was in the sky that night. even though it took place over 13 years ago it stills resonates in my head as if it happened yesterday. i have searched for a solid answer to no avail. any way here is my story.\r\n\r\n myself and two friends were driving down lincoln blvd. heading west at about 20th street. at that point i caught a large group of lights out of the right corner of my eye. i said to the other two people in my car \"do you guys see that?\" at which they responded \"yes!\" i slowed the car down and made a right onto 18th street which is a dead end road. there were several other cars pulled on to the street with the people outside of their vehicles and looking up. myself and my two passengers jump out of my truck and looked up as well. the object that i saw was huge. bigger than anything i had ever seen in the sky before or since. it was a boomerang/ diamond shape with lights at each point. the lights were bright like baseball field lights. everybody stood there silent just staring with the occasional \"what is that?\" being muttered. the strangest part was that it made absolutly no noise. i am not a rocket scientist but anything the length of two or more football fiels propell itself through the air should at the very least make some sort of sound. but there was nothing. after about 30-35 seconds there was great big \"woosh\" sound and the lights immediatly went out. the after glow from the lights lasted for about 5 seconds, like after a camera flash blinds you. then all you could see was the sillouette of the object. still heading in the same direction towards the north edge of squaw peak to a place called dreamy draw. dreamy draw is now the place that state route 51 runs to the north part of the valley. it never picked up speed which i approximate at 40-50 mph. it finally disappeared behind the north slope of squaw peak. everybody at that point got in their cars and simply drove away. my friends and i talk about it all night with each other. it wasn't until later on, maybe a month later were even heard abot the phoenix lights. the pictures that they printed in the paper and the video the news broadcasted were not the lights that i saw that night. not even close. there was a woman in town, a doctor, that made a documentry of the phoenix lights event. i went to go see it but she made it into some spiritual encounter that we all took part in. for me it was something unexplainable. and it has racked every bit of logic that i have in my body. anyway if you have any answers i would greatly appreciate them. and vice versa if you have any more questions for me please ask.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time,\r\npreston brown\r\n

neighborhood corner store that evening. we were only about 2 blocks from my house, when i looked back right behind us and seen a ufo. it was very low to the ground literally just above the tree line and during the few seconds we was looking at it, it was perfectly still!! when we both realized what it was we both started to panic and turned back toward my house and ran. when we got to my house my mother and step-father was sitting outside on the porch. we ran all the way and asked them did they see that... my step-father say's see what?  i said a ufo!! he sarcasticly said yes. but later admited they seen nothing, they thought we were screwing around i guess. my mother said we were gone for much longer than we whould have been and thats why they were waiting outside. i cant even begin to say how long we were gone but it was almost dark out when we got home and we only walked 2 blocks from my house. we really didnt have any in depth discussion about what we seen about that until about 5 yrs later. infact i guess over time i even started to second guess what we seen until we had talked about again years later. now i am 30 yrs old and have another strange story to tell you about. about 3 yrs ago, i went to the dr. because my shoulder was bothering me. they took an x-ray and when the dr. came in to look at the x-rays with me, he said something very strange to me. he said exactly this to me.. \"i have a question to ask you and you dont have to tell me if you dont want to, but what is this?\" he pointed to the x-ray at a round quarter shaped thing in my arm. i looked at it and said \"i have no idea, you tell me\" then he acted strangely like i didnt wanna tell him or something and didnt say anything else about it. it took some time for me to digest what i saw and

i did not want to become part of a joke. i did have a good friend that lived not too far away from where i saw the object. i told him some basic information; without telling him the whole account, at first. he told me that, at that time, for about the last two years, people saw strange sightings over the stepple of an old church on highway 29. this is where i saw the object. the open field is across from the church. i know that a lot people have reported seeing triangluar objects; but i was wondering if anybody ever reported seeing what i saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":19017,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.8271951,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09012009-0021","longitude":-89.1695568,"occurred":1120124400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,   Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1251848628000,"summary":"Large rectangual-shaped object, the size of a small car,the color of a deer","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1524,"locationName":"Wittenberg, Wisconsin","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:193668"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Burnsville","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"    i was home frome work. having a beer on my front pourch, like i'd done on many night where the weather was good. i was a natural star gazer. not a proffesional astraunomer. i just used to look up and wonder if any other life is really out there. i got up from my chair, and started looking at the stars, because the night was so clear.\r\n    i was looking up for about 3-4 min and i saw what looked like a star moving across the sky. i thought, is that a shooting star? no. i said shooting stars are burn by really fast and burn out. then i thought it's a sattelite orbiting the earth. but with that though the star started to move in the other direction. i thought that was funny. so i went into the house and told my wife at the time to come and take a look at this. after i had been watching for a while. she came out and we both relocated the star looking object in the sky and started looking at it. \r\n    some how we lost the star looking object in the sky, so we started to look around to see if we could relocate this small object. as we turned our heads and bodies completey to the  other direction we saw a rounded   triangular shaped object from the bottom. it was almost directly over us.It was a dark metalic lookng craft with circular looking vents maybe. they appeared to be in the closed position. this craft showed no lights at all. it was close enough to us that if i had taken my beer bottle and tossed it up i would have hit this object. the triangular shaped object moved by us very slowly, very close, and with no sound what so ever. all we heard was a slight russel of the leaves on the trees. we both ran in the house checked on our child and i don;t kow about my ex-wife now but i have never looked into the sky the same. i regret not having a video camera or something back then.  my time and date of sightting maybe 1998 or 1999 around sept-nov   it has been so long that i don't fully remember. lots of things have changed in my life since then and i just have not kept good records for anthing.  so thats my story. thanks. call me with any questions.

15th my wife woke up and asked me if i had to work that day (sat.), i replied yes, but i didn't have to be to work until 7 am.  she took sasha (one of 3 pet dogs) downstairs and let them out for their morning potty (she remained downstairs on the couch).  at 5:30 am my phone alarm went off (i looked at the phone and it said it was 5:30 am).  i went downstairs and tuned the tv to the weather channel to get the \"local on the 8's\" (approx. 5:34 am).  i forgot to grab my ipod so i went back upstairs to retrieve it, subsequently missing the 6:38 time of local on the 8's.  i watched the 5:48 time, after which i kissed my wife goodbye (i awakened her briefly for that).  i estimate i left the house at about 5:50 am.  as i was driving north on blaine street, approaching highway 34, i noticed what i thought was a commercial jet heading east, off to my left (west), behind it was a white light following and passed the jet like it was standing still.  at that time i was thinking to myself that either i was witnessing a ufo event, or i was seeing an airforce jet that \"doesn't exist\".  as i approached the intersection i tried to \"look past\" the street lights there to continue observing the light, but what i saw was what appeared to be to white lights, kind of oval shaped, not blinding, but i couldn't see past them (at the time i just figured that it was the street lights, and continued on my way to a local restaurant that was about 2 miles from my home).  approximately 3 or 4 blocks from the restaurant my cell phone alarm went off, and when i pulled it from my front pocket (i was wearing bib overalls) it said it was 5:30 am.  i went on to the restaurant where my cell phone time matched the time at the restaurant.  it was several days later when i realized the the street lights were the sodium arc type and not white as i remembered.  there is no way that i can prove what happened, but i swear on a stack of bibles that is exactly what happened.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path then

days, we proceeded to scan the sky for anomalies.  a very bright silver-white flash caught my eye in the ne corner of sky in the area of cassiopeia.  like the ct witness, i thought it was likely just a plane strobe, but then realized there were no other standard nav lights.  i then asked her to check this thing out, and we both perceived it was moving steadily in a ne direction and pulsating at regular intervals.  unlike the ct person, we couldn't see any other regular pin point of light or other object d\\t city lights.  my estimate was that it pulsated every 10-12 seconds for about 6-7 times, then left our view.  i have no idea at what height it traveled.  i would say it moved faster than most satellites i've seen or the iss, which was nowhere near us at that time.\r\n\r\nthis will probably be found to be a new type of satellite or maybe space debris.  but i've never seen one that flashed this brightly at regular intervals and there was no burn trail that one would expect with
