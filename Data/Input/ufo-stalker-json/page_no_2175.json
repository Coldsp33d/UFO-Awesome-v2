colorado my wife and i noticed a large brightly lit object low to the ground. i was in my car headed to work and she was right behind in her car. for about 5 miles we take the same way to work and she turns off while i keep going another 14 miles to my job.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw this object it had just made a slow sweeping right turn to position itself directly over the road heading our direction. it was so bright i immediately knew it was no aircraft i have ever witnessed. \r\n\r\nas i looked i realized there were no wings on this flying object. it appeared to me to be just a large roundish mass but i could not make out any particular details with the bright light. i noticed some red lights and blue lights but was not certain of the position of the lights on the craft.\r\n\r\nat 5:20am this time of year it was still quite dark outside and this round object was very brightly lit with an intense white light. the white light was so intense it drowned out the smaller lights on the sides and top of the craft.\r\n\r\ni slowed down to take a look and rolled my window down. by this time it was about 2 or 3 blocks ahead of me coming directly towards us. \r\nthis craft made no sound at all and i was expecting to hear an engine.  i would estimate the diameter of this round object 100-150 feet across as it was wider than the road and it could not have been more than 100 feet above the road. \r\n\r\nall of a sudden i lost interest, rolled up window and got back to the speed limit on the road. i had no thoughts of ufos or objects coming down the road at a low altitude. i looked in my mirror and saw my wife had slowed way down and i had gotten ahead of her several blocks. \r\n\r\ni wondered why she was so far behind so i slowed down to let her catch up. i continued to work and did not know about any ufo or having seen one.\r\nmy wife had waited and watched with her head out the window as this craft slowly moved over her car going the opposite direction at a low altitude and slow speed. \r\n\r\nshe describes it as perfectly round with a domed top and several different lights on different parts of the craft. i had her draw a picture of this craft and the locations of the lights and she clearly remembers one red light on each the widest points of the craft and a blue light along the domed top on each side. \r\n\r\nafter the craft passed over her she increased her speed to catch up to me. we did not see each other but she called me at work about 30 minutes later to tell me about the round ufo that passed over her car while she watched it outside the window. \r\n\r\ni told her it was a plane; we did not see a ufo. she repeated the size and shape and all of a sudden i remembered seeing it and i knew it was not an ordinary aircraft. \r\naircraft can���t fly that slowly. aircraft can���t fly in silence as engines make noise when under power. \r\n\r\naircraft have wings, this object had no wings. aircraft don���t usually fly down a road in the city low like this. too many things don���t add up for this to be any normal aircraft. and if our government has round domed top aircraft it���s new to me. not to mention completely being completely silent and able to defy gravity.\r\n\r\naircraft have stall speeds, (except helicopters) the speed at which the object will fall like a rock. i���m glad it did not fall like a rock with us under it. it certainly defied gravity whatever it was.\r\n\r\nthe strangest part of this to me is after seeing this object and knowing full well it was no aircraft that flies at such a slow speed and this close to the ground and with no noise at all that i just forgot about it. \r\ni can���t figure out why as soon as i was about 2 blocks from it and we were closing speed that my memory lapsed and i forgot about it until my wife called me at work and reminded me. \r\n\r\nat first i was very excited as i had not seen a ufo this close to the ground since about 1963 in washington dc.  but as i got closer to it my memory just disappeared and i completely forgot about it until 30 minutes later. had my wife not called and reminded me i may not have recalled it at all. \r\nanother strange part of this is i take my camera with me all the time and it was laying on the seat next to me and the thought to take it out and get a photograph never entered my mind.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

gliding over hollywood heading east towards the hollywood sign and hills (moving to the left as i was viewing it).  i have seen video footage of triangle lights like this before, but never thought i would see one myself.   i almost thought i saw a reflection of the entire triangle's surface as it tumbled through the sky gracefully over the edge of the city...  it almost appeared as if it was 90%

were seeing it too.\r\n\r\ni thought maybe these were helicopters but the lights were too bright and constant.   i've seen plenty of helicopters in la and i know the difference... and i know these things covered a good distance pretty quickly.   these things connected, glided and tumbled and made movements that are not what a helicopter is capable of or that three would ever do together...

to move a maintenance road gang in the summer of 2001.  we were called for 2:30am and made our way out of the yard within the hour.  around mile 28 on the wacouna subdivison, i noticed 2 triangular shaped objects in the sky at around 4:30 am.  the objects were identical in size and shape, and completely stood out from the few stars that could be seen at the time.\r\n\r\npuzzled by these objects, i mentionned this to my colleague who was equally dumbfounded.  we actually stopped the locomotives in order to get a better grasp of what we were seeing.  he took out a pair of binoculars and we watch these objects hover above us.  the binoculars gave us a glowing perspective of the lights above us.  they seemed to be slowly moving while keeping the identical pattern.  we observed them for a few minutes, then decided to make our way north before the dispatch called us.\r\n\r\ni wrote the whole episode off, until i saw an article in a french magazine a few months later.  my colleague agreed that the pics looked eerily quite similar to what we had seen.  then last week, i stumbled upon a discovery channel episode (28/08/09) concerning events in pensylvania that were quite similar to what we saw that morning.  i took it upon myself to relate to you this eye witness in the hope that it may correlate any other odd sightings.\r\n\r\nwe never witnessed anything like the sediment

(this actually frightened my 14 year old daughter because she believed they were \"watching\" us). aprox 10-20 min after the first craft left sight the remaining 2 slowly left in oppisite directions, 1 to the east, 1 to the west. i took several pictures and video with my phone camera but the resolution was so poor nothing showed up upon review. i did not bring along a quality camera because i was expecting to only be viewing meteors, which are too fast and too unpredictibal to catch on camera unless your really lucky.\r\n  feelings or reactions after the sightings? i was elated, bieng a devout ufologist, my daughter was at first amazed having never seen a ufo, but then became worried and now does not talk about it, trying to convince herself what she saw was a star or planet.

went out to his large, grassy back year. i looked up at the overcast sky and saw a perfect triangular shaped hole in the clouds 1-200 metres above and around 50 metres ahead of me. the hole was slowly moving with the clouds in my general direction. the thought jokingly crossed my mind that this could be a hole for a ufo to enter through. within the space of 5 seconds after this thought a clock-wise spinning black triangular shaped object entered at a 45 degree angle from above the clouds near, but exactly through, the above mentioned hole in the clouds. it stopped just as it had made it below the clouds for a moment, then spun in reverse (anti-clockwise) and moved away retracing the  path it had arrived on. the sighting took a total of about 2-3 seconds. it was'nt until the object had stopped spinning that i could see it was a triangle, as while it was spinning down from above, it had resembled a boomerang in flight.\r\n\r\nthe event was over so quickly that i didnt have much time to respond emotionally or intellectually. i just observed it passively and was left somewhat bewildered as i had never heard of a triangular ufo. also, the fact that i had \"thought\" it first, seemed

half forgot about for the rest of the evening, only pondering it further when i was later alone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in 1995, my little brother and i were recounting our life as kids over a beer at college. he mentioned my fasination with spiderman as a kid, specifically when we lived in oh. i instantly recalled a strange thing that happened to me. i got excited and my little brother confirmed he remembered my story. i made him recount the story that i knew so well, but wanted to see if he recalled the reason why i was so in to \"spiderman\". i don't think i told anyone else of this story and i know he had not heard this story since he was 6 to 7 years old. winter/fall evening of 1978; dayton, oh; sugar creek area. my father a well respected naval intelligence insider and test pilot was working at the time on secret aviation things at a nearby afb, he has admitted only that he worked on things that required \"reverse engineering\". he is a technology and intelligence community insider. i am in the military currently, so names are not an option today. what happened was: i was playing on the floor near a second story window, i was 6yrs old. my little brother was in a half body cast from a broken leg. i noticed a small grey \"balloon\" hovering outside the window. everytime i looked at this shape, it went down below the window sill out of my sight. finally, i asked my little brother \"do you see that balloon?\". as i got him turned around to look, (he was not mobile, i had to shift him) \"it\" was gone. then, something went vertical past the window in a blurr. as i watched and stared, i got very scared, this \"balloon\", peaked in from over the window. it had eyes. it quickly retreated back upwards and i didn't see it again. i ran to the window yelling \"spiderman, spiderman!\" all i saw outside was the large oak-tree branch just outide the window. i recall it was getting dark/dusk. i am writing this story becasuse all of us should think about the unexpalined in our lives and try to make sense of it. my neighbor years later told me that they had seen lights in the corn field that was in my backyard that year. i believe i had seen something watching me, something in the tree, and it was not an owl, and it was not spiderman. i also believe that my father knows something about the ufo phenomenon because since 1995 i have been able to get him to talk about things, and he has reluctantly told me that he did meet the men in black during the time of my story. someday i will find out why he \"can't answer\" my questions...I'll be sure to share what i learn.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18974,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7685678,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08312009-0003","longitude":-84.1874069,"occurred":276073200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1251716227000,"summary":"Years
