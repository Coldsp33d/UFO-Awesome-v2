regular airplane (i believe it to be one since it had green and red lights like one and flew like one) which \r\nwas very high up and as i was watching it... what appeared to be 1 or 2 smaller bright white round lights showed up around it but i couldn't tell if they came from it or if they were way high above it or what since \r\nthey were going so quickly. in my opinion, these lights were surely ufo related because i have never seen anything like it before. \r\ni called to my daughter and pointed up (not taking my eyes off of this) saying, \"i wonder if the plane sees it! am i seeing what i think i'm seeing... what do you see?\" she looked up and said, \"it's a light doing \r\nfigure eights zipping around real fast, oh my god...It's a ufo!.\" she says it was 1 light but i thought it was 2 because it looked that way to me since the light was zipping so fast. my sight is much poorer than hers, but i am positive that i saw ufo activity. \r\nthe airplane flew off normally, but the light stayed as it was when i first saw it, making a couple zig zags at first and then several semi circular patterns in what seemed like a small span of space until it just \r\ndisappeared. \r\nif you stand outside and point up into the sky and make a letter \"c\" (both forward and backward) with your pointer finger a few times in a row very fast... this is about the span of measurement it works out to be while looking up. that is a good example to me because i'm not good at determining these distances. \r\nthis is the first time either of us ever saw anything \"weird\" like \r\nthis. it's my estimate that the whole thing lasted about 10-20 seconds. we waited about 15 more minutes in case it came back but we didn't see anything else. i searched on my computer right away for local area sightings and hadn't seen anything. thanks for the chance to report \r\nit.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

northgate blvd. when i first saw it. it was well above the horizon to the north of me, hovering motionless. \r\n2. the object caught my eye because sunlight was glinting off of it.\r\n3. i don't recall thinking it was anything...By that i mean it didn't look like anything familiar such as an airplane, bird, blimp, balloon or anything else. my only thought was \"what the heck is that?\"\r\n4. the object was silvery/metallic. cigar shaped but rounded and tapered at both ends. sunny cloudless sky. the object was to my north well above the visible horizon, trees, streetlights, etc. truthfully, i can't say how far off it was. the object could have been small and very close, or huge and very far away. \r\nthe object appeared to be hovering, motionless.\r\n5. i was confused/curious as to what the object was. as i said, it didn't resemble\r\nanything i could chalk it up to. i turned east onto lathrop rd. and continued viewing the object out my open left side window, still apparently hovering.\r\n6. this is what weirded me out. it took off to the east in a blur. i mean, it went from completely motionless to moving at a rate of speed i won't even try to estimate. it didn't accelerate like anything i've ever seen. you know, something begins to move and picks up speed at a constant rate. it just took off like a bullet from a complete standstill. again, it was a blur, heading east and just disappeared in a second. i turned north into my church parking lot and looked around but saw no sign of it. the kids didn't see it. they were spaced off looking in other directions. i never spoke up to point out the object. by the time it occured to me to do so, the object was gone. the whole experience from beginning to end lasted perhaps a minute, maybe two at the most.\r\n\r\n  what the heck was that??? i'm a commercial driver. i've spent most of my adult life outside/driving in every concievable weather condition. i'm 38 years old. i've seen odd things in the sky...Particularly at night driving through the desert. i've always chalked it up to far off aircraft, meteors, military activity, moonlight on an unusual cloud formation, etc. this was in broad daylight. i'm not crazy. i don't do drugs. i'm not a conspiracy/ufo nut. all i'm saying is i saw something utterly inexplicable. it bugs me...

the stop sign i noticed a red light i thought it was a plane or sumthing. i turned left still keeping my eye on it cuz i figured a plane would have flashing light so it was different looking. i couldnt tell the distance until it moved. i drove a lil futher maybe 150 yards looking back at it.  then i realized it was over the baseball field about 60 yards from the stop sign i was at. i stoped my car right away and got out. it was still hovering over the b-ball field. i listened closly i was wondering if it was a small helicopter... it made no sound at all.  the light pulsed with with no certain rythem. it also would go out completly then turn back on. i watched it hover very slowly to the left & then it started in my direction but never got closer than 100 yards maybe a little less. i could not see a shape just light. it made circular movements going back & forth. from left to right slowly. i call my mom who works for the police dept. she called a officer on duty. i drove to the high school which is by my house to get closer to the object. as i enter the parking lot it went south farther away from me. about the same distance from me sitting on the road. i knew at this point it was awear of my presence & interest. i decided to see if it was for sure so i started driving my car back & forth through the parking lot. this light followed my every move. i would stop quickly & it stoped on a dime. i would set for a second then reverse quickly then stop. it was moving exactly as i was. it would hover in one spot when i was setting still. the officer came to the school & seen it himself. hes said it was  a helicopter in stealth mode. but he & i drove towards it he took the big light on his car shining it at the object driving towards it. it was keeping distance from us. when he left being a bit sceptical he said \"i dont know what it is\". i stayed for a bit longer then decided to go to the store. as i drove away from the school it followed me followed me bout quarter mile. i made my way back towards my house when i turned onto pioneer lane towards the school. i could see it still over the school. i went back to the school & continued seeing if it would copy me & it did.  i was interested in see more of it. i drove to the back on the parking lot where it was really dark nothing around. i turned my car off. at this time it was about 80 yards or so south of me & about 100ft of the ground hovering in one spot. there was no sound at all, it changed it light to a soft white,yellow color not super bright. about the same strenght as the red i would say. i got out of my car turning my engine if & lights. i walked about 30 feet from my car towards it & didnt move. i was scared to go any closer. i stayed back there staring at it for another 10 mins

the stop sign i noticed a red light i thought it was a plane or sumthing. i turned left still keeping my eye on it cuz i figured a plane would have flashing light so it was different looking. i couldnt tell the distance until it moved. i drove a lil futher maybe 150 yards looking back at it.  then i realized it was over the baseball field about 60 yards from the stop sign i was at. i stoped my car right away and got out. it was still hovering over the b-ball field. i listened closly i was wondering if it was a small helicopter... it made no sound at all.  the light pulsed with with no certain rythem. it also would go out completly then turn back on. i watched it hover very slowly to the left & then it started in my direction but never got closer than 100 yards maybe a little less. i could not see a shape just light. it made circular movements going back & forth. from left to right slowly. i call my mom who works for the police dept. she called a officer on duty. i drove to the high school which is by my house to get closer to the object. as i enter the parking lot it went south farther away from me. about the same distance from me sitting on the road. i knew at this point it was awear of my presence & interest. i decided to see if it was for sure so i started driving my car back & forth through the parking lot. this light followed my every move. i would stop quickly & it stoped on a dime. i would set for a second then reverse quickly then stop. it was moving exactly as i was. it would hover in one spot when i was setting still. the officer came to the school & seen it himself. hes said it was  a helicopter in stealth mode. but he & i drove towards it he took the big light on his car shining it at the object driving towards it. it was keeping distance from us. when he left being a bit sceptical he said \"i dont know what it is\". i stayed for a bit longer then decided to go to the store. as i drove away from the school it followed me followed me bout quarter mile. i made my way back towards my house when i turned onto pioneer lane towards the school. i could see it still over the school. i went back to the school & continued seeing if it would copy me & it did.  i was interested in see more of it. i drove to the back on the parking lot where it was really dark nothing around. i turned my car off. at this time it was about 80 yards or so south of me & about 100ft of the ground hovering in one spot. there was no sound at all, it changed it light to a soft white,yellow color not super bright. about the same strenght as the red i would say. i got out of my car turning my engine if & lights. i walked about 30 feet from my car towards it & didnt move. i was scared to go any closer. i stayed back there staring at it for another 10 mins i think. it went slowly south after that. ive seen it one more time about a month ago. also my mother & i seen a day time ufo here about a month ago.  she got a very good look at it. she called me &

sitting there. 15 minutes went by and my wife came out and stood next to me. i said , do you see that light? she said yes.\r\nthen i asked , is it moving ? she said no . so now i confirmed that what i was seeing was what i was seeing. i said, ok!       a few minutes went by and\r\nit started moving in our direction. i asked again, is that moving to you?\r\nshe said, yes!  we just stood there infatuated and captivated at what ever it\r\nwas , and coming in our direction ,very very slow! as it got closer all i could think of , what is that!!!! i could not put it in any catagory.It seemed my mind was stuck on , what is that . thats all i could think of.\r\nnow it is real close and we both started walking toward the back of our house\r\nslowly all while this thing floated slowly closer and closer toward us.\r\ni kept saying over and over to my wife , what is that? when it got almost above our heads we could not see a shape , all we could see is a bright light\r\ninfront and a couple of re lights around the bottom and back. none were blinking and it had to of matched the sky , cause we could not see a shape\r\nat all. and all this 30 feet above our heads. also the craft ,what ever it was made no noise at all ! then as it got maybe 10feet passed us as we were\r\nlooking at it, all of a sudden we were looking at eachother in the same spot\r\nbut the thing had disapeared . it was like something was missing. we walked back into the house slowly and just kept asking what was that? and her saying\r\ni don't know to my questioning of what was that. the best way i can describe \r\nit , it was like i was in a dream , but not , and totally dismayed!!!\r\nvery blase' , we came in the house sat down and started watching tv. and\r\nclouded asked every once in awhile , what was that? \r\n                   the more i always thought about it the more strange it gets. it actually had the power to go that slow with no sound and did something to us to make us not know what happened. because we, my wife and i,\r\ncan not finish the story. we can not finish the story of then it kept going\r\nand took off in so and so direction or anything. we just can't finish the story.

approximately 10:10 pm i noticed an object in the sky, upon first glance it seemed like a star twinkling in the distance.  there was an unusual red / green coloration to the object which attracted my attention enough to retrieve binoculars.  with closer inspection the binoculars revealed that the lights of the object were in a triangular pattern of red / green / amber.  i called my wife to look at the object using another set of binoculars.  she confirmed that there were actually lights in a triangular pattern.  during this time (elapse 15 minutes) the object remained motionless at 302��� (nnw) from my original vantage point.   we observed the object jointly for about thirty minutes relocating to a nearby field to obtain a better view.  several aircraft passed close by our position, while the object remained motionless 20��� off the visible horizon.  retiring to the house i re-observed the object at fifteen minute intervals, always noting that it was in the same position.  at approximately 1:30 am the object dramatically changed, revealing three solid amber lights and a white strobe light (one second interval).  after observing this for some time i returned to the house.  upon returning for the last look (2:30 am), the object had reverted to its original lighting scheme of red / green / amber.  the object never moved directionally during the entire viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequipment used:\r\nbinocular m-17 artillery field glasses 7x50 \r\njason model 1111 mercury 7x35

going south on hwy 149.  my girlfriend was driving and i was sitting shotgun.  like i said, it was a new capming spot and neither of us have been on this highway before.  \r\n\r\nthe road was going straight towards a medium sized hill, and then the road turned left of the hill.  just to the right and above the hill is where i saw the ufo.  what made me notice it was that it was shiny.  the sun was just about to set, and the ufo was shinning bright orange from the sun.  i think it had a silver/metallic exterior.  it appeared to be disc/orb shaped.  it was flatter on the bottom and more rounded on the top.  i looked away from it atleast three differnt times, to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me.  i thought it was a cloud, but it most definately was not a cloud.  at that time, there were actually several jets that were flying in the distance. all of them were emitting jet streams and were clearly moving.  this was not moving!  it was hovering above the hill in complete stillness. i wanted to document it with video, but it was somewhat far away.  and i knew you wouldn't be able to see much on video, from the distance we were at.  but, the road turned which made me unable to see the ufo anymore.    \r\n\r\nso, we kept driving; hoping that the road would go back around to the other side of the hill; which would have put us closer to the ufo.  but unfortuantely, the road went to the left of the hill, and kept going left, into a canyon.
