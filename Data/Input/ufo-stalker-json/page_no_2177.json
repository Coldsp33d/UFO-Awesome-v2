somewhere in the middle of the everglades, we spotted ahead of us and off to the side of the highway a beam of sparkles (or 'glitter', as i just saw a lady on the discovery channel describe it as).  i have always recounted this event as calling them sparkles, as if they were sparklers from those stick sparklers that you lite and hold in your hand, or sometimes i have seen them in a birthday cake. \r\n\r\n we saw this on the right side of the highway, approx. 100 yards from the highway. we had no idea at all what it is we were looking at, apart from it being sparkly things slowly falling from the sky in a similar fashion as snowflakes might fall from the clouds. we immediately pulled the car over and got out and watched. there were 2-3 other cars that also pulled over and had got out to watch. there was no sound at all coming from whatever was up above. there was nothing visible at all that would indicate where the beam of sparkles was emminating from, ie: a ufo craft of any sort. i estimate the beam of sparkles to be about 75-100 yards high. everyone that had pulled over and was standing beside there vehicles were all saying to each other, \"what the heck is that??\"  the sparkles seemed to almost be in a structured cylindrical 'beam' which i would guess to be about 15 feet in circumference. at first the beam was stationary, maybe for a minute or two, then it slowly started to drift towards the highway and behind our vehicle. it drifted for about 30 seconds with a full beam of sparkles still falling, at which point it crossed the highway. at one point the stream of sparkles seemed to be disrupted, as if the beam was momentarily broken, but within a few seconds it continued as a full beam again. we stood and watched it as it continued to slowly drift further away, pausing briefly once or twice, until either the beam vanished completely or had gone out of eye sight. the entire event took place over a period of 4- 5 minutes.  we stood there dumbfounded asking everyone what that was!  soon after we got back in our car and continued on to miami, all the while in amazement as to what we just witnessed and quizzing each other as to what it was we just saw.\r\n\r\nthe striking thing besides the sparkles was that there was no sound at all, none!\r\n\r\nonce back at our hotel, we questioned each other about whether that was something we should report to someone.  ultimately we did not report it.  i have told this story many times to people over the years, and am totally convinced that what we saw was something not of this world.\r\n\r\nafter watching the discovery program on tv tonight and hearing the lady on the show talk about the 'glitter' falling down and onto the tree in her backyard (then rising back up again), i knew she and i had witnessed the very same thing, (with the exception being that what i saw never rose back up into the sky).","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18939,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":25.7909189,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292009-0003","longitude":-80.2168693,"occurred":512640000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":512640000000,"summary":"Driving

came back in and asked if i saw the ufo. i was like what? so i went out to the front of the house and saw an orange ballish object going through the sky from the east heading west. i told george to grab my recorder and i shot as much of it as i could in a short period of time. it appeared to be somewhat round but yet somewhat oval or fireish. it traveled at a basic normal speed and did not appear to be to high in the sky, not more than a plane might be but did not have any flashing lights but did appear to be fluctuating to a point. it was deffinetly not a plane or jet, as ohare airport is the pattern it was coming from i questioned myself but knew it could not be a plane unless it was on fire. i watch a lot at night as they fly over daily or nightly as it were. the film i have just shows a white light in the night sky as it disappeared into the clouds. i am sure that enhansment would bring out the true color as we observerd that night. i resently called our county sheriff to see if there were any reports that night but only the usual illegal fireworks going on. the only thing i have is the shots i took and george as seeing them as well. but trust me, i gre w up in indiana as a kid and i can say, this isn't the first for me. i cant send photos as it is an old recorder that apparently itsn't compatable to my pc. but if i can figure out how to do i will or u may pick up thr

looking for the predicted cloud cover to move in,i had a fishing trip planned for (o dark 30)the next morning and needed to know weather to pack my rain outfit it looked to be clear,but i needed a better view because of the overhead awning. \r\n the steps on my back yard deck face west and i walked towards them to check on the dog and get a better look at the sky. that's when an object caught my eye in the western sky about 30 degrees above the horizon. at first i thought it was a low a/c or maybe a helicopter because of the flashing red,green,and brite white lights. being a retired united

case they seemed to the naked eye to be  moving all over the place. i then went into the house and got my binoculars(10 x 50) and checked the object out again thru them,again they appeared to be all moving around,i needed a little more magnification to be able to make out what i was seeing so i went back in and got my 30x spotter scope with them i got a good look at what was going the red,green and white lights started moving into a vertical counter clock wise circle facing my direction around a very bright center white light, they were moving like a ferris wheel, then i knew it was no conventional a/c with nav. lights like that. they then went horizontal like the rings of the planet saturn then into a gyroscope configuration spinning and rotating. i watched the object for a good 20 min's. before it moved further of to the west and then it was gone.It did not appear to be more then 5 miles away, its hard to tell the altitude, about 30 degrees above the horizon, maybe 5000ft. i

we are always outside in the middle of the night because we wake up early and can't go back to sleep so we just get up and go outside with a ciggarete and watch the stars. we feel very weird to have seen so many things in our area. that's why we really didn't want to report them but my husband said we should so maybe you could research the night sky that night and maybe have a logical explination. i don't know what else to tell you but we did see this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":18911,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.4778321,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272009-0004","longitude":-122.3222875,"occurred":1251369600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1251369600000,"summary":"Saw 2 star like objects flying high side by side then noticed a 3rd one flying about 10 feet behind them but in the middle of them in the back came from southwest and turned towards the east towards the casecade mts.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Burlington, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:195098"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Nampa","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside smoking a cigarette and looking at the stars when i noticed a star flashing very fast and seemed to be changing colors. i went inside to get my binoculars for a clearer look because the object was very far to the south. it seemed to be flashing white, then red, then a blueish green. i then called my wife and son out to also have a look. they both saw it. we then began to look around and counted eight total in different distances and positions, all in the souther sky. we could not find anything even similar in any area of the sky except the south. they did not move for the hour or so that we watched them. we then went inside and our direct tv flashed and lost it's signal very briefly. unknown if this had anything to do with what we saw other than our dish points to the south.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":18910,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.5474072,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272009-0003","longitude":-116.5547424,"occurred":1251351300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Idaho","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1251351300000,"summary":"Seen a light very far to the south that was flashing very fast and not moving","tags":["flash","light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Nampa, Idaho","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:195099"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Arvada","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I saw it pulsing and flashing multiple colors with red lighening looking rays coming off of it ...Its still there south east arvada","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18909,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.8069344,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08272009-0002","longitude":-105.0832042,"occurred":1251370800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,  Star-like,  Triangle,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1251370800000,"summary":"I saw it pulsing and flashing multiple colors ","tags":["pulsing","flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18909_submitter_file1__0827090510.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18909_submitter_file2__0827090510a.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18909_submitter_file3__0827090510b.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Arvada, Colorado","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:195100"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2177}
