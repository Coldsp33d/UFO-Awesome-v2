was coming as i looked at the stars and satellites that flew by.  i told her i felt it in the pit of my stomach.  she then noticed a pulsating light in the north that seemed to circle over the city of grants pass.  this light remained steady except for a bright pulsating light that emanated from it.  no matter where it went it stayed constant and pulsing.  after it circled in the north, it slowly went east and disappeared over the mountains.  during this time, after we were deciding that this looked highly unsual and compared it to a couple jets flying overhead, we decided to get our little digital camera that can take movies.  what i caught on camera was completely different than what we saw.  at 7 secs & 34 secs white lights flash around the screen that we did not see at the time.  we were also both stumped as to why we didnt see the pulsating light in the sky at the time on the camera.  in the video there is a constant red light which is from a radio tower on the eastern mountains.  we didnt get a closer shot of this thing because we wanted to make sure it was truly unusual before we got over-excited. there was no noise from this light either and it couldn't have been more than a mile or so away from us.  i am still in a bit of shock as to my feelings that came just before we saw this thing and am a bit shaky.  my dog even was attentive to it and had her ears perked straight up.  i am including a pic of my dog, a movie, and a very grainy pic that i use on \"pic\" mode.  on the picture there is a a white-yellow light matching what we saw at the bottom of the picture.  the movie is different from the picture and i dont know why.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

between the hours of 12am and 4am.  i am also a smoker, but i do not smoke inside my house.  at approximately 3:30 am i stepped out on my back patio (which faces south) to smoke a cigarette.  it is a ritual for me to locate the moon and venus in the southern sky as soon as i step outside.  when i lit my cigarette, there was nothing unusual to report.  after about 3-4 minutes, i bent down to put out my cigarette.  when i stood back up, something caused me to look up again.  at this time, venus was hanging low to the southwest.  the moon was a little higher in the sky, and positioned east of venus.  further east of the moon, and directly south of my point of view and a little higher in the sky than the moon were two brilliantly bright lights sitting one above the other.  they were bright white (brighter than venus) and appeared to be a great distance away (possibly in outside our atmosphere).  for the time i observed them they were completely static in the sky.  they did not move in relation to objects on the ground, the stars in the sky, or in relation to each other.  they lights did not twinkle or change color or change in brightness.  it was a clear night with no clouds as all other stars were visible.  i watched the two objects for about two minutes.  then without moving, they faded from the sky in about 10-15 seconds.  they faded away at the same rate at the same time.  the fading can be described as if they moved behind progressively thickening clouds.  however there were no clouds and other dimmer stars in the same area were still visible.  the only logical explanation i can come up with is that the two objects were indeed above our atmosphere, and as i watched they passed into earth's shadow, thereby disappearing.  i stayed looking at the same spot in the sky for about ten minutes hoping the lights would reappear.  they did not, and i have not seen anything remotely similar in the southern sky at anytime of night.  as i viewed the objects i felt only intrigue and curiosity.  after they disappeared i felt a great deal of uncertainty, but not fear.  that is the extent of my story.  if anybody else saw anything similar on 8-11-09, i would love to hear about it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":18907,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9531753,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08262009-0026","longitude":-92.3325724,"occurred":1249986600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1249986600000,"summary":"Two

(there were about +50 in my estimation)\r\n\r\nthese objects then incredibly, shot across the sky in our complete view and made the shape of the number 7 but with the strike in it, they then made a square shape and others.\r\nthere was no light from theses objects but they were distinct in shape and colour-black, a black that stood out from the night sky.\r\nwhilst we were watching this amazing sight i noticed that all the wind chimes in neighbouring gardens were sounding quite loudly and dogs started barking.\r\n\r\nthe next thing that happened i had an urge to look to my right, above me i estimate 100-150 feet one of these objects was just rotating there completely silent. (it was massive! aprox the size of a 747x2)\r\ni must admit that when i saw this and my stepson also saw it i was afraid i can't describe the exact feeling except i think it was the fear of the unknown!  we both at that point ran inside the house and locked the door.\r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes later i went back outside and there was no sign of these mysterious triangular objects, i was glad but also sad at the same time if that makes sence because i really wanted to know what they were.\r\n\r\nafter that incident i only told my parents and close family, but even they thought i must have had one to many! i tell you no lie this happened and i can even draw the whole thing as from start to finish it is that clear in my mind even after all this time.\r\n\r\ni never reported the objects because as i'm sure you are well aware of the stigma attached to such reporting of these sightings but, i am so pleased to be able to report to you and maybe this information will be useful in some way to others studying this phenomenon.\r\n\r\ni just have to say that i have no reason to lie or exaggerate what i saw that night, i seek no reward or fame, i also just want to know the truth about

seemed to be hovering from north to south.  it was moving very slowly and did not make a sound. although it was at least 1000 feet up and maybe a mile away.  usually even a plane will make that kind of noise, especially the small prop planes that leave our airport.  the other thing that got me thinking that it wasnt a plane was the fact that it did not appear to be landing or taking off.  it was very bright and shiny.  i found it odd that when i took my sunglasses off i could hardly see it.  it had more of a brightness with my sunglasses on.  it was cigar shaped but oval at the same time.  it did not change shape, it was just in between.  i looked down to my cell phone to activate the camera in it.  as soon as i went to point it to take the picture the object disappeared.  immediately after this i knew it wasnt a conventional aircraft.  it was something else.  i scanned the whole sky immediately after and it was no where to be seen.  i have had a few odd sightings here in timmins

reside in the house up their driveway at 8 possum glen road. i was alone on the deck talking to an old air force friend when i saw the \"lights\". i first noticed the lights as i gazed into the night sky. when i first noticed the lights, i thought that it was very strange but i didn't know what they were. i knew that they were not typical aircraft.\r\n\r\ndate:  august 25, 2009 tuesday\r\n\r\ntime of initial sighting:  between 9:14 and 9:16 p.M. est\r\n\r\nduration:  2.5 minutes\r\n\r\nlocation:  less than 5 degrees above jupiter and about 1-2 degrees to right - jupiter and the objects appeared ssw from my location\r\n\r\nnumber of observed objects(lights):  2\r\n\r\ntotal duration of sighting:  2.5 minutes\r\n\r\nweather/observational conditions:  clear, no wind, moonless or moon behind trees, milky way banding visible and double stars in ursa major visible to unaided eye, no significant background lighting\r\n\r\ncolor:  both objects remained white throughout event\r\n\r\nshape:  disc/circle\r\n\r\nbrightness/intensity:  objects brighter than jupiter, non blinking or pulsating, one object changed intensity slightly later on in the event\r\n\r\nsound:  none\r\n\r\nsize:  both about 1.5 times jupiter's apparent diameter\r\n\r\nobjects' apparent motion (together)  both objects were initially in motion for about 1.5 minutes. their motion appeared as if 2 light bulbs were attached to the \"multi axis trainer\" used in astronaut training with one bulb on the framework of one axis and another bulb on the framework of the other axis. it appeared that they were revolving around an uncommon center in a loose elliptical path. both objects were moving in a clockwise direction but changed to a counterclockwise direction for a moment then returned to clockwise. there was no other interaction between the objects such as light sharing or arcing. \r\n\r\nobjects apparent motion (separately)  after the initial 1.5 minute observation of motion, one object (disc #1) stopped its motion as if hovering and then the other object (disc #2) acceleratied in a ssw direction at an extremely high rate of speed until it was hidden by the trees marking the perimeter of the property. about 1 minute after object #2 was no longer visible, object #1 then accelerated from its hovering position in a sse direction at a similar rate of speed as object #2's object #2 displayed a slight increase in intensity as it was acceleration. after object #1 stopped, the remaining motions during the event were in apparent straight non curving lines.\r\n\r\nresidual effects (physical):  there were no vapor trails, however this would be difficult to observe since the moon had already set or was behind the trees and there were no significant background lighting\r\n\r\nresidual effects (personal): disc #1 stopped as i stood up from my chair, this made me feel somewhat like i was the one being observed.\r\n\r\nlocal effects:  just prior to my initial observation, i heard about 5 dogs barking, my two up the driveway and 2 or 3 within a quarter mile. i couldn't determine if the other dogs were barking because mine were barking or if they were barking due to another stimulus that they had perceived.\r\n\r\ntime this report taken:  almost immediately after the event was over - 9:18\r\n\r\nwho took the report: the report was taken and written by my father, arthur constantino 6 possum glen road wwantage (sussex), new jersey (same property - different house). my father is a retired science teacher of 38 years. he is 62 years old and had retired in july 2007. for a short period of time, he was a field investigator for apro.\r\n\r\nfather's comments:  melissa and i have talked about ufo's on occassion with her having no real opinion as to whether they are intelligently controlled devices or not. she does not read ufo books and has shown marginal interest in ufo documentaries on tv. when she called from the deck to tell me what she saw, i came out and observed that she was shaken but was able to provide needed information to the specific questions that i proceeded to asked her. we went over the event several times and also communicated with her air force friend on the other end of the telephone. he was on the phone when the event was taking place. i have read many books on ufo's and have taught my students that suspended judgement is an important part of science until the facts present themselves enough to draw specific conclusions. \r\n\r\nnote:  the closest airports are newark liberty international (nj), stewart international (ny).\r\n\r\nfollow-up:  i called the following police agencies to ask whether they had received any reports of ufo's within the above time frame.\r\n\r\nvernon, nj police - the direction where the lights?Objects appeared\r\nnew jersey state police, augusta, n.J. - patrols wantage township and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nboth agencies said that as of 9:40 that evening, there were no reports of ufo's. i did not persue atc.\r\n

over the trees approximately a quarter of a mile ahead. the area is residential and there are no street lights.  i continued driving toward the lights, past the turnoff to my road, because i was curious as to what this could be. my first reaction was that these were huge spotlights on a post such as you might see in a football stadium.  when i neared the lights i slowed the car to get a better view and realized the lights were on the front of a large rectangular grayish object that was hovering above the trees.  i stopped my car and rolled down the window to get a better view.  i estimate i was about 150 feet away. the object made no noise.  there were several white lights on the side, no wings,approximately 50-75 feet in length. i was astounded to say the least. several seconds after i stopped, the object sped away in a southeasterly direction and i noticed a red light on the back.  it was gone in an instant. there was no other traffic on the road at the time and the sky was clear. i was scared to say the least, and am totally perplexed.\r\n

the night sky was absolutely clear and you could see hundreds of stars.  i noticed what i thought was a shooting star but it blinked, so then i thought it was some kind of aircraft.  i realized in just a second or two that there were three objects alike, in the same general area of the night sky.  all three were darting here and there, many times turning on a \"dime\".  more than once, making a 90 degree turn.  as they danced around a large portion of the sky, they would blink really quick, sometimes.  but not constant.  they seemed to almost be playing \"tag\".  their speed was phenomenal, and much faster than anything i am familiar with.  plus, they could change direction in a blink, and \"we\" have nothing that can do that, at that speed, to my knowledge.  i was describing all i was seeing to my buddy gary, and we were both trying to come up with an answer that made sense for what i was seeing.  i sometimes did not talk when he was asking me questions because i was entralled with what i was seeing.\r\n\r\nabout two or three minutes (maybe less) into watching this, they \"zipped\" away in different directions.  i kept talking with my buddy and kept watching the sky.  about four or five minutes later, i observed one of those same objects, heading north at an incredible speed.  behind it but far back was an obvious airplane, probably a military jet because of its speed, going in the same direction.  i had the impression that it was trying to catch or keep track of the \"object\" in front of it.  the airplane was going really really fast, but was \"dusted\" by the object in front of it, which seemed to be traveling at approximately 1 1/2 to 2 times the speed of the airplane.  they both disappeared to the north.\r\n\r\nwhen i was observing these three objects in the beginning, they often would blink really quickly, a white light with no discernable colors, but would not constantly blink.  the blinking was very fast.  faster than helocopters or airplane lights blink.\r\n\r\nbut sometimes they would not blink for a second or two.  when they were not blinking, i could still make out an object in the direction of travel at any given moment, which appeared to be a dull grey or silver in color, streaking.\r\n\r\nthese objects were very high in the sky.  what i would describe as \"outer space\".  i can not explain how i could see them when they were not blinking, as there seemed to be no light other than that which blinked.  maybe it was a reflection from the moonlight that allowed me to see them.  i don't know.\r\n\r\ni have never before observed something i could not explain, prior to this.  i served 8 years in the u.S. marine corps and 4 months in the navy.  i am 56 years old and a retired cleveland police officer.  i retired as a lieutenant, and i was recognized by the u.S. congress (108th congress) for my service and career.  my buddy who was on the phone with me at the time, is currently a working police officer in cleveland.\r\n\r\ni have spend 24 hours or so, replaying in my mind and recollection, all of what i observed last night, and can not come up with a logical explanation.  i have told no one except my wife, who is visiting our son in texas, and my buddy gary.\r\n\r\ni will add that in my area, we get a lot of military aircraft that conduct manuevers above our home.  there are usually two but sometimes three, always in the daylight hours, apparently practicing.  on one occasion, my wife and i actually observed one of the planes shoot an object, but we do not know what it was or where it went.  this shot object disappeared into some clouds.  every once in awhile these military aircraft break the sound barrier and rattle our home.  we just assume these military jets are from wright patterson afb, which is not to far from us.\r\n\r\noh, one more thing.  when i was observing the three unknown blinking objects, there was absolutely no sound.  when i observed the one streaking north, it was also silent but i could hear the loud coming airplane that was way behind it, going in the same direction.  my \"feeling\" is that the airplane was a lot lower in the sky, than the object it was following behind. \r\n\r\ni don't have anything else to add.  please let me know if you get any other reports from my area, during that same time period.\r\n\r\ni am just amazed and confused.  i need glasses to read but my long range vision is very good.  i can not come up with a logical explanation for what i observed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18881,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.2108266,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08252009-0021","longitude":-83.602257,"occurred":1251181800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1251181800000,"summary":"Three

house. i was sitting down in the middle of the backyard, looking in a south-southeasterly direction when i saw the craft out of the corner of my eye. it seemed to be a gray-ish boomerang that was thicker at the back curve and tapered thinner to the front. as it passed over i saw four blue jets that emmited no sound on the back. there were two of the jets on each side of the inside of the curve. \r\nas it moved further south at an altidue of maybe several thousand feet, flying slowly, the blue jets turned off in pairs. first the two outside jets and then the two inside jets, within 10-20 seconds of eachother. after that it became harder to watch it as it moved farther away and seemed to turn slightly east until fully disappearing. \r\ni didn't tell anyone about it until about a month later when i told one of my best-friends because i doubted anyone would believe me. he just chuckled and mocked my story a bit but didn't say anything else.\r\ni think the craft could have been a test plane from area 51, as it was moving from that general direction.
