States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband gets up to smoke cigarettes at night. he has been observing something in the night sky on and off for about two weeks now. he took three photographs of a bright light above our house with his cell phone about a week ago. he described the light/object as a ufo and says he can see an arm coming out of each side with his naked eye. he has seen two different objects on various occasions, and thinks he may have seen a third but is unsure. he advised me they move too quickly to be easily explained, are too bright to be stars, and do not have any blinking lights to indicate they are airplanes. he has told me that he has watched them remain stationary, move, and change direction. he has said the objects remain in the sky for roughly thirty minutes to an hour when they are there. i can not recall if he has observed them appear or disappear. i am unable to easily identify the object he has taken with his cell phone camera, however the roof of our house is clearly visible and a bright light is visible above it. our house is located around the galleria area of houston, which makes observing stars virtually impossible. the house faces north, with artificial lighting provided by one street lamp on the north side of the house and one theft-deterrent light above the neighboring business to the west. the photos are three consecutive shots facing south with a bright light in the south.\r\n\r\ni requested my husband wake me up the next time he saw the objects/lights. on august 25th, 2009 at approximately 4:30am, my husband woke me up to tell me there was one object in the southwest portion of the sky. he advised me to look directly to the right of the building next to our house. he remained inside with our sleeping baby. i went outside and observed a single dot of light in the sky where he indicated. i returned in to confirm with him that this was the object he has been seeing. he advised me that it was. i returned outside with a digital camera and digital video camera. i attempted to capture the object in a series of 18 photographs from 4:51am until 5:06am. the camera had extreme difficulty in automatically focusing on the light even after i changed to a telephoto lens. the digital video camera had difficulty maintaining focus on the light when i zoomed in, as it also has an automatic focus feature. i am unable to adjust the focus for either manually. a second light appeared in the northwestern area of the sky and appeared much smaller and farther away. my husband advised me this was a second object he had also been seeing. i recorded the second object with the digital video camera only.\r\n\r\nmy husband, myself, and our (now awake) baby all returned inside our house some time after 5:00 am when the baby became fussy. both lights remained visible in the night sky when we returned inside. both objects had moved from their positions significantly since observing their original locations. i would appreciate someone from mufon following up with me on this report so i can submit the photographs and video recording in full. i can provide more comprehensive details of the sighting if necessary, however this report contains the majority. i am hoping the photographs and video footage can be enhanced. more information will be provided to authorized mufon persons upon request.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18875,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.7656327,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08252009-0015","longitude":-95.3640596,"occurred":1251199800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

up i only saw sky but the camera saw it. the camera is new andi bought it from fred meyer a week before- sony digital. thinking that was just a bird or leif i went into the mobil that was trashed out

had brought my binoculars for viewing. i watched this oject for about 15 minutes and it was motionless the whole time then i noticed a west bound commercial plane approaching close to the object so i kept on viewing the object and at one point i could see the object and the plane within the view of my binoculars. the plane appeared to be at cruising alttitude so i'm guessing 30-35,000 feet. the plane didn't react to the object so this further bolstered my belief it was a star or planet. at that moment the object became very fuzzy and dimmer. thinking i had fogged up my binoculars i cleaned the optics and returned to viewing the object. at this point there was a whispy plume coming off of the now dimmer object and within the plume i could see smaller white orbs shooting through. i instantly thought this reminded me of a youtube ufo video from mexico where an object was shooting orbs out of it, i mean it looked almost exactly like that. i ran in to get my video camera and by the

nephew) and two adult females (my daughter and myself) were walking outside in auburn, washington at 1:39 am as my daughter was going home next door. since we are in a rural location and it was dark out, we were seeing her home safely. she happened to point out that the stars looked different - we are all avid sky watchers - and all looked up to consider what she said. she then said that she had never seen a certain tiny constellation in the southwestern sky and we all looked to the area she was indicating. my nephew asked if it had changed shape, and all four of us noted the change from a 'ladle' shape to a square and then a triangle. stunned, we watched the shape chnage further into a rounded heart shape, a line, a zig zag, and i told my daughter to get her camera which she had left inside my house.\r\n\r\nwhile she was trying to video tape the object, i went into the house, got my camera, and turned all the lights out. i went back outside and we watched and did our best to document what we were seeing.\r\n\r\nif the ground were at 0 and directly above us were a 10, the object would have been near the 7. as we stared towards the south south east, the pleiades was at a 9 and to our left (east). at arm's length, it would have taken a nickel to cover it.\r\n\r\nat first we thought the lights were shifting into the repeating shapes, but as we watched over 2 hours, we realized it was a saucer shaped object with the lights along the edge and the ship was rotating, causing the light pattern to shift.\r\n\r\nthe object drifted to the east very slowly, and then drifted back to the west. we could not judge the size very well, but for some reason we all thought it was huge. we watched a sattelite go from the south west to the north east and i would guess that the object was about the same level as it, as the lights were of a similar size. it could have been smaller and much closer - it was impossible to tell.\r\n\r\nwe also noted several shooting stars, including one that 'shot' slower and did not fade as it curved from the area of the object and went east.\r\n\r\nwe tried very hard to remain calm, but we all felt a sense of awe and gratitude. we all sent mental messages of  thanks, for what it may have been worth - and we all felt excited and nearly euphoric. we all agreed that what we were seeing was beautiful.\r\n\r\nalthough we took dozens of pictures and videos, which we will gladly send in if requested, the lights were apparently not strong enough to be picked up by our cameras. maybe someone has a program on their computer that can help see what may have been picked up in the videos.\r\n\r\nwe will continue to sift through them. i am still rather blurry, as i am a bit old for dawn patrol, and i did not actually get to bed until nearly 4:30 in the morning.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path then

clouds/pleasant.  we were putting mulch out in the front of the house.  we talked of how low the planes were coming in to dulles from the southwest to the northeast direction.  soon after a 767 rumbled overhead, i noticed 3 black triangular shaped objects that initially i thought were birds.  i mentioned to my partner that the objects were flying too fast for birds, and we noticed that when the objects went in front of a cloud, no flapping of wings were noted.  the 3 objects seemed to be circling around each other, but at the same time, were ascending.  very suddenly, one of the triangular shaped craft simply zipped quickly across the sky, from east to west, very quickly.  i was able to follow the object with the naked eye, but it was very quick--and not a bird.  the other two triangular, dark metal looking objects seemed to still be circling around each other, like a dance.  it was almost like they seemed to be enjoying circling around each other, dancing around the sky.  the other two then followed the same direction as the first, and all turned southward and left our line of sight.  i've been a registered nurse for many years and my partner is career secret service.  we neither one could explain this strange sighting, especially in the flight line of a major airport.  we both mentioned that they were truly unidentified but not sure if they are ours...Or not?  the g forces with the maneuvers alone would be unbelievable with the way the aircraft maneuvered.  it was truly awesome for both of us to see.  again, triangular shaped, somewhat 'chevron' looking, dark metal approximately one to two thousand feet in elevation, and looked about the size of a mid sized sedan...It's difficult to explain this any other way.  i've never reported a sighting because i've really never had one before.  both of us are very objective in our professional and personal lives, but had no explanation for this.

ones, when we all heard this loud whoosh sound, that got louder and louder. from about 200 yards away, we say four bright red spheres rise out of the brush one by one. the speheres were about the size of a large pickup truck and were glowing a bright red that lit up the surrounding area, including the back of the house we were at. my friends horse all began rearing up and nervously whinnying and runnning around the corral as the objects rose. they all rose quietly into the sky, when the last one got to about 100 feet off the ground they slowly headed off to the east, towards the electric plant that sits outside of monahans. they then seemingly hovered over the plant for about 4 minutes. then they all rose in unison and zoomed off in a near vertical ascent, about 3 seconds later, there was a loud clap of what sounded like thunder, but sounded like a sonic boom. it took about 15 minutes before the animals all calmed down and quiet returned to the countryside.\r\n\r\nwe all watched in completely and utter amazement, about 1 minute passed by before someone said anything, even then we couldn't come up with a reasonable explanation. alot of us grew up in monahans and many of us have seen the strange glowing lights that seem to be attrated toward the plant, but we've seen them from a long way off, usually at night as we are driving back home from odessa or kermit. they usually are seen only rising up and disappearing into the night sky.\r\n\r\nwe stayed up most of the night talking about it and we still couldn't come up with an explanation to what we witnessed. but i know that

airline.  while flying a salt lake to denver leg in an empty canadair crj-200 regional jet on 22 august, the captain and i witnessed a brilliant bluish white object as we descended through 19000 feet amsl and crossed the \"tomsn\" intersection in the area of estes park colorado, some 60 miles northwest of the denver international airport.  as we levelled off at 19000 feet, we began slowing from 310 knots indicated to 250 knots indicated airspeed, as instructed by atc.  at this time we noticed a bright white light off to our right (south of us) at about the 3:30 position and apparently the same altitude as us.  it appeared to be another aircraft descending parallel to us into the denver area, but it was extremely bright, appearing as though we were looking directly into its landing lights.  we asked the denver approach controller on 119.30 mhz if he could see any other aircraft off to our right, and he said there were none.  we also had no indication of any aircraft off to our right on our onboard tcas (collision avoidance) system display.  we observed this aircraft (?) from approx 8:07 to 8:09 pm (less than 3 minutes) and it appeared to move eastbound parallel to our course, less than 10 miles off to the right (south) of our position, in the area of longs peak and rocky mountain nat'l. park.  we know it was not a great distance away, since we saw it pass between us and a rain/virga shower in the vicinity of long's peak, off to the right (south) of our track.  it appeared to have at least similar speed to ours (250 to 300 knots), although this is difficult to judge--it seemed to be a bit faster than we were, going eastbound.  as we both began to observe it closely, it literally faded from bright and sharply visible to completely gone in less than three seconds.  it did not appear to accelerate or change course--it just faded rapidly from view and was gone.  another two quick inqiries to the denver approach controller yielded the same answer--he saw neither an aircraft transponder return in that area nor any \"primary\" return (an aircraft or object simply reflecting radar waves off of its skin).  this was most puzzling to us as we both clearly saw this bright large object and observed it for over two minutes.  it appeared roughly elongate rectangular and very large--perhaps the size of a large jumbo jet(at least 200-300 feet long)...But this is difficult to judge without distance information--i believe it was at least 5 to 8 miles off to our right.  hard to discern surface detail--it simply looked roughly rectangular and extremely bright bluish white light in color (emitting light).  \r\n     i did not have binoculars or a camera with me on this particular flight, so i cannot give much more close detail than this. please feel free to call me with any questions you may have.  i am thinking of requesting the radar tapes from atc.  our flight number was skywest 1008, and we were communicating with denver center on 126.50mhz and then denver approach control on 119.30mhz when the event occurred.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

outline of object against the stars caused a dark cigar shape moving fast from south to north in a straight line.  i took my eyes off the object to turn around and quickley found it again.  i kept

falls\r\nmy spouse and i were on our way to wichita falls. we stopped in at the dairy queen off of hwy 79 in archer city. i was sitting at a booth by a north facing window, sipping on a malt and watching what i assumed was a small white plane. the plane (?) was moving from my ne to ene (west to east) at approx. 5,000 ft agl. it appeared to bank it's wings to the right, then there was a brilliant flash of light which i assumed was a\r\nrefection from the sun.  however, at that instant the object took on a diamond like shape. it flew a short distance further and vanished, as if it flew into a hole in the sky. i looked all around that area of the sky and never saw it again. i told my spouse \"after the fact\", after his having seen the perplexed look on my face. at the time of sighting, my mind was trying to process what i was seeing, so i didn't say anything. my spouse could not see the object, as he was seated facing me and had a wall to his right.  i was facing him, with a clear view out the window, north and east.\r\ni assumed it was a plane, because the object 'appeared' to be a small plane. i should have been able to view the object for quite some distance, as the sky was clear, with just a few puffy clouds. the object was in open sky and not near any of these clouds. i was inside the dairy queen and could not hear any outside noises, except for occasional traffic on hwy 79 and inside the dairy queen. this sighting lasted at most, 10 seconds.\r\n1. having lunch at the dairy queen in archer city.\r\n2. i noticed a small solid white plane headed east.\r\n3. i thought it was a piper cub.\r\n4. the supposed plane was traveling west to east, banked to the right, flashed a brilliant white, then took on a diamond shape.\r\n5. my feeling during sighting was one of wishing i was piloting the plane and after, astonishment.\r\n6.  i lost sight of the object when it simply vanished, like flying into a hole in the sky.\r\n\r\ni am sending a
