6.30 to 7.30 as we approached church lane, rg303tg i glanced out at the trees on my side of the van we were in, there are bad bends in the road at this point, and... my wife screamed out \"watch out\" hit brakes just managed to stop before going in ditch on my left, \" what's wrong with you \" she said by this time i was looking straight ahead afraid to look again without her confirmation, \"have a look out my side window.\r\n,what does it look like \" i said \" a spaceship\" was her answer drove the van up the road a bit to get a better look, stopped the van and i got out of it to get a better view, wow phew from being scared to death one minute to amazement in heart if that's the feeling, felt privileged, felt as if i was gifted to see such an event, this craft was hovering over a field no more than 50 yards away about 200 feet in the air it was 100--200 yards across 30 yards deep, looked saturn like in shape, had a set of windows running through the middle all different pastel colours, looked as if they were flashing but maybe it was the rushing clouds inside the craft that gave this impression, the clouds were all small but were different shades, and they looked as if they were thundery, rushing through the ship, it was at this point i decided to tell myself to remember every detail as i was seeing something that was going to get investigated and my information could be of great significance we watch it for about five minutes no more, the ship moved off in an arc shape to our left going up as it moved, its path took it straight over the atomic research base 500 yards away, then it went parallel to the m4 motorway towards london, here is where we lost sight of the ship, it disappeared out of our sight (to far off to see) i drove up the road 500 yards and parked the van to see it there was any thing that i could add to this ufo sighting, yes the weather it was a bright morning don't think i saw the sun up yet but it was bright morning the best sky i've ever seen all light blue not a cloud in the sky anywhere, none not even a planes energy trail nothing. but there was two other objects in the sky, the moon looking like this ( in shape although tilted more, under this moon i saw a star shining as bright as any flickering quite large for a star i thought maybe its the space station, the star or space station was just below it.\r\nabout a quarter of an inch between your fingers looking up at it, remembering all the events of that day was going to be easy, or so i thought, we told our family first about the sighting and some were sceptic and others laughed, three days later there was a news article asking if anyone had seen any ufos lately, i was expecting the press to be full of this sighting but there was none, it was then i felt as if we were being tested for our integrity or our ability to be trusted weird feeling, did nothing about it for 4 years or so, something triggered off my wondering why?\r\nstarted reading up about ufo sighting and people near where i live who i could ask some questions, and i told him all i told you, then he asked me what day it was? forgot the date? couldn't t remember the date? for over two years couldn't nail down the date? nightmare? then the other week i ask my wife to see when our passports run out? keeps them in a draw with other things birth certificates, insurance, etc., she came down the stairs with a piece of paper torn off dated 11th september 2004 and she had written on it spaceday, brilliant as so i thought, easy now to find evidence? evidence of the spaceship? so easy, no chance, \r\n(1) m4 motorway cams must have recorded it, the traffic police, and the bbc, have access to these road cams, no reply?\r\n(2) weather photos of that morning sky again bbc and weather stations have this evidence no reply?\r\n(3) google earth must have evidence of the spaceship that day where is it? no reply?\r\n(4) m.O.D base has twenty or more cameras that could have recorded its flight?\r\nresearchers the police, google earth, weather cam sites, mod, all got this evidence?\r\ncan't believe there's no evidence other than our sighting? over ten years ago now, and have looked every day in my email in box for a google ufo report that resembles our spaceship? nothing, the size makes most people look sideways, bigger than wembley stadium, could have hit it with a catapult, watched it for 5-7 minutes, followed it up the road half a mile, spoke to weather buffs about the rushing clouds being the energy the ship used as its power?\r\nwent back to site 2 years ago and realized that we must have entered into some type of time warp-tunnel hence why they never saw the ship, guess they never looked at any of the hundreds of instrument records that showed distortions due to this ship size? they needed to look at the evidence with regard to the speed we were traveling at? all the evidence to time travel is still there on their archives, i cant get anyone now to call up an investigation into this time warp possibility, we stood in the middle of the road for 8 minutes or more, you cant do this without being run over, every minute a car passed this spot we stopped, there was no noise, no birds. no planes, that morning, spectrometers, charts, dials, gamma ray, gravitational charts, radiation charts, etc. will show distortions, all they need to do is look, this spaceship was huge, came here to do something? never harmed my wife or i,\r\ni have sent letters and emails to many telling them they need to look, to call an investigation, saying this belongs to mankind, but for some reason its as if they just ignore my requests, f.O.I request sent me a email address to reply to that never existed? there's not a television channel or newspaper in england that hasn't read the above? pictures on my facebook page show the place and the size, we watched for 8 minutes, they cant find distortions? pwew, to this day they never looked. \r\nmichael

left to right, went into house and got my wife to come out, she took one look and said \"so what, a big red thingy flying around the sky\", she went back into the house.  i watched for about two minutes as it moved up and down, left to right, it then just took off very fast, much faster than any jet or anything, made not a sound. it headed north-west and disappeared over the mountains, it was traveling so fast it appeared to go right through the mountain.  i see many strange things in the night sky up here, mostly what look like a camera flash in the upper atmosphere, i see them quite often, sometimes just one, other time several, they are always a bright white flash, gotta look quick.  one night i saw four of them, then a fifth, only the fifth one was red, the only time i ever saw a red one, they appear to be like an energy burst just outside of our atmosphere, definitely not a plane or helicopter, way to high up, maybe a ship entering or leaving hyper space or something like

(6.5 - 7\"), blonde, thin, dressed very gq suit, perhaps charcoal. he was always looking down. i tried hard to look at him but could not focus in for some reason (as if hearing, don't be rude, don't stare). hair was to the collar, seemed to be one length as opposed to a shaved cut. \r\n\r\nher: tall, a few inches shorter than him, and she was wearing heals. thin, with long very red hair, obviously a dyed (non-natural) red or a wig. very straight, all the way down her back. she also had bangs. i wanted to (and did) see her eyes. they were blueish, and the pigmentation was unique. she wore a long black jacket over (what i believe to be) dark blue dress. i do not remember seeing a handbag. \r\n\r\nthe interaction: \r\n\r\nafter watching the first half of the nba finals in our room, my sister and i decided to go downstairs to watch the second half of the game at the grand lux cafe bar, which is in the back end of the casino and it was a pretty quiet, with very few people around. we both noticed a striking tall couple about 15 feet away to our left, walking towards us. we stopped, planning on letting the two walk in front of us so we could get a good look because something just did not seem right about them. but that is not what happened.\r\n\r\nunknowingly i must have taken a few steps forward as if to step in front of them, which was not my intent at all. (they were not even within my peripheral vision.) i felt a very odd energy brush by me and i realized it was them. i felt panic for my sis as i knew she was behind me and they must have surely have bumped right into her. i whipped around to see her in a freeze-tag-like pose. (the couple were still not within peripheral sight.) she was very startled and shaken and says out loud  \"how did i not run into them?\". (she too had also taken unintentional steps forward.)\r\n\r\nthe tall duo were still walking the same direction and were about 7 - 8 feet on the other side of us heading towards the palazzo theater. they paused, the female looked around but did not acknowledge us. at this time, i admitted to myself that they could not possibly be human and watched them walk away (or more like glide, their stride was not \"normal\".)  i had the thought that they seemed to be communicating to each other.\r\n\r\nodd aftermath: all we could say about the ordeal was \"wasn't that weird!\" it was as if we couldn't assimilate what had just happened. we went into the grand lux bar and ordered some beers (our first drink of the day) and did not speak of it at all. my husband joined us for a minute, and we didn't even mention it to him.  after the game we walked to the casino across the street (the wynn) and while watching the outdoor water fountain show, we finally started talking about what had happened. my sister said aloud what i had been thinking all along ... \"we just saw aliens\".  we compared our stories and they matched up, it really did happen. \r\n\r\nis it possible there were other reported sitings of this couple in las vegas? since casino's have camera surveillance, perhaps mufon has connections to obtain video tape of us \"bumping into\" them?

of my photos, and to my surprise, i had captured a ufo.  after much review of the photo, i have ruled out that the object captured in my photo could be a smashed bug on the windshield, a light from inside/outside the vehicle, an airplane, or any other reasonable object.   we did not hear a sound before, during, or after the photo.  in the photo, you can see that all the other items (trees, snow, front hood of vehicle, etc) are clean, crisp, and good resolution in the photo.  you can see in the photo that the ufo must be a moving object across the sky, since it has a slightly blurred image.  at this time of day (6:25pm) the sun was to my east (left in the photo) and you can clearly see the sun light on the top the ufo and a shadow below the ufo.  while i was snapping the photo, i was only looking at my phone screen and at the black lake to ensure i was centered on the lake.  the driver was not looking in the direction of the ufo to notice it, and the 2  passengers were looking at their respective phones at the time that i snapped this photo.  so, there was no one that saw the ufo at the moment the photo was taken.  the photo was simply taken at the exact moment this ufo was passing

this thing must have been bigger than his one story house, and it was a huge disc shape, it was a thick circle though, and it flashed all these colors too, in a pattern! it must have only been maybe 30 feet above his house, just hovering there, completely silent. i decided that i had to take a photo or video of this thing, because no one would believe it. so i turned away, and ran back to my house, i turned around when i reached the door, only to find that this huge ship was gone. when i tried talking to my older brother about where it had gone, he couldn't even remember the last five minutes, and to this day he can't remember that night. i suspect, that this ship saw us looking at it, and when i turned away and ran back to my house, i had unknowingly protected myself, because i think his memory was wiped by that ship somehow.\r\n\r\nanother time i saw a mother ship hovering above the tree tops, and releasing smaller drones down to the earth, those drones went down to the earth, as if to gather samples etc, and then they went back up into the mother ship, and they left.\r\n\r\nanother time we saw a ufo, and my older brother and i pointed our laser pointers at it, and the damn thing came after us, and chased us!\r\n\r\none time my mother, my little sister, and myself were house sitting for a neighbor, and as we did this, we all heard an unearthly noise, it sounded like an alien spacecraft, and it had an oscillating noise which enveloped the entire house, this lasted for about two minutes, and then the noise completely vanished. only about a year later, the noise returned, only this time it hovered in front of our house, no one saw it, but myself and my little sister heard it, and we immediately started to freak out, it sounds like an advanced oscillating engine/propulsion technology, it lasted for only a minute, and then it left. \r\n\r\nin all of these events, it only happens during the spring/summer time. which suggests to me that they are most interested in this region when the wildlife is abundant and active, which i believe they use for educational/scientific research and study of our planet, and all its inhabitants. \r\n\r\nthe best ways to contact me would be by email, or even a visit would be okay, although i live with my parents, and no one else is willing to come forward, and they do not want to be contacted by you, nor would the property owners want to have an in house interview, although i would be happy to meet your field team and show you the various locations the events happened. \r\n\r\nafter the first incident in 2011, i noticed i had strange symbols on my left hand, i don't know if it's a simple coincidence, or if \"they\" placed a mark upon me. i also have access to something called: \"the database\" it's a collection of everything ever done in the past, everything that is being done in the present, and everything that is going to happen in the future. i used this information to learn about the most highly classified secrets of the federal governmnet, which i will reveal to you upon your request. so far i've decoded how paper currency is made, and i know about project z, the governments plan to turn people into zombies, and i have evidence to show you, that was documented by major news sources. \r\n\r\n\"they\" whether they are members of the divine, or extraterrestrial, visit me, and they give me this information, they speak to me in my dreams, and they tell me all these things. although \"they\" never reveal to me who or what they are. \r\n\r\nwhatever these symbols mean, i'm wondering if they have any meaning to your organization. perhaps it is some alien language, or something you've seen in your collection of submissions.

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am a ufo enthusiast, i often observe clear skies with reasonably powerful binoculars. on the night i've dated above, i witnessed multiple very fast moving star sized lights, yellow/white in colour which cannot be seen with naked eye.  they are usually visible for as long as i can see, or until they disappear out of view over the roof line/horizon.  have seen similar lights before but only occasionally and without such obvious alterations in direction.\r\n\r\nthis particular night i was spoilt for choice, they kept appearing, some would seem to start moving when i latched my sight onto them, whilst others were already racing across sky when i found them. some slowed a little, changed flight path a little then continued at fast pace.\r\n\r\none in particular seemed to avoid other lights/stars and one of the lights it approached started moving away from it also at a fast pace and the light i was tracking also made a very noticeable change in direction (not a u-turn) to seemingly avoid contact or avoid the immediate space surrounding the other light. something i've never witnessed before. definitely intelligently controlled craft of some sort and strongly looked like there was interaction between them, albeit what appeared to be avoidance of each other.\r\n\r\nsecond incident as also listed above was actually around 1 week earlier (23/24 may -2017 and around 12 - 1am (est). i was having a cigarette in the garden and as always, with it being a clear night, i kept my \"eyes on the skies\" and i noticed a very bright/pure white light, much larger than any star or planet but smaller than a full moon which was moving at a steady and relatively slow speed in the sky.  i ran into my house and grabbed my binoculars, quite quickly managed to lock sight onto the light.\r\n\r\nit was moving towards me/my house and grew larger as it approached.  it was one solid steady light, was not pulsating and had no side lights as you would expect with a terrestrial craft.  i listened very carefully and there was absolutely no sound what-so-ever (this really caught my attention as it was ticking all the boxes), also no other terrestrial craft visible or to be heard. the light was at least a few hundred feet above me (possibly higher) but the most startling occurrence for me was when it was almost directly above me, another light seemed to appear out of nowhere, it was slightly ahead of the first light (in direction it was travelling) and was completely stationary and lit up from nothing to the same size and brightness as the first light.\r\n\r\nthe light i was already tracking continued at the same speed without faltering from its straight line path and the second light (exactly the same in colour and size) then followed its path, almost along side each other and the pair of lights continued at i think roughly the same speed until i lost them to the roof line. \r\n\r\n100% definite craft of intelligent control & no sound at all.\r\n\r\nthe most obvious and closest sighting i've ever encountered and providing i don't get abducted and probed, long may they continue. has restored my interest in the subject, i am obsessed again! if i am fortunate enough to witness anything else of significance i will be sure to contact mufon. will be sure to record next

kind coined and apparently developed by mr greer and an et(according to mr greer).\r\n\r\nthe first and third attempt were in my opinion the most effective as during the second i was very tired and did not stay around late. having said that i still saw something strange but does not compare to the first or third.\r\n\r\ni start the ce 5 as suggested, broadcasting re recorded tones via transceiver radio recorded from a crop circle(according to the contact app, which is essentially a guide). the second step is what is called coherent thought sequence. i attempt to mentally project my exact location in the galaxy, solar system and eventually earth. due to my proximity to jbmdl, a joint military base and large air base just nw of my location then, i added a simple but explicit warning with my location. the third and final part i use a laser light to pinpoint myself.\r\n\r\nthe first sighting happened just before a meteor shower. now, don't misunderstand, i have spent months pondering all options objectively. and i can say without pride or shame i don't know what i saw. there were shooting stars that evening, strangly arriving from multiple directions, but many of them had smoke trails and dust trails. this not to be confused with the very first object, which was not a distant blue white light, but a cone or acorn shaped, very large or very close and low object with red and orange at its immediate sides. much different from the red and green nav lights on jets. it had a white cone aura and by my estimation was from tree top level to five hundred feet. and was moving slower than any meteor i've seen. possible alternatives to a ufo or meteor would be a stealth helicopter or drone, but that wouldn't explain, if the mil base sent a sortie to check the laser light out, why they would turn their unusual lights on. this object approached from the south, flew over the house i was staying at and vanished without any trace,it was flying straight and level and no more then one hundred miles per hour or less, poofing straight over the house.\r\n\r\nbut, it wasn't what i saw that convinced me it was neither here nor there, but from somewhere else, it was the experience after, a day later while in bed trying to sleep that did. the best description i can offer is a local basketball sized ball of sound came down my hall and surrounded my head. it matched the description of a former marines testimony via eye witness testimony of sirius disclosure. i felt fingertips drum over mynhead. and the corner of my bed lifted and dropped. i felt as if they were inviting me outside. they followed me home and were checking me out. who? i dunno. that's just what i experienced. at no point was i frightened, but i felt it was a little invasive although also harmless. it was either a series of wild coincidences or something unusual.\r\n\r\nthe third encounter happened this last memorial day weekend, thinking there would be less traffic around mcguire, which there wasn't as much, i decided to do it then. through the evening normal jets were flying overhead. it was clear what was a jet and what was not. after the ce5 protocols it was getting cold but instead of calling it a night i got my jacket and a blanket to continue shining the laser for a short while longer. the object this time, which i would suggest could have been the same or a similar object, flew much further up this time, came from the east and stopped over the house again. this time, it being at least two thousand feet up, i got a better profile of the object as the first encounter it was much lower. it had a cone aura, was again the slowest, most colorful, unusually shaped and soundless object that left no trace. it flew across the traffic pattern of mcguire and minutes later a jet flew south from mcguire, against the pattern, directly to where it had been.\r\n\r\nthese are two entirely separate ufo sightings. as far as visual sightings during ce 5s i am batting 1.000.  i have seen something strange each time. and i share it with all who i know and think will listen.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

miles north of highway 212. \r\n2) i noticed the object on my left thought it was a plane.  it appeared as a white circle.  but i noticed it had only one source of light not like a plane with many lights.  first instance appeared to be a plane but it became obvious it wasnt a plane.  jets do not go that way.  small planes do not fly that high.  the first thing we generally notice with small planes is their flashing lights.  this did not have flashing lights.  there is no airport in that direction for hundreds of miles so it cant be a small plane i thought.  it is open prairies and uninhabitat.  within a hundred mile radius there is just a few hundred people living there.\r\n3) a plane i thought, a jet first but then a private plane\r\n4) it was a circle shaped white bright object.  it was a clear night with no cloud coverage, no visibility restriction at all.  it was moving from nw to se direction.  when it came closes to the road where i was driving, closes to me, it split into 2 objects and changed color to bright orange.  both objects sped up in the same trajectory and disappeared from my field of view. \r\n5) i was curious.  i stoped the car got out to look when i knew it wasnt a plane.  i was going slow so took me couple of seconds to stop.  it vanished incredibly fast when it split and did the orange glow\r\n6) it vanished int he same trajectory once it split.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

radar when i seen the same flashes of light couple weeks ago going north from south only started flashing directly infront of me directly in a eastly direction,\r\n\r\nthe air plane was at 33,000 feet this object was above and behind the plane, following the plane, it only started flashing like the last report i gave you guys right in the upper eastern sky, never seen a flash until then so i defiantly this was know plane because it was 2 things i could see from the ground the air plane and something following approx. 2 miles behind it as if it was only observing the plane, now i do now know of any satellites that have strobe lights on it like this and try to pretend to be planes or look like a bright flashing airplane with bright white light, and the way it strobes is unusual as well as for the fact its not on flight radar along with the other plane, also have seen the same lights going same direction recently again within past week and the report i sent to you 2weeks or so ago this was great being able to have a plane and a ufo in the same area one following the other and being able to see hey there is only supposed to be 1 object on my radar what the heck, amazing absolutely amazing, and the light is beautiful in itself the way it flashes and tries to be cute and pretend its a plane haha\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
