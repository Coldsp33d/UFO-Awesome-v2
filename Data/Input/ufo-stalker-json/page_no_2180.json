heading south west directly towards us.  they were below the cloudline, and moving very slowly - almost floating accross the sky.  they were not hot air balloons, and not fireworks, as the airport suggested there were fireworks in louisville, but then they would have been coming from south west to north east and not vice versa.  and they didn't look anything like a firework i had seen.  these were some kind of a craft - a round object that would rise above into the sky and then seem to fizzle out before it disappeared, all around the same spot.\r\n\r\nthen, we saw more.  sometimes in pairs, sometimes one at a time.  my neighbor saw three at a time in a triangular shape prior to coming to get me.  one of them separated from the trio and went higher.  i we called some more neighbors out and i called my husband and parents.  my parents drove down to north canton.  they didn't see anything in the sky on the drive down.  \r\n\r\nthe lights finally stopped coming around 10:00, but resumed after my parents arrived, around 10:40pm.  this time we saw two sets of pairs floating in the sky.  depending on how far away they were it resembled either an oval/disc or a circle.  they were just these glowing, almost firelike balls.  they seemed to flicker like a candle would as they went by and eventually they disappeared.  again, they were orange and would rise from northeast and head straight towards us, sw.... low flying - above the trees and below the clouds.  they were very slow moving, slower than a blimp.  and completely silent.  we heard no noise at all with them, and when planes went by we heard the planes.  \r\n\r\naltogether, there were ten of us that watched them floating by us.  we were both fascinated and frightened.  my neighbor reported it to the airport, they had her continue to call as she saw them.  they said they do not know what it is, all they can guess according to the sheriff was fireworks from louisville, but again, it was coming from the wrong direction to be louisville.  my mom recorded some video on her cell phone.  i'm waiting for her to send it to me.  \r\n\r\nby 11:30pm, we hadn't seen any for about 15 minutes and all decided to go in

one of us. \r\n\r\nthe light was bright neon green, it left a tail as it moved in a zigzagged pattern. it was absolute silence, this area is forest and farm land. also, it moved very very quickly yet in a \"smooth\" manner. it's acceleration seemed effortless to best describe this smoothness. it didnt jerk like a car would when you step on the gas pedal... it just slided. \r\n\r\nthe event was

schools, i exited my parked bus at the westside transportation facility at 12400 shelborne, carmel, hamilton county, indiana. i stood in the parking lot and looked north to watch a turboprop twin engine beechcraft king air flying south at 1000 feet above ground level (agl) .25 mile to the east of my position. it turned from south to west and flew over my position, then, when .25 mile west of my position it turned to a heading of approximately north and lowered landing gear and flaps and began a 3 degree descent presumably to executive airport located four miles north of my position. i am a commercial pilot certificate holder, airplane single and multi engine land and instruments. i also hold a certified flight instructor, instruments certificate for single engine airplanes. it was pleasant to watch the aircraft execute its approach. the airplane was about a mile north of its turn onto final approach when i observed a straight black horizontal line .25 mile directly west of the aircraft at a slightly higher level than the aircraft. the aircraft was descending through approximately 750 feet agl. the black, crisply shaped, thin rectangle could be called a thick black line about one inch long when seen from my position. i thought it was a large black bird with its wings outstretched flying on a thermal. the line was too perfectly straight to be a bird, however. birds on thermals have a slight dihedral or upswept or downswept wingtips, and their bodies make small adjustments to dynamic flight conditions. this bird had no flex to the wings, nor a body. i ignored the airplane and stayed fixed on the bird to see what it would do next. i blinked my eyes  and the straight line \"bird\" was completely, abruptly, and suddenly gone and seemingly replaced by a thin flat disc on its edge! that it was smooth, flat, and of an unpainted metal color was very obvious by the fact that it accurately reflected the color of the sky and the scattered cumulus clouds enveloping it as they passed from west to east at 1000 to 1500 feet agl. there was no convex character of the surface. it was perfectly and precicely flat. i believe the black line was the appearance of the edge of the object when it was positioned parallel to earth's surface like a coin placed placed flat on a surface. my estimation of dimensions is that the black line was three feet thick. its diameter, when seen while in its vertical position like a coin placed on its edge, was fifty feet. that it was a controlled machine was perfectly obvious in that, despite the wind, it stayed in exactly one position over the ground. further, it was perfectly stable with no wobble, bobble or oscillation. it was precisely fixed in the vertical attitude and in one location. after many moments, it released its hold on its position and drifted leisurely eastward with the wind. i did not want to blink again for fear that it would change yet again. i did not want to lose sight of it. i had to blink, however, so i did so as quickly as possible. during my blink the object dissappeared. my eyes searched and searched for it and were unable to locate it again. when i realized it was gone i felt i had been treated with contempt by the operators of the machine. i felt and still feel that i saw it quite clearly, that i can probably deal with the reality and agenda of its operators, and that the operators of the machine underestimate observers and are disrespectful to us in making the apparatus suddenly dissappear without explanation, or movement, or a trail to satisfy our sense of logic. on

looked over at it and said it was a plane with its lights on. then it stoped moving,he said can planes do that i told him it was a helicopter. at this time it was around 1/4 mile away from us flying around then in a flash it was gone. we didnt know what to think. im not sure maybe 10 min.Later thats when it started one after another at least 10 or more flew close by us, one came around 20 feet from us and about 3 feet off the ground. i asked mark too come over and look at it with me he wouldnt get off the car. i walked over only to stop 10 feet from it. i dont remember seeing any markings on it or windows it looked to be around 15 feet long. what i thought was strange it didnt make any noise im still trying to remember if lights were flashing on the side. it stayed there maybe 2 min. then moved away slowly behind a garage and trees. i walked around the garage only to see it was gone. i walked back to the car where mark was, sat on the hood and talked about what we saw. at that time it was getting really dark out think it was around 10:00.There was a big field across marks sisters apt. and we saw a huge ufo it had to be at least 300 feet long. at this time we were getting a little scared. we ran inside to wake up marks brother inlaw he walked out to the back door looking at this large ufo. he didnt say one word turned around and went back to bed. we called one of our friends and told him what we saw. he thought we were making fun of him... he was into ufo's reading books and all, we used to tease him about it. anyway mark told him to go outside and watch for flying saucers. we went back outside they were all gone we sat outside for awhile longer but didnt see nothing. nor did our friend dave. the next day we told everyone what we had seen. i dont have to tell you what they thought... but the next day people started calling in about ufo's they saw the night before.  jim r.  this happend in 1975 ","distance":"20 Feet or

shoreline of lake huron.\r\n\r\nat approximately 10:30pm, i received a voicemail on my cell phone an exited the cabin to listen.  as i was listening to the voicemail and looking out over lake huron, i started to notice stationary \"yellowish/orange\" lights.  these lights would turn on for about 5-10 seconds and then turn off.  the lights were bright enough to cast a reflection on the lake.  once the light turn off another light would turn on in a slightly different location, maybe next adjacent to the 1st light or down the shoreline a short distance.  i called my family out and we watched for about 20 minutes and saw about 30-40 lights.  \r\n\r\nthe lights were located due east over the lake and approximately 30 degrees up the night sky.  in the sky to the se was a very visible star/planet, whose light was bright white and was the brightest object in the eastern sky.  my flashing lights were approximately the same height in the sky.\r\n\r\nafter about 20 minutes another couple that was having a bonfire on the beach joined us and said they had been watching the light for about an hour.  at this point a single light turned on directly east of us.  as we watched 2 more lights turned on, one on either side of the original and parralell to the ground.  then two more lights turned on, again one on either side of the now three lights.  this created 5 lines in a straightline, parralell to the ground.  these lights stayed on for a few seconds and then contracted back to the single point of light and turned off.  my daughter then was freaked out so we went in for the night.\r\n\r\ni know that the annual meteor shower had happened the night before so i assumed that is what we say.  but these lights were fixed in place and were perfectly round.  no what i would expect from a meteor shower.\r\n\r\nthey were more like lights on an anchored boat, but were far too high in sky to be a boat.\r\n\r\ni know that the old air force base in oscoda, mi is closed, but was being used that night for training exercises between the us and dutch air force.  we heard and saw military planes during the day.  these planes are moving and very load.  our lights were not moving and completely silent.\r\n\r\non the following monday, i called the oscoda and alcona county police to see if anyone had reported this event.  both reported that no other reports were made.\r\n\r\ni have a technical background and always try to look for a logical explaination.  at this point, i have eliminated the
