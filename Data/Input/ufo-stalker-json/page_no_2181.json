orb darting above that seemed to change size and shape 'it got bigger and the light was blinding and i felt heat. it hovered right above me and i remember thinking how quiet it was. then the thing by the bush turned into a smaller orb about the size of a basketball and shot into the air towards the big orb which started pulsing they merged, pulsed real bright,then vanished in a streak.Then my dog came out it was trembling and had a round burn on his nose like a car lighter would leave and the tip of his ear was missing but not bleeding.  when i pulled myself togeather we ran home and told my family and everyone laughed even when they saw the dogs was hurt. my parents tried to convince me that the dog tangled with a raccoon but i know what i saw and the dog would pull back and refuse to

at the tables around me are talking about. i also can play the piano and organ by ear and  can see auras and the list goes on. i also have had this feeling of expectation which grows stronger the

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Orange ball-[corrected]\r\n\r\n   approaching the top of hill street (looking up) i noticed a descending orange ball atop pa rte 247 headed toward the little league municipal ball park hidden in the very low lying storm clouds as it had down poured 3 hours earlier that evening as said clouds were up against this area of moosic mountain and it was about to down pour again.\r\n   the low lying clouds appeared as a dense light grey fog and the orange ball was floating downwardly glowing like a descending parachute with a flare attached like used in the military.\r\n   my first thought was it ti be an approaching plane headed into the scranton/wilkes-barre international airport upon clearing the archbald salem mountain (elev 2200')omni guidance tower, but orange ball was under (elev 2000')the norm for such approaching air traffic.\r\n   i waited for it to change direction from east to south west, usually done at this point; however! it never did? i then realized that this was something different!\r\n   when i stopped at the last stop sign the clock was 9:14 pm luppini time (found only in jessup, pa). i traveled about 600 feet or so and pulled over just as anothe car passed me parking across from an inspection garage station.\r\n   i got out of the car as the orange ball was descending toward the ball park's high tension power line that cut right throught the middle of the three field stadium.\r\n   i could hear an electronic type crackeling (like a mosqueto zapper)uninterupted as it approached in the still quiet night.\r\n   luckily a sliver opened up in the dense clouds giving me a clear view.\r\n   the orange ball was heading toward the top of the high tension tower lines for sure.\r\n   i was now looking straight up under the orange ball as if it was an ultra-lite aircraft.\r\n   it was stepping downwardly by going forward and slightly upwardly in a floating jerking type motion out about fifty feet or so and then dropping down rappedly on a very steep slope 70 or 80 ft. or so and then stopping (similar to a mountain climber descending a very steep incline).\r\n   it was aware of my presene and acted extremely cautions! i observed this repitive process for about 8 to 10 descending downward steps as it now had come down to about elevation 800' and was still descending.\r\n   i rushed back into the car's back seat to retrive an old camera on the floor in a box with other materials finding the 35 mm camera and immediately tried to get a shot unable to see well enough to properly focus an set it in the dark.\r\n   i missed the orange ball at its lowest point because it was now stepping back upwardly at a very steep angle as i tried to take the shot!\r\n   while attempting a second shot the down pour let lose unbelievably!\r\n   the clouds immediately closed the sliver type opening as i dove in the car with camera all wet.\r\n   when first observed the orange ball appeared to be about 1/2 the size of a car(2,000' elev) and then at the low point (500'elev.) it appeared to be jus about the size of a car.\r\n   it was kinda of multi layered colored as follows: 1)black nose in front, 2)then dark red behind that, 3)then bright red behind that, 4)then dark orange behind that, 5)then bright orange behind that, and finally 6) extremely bright bright white light behind that!\r\n   it made no noise with exeption for a crackling and moved in a slow floating type motion very cautiously.\r\n   as i think it was gathering all available emfs from atop the high tension electrical power lines maybe like recharging itself!\r\n   others last 4th of july (2008) reported it both before and after the comunity fire works display withh 4-5 witnesses in each group.\r\n   over the past 40 years their have been numerous white blob sightings usually under elevation 200'in the upper lackawanna river basin.\r\n   i felt as if it was alive as it acted like an animal being feed from your back porch steps as it was so timmed and caution and careful probably due to poor visibility and trying to avoid contact with the high tension power lines but had to recharge or maybe die!\r\n   i only wish i had my binoculars as i could have really seened the details at it lowest point estimated a 400 feet.\r\n   i then went down hill street to the convient mart to see if the cops were on their coffee break but! no one was to be found.\r\n   i then proceede to frank's in simpson for a late snack, another area where some type of ufos seem to come and go up the lackawanna river basin toward the head waters in arart, pa their apparant area of interest when traveling through!\r\n\r\n   the total time of this sighting was about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\njoseph r. caterina, pe\r\nc/o 419 simpson street\r\npeckville, pa

it was out of my sight. i did not even think to get my camcorder and get pictures as i was spellbound by what everyone was seeing. the sighting was not what affected me but what was going on in the fantail ( for lack of a better word)of the craft or crafts as we ( my brother & i) saw white or silver dots moving rapidly about within the plume behind the point or front. as one moving dot matched the front for a short time and did a 270 degree about face back into the plume and immediately returned to its previous position at the front. i have been around aircraft all my life and i do not know of anything capable of these abrupt and very quick direction changes much less the speeds they were going. at that time a cluster of flashing lights or explosions went off where the large part of the plume or fantail was. there were other smaller moving white dots in the frey going in all different directions (i can relate this to a scene from star wars when luke was watching his fleet get annihilated). sort of what a cluster bomb would look like when exploding in air. my brother and i saw this through 70 power binoculars and could see very sharp details. everyone else had no visual augmentation but could see clearly what was up there. \r\n whatever was happening had nothing to do with this planet as it was so large and so far out. we could see other local aircraft from the airport at different altitudes. i'm no dummy and i know some truth about reality. i file this report to get this off my chest. i want everyone to know. \r\nthank you, steve

toward the ball parks high tension power lines that cut through the top area of the three field park.\r\n   i could hear a electonic cracking noise like a mosqueto zapper uninterupted as it approach in the still quiet night!\r\n   a sliver in the clouds opened up as i now had a clear shot!\r\n   it was headed toward the tops of the high tension lines for sure!\r\n   i was now looking straight up under it as if it were an ultra-lite aircraft.\r\n   it was stepping downwardly by going forward and slightly upward in a jerking type motion about 50 feet and then dropping down at a steep slope very rappedly and then stopping.)similar to a moutain climber decending a steep incline).\r\n   it was very very cautious and i believe aware of my presence. i observed this for about 8 to 10 downward

 we start to think that maybe it is a train, with one large light on the front, but then realize that a train wouldnt cross the interstate.  it stays in the eastbound lane heading west for about 10 minutes or so, and then comes back into the westbound lane behind me once again.\r\n\r\nat this time, we're totally baffled by what it can be.  i tell my wife that i'm going to stop the car and see if it catches up to us.  she tells me this isnt a good idea on an interstate, but i stop the car anyway, against her wishes.  it had been following us for so long, and hadnt gained on us much at all.\r\n\r\nso i stop the car, in the middle of the interstate, and the huge light appears to stop as well.  we turn in our seats and stare out the back wind shield.  we're totally baffled by what it could be at this point.  i was still clinging to the idea of \"train\" until i stopped the car and it stopped behind us.  at the stopped position, i'd estimate that it was a mile or so behind us, and huge.  and bright.  the light never blinked or faltered. constant and very bright.\r\n\r\ni start moving again, and it maintains this distance for 5 or 10 more minutes.  it shoots back across the interstate into the east bound lane headed west a few more times, before it shoots back into the west bound lane behind me, and then off into the trees that line the interstate and it was gone.\r\n\r\nwe didnt see the object again until about 15 minutes later when we were exiting i-16 onto highway 96.  upon exiting, while driving up the exit ramp, a huge light flashed on and back off very quickly about three times.  it was so bright that everything was light.  it was as if someone was playing with the stadium light switch, only the stadium lights were positioned in the trees along side the exit ramp and aimed directly at my car. flash flash flash in succession, very quickly.  and then it was gone.  \r\n\r\nwe talked about this with one another, my wife and i, for the next week or so.  we couldnt wrap our mind around it then, and still cant today.  i wish i would have been paying closer attention to the clock.  if there was any missed time, i'm unaware, and if we were contacted, i cant remember.  these are the actual events and i have been very reluctant to talk about it until now.  i would be willing to recount this story to a mufon investigator.","distance":"501

but is does look interesting. when i took this photo i only seen the bird. but i do remember lots of bugs flying around, so that is what i figure it was. and possably many photo's are the same if i'm right. i shot this with a panasonic dmc-fz30 focal length 43.3mm. i know this for fact because i looked up the details in the photo today to find the proper date and it also had some other info in the photo.\r\n although i do believe in ufo's i really don't think this is more then a fly or something in that nature. but back in 1978 or 79 my exwife and i seen an incredible amount of flying lights of crows nest lake in alberta canada. i was going to pull over and have a look but my exwife reached over with her foot and laid on the gas. this took place at about 2am i believe it was the fall of 78 or spring of 79. i son't quit remember. but our son was under a year old and we traveled to alberta to see a eye specialist for him. i have always wondered what we seen. there were hunderds of light flooting in the sky made it look like it was just about daytime.\r\n this is why i do believe but never was able to see a shape of what i saw so how knows. but i truly believe the object in the bird photo is nothing more then a bug flying by. i actually named this photo ufo. and i posted it on rendersity under the user name michif. i also said in that posting that i believe it to be a bug flying

a year ago.  the first weekend in august of 2008 i received a phone call from a friend of mine at about 10:30 pm mst.  he told me that he was all of a sudden a believer like me.  i couldn't believe what i was hearing because he was as much of a sceptic as anyone.  he told me he had just witnessed two bright objects in the sky, which at first he thought was an airplane, that was until they spread apart and one became brighter than the other.  i got pretty excited and i went out onto my deck to see if i could observe this and it wasn't three minutes later that i spotted something high in the sky.  now this event occurred in duchess alberta, the object was moving south to north and it looked like a satellite; only without blinking lights.  all of a sudden another object with the very same characteristics crossed the first objects' path going west to east, as i looked around the clear starry sky i spotted no less than six of these objects in a 15 minute span moving in every possible direction.  i was so amazed that i woke up my 7 month pregnant wife (who is also a sceptic) to come take a look.  at first she tried to pass it off as a plane, but when a real plane flew over head she could clearly see the difference.  we watched these things almost every night for the whole month of august, not even exaggerating, and then we moved an hour north to my current resident in hanna.  the recent sighting i'm reporting is the same objects, a couple of peculiar things happened on this night, my wide and i were out on the deck again and watching the very starry sky and not to our surprise we spotted a lot of these star like objects flying around, one crossed flight paths with a jet, it was obviously at a higher altitude, but as it crossed the path of the plane it lit up brighter than every other star in the sky, then it went dim and carried on.  a few minutes later i witnessed two of these objects moving from south to north in unison, always keeping the same distance between them, i was curious to know if it was two ends to the same object, so i watched it until i could see a star in between them and i did.  i know this is long winded, but i've witnessed probably 200 or more of these things over the past year and i have no explanation.  the night i am reporting about, i counted 18 in less than 30 minutes.","distance":"Over One

saw a huge, orange, glowing ball rise straight up in the air from the distance of about a mile. i gasped and everyone turned and looked. there was another group of people on the beach sitting several yards away, and they also saw it and began yelling. at first i thought it was a meteor on fire, although it didnt have a tail, and began gaining, rather than losing altitude.\r\n    after rising into the air, it began travelling parallel to the beach, heading directly towards us. it must of been at a very high altitude because a commercial plane passed beneath it, and you could tell the object was much higher than the plane, but still massive. \r\n    it soon was directly overhead, and you could see the bottom of it, shaped like a disc, and lit up entirely orange. the light seemed to be pulsating. after it passed over head it took a sharp upward turn, and we watched go higher and higher, so high that it was the size pinprick when it dissapeared. when we first saw it it was bigger than a beach ball. \r\n    when kit began travelling towards us we were all freaked out, and i ran towards it so i could see it from a different angle, to see if it was possibly a plane,which it was pretty obvious it wasnt ( the light was orange as opposed to white, and once i saw it from directly beneath it it was clearly some sort of circle). simply put, it was a huge glowing ball, with what appeared to be a sold epicenter that was giving off the light.
