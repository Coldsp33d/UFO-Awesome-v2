mind.\r\ni live in phoenix arizona and i was looking southeast at jupiter with binoculars around 9 p.M. when flashing lights came across my field of view.  i looked up and saw something moving with red,white and bluish strobing lights.  i looked through the binoculars and it was not an airplane. all you could see were the flashing lights and it moved a little erratically--in other words not a real straight path.  i followed it as it moved from south to north.  then, suddenly, it stopped, turned a pinkish orange and began moving south ! this was not a helicopter either.  i lost view of it because my patio cover was in the way.  as i began looking for it again i noticed more than one of these strobe like things moving through the sky. the lights would flash in groups of 6 or more and then stop and start again--unlike airplanes. when they started again they had moved.  i called ray out to watch with me.  he didn't believe me at first, but now he does !!  my neck was getting strained, so i pulled out a lounge chair and laid on it looking up with the binoculars.  now this really freaked me out--a white orb looking thing, (did not seem solid) much bigger than the stars i was looking at and closer, moved across my field of vision.  \"oh my god, what's that?\" i said.  i followed it through the binoculars as it moved from east to west and then it suddenly turned into these flashing lights right in front of my eyes !!!   i was utterly amazed !!!  what was i seeing?  ray and i watched the lights move around the sky--unsure if it was a few that kept moving to different spots or if there were many. we saw them in every direction at one time or another.  my grown son came home around 9:30 pm and watched with us.  he has been seeing alot of these same lights late at night when he comes home between 2-4 am and had told us earlier in the day he saw them in groups or clusters in the east and west the night before. i went inside to get my telescope but i just couldn't adjust it fast enough to take a closer look.    when we saw two of them follow an airplane that was heading west from the airport, we got a little worried.  there was never any sound coming from them. it was so hard to judge their distance.  around 10 p.M. all of the activity stopped.  i have looked the last two nights and have seen nothing like it.  i was just so glad that someone was home with me to watch. ray said he felt priveleged to see such a thing.  i thought it was exhilerating and scarey at the same time.  next time---we'll bring out the video camera.  if there is a next time !!!  did anyone else see this???  listen folks, we have visitors, and i felt like they wanted us to see them.  thanks for letting me share my experience.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

from vacationing in northern vermont.  \r\n\r\nstaying at a camp ground on the north end of harvey's lake in the town of west barnett. i woke up around 5:30 am. grabbed my smokes and camera and stepped out to the deck of the trailer we were using. there was a fog rising off the lake and most of roy mountain directly south was already 90% covered in fog. also a couple of men were in a small boat already on the lake. very picturesque so i took one photo, stepped a few paces forward and took two more photos.  it was the first photo dscn0402 that the object appears. the other two photos taken moments later [perhaps 15-25 secs] did not have this bell shaped object.\r\n\r\ni then decided to capture some video with this camera because it was so quiet and still on the lake. because the camera is new and had only tried the video feature once before i did a test of the camera in video mode. this test only lasted 2 seconds but captured something moving at incredible speed across the sky and out of sight in only 12 frames or less than a half second.\r\n\r\ni didn't consciously see or hear either of these events despite the fact i was gazing directly at this direction. i can't

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was returning home from a fishing trip at lake morena (which is along the mexican border about half way between san diego and arizona border) and was on a dirt road which winds behind the lake when my car bottomed out in a gully at the edge of a large meadow and got stuck. the time was about 10 p.M. and the date was some time early july of 1999. i got out of my vehicle, grabbed a small shovel out of my trunk and began the task of digging my back tires out of the rut. after about 20 minutes i stopped to take a break and smoke a cigarette. as i did this i noticed a bright light zig-zagging up and down along the side of a nearby mountain, shining a spotlight in a sweeping motion across the side of the mountain. at first i didnt give it a second thought, as i assummed it was a border patrol helicoptor searching for illegal immigrants. they are a common sight here, since we are so close to the border of mexico. after finishing my cigarette and a bottle of water i went back to work with the shovel and after about 15 minutes more i decided to get behind the wheel and try to drive out of the gully. as i opened the drivers door  my eye caught something in the air just to my right. it was a bright white orb that was maybe 4 or 5 feet in diameter. it made no sound whatsoever, and was hovering stationary, making no movements at all. it was only about 40 or 50 feet away from me and was about 25 feet from the ground. (and let me make one thing clear, it was not a helicoptor)i stared at it for maybe 10 seconds or so and then for reasons i still dont understand, i began to walk towards it. i do remember not feeling threatened in any way. and i believe i took about 10 steps toward it when suddenly a blue beam of light shot straight down below the orb and in a sweeping motion shot right into my eyes. (it had the characteristics of a laser and i could see particles swirling inside it, and iam guessing it was maybe 2 inches in diameter). i put my hands in front of my face to protect myself and for a second saw nothing but blue all around me. when i coud tell it wasnt directly in my eyes any more i lowered my hands in time to see the beam do something very strange, it did not cut off or wink out like a normal light would, it actually retreated back into the bottom of the orb as if it was on a string. i know it sounds crazy and light is not capable of doing this, but nontheless i witnessed it, and i dont think my description is doing it justice. as soon as the beam retreated back into the orb it began to slowly glide to my right which was southeast. i watched it until it began to round a bend with a lot of tree cover, but before it went out of sight it shot out a brilliant spotlight towards the south that momentarily lit everything up brighter then daylight and then it dissappeared behing the trees. iam fairly certain now that the light i saw zig-zagging up and down the side of the mountain was the same orb that i witnessed in the meadow.\r\nas the years have passed and i have had lots of time to go over this event in my head, one thing that puzzles me about it was my complete lack of excitement immediately after it happened, i just felt tired and kind of \"blah\". in fact i dont recall even thinking twice about it until the next day. i told a couple friends and they just laughed and kind of rolled their eyes and thats when i decided i wasnt going to say anything about it after that.  i cant really explain it but as i thought about it more and more as time passed the whole event began to remind me of looking at a jigsaw puzzle with a piece missing. i know what happened to me but i feel like something is missing. its an odd feeling that i cant really explain the way i'd like to.\r\nanyway, thank you again and god bless","distance":"21-100

called lake morena village just outside of campo, ca. its along the mexican border midway between san diego and the arizona border. it was around 4a.M. and i had just left my house on a short walk to lake morena to do some early morning fishing. while walking down the street i noticed what i first assumed was the moon between some nearby tree tops. it was very big, as the moon often apears here in the mountains. as i looked i noticed it had an odd shape to it. intrigued, i left the road and climbed a small hill with a rock-pile atop it to get a better look. what i saw was a well defined craft. it was v shaped and was luminous. the same color as the moon. it was the most immense thing i have ever seen. iam guessing its distance from me at 20 miles and its altitude at 10,000 feet, iam giving these estimations because it was flying in roughly the same flight path as that used by the commercial airlines that i have seen fly past for years. comparing it to the commercial airliners, iam guessing it was as thick as 5 airliners stacked atop eachother, and atleast 1000 feet long. aside from being luminous it had what appeared to be a luminous mist of some kind which surrounded it and tapered to a point maybe a half mile below it. (it was like a classic tornado shape)which didnt trail behind it but moved along with the craft.(very strange) it moved very slowly from the west to the east, towards arizona. it took about 20 minutes to cross the horizon and was quite a sight to behold.\r\nthank you for your time and god bless \r\n","distance":"Over One

house when i spotted a bright object in the sky about a half mile off, directly ahead of us.  i thought nothing of it at first, thinking it was simply a helicopter or a plane.  i immediately noticed how bright the object was, and that it had a pulsating red light.  at this point i could also see there were two or three seperate white lights.  i drove on, and as we got closer, i could tell the object was not moving.  i asked my friend what she thought about it, and she said she didn't know. at this point we were almost right next to it.  it was hovering above a barn about 100 ft in the air, and we could see a white light shining down on the barn.  we came to a crawl. i turned the music off. we didn't hear any noise, such as a helicopter whirl, but i regrettably did not open the windows.  we were kinda freaked out. a truck drove by in the oncoming lane and it appeared to slow down but i do not know if the driver noticed the object.\r\n\r\nwe drove a little further, and we kinda just looked at each other nervously. i didn't want to believe what i was seeing, but the whole setting just reminded me of something out of the twilight zone or some other 50's era sci-fi movie. she suggested we turn down the first street we saw, so i turned right onto a small country road.  at this point we lost visual sighting of the object and the barn due to houses and foliage.  when we came to a clearing, we saw the barn, but the object was no longer there.  this was no more than a minute after we slowed down to view the object up close. she said she thought she saw it far away, but i wasn't sure that was the same object. we turned around and decided not to go back to the barn. it was late and i wanted to get her and myself home. the whole sighting lasted about 3-5 minutes.  i have

idea what it was that woke me up but i jumped out of bed. for a 57 year old woman, jumping out of bed at 5am is not part of my physical fitness routine..I felt i was still in a waking up mode but went directly to the front door in my pj's and stepped outside onto my porch.  the dogs followed me and went into the yard to do their morning thing.  i thought what the heck am i doing out here in the dark on my porch. i looked at my insulin pump to see what time it was and i thought to myself, wow, what the heck, i could have sleep another 45 minutes or so.  couldn't help but notice the sky was so beautiful, 1/4 moon in the lower eastern sky, you could see the earth's shadow over the moon making it a quarter moon also a bright star not far from the moon. i was in ahh of the sky that early in the morning and felt totally focused on it for some reason. just staring out into the lower sky..Sky looks totally different at that time of the early morning than when around midnight.  you see all clusters of stars and what looked like orion's belt. i seen my older dog sit in the middle of the yard again, as he done this once before with something strange, and he was looking west at something in the sky. just sitting there he was with no movement. that blew my mind.  i yelled at him to tell him to hurry up and do his business. all of a sudden, i felt somebody was speaking to me and was told to look up again..This look up stuff is getting old..The most beautiful whatever was cruising over approx. couple thousand ft. directly over my home. no noise at all, blinding blinding light.  no pulsating lights, just a constant radiating blinding ball of light..Totally white like a brilliant diamond shining.  couldn't even distinguish a shape as it was so bright.  whatever it was was certainly huge.  if i had to estimate a size to the object in the sky it would be 10 times the size of jupiter when she is visible.  i know that i recently had a sighting over the weekend and this is getting more and more strange to me. i feel pretty stupid sending in another report but i feel possibly something is breaking me in for some reason.  i am not frightened now at all thanks to mufon but this year has certainly been a sighting year for me and feel you may find me a nuisance.  i don't like to tell people about these sightings because most are closed minded and believe you are nuts after awhile. i am a very spiritual woman and have been for 17 years.  i don't share that info much either but i feel it has something to do with all this. my spiritual growth is very important to me at this stage in my life.  it seems the more spiritual i become, the more what i use to believe was strangeness and superficial is not strange and superficial at all.  this year has been the real big growth year for me and now all this extracurricular activity is happening to me.  i don't know if a camera with take what i see in the dark sky but i am going to start carrying one with me.  at 5am with a sudden wake up, i would have never thought to grab a camera.  can you tell me what the heck is happening to me?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18731,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.1391375,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08182009-0010","longitude":-86.2166287,"occurred":1250578800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1250578800000,"summary":"Looked

the grocery store. i tend to look at the sky frequently and noticed 4 blinking(they were blinking rather quickly, actually) lights over the mountain. i'd driven down this road in the evening before and had never seen the lights, but i didn't suspect anything weird, i assumed it was one of those light things they put on the top of mountains so that planes don't crash into them. \r\nthen they began to move and i quickly threw that assumption out the window. \r\nthey began separating and 3 of them headed to the left (my left), two of them disappeared and one remained much further than where it started (i can't remember whether or not the other one stayed in the original place, i think it may have). i kept my focus on that one for a good minute, and began thinking maybe they were helicopters. though i don't recall helicopters blinking that quickly, or being able to disappear that fast. i was a little more curious, but still wasn't thinking it was anything too crazy. my focus went back to the original area where i think there were a couple more objects hanging there... i watched then suddenly there were 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. i lost count after 7, because a few objects seem to be blinking in and out of vision. it was a huge cluster, nothing like i've seen. they began making formations, they made about 3-4, maybe 5... i saw a couple of planes/helicopters (it was so far away, it was really hard to tell what i was seeing) fly in that were definitely something i could place as ours. by the time i hit jones, they had mostly separated and dissappeared. though there were some sporadically placed about the sky. i was enthused that the light turn red and i could focus much more on the sky. there ended up being on in the sky sort of above my truck, though, very, very high. in the same height an airplane could be seen at, but it appeared much smaller and i saw no wings, it was still blinking, though much more slowly. it appeared to be white (white light, silver, i don't know.) and was just kind of cruising through the sky. \r\ni don't know if it was extraterrestrial or government, but it was totally cool either way and i was happy to see it! \r\n\r\nunfortunately, i

around, flying a short distance, and then stopped.  it remained still for about two seconds, then took off in a diagonal direction, disappearing in a bright flash just like the first one.

known aircraft.  the lights seemed very high up in altitude and i was unable to ascertain a shape.  it looked like a dim white star and did not fluctuate in its intensity.  i also heard no sounds
