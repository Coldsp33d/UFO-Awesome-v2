first it was the chemtrails. the spraying here has just slowed down in the last few weeks, but it has been constant and heavy since about mid february. i was really alarmed by it and the only reason i know the term \"chemtrail\" is because i started looking into what these planes were spraying. i had never even heard the term before this year. i have lived in pittsburgh my entire life. on the heaviest day of spraying in may i stopped for lunch at burger king in haymaker village. i decided to eat in my car and watch the planes as the sprayed an enormous grid over trafford and monroeville. i was sitting there and trying to figure out what the hell they were doing when something caught my eye near the top of the tree line. it was a dull gun metal black sphere about the size of a large beach ball. it was slowly moving along the tree line straight across from haymaker village. it was not a balloon or some sort of toy. it was controlled and its movement was very smooth and straight. there was no wind that day. i thought this occured in may, but it must have been earlier than that, because there weren't leaves on the trees yet. i kept looking around to see if anyone else saw it and i fwelt like i was going crazy. it appeared to have weight to it, i can't explain it...But i think if it fell out of the sky and hit you on the head you'd have a crushed skull. it was no balloon. i am asuning that it was under military control and that it was a surveliance drone of some kind. maybe to monitor the chemtrail activity\r\n? it really affected me. i used to love walking my dog at night. i have not walked him at night since this event. i walk him in the morning and take him in the yard aty night. i don't like to be out at night for fear one of those things will be around and i won't even know it. i also took down the sheer drapes i had in my apartment and replaced them all with thermaback block out drapes. i have seen the big chemtrail x's and tic tac toe boards. i have seen heavy spraying in monroeville, trafford, murrysville, white oak and north versailles. i have seen black beams of light ( partical beams? )one with a military jet seemingly folllowing the path of the beam across the sky. i have seen pure white unmarked planes and military jets criss crossing the sky. i have watched the military aircraft create the giant x's. i have seen the chemtrail spray turned on and off in mid air-these are not contrails. i also saw one of the white planes vanish in front of my eyes in a clear blue cloudless sky. poof...Gone. like it had been erased. i have seen upside down oily rainbows in the sky. there have been alot of ufo reports out of the area. if anyone would like to talk to me about all or any of this i'd love a sounding board. you can email me at melissaanncan@yahoo.Com. it has been driving me crazy for months. i was so happy to see that someone else has posted about the sphere, although theirs was gray and mine was black. at least i know i'm not losing my mind. i intend to walk my dog at night again...I just have to work up a little more courage!","distance":"101-500

there were also planes in the sky flying overhead toward the airport, but no aircraft flew through the circular lights. i kept waiting for the objects to collide, because they were flying so closely past each other. i thought the objects may have been private planes or test flights, but the more i looked at them, there were too many and they were flying to dangerously to be test flights. i also thought maybe it was some kind of laser or light show, but it was very cloudy and i saw no beams. the movement of these objects reminding me of the movement of fireflies. i was curious but not afraid

no clouds that night.  i took 3 pics.  one while light blinked off, this shows an obvious solid object in the sky the fits the normal description of a ufo.  it is plain as day to me, but others may have their doubts.  the pics while the lights were on were odd-shaped, and different both times.  the object, though, is still lit up maybe from inside or the light was dimmed for some reason.  i am an avid \"sky-watcher\" and that is why i got a digital camera.  this is great for me, however, i have a computer from 1999 or 2000 and none of the software works so i cannot send the pics.  what should i do about that? i am going to try a friend's computer and see if i can send the pics from there.  it is important to me to get this out so if it is okay i will fill out another form here if i need to.  i was astonished the an hour later when i noticed it just may be a ufo!  everyone knows i would not make this up, so the picture is true and so is the story, and that makes me watch the sky even longer now! i will go to the nearest photo shop tomorrow and get these printed out.  there is also another pic i just noticed of a gray orb with almost symmetrical designs in it, it was in the

through my sky scout and noticed a ball of light streaking accross the sky, just like a satellite would. i notice that it was moving and flying in pattern that satellites don't. it from southeran sky to the north then erratic flying including altitude changes. this lasted for 15 minutes before it disappeared. i sat back down in my lawn chair and started to notice flashing lights from a plane, they were jets from lafb. there was at least 6 jets flying in teams of two very high and very fast towards the north sky, i stood up and looked at them and then noticed that they were following the ball of light that had returned. another interesting \r\nthing i observed, the fighter jets would turn off their blinking light when they were trying to chase this ball of light. the ball of light, from my perspective appeared to fly out into space. i would lose track the jet but after 30 minutes i could see them in pairs of two flying around the valley.\r\n\r\nnot much too describe about the ball of light. it appeared to be the same size as jupiter but had an orange tint to it's light. it was able fly really fast and several times it flew out of sight and would reappear. i quickly learned that by

have a habit since my last sighting that was close and so so mind blowing, of watching the sky.  took me a bit of time to come back outside and scan the skies after the triangle sighting few months ago..Kinda gives you a wow moment to see a strange craft closer than you think it should be.  had to deal with that experience in my adult life.  i also had one when i was a child but that one was easier to take.  i have already shared those experiences with mufon.  had a strange strong weird feeling i should look up at the sky. the feeling was like i was being asked to.  that definately was a weird feeling.   i looked up and saw a little star moving at a good rate of speed. it was very tiny. not something someone would notice because it was so dim but moving.  out of all the big expansive sky, i looked directly at this tiny tiny moving light and just kept staring at it..It was way way up there like it was meant to fit in with the stars.  all of a sudden it stopped directly within my sight and morph up with light brighter than the largest brightest star in the sky at the time.  i thought it was coming down towards us and that is why it was getting brighter but it wasn't..After a minute of putting on a good show of pulsating blinding light, it dimmed out and went on towards the southeast.  i had this happen to me couple months ago and we started waiving to the craft way up there thinking it would never know we were waving and saying hello.  that way up sighting was followed up with a low low triangle slow slow fly over 30 minutes later the very same evening.  my neighbor said last night,  are they saying hello again as this seems weird for things like this to happen right in front of your face.  guess they could be saying hello..Last night the star was like the craft that fly over the james gilliland ranch in wa state and get very bright and huge..Just wanted you to know i am back outside and have accepted what i see and i can't explain is no reason for

brightly shining orbs in the distance to my right. they were vertically parallel, and the bottom one was slightly bigger (ie. closer). because i'm deathly curious and and a ufo/alien fanatic, i immediately turned in that direction. gradually the bottom orb increased in size as i twisted through the neighborhood i'd entered, and before i knew it i was almost directly beneath it.\r\n\r\nno longer appearing as an orb, the ufo was extremely close enough to the ground; i'm not great with measuring distances, but to give you an idea, to my vision it was about the size of making circle with your index finger and thumb. it was rather egg-shaped, if the egg were on its side, and it appeared to be black, although it's hard to distinguish color at night. i remember the arrangement of the ship's lights looking rather like three, bright bug-eyes.\r\n\r\nas i raced through the suburban streets to keep pursuit, the ufo slowly flew overhead at a constant pace. eventually it decided it was done there (or as i like to believe, wanted to lose me) and picked up speed so it was impossible to continue the chase. i watched it fly away from me, and suddenly it was above the hills on the far side of town.\r\n\r\nhopeful to see more, i drove in that direction, and during this drive i saw two more very shiny orbs hovering on either end of town. after waking up another space-loving friend of mine to watch the two, i changed course for a nearby set of hills one of them seemed to be over. when the orb didn't get any bigger after a short hike, i gave up, but from that hill i had a fantastic view of one of the ufos directly above the center of the valley.\r\n\r\nas the sun was coming up around 6am, i finally drove back to my home on the outskirts of town only to clearly see one of the ufos directly above the neighboring town of livermore in the morning sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18680,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.6692512,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08152009-0004","longitude":-121.8668789,"occurred":1250233200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1250233200000,"summary":"Three

video on a larger screen the object that i have on tape is more than an ordinary bight star, it has a distinct diamond/saucer shape with the light or lights circling the center of the object and exposing a perfect silouet of the top and bottom of this object. while tonight object didnt have the wow factor that the object i taped on 8/13 it was still impressive and is something that needs to be investigated by someone with a little more knowledge of ufo etc. thewse sighting have me a little scared nervous!

of 51st street and south lewis.  we stopped at the traffic light for a few minutes and both noticed a bright flashing white light, about the intensity of a commercial aircraft landing light but it appeared to be a tad brighter.  it was just over the power lines in the distance, slightly to the east of lewis avenue.  my first thought, because of altitude and where it appeared (near jenks airport and close to flight path for tulsa airport), that it was a commercial jet on approach but upon seeing the white flashing light, i knew it was something else.  the light appeared to be stationary in the sky.  our next thought was it could be a antenna light on top of a building, but they are always red and i had never seen this light before at night.  it was flashing on and off every 2 seconds.  the flashing pattern was similar to a light at the top of a tower.  as we continued driving towards home, we watched the light and it was not moving.  so we decided to check it out.\r\n\r\nwe drove south on lewis toward east 61st street and the light appeared to be stationary just in front and above us, at the west edge of the southern hills golf course and slightly east of lewis avenue.  a helicopter flew underneath the light at a lower altitude from east to west and began a circle to the south.  as we got closer, the light appeared to have projections (wings?) on both sides of the light.  at the end of each projection was a red light with a green light beside it.  keeping an eye on the light, which was now directly above us and slightly to our left, i opened my window and we pulled into the bank parking lot just south of 61st as i opened the sunroof for a better look.  we stopped in the parking lot within a few seconds after turning off lewis and looked up at the light.  nothing.  it was gone.  we scanned the sky around us and saw nothing.  we heard no sound from it.  after setting for a few minutes trying to figure out where it went and what we saw, we noticed the helicopter flying by in the distance and heading north, leaving the area.  the weather was clear and i don't think the moon had risen yet.\r\n\r\nbut this is not the end of the story.\r\n\r\ni was laying in bed at about 11:00pm later that night and couldn't sleep.  the blinds were open.  with the blinds open, i have a good view of the southwest portion of the sky.  i have seen, at night, helicopters flying overhead, some using search lights (probably police helicopters), and an occassional plane going to jenks airport.  they are easily heard as they pass overhead.  well, this time i saw something i haven't seen before.  at a very low altitude, i saw what looked like two bright headlights of a car, with a space between the lights (like a car) and a faint blinking red light between the bright lights.  it flew over the house at a relatively slow speed, but faster than, say, a helicopter.  and unlike other craft i've seen passing by, it was completely silent.  i hopped up and ran to the backyard but it was gone and it did not return while i was awake.\r\n\r\nend of report.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18675,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.1615616,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08142009-0020","longitude":-95.982845,"occurred":1250223600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Oklahoma","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1250223600000,"summary":"Stationary

orange ball.  it appeared to be stationary and i thought to myself that it was strange that i never noticed that object before.  then it occurred to me that this object had never been there before so i began to try to determine if it was moving.  \r\n\r\ninitially, it appeared to me to have three streaks of orange light emanating from the bottom.  at no time did i hear any sounds except for those of the cars driving along the street.  if i had to compare it to a real life object, i would compare it to a bright orange, luminous hot air balloon.\r\n\r\ni walked southward and could not discern if it was moving in the opposite direction than i was walking or if it was stationary.  i continued to look away in the direction i was walking and then look back.  during this process of my looking away and looking back, it seemed as if the object changed it's position in the sky by about 100 feet during the moments that i was not watching it.  the object continued to be about parallel with me as i walked.  i would continue to turn my head and check on it every few feet and it did appear to be moving very, very slowly.  then, when i turned to check again, it was so far away that it only appeared as if three small points of light consisting of two red and one yellow.  \r\n\r\ni figured that the experience had concluded and i began walking back toward my street.  it was not much more than one to two minutes later that i felt the urge to turn around and there it was again hovering over the treetops of the houses across the street.  as before, it was either stationary or moving very slowly.  i watched as i walked and kept trying to find a plausible explanation for this orange light.  as i continued on my route back home i lost sight of it due to trees obscuring my view.
