was fishing with a group of friends in the tofino area we where trolling for salmon at the time, caught a 32lb fish ;d\r\nwe made a break for lunch on a local beach after we docked the boat we went back to our campsite grabbed our bbq and surf boards and hung out on the beach for the rest of the afternoon surfing eating our freshly caught salmon had a fire and just hung out for the rest of the day and part of the night.\r\nthat 'night' was a full moon so myself and my friend \"n\" decided we would surf throughout the night with the ocean being kind of illuminated we got some good waves in a couple nice wipe outs :d but for the most part it was fun now at around 11:00 - 12:00 not 100% sure what time it was just guessing i observed what i had thought was a 'satalight' joking i told \"n\" \"look a ufo\" he laughed said 'yeah nice satalight at this point we where still in the ocean in the 'lineup' and wernt really paying much attention to the sky we rode another wave in close to the beach i was getting sick of the cold ocean and bad wave breaks and we decided to go back to our camp site. once we where on the beach i was taking my leash off and felt compelled to look into the sky again and the 'satalight' we had thought was orbiting our planet was now 5 - 6 \"satalights\" with no color / shape that i could make out at the time because of the distance they where no longer orbiting i told \"n\" to look up he could not believe what he was seeing neither could i being curious i went into my bag that was laying on the beach took my flashlight out and started flashing at the \"craft\" satalight what ever all 5 or 6 of the craft completely vanished without any explanation and 1 appeared directly over the ocean infront of us i'm not talking \"quick movement\" hazy vision of the object i mean in the blink of an eye it went from a small cluster of weird [cms/tg/pd] in the sky to being directly in front of our faces i cannot explain to you how the object looked in terms that i truly understand all i can say is when it appeared infront of us where the waves where breaking over the ocean it looked like molten lava and was changing colors rapidly from an almost liquid magma red with tons of movment around the body of it to an almost white color overtime then it was almost blinding the only way i can explain it in the phase that it stayed after a few minutes of doing some weird [cms/tg/pd] when it appeared is the most shiny sliver metallic look i've ever seen in my life it looked like a ring polished to perfection. at this point \"n\" was telling me to run i told him to go to the campsite and grab the camera i ran into the tree line behind us scared for my life actually yelling at \"n\" saying \"grab the [cms/tg/pd] camera\" i kept watching this 'thing above the ocean' it couldent have been more than 300 ft from me \"n\" came running back saying i got the camera i got the camera, now what i'm about to tell you i'm going to assume that you are a legit research group mufon i've spent the last 2 months researching \"ufo\" space etc etc etc, not knowing what to do with what me and my friend came across and the footage / material we obtained being afraid and we'll the story and footage and thing that was given to us sounds and looks completely [cms/tg/pd] nuts =\\\r\nwe started recording this 'craft' walking back onto the beach and what happend next changed my life and everything i ever believed or thought was possible. i grabbed my flashlight and started flashing it at the craft again trying to get the attention of what ever the [cms/tg/pd] was above us we stood there filming for about 5 - 10 minutes and nothing happened then suddenly the craft that looked to me like something out of startrek and was giant in size opened on the right side of it and another small craft came flying out of it the noise the larger craft was making i can't explain it almost sounded like how a 'frequency' would sound i guess it was alien to me the noise it was making this 2nd craft that came out was the same shiny metallic silver as the larger one it approached us and hovered above the sand in front of us about 1 inch possibly off of the beach now this is where the story gets a little bit unbelievable but keep in mind we have good footage of this not a shaky blury image but actual footage of almost the entire event. a person came out of the 2nd craft and when i say person i mean human an actually person not one of these grey looking big eyed aliens people get 'abducted' bye or some martian looking thing it had eyes ears a nose feet hands etc the only difference was she had absolutely no hair what so ever it approached us \"n\" looked at me and said \"[cms/tg/pd] run\" i said no wait wait this person had facial expression i.E emotion etc she had looked just as afraid of us and confused as we where bye her, i looked at this person and said hello thinking possibly it speaks english me being completely nervous and not knowing what to say it then stoped about 3 - 4 feet in front of me and made a weird sound i don't know if she was trying to communicate or what but in any case it was really strange i held my hand out trying to show submission so she didn't think we where 'hostile' she felt my hand / arm her skin almost felt synthetic and she was cold really cold she then felt my hair and wetsuit made another noise and pointed at my flashlight with a 'confused' look on her face at this point i was no longer scared and when i say scared when this 'craft' came onto the beach and the one that hovered above the ocean arrived i can't explain the fear that came over me. its like nothing you will ever feel.\r\n\r\ni picked up the flashlight and she backed up a couple of feet i think she might have thought it was a weapon of some kind i threw it on the ground in front of her and she picked it up examined it and walked back to her 'ship' went inside of it we still stood there filming the hole time saying 'i cant believe my eyes etc' and my friend \"n\" you'll see in the film made a stupid comment saying 'think i could get with her' and i laughed she then came back out of the craft and the same way i gave her the flashlight she through something at my feet i picked it up she then came over and touched my arm again which was really creepy because of the texture of her skin and how cold and pale it was then went back to her craft 'docked' with the larger one and it disappeared again we sat on the beach for another hour or so trying to figure out what the [cms/tg/pd] to do with this circular object she gave us i still to this day have no clue what it is what its used for or anything it has what looks like math all over it and a few strange drawings and you can move it around like a rubik cube we where going to call the military but thought that was a bad idea then we where going to contact the media and send them this thing and the footage anon but thought that was a bad idea as well for the past few months i've had this video and this thing and i don't know what to do with it. please e-mail me back via [cms/tg/pid] and tell me what you think my best option is for this and if there's been anyone else with a similar experience i'm also contacting nasa and possibly the local tofino police

airborn, before it hit the water.\r\n\r\nit was such a sight that emergency rescue and search crews in the area sprung into action and began searching the area using sophisticated sonars and underwater cameras to try and figure out what the object was. even helicopters from the canadian forces base (cfb) in nearby trenton took part. on tuesday at 1:30pm, they discovered an object about 9 meters (30 feet) below the surface, but because of currents and nearby rapids, sending divers down would be extremely dangerous since they would be instantly swept away by the currents.\r\n\r\nthe mystery? authorities and residents have no idea what this object laying at the bottom of the river is. there are no planes missing from the area, no other aircraft like helicopters, etc. are missing. there is no derbis, no oil slick and even space agencies that were contacted said nothing disappeared from orbit.\r\n\r\non tuesday afternoon, ottawa police const. alain boucher said of the object they found on the riverbed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n���the size and the shape doesn���t lead us to believe it���s any piece of an airplane or fuselage or anything like that. it could be a rock, it could be a

11pm. it was a nice night and because i had my dog with me i had the car windows open as i drove back to my house. i was headed north east and as i turned a corner to start going over the bridge i noticed two glowing ovals lifted into the air and going upwards. they weren't going straight upwards, they were going at a 30 degree angle (to the right) into the sky. the ovals were a soft golden color with a white light in the center. they were rising from close to the bottom of the street. \r\n\r\ni kept driving but tried to keep an eye on them at the same time so i could figure out what they were. my fist (and only guess) was that they might be japanese paper lanterns and the glowing center might be a candle. the more i thought about this the less likely it seemed as it was definitely not the neighborhood for anything like that and they were also floating north east, into the wind, there was no flickering if it was a candle and the floated so effortlessly and smoothly againt the wind.\r\n\r\nby now i had driven halfway up the bridge. the orbs were just above the bridge now in height but they had crossed above it and were still gaining height over the river below. they were about the size (not shape) of a football. at this point i had grabbed my camera to take a picture but it would not turn on. there was no low battery signal and it had been working eariler that night but it didn't respond when i tried to turn it on while on the bridge. i keep driving because i did not want to stop on the bridge even though no one else was driving on it. out of the corner of my eye i notice a light and turn my head to the left. right beside my open car window is a third oval floating faster than the others trying to 'catch up'. i could see it through the railings of the bridge until finally it was passing over the two lanes, over my windsheild, past the last lane and then over the river like the other two.\r\n\r\nit made no sound as it came over the car. close up it looked like a box paper lantern with rounded edges. it looked gelatinous with a white glowing center, almost like a jellyfish without a tail or tentacles. i started getting anxious and i was crying. once i got to the bottom of the bridge i turned right around because i wanted my boyfriend to see what i had seen. i drove back downtown where on ellice street there were four cars pulled over on the side of the road. the drivers and passangers were standing on the side of the road looking at the lights. i didn't get out because i was in a rush to get my boyfriend but no one could figure out what exactly was floating in the air. the orbs had gone significantly higher in the sky but were still much larger and brighter than stars.\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend and i could not see them by the time i got him so i went to leave again once i had calmed down. when i got home after midnight and got out of my car i scanned the sky for them. far in the distance now to the north west they were still in the sky. \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

with the \"m\" on it, near casa blanca road and the u.S. air force space command center, i noticed a large, bright red/orange orb of light hovering above the town, to the south west. \r\n\r\ni've seen these flights plenty of times above maricopa, but not for a couple months. i pulled over and stopped the car to determine if the light was moving, but it was staying stationary. i drove in to town and turned right at smith enke road, which is also hwy 238, to head in the direction of the light. i could see the light very clearly, and knew it was straight ahead on my left. once i got pretty close, i pulled over again to get my camera out of my trunk. unfortunately, it was too dark for my camera to focus, and my zoom was not strong enough to take a photo. it was late and dark and i had never been on that road before, so i took out the gps on my phone to see and remember where i was and to approximate the location of the light. i was stopped just a little west of the intersection of 238, green road, and w. smith enke road, with the light appearing just to the south west, approximately at w mcdavid road and white road. after i made note of the locations, the light disappeared. i got back in my car and tried to follow the neighboring roads that would lead to the direction of where i saw the light, but none of the roads were paved. i turned around and started my drive back to town. that was when i looked to my right, in the direction of where the light had been, and i saw on the ground something that looked like a portion, or top, of the red/orange light--only it appeared to be mostly below ground level and surrounded by many, smaller white lights. they were not blinking, but there were many of them, spanning a very large distance. i stopped again to take a photo, but my camera was not able to focus. \r\n\r\nthis morning, i grabbed my binoculars and headed back to the same location to try and see what the area looked liked in the day. i didn't see anything unusual, but i did drive a little farther on the 238. i turned left at n ralston road, which is just west of the area i perceived the light to be hovering. on that road, i saw there is a milky way dairy. i just google-earthed the area, and it's very possible the many white lights i saw last night were from the dairy. but what the heck was that huge red light?

behavior parallel to me, they were moving along with me, i'd drive for a few miles and they would reappear right there with me, they were moving too. they were always brilliant, and always off the ground. i had my camera with me ( which has a little video option on it) and took some video and took a couple pictures of it. i would pull over, film the thing for a bit, get back on the road, pull over, film it again. you can see in the video that it keeps reappearing a few miles down the road just as i am doing. i pulled over to the side of the road about 4 times to catch it on video. by the fourth time i pulled over to film it, i got really anxious and scared, i told myself, enough of this, i cant take this, and drove the rest of the way home. the whole time, looking back, and still seeing it behind me. this thing scared me so bad, that i called my girlfriend and told her i was on my way home and i had to talk to her. when i finally got home, and started telling her the story, i started crying, it was a very scary experience. i have no idea what this thing was. they were two bright bright lights, yellow/orange, off the ground. the light on the top would disappear first then the bottom one. this happened over and over. it seemed to be headed towards south mountain and chandler boulevard. in the video i have attached, was the last video i took before i got uncomfortable.

dove.  it had a blinding light pointed at my car that resembled the spotlight from a helicopter.  this particular aircraft however did not have the signature lights a chopper would so i followed it.  it begun to move north at the speed of a jet airplane; i followed behind northbound on 29th off of dove.  when i approached lark it was already passed 5mi and decided to hover.  it was at that point, looking from lark and 29th, that i could tell it was no chopper.  this aircraft seemed to be in a triangular shape with lights on the edges and bright lights on the 3 corners.  the lights blinked in an odd sequence and in multiple colors.  it seems this aircraft masks itself as a chopper but from certain angles its cloak is rendered useless.  to get a better view i turned westbound on lark as it decided to travel west as well.  as i turned north on ware rd. the aircraft seemed to change shape slowly.  i turned west again on trenton off of ware rd. to follow the aircraft that seemed to be hovering further south west from trenton and ware rd.  once i came within what seemed to be a mile of the aircraft on bentson and trenton the aircraft changed to camouflage perfectly in the sky; it seemed as though i was looking at a star.  within the same moment the craft's lights came back on and it started moving southbound and so did i.  this craft was moving so fast there is no way in hell it was a chopper, at least not one i have ever heard of.  by the time my car traveling at 45mph reached 4mi line the craft was clear into mexico and hovered until it either disappeared or landed.\r\n\r\n20 min later, 9:50pm, i spotted a second aircraft hovering just next to the radio towers on dove in between 23rd and 10th st.  being within 200yrds, i thought the craft clearly resembled a chopper for sure.  by the time i approached the canal eastbound i could see in my mirror that it was no chopper; it was the same type of aircraft from before.  i hit my breaks and turned into the parking lot just west of gold's gym to get a better look at the craft traveling south west from that point.  why would a chopper hover right next to a radio tower in low viability?  they wouldn't.  what was that craft doing? was it government or something else? why did they fly off into mexico?\r\n\r\ni was finally traveling east on fern off of 2nd st. and had a 3rd sighting, this time at a distance.  i saw a third craft hovering next to another radio tower just a few miles east of the second sighting.  this craft resembled the previous 2 in light patterns and flight.\r\n\r\nnone of the 3 crafts were flying in a point a to point b pattern as a chopper would, police or otherwise.  these crafts few as one would for a joyride or sightseeing.  cloaked as a chopper at that.  any explanations?\r\nanybody who has lived in mcallen, tx as long as i have knows you will never see 3 choppers flying within the same 30 min and within a few square miles of visibility.\r\n\r\ni feel as dumb as those cooks that come on tv saying they saw a ufo.  i make fun of those guys; now i am one.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

read an exceptional amount of material on the specific ufo that my brother and i saw, but none have described the level of detail that we were able to discern. we never reported it. i figured i'd finally put it out there and see what others can make of it.\r\n\r\nthe exact date was either april 12th or april 13th, 1997. my old diary has an entry detailing the event, dated april 12th, though i'm not sure if i wrote about it on the actual night or the day after the event occurred.\r\n\r\nit was around 8:00pm. we had to be inside by 8:30, so it couldn't have been after that. my older brother and i were playing hide and seek in the back and front yards. my brother had just caught me and we were getting ready to start another round. \r\n\r\nwhat made us turn our heads towards the sky was the noise. it was an almost inaudible humming, very low pitched and oscillating or pulsing slightly in volume. i remember the pitch and tone with perfect clarity, even after all these years. it was very quiet. i doubt we would have noticed it had we been in the back yard.\r\n\r\nwhat we saw was a dark, triangular object, around the length of a bus. it was flying very slowly -- we could have easily outrun it had we tried. it was directly above the road at an extremely low altitude, so low that its belly was illuminated as it passed over the street lights.\r\n\r\nwe could see in the light that it was, in shape, a perfect triangle with sharp points that curved as they receded towards the top of the craft. the material that it was constructed from was very dark, non reflective and completely smooth. there was a large, spherical object embedded in its center and similar (though smaller) spherical objects near each tip of its triangular frame. these were, in contrast to the rest of the craft, shiny and lighter in color. the finest detail that we noticed were beveled lines that moved out from the center orb to the orbs at each tip.\r\n\r\nthe first emotion i felt was fear. it was overwhelming. the crafts appearance, in conjunction with the strange noise that it made, was extremely ominous. the thoughts that passed through my mind were things like \"shouldn't be seeing this, can't be seeing this, aren't seeing this.\"\r\nafter it passed, my brother told me he'd never felt so frightened in his entire life.\r\n\r\nit was so close that we could have easily thrown and hit it with rocks. my brother, immediately after seeing it, grabbed me from behind and wrapped his arms around my chest in a tight bear hug. he told me that if they take me, they'd have to take him as well. he later told me that he'd seen \"fire in the sky\" weeks before the incident and he thought we were going to be abducted. very humorous in hindsight, though it wasn't funny in the slightest at the time. the words sent a shiver down my spine.\r\nwe watched as it slowly made its way down the street. it disappeared from our view when it passed over a group of trees, heading in the direction of a large, wooded creek area that led to a primary school. that was the last we saw of it.\r\nwe were shocked. when the fear of its close proximity and presence passed, we were completely awe struck. we wanted to see it again. we stayed on our front porch looking at the sky until our parents called us inside. we agreed not to tell anyone about it, including our parents. the reasoning my brother gave that made me come to this conclusion was that \"they\" might not come back and we won't ever see it again if we tell people about it.\r\n\r\nwe've talked about it many times since the event. my brother believes that it's a military black project. i beg to differ in opinion as i can see no logical reason why the military would fly such technologically advanced aircraft at low altitude and speed over a heavily populated suburban area. it goes against the operating procedure of all previously top secret military aircraft.\r\n\r\ni've attached two pictures of a 3d model that i created. it's as close as i can get to what we saw. \r\nalso attached is a sample (in .Mp3 format) that i created in an audio editing program. it is a reproduction of the sound that the craft made.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18653,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-34.0648641,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-08132009-0022","longitude":150.8219119,"occurred":860986800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

yard facing north east watching the pleiades meteor shower. it was around 10:30 pm, edt, it was clear, and we saw quite a few nice examples of meteors, maybe one every two minutes. we were sitting close to the house, with a small window behind us, when i heard our cat meow to us from the window. \r\n            i got up and sweet talked to him through the window, since he is a very needy cat, when my wife said, \"honey! it's a u.F.O.!\". i turned around just in time to see a dimly lit, almost shrouded configuration of three dull amber/brownish lights in the north east sky, and they seemed to be pretty low in altitude. it resembled the effect of some one shining three muted lights in a triangular pattern on a low and overcast sky. it's a tough thing to explain. \r\n         anyway, we ran into the middle of the street which is maybe 50 yards from where we were sitting, and watched the triangular pattern steadily move from east to west to finally be obscurred by a large tree in our yard. \r\n          in the time my wife had seen the object, before i had turned around at her warning of it, she said that it had slowly appeared out of the east and stopped, rotated from a configuratuion of two lights leading a third, to a single light leading the other two. i guess a better description would be to imagine a triangle with a light on all three tips, and having it rotate from the fat side of the triangle facing, to the tip facing. it also seemed to have solid mass in the middle, and not three seperate objects. \r\n         i've seen some unusual things in the sky before in the past, but i was by myself, and could easily rationalise them in my mind as maybe my imagination. but seeing it with some one else, well, it makes it pretty hard to explain away so easily to myself. i definately felt the hair stand up all over my body when we saw it, and i don't feel so nuts since my wife saw it too.","distance":"101-500

saturday.  i was curious if mufon was aware of this case. there has been a report filed with ufo casebook by the person that took the photos of what appears to be a saucer shaped object on a flat bed trailer going down i-20.  there were many witnesses and many called the local radio station 97.9 the beat. people were allegedly forced off the highway by police and the on ramps were blocked.  some witnesses said there were military present and that some of the escort cars were black suv's and hummers.  supposedly, the audio has disappeared, and the radio station refuses to play it again.  there also seems to be police reports made that night about flashes of light and loud booms.  there were fireworks that night, but some are saying it was not fireworks.  i also had a very odd experience approximately 24 hours prior to these photos.  i will file a report if you think this story is worthy of your attention.  i recommend someone there take a look at this on the ufo casebook website as well as the photos i have attached. i would just like to point out something odd about the photos.  all wide load transports are required to have a  \" wide load \" sign, there is not one.  the photos are blurry, but i can see that there is no sign. we need your experts to investigate this, because there are conflicting reports being spread around, and we need someone to get the real facts.  please let me know what you think,so i can file a report on my experience, because i think it could have relevance to the investigation.  thank you very much.\r\n \r\nchristian smith\r\narlington,
