months before my sighting, i had been feeling severly depressed over the fact that the human race and all of the beautiful country and animals could quite possibly be detroyed by us or nature. in fact, i was very troubled about the massive caldura (volcano) under yellowstone park could erupt killing millions. the morning of my sighting, i woke up and heard in my head a voice not my own. this voice said, \"do not worry yourself, if anything did happen, you and the ones you love will be safe.\" immediately, this depression lifted its heavy yolk off my sholders. i became very aware and took these words to heart. i got ready for work and when i went outside to get in my car, that is when i saw the black triangle in the cloud. please look up the details, event sighting date 6-28-08, black triangle, texas\r\n\r\nwell, two days later while i slept in my bed, i was awaken by something in my room. i looked around but couldn't see anything due to a very bright light shining on me. i became aware that i was lying down, but didn't feel that i was in my room. suddenly, i felt a presence over my left shoulder and could feel something touching my left thigh. when i looked up and over my shoulder, i saw three entities standing there. it is hard to describe them, but i would say that they looked like old wrinkly men, sort of like those in the movie fire in the sky.\r\n\r\ni asked them what they were doing and one of them replied, \"we are taking something from you for the future.\" the next thing i remembered was waking up in my bed. i told my mother about this and she said that that night she was sleeping on the floor and she felt herself fighting with something and remembered pulling off tubing attached to her body. she remembers the sensation of being stood straight up and on to her feet from a position where she started on her back.\r\n\r\nthe next night again i dreamed of the light, but this time it seemed even brighter than before. that's all i remebered from that night, but upon telling my mother this, she too saw a bright light from behind her. it was brass/copper color and very intense. i never told her the color and from where it was shining, but it was just like mine that night. i told her hers was the same as mine.\r\n\r\nit's very difficult to describe how i feel about the whole matter. it's freightening and exciting at the same time. i don't feel scared. i'm more afraid of humans than i am of them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18639,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.7688827,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08132009-0008","longitude":-95.3679996,"occurred":1214674200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1214674200000,"summary":"Update:

minutes shooting up there i noticed a dark object moving across the sky from west to east.  it was not moving in a straight line and was changing speeds.  at first, with my bare eyes, i couldn't really make out the shape. it kind of looked like a chopper at first, but did not move like one, nor did it make any noise.  i took as many shots of the object as i could in the 20 seconds or so that i had.  it was so high up that i lost it for awhile, but in the end i managed to get 15 photos of the object. after, i took a closer look at the photos on my computer and quickly realized that i was dealing with 2 ufo's.  another object, even higher and further away, was also captured in the background. also moving, but appeared just as a bright white light.  i could tell it was moving from the landmarks on the ground in the photos. i took all the photos in the same position.  so i know it wasn't a star.  \r\n                    anyway, the object i focused in on was black in color and shaped like an upright cylinder with asymetrical limbs off the sides.  the top of the object had a multi pointed surface like cones or pyramids. there also appeared to be a single reddish light on it as well, but it might have been from a reflection of the sunset.  i only noticed these features after zooming in on the computer.  i will send 3 of the 15 photos to you guys so you can judge for yourself. i can send the rest on your request.\r\n                    i am hoping that i'm not the only one to have seen this.  there must have been tons of people shooting that amazing sunset.

dust from wind i think? but, one \"star\" to the south east very high in the sky caught my eye right away! this star/ufo/? seemed to move higher in the sky and get very small then, it seem to come closer as if it was zooming in like a camera would and get bigger and bright to the naked eye? so i started to video tape it with my sony mini dvd 80x zoom. i taped this thing for a good 30 min-45min zooming in and out, in both night shot mode and regular mode! what i have on tape is incredible to say the least to the naked eye this thing looks like just another big bright star but on tape it has a distinct chevronie/diamond shape from about 30/40x zoom but at 80x zoom this thing takes on a whole different shape, color, and life! it dance like a worm then splits and criss./crosses itself the energy and speed of the light/lights it puts out is unexplainable, then in part of the footage you can see blackshadows on the top and bottom of this thing and the lights seem to dance in  between the 2 shadows? i would like to have someone take a look at my footage and either tell me that my camera was malfuctioning or that my footage is just normal footage of a regular star and that zooming in on star will cause what i have on tape. or that the footage i have is truly unexplainable footage of something not yet known or identified? computer is a mac and my camera is a sony i have tried in the

rural area about ten miles outside of the nearest town (glen rose, tx). i feel this is a relevant sighting especially since a nuclear power plant is located a short ways from where i take residence (comanche peak nuclear power plant). the plant is in fact in veiwing range of my residence since i live on a hill. my house is located just off highway 67. i was outside shooting basketballs for a short time while i noticed an unfamiliar humming noise. i dont think the noise was being emmited from the object directly but actually coming from the object breaking through the thick air. the object was clearly triangle in shape as it blocked out the bright stars and much of the night sky. small lights could be seen flickering as would a light on an airliner's wing tip. there were only blue, red, and white lights emmiting from the objects underside. it was flying directly perpindicular to the highway as it slowly made its way out of sight. as to its hight off the ground, i could safely say it was about 60-70 feet up. i feel this is a good estimate in correlation to my house and it seemed to be just above the roof. i felt no emotional distress nor anxiety as the object passed over my head, only intrigue. the object flew in a straight line. in a mere five minutes the object faded out of sight, oddly in a direction that would pass within a few miles of the nuclear power plant. i have spoken to many members of our community about my sighting and most can tell me about their own strange occurences in the region. the object was clearly solid and made of a metallic substance. it flew apprx. 40 miles an hour and very smoothely. it had no apparent struggle to keep airborne. it was around 60 feet long and at its tail 60 feet wide, a perfect equalateral triangle. it very well could have been a military designed craft as jet fighters frequent the airspace around my house and the power plant.  \r\n\r\njust recently a string of ufos were reported and recorded in stephenville, tx. these sightings were covered in depth by media sources around the state and even the nation. simply typing in \"stephenville ufo\" on google will result in a barrage of pages covering the event. strangly, ufos around here are not uncommon. if anything, they can be considered almost normal. for any ufo fanatic or skeptic, this area should be labeled a definate hot spot. \r\n\r\ni researched my sighting on the internet and found that triangle ufos are spotted quite frequently on major highways such a mine. some call them \"black triangles\". research should definately be done on these occurences. my own belief is that these are simply goverment contolled crafts thats existence has not yet been released to the public.

direction of cassiopeia for the perseids meteor shower. it was a clear sky with a lot of ambient background light. we had been out for about 15 minutes and had just seen a good long meteor trail traveling east to west.  i picked up my cell phone to call my son to tell him what we saw since he was watching too, from his porch in another state.  while on the phone with him i noticed something moving in the sky traveling almost overhead roughly ssw from just above cassiopeia. i blurted out, \"what the heck is that?\" i told my son that i was looking at a ufo.  my wife saw it at the same time. we both followed it for about 10 seconds until it disappeared just above the horizon. it was triangular in shape and moved very smoothly with no noise. it did not change directions.  there were 4 dim, non-flashing lights on the bottom of it; one in each corner of the triangle and one in the middle. the lights illuminated enough of the bottom to make out the shape. it seemed very low in the sky to me. from where we live, there is continuous airline traffic into o'hare and out of midway, and we are also close enough to dupage county airport to see private jets and props go in and out. we are very familiar with what planes look like at night and saw many of them during our meteor shower watching, but this ufo was nothing like any of them.  the elevation of the ufo seemed about the same as the jets queueing up over aurora for o'hare, maybe a little lower.  both of us were a little spooked because we have never seen anything like this before and never imagined that we would ever see a ufo. i would like to know if anyone else saw this in our area. if it becomes indentified, please let me know what it was. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

night. at the time the skies were clear. to my the nnw i saw what appeared at first to be a large twinkling star, but i knew i had not seen it before. i thought maybe it was an aircraft, or possibly a sattelite, but it was remaining stationary. i almost shrugged it off, but just before i turned to go back inside it began moving in a southward direction fairly slowly. as it moved closer the twinkling i thought i saw earlier was clearly lights. at first they seemed to be flashing, as lights on a plane would, but i knew it clearly could not have been a plane because it remained stationary for several minutes when i first saw it. as it came even closer i could see that the lights were actually rotating around the object. the lights were red, green, blue, yellow and white. the object never got close enough to make out an actual shape, but from the way the lights rotated it appeared to be round at the edges. at that point it stopped briefly, but after a few seconds it began to go back in the direction it had just came from. it went almost all the way back to where i had first spotted it and stopped again. at that point i caught a glimpse of a small, but bright white light out of the corner of my eye to the east. i turned to look thinking it might be one of the persied meteors, but it was moving too slow, and the light was pulsing. it was moving directly toward the first object and continued until it was just below and to the right of the first object. it appeared to be considerably smaller thatn the first object, but i believe both objects were very far away and were definitely at a very high altitude making it hard to determine the size of either object. the second object remained in that position, below and to the right of the first object for probably nearly a minute or so. at that point the light from the second object stopped pulsing and just seemed to fade out. a few minutes later the first object moved quickly to the north and disappeared.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

into the southeastern corner of the sky when i noticed a triangular object that was not twinkling like a star would. i stood there watching it hover. i watched it for a good 20 minutes as i continued to walk the block. it was definitely not a star as i noticed it would move just ever so slightly, but not quick, nor did it twinkle. \r\n\r\nafter watching it stay within the same area of the sky and thinking it may be a ufo i decided to go back inside. i didn't say anything to my teen girls at the time, thinking they may call me crazy. a couple hours later they went to bed, but were still up talking and apparently they were also looking out the bedroom window and spotted this bright hovering object as well. by this time it was nearly midnight. i was in the living room watching tv when my

white lights moving in tandem in the northern sky above denver colorado. the two lights were the size and intensity of the bright star sirius. the night was beautiful and clear, the moon was hanging large and low on the horizon. these objects or object turned southeast and flew directly over my house and then suddenly vanished. \r\n\r\ni was standing at my open rear door of my house when the sound of an approaching helicopter caught my attention, as usual with any low flying aircraft, i would go outside to watch for it. as soon as i stepped out onto my rear deck my attention was diverted to two bright lights approaching from the north. at first i thought the lights were stars and stationary, but then i soon realized they were moving in my direction. they were moving slowly in tandem as if two planes were flying in formation, one in front of the other. this struck me as very odd so i continued to watch them. the two lights were approaching me from a slight angle and they never once deviated laterally from their position. they continued heading in my direction. i stood there trying to understand what it was that i was looking at. as it over flew my house, i ran through the house and called for my teenage son to come to the front door to observe this as well. the two of us stood watching this thing cruise overhead silently and almost effortlessly. we both stood motionless trying to understand what it was we were watching. within a few seconds the two lights flashed off in unison and it was all over. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be close; however, it had no discernable shape. the object made absolutely no sound. the space and distance between the two lights can be measured by extending one full arm length and turning your hand at a 90 degree angle. one hand length. the area in which this thing traveled penetrated heavily regulated airspace, (class bravo airspace) for dia. this portion of class b airspace has a floor of 8000 feet msl and a ceiling of 14,500 msl. the object was in this air space and had also flown in between centennial (kapa) and buckley afb airspace. all three are manned by radar.  i am an instrument rated private pilot and i think i have a pretty good understanding of what airplanes look and sound like. this was no airplane, as this object had none of the required position lights / navigation lights or strobes that one would recognize as local aviation. the object was not a small dimly lit fast moving satellite, nor was it a commonly observed meteor streaking across our celestial heavenly body, and no, it was no weather balloon. i don���t know what this thing was that my son and i observed, but it left a bad taste in our

anclote island getting ready for lunch.  my wife got up to go to the kitchen sink and after looking to the south she said ���what the hell are those things���. i jumped up and looked out the window from her view and said ���it���s not three flocks of birds and we don���t have anything that big that can fly���. what we could see about 2 miles away across open water and 4-5 hundred foot above the tree line off baileys bluff were 3 large flying triangles. the first was the size of tampa foot ball stadium the next in line directly behind the first was one of the same only ��� the first one in size the one directly behind the first and second was a third one with wings that were about the size of the playing field at tampa if you include both in zone areas (150 yards mol). i got out our binoculars we keep in the kitchen drawer by the sink that we use for looking at birds close up and was amazed at what i viewed. at the bottoms on all 3 was black moving smoke that kept recycling in a well defined coronal field of many colors. the tops of all 3 where low profile looking almost like the color of the sky but were slightly off color and well defined by a coronal discharge. i then handed the binoculars to my wife and went to open the glass sliding door so we could go into the back yard. the triangles were now about straight out by the anclote island heading n/w and we lost sight of them over the gulf when our sight was blocked by our neighbor���s roof line. they flew quickly covering about a 7-8 mile radius in a little over 4 min without any sound at all. my wife then made the comment that they were trying real hard to be invisible but they blew it because there was no doubt what we both had just seen. i have had many encounters with almost every close friend and some family members. i have had many encounters since childhood over in orlando, but this was my wife of 20 years first but not her last. she has always complained in the past that she spends more time with me than any other person because we work together and our offices are 5 foot apart but never had she seen one. my response to her was always you have to go outside at night to see them and then i teased her about them making a very special viewing just for her in the day time so she could see them from inside our home. she was quite stunned over how close and how large they were in the day time getting close to noon on a very clear day in pasco. i then had to explain that these triangles were the biggest ufos i ever heard of and then said to her that at least you did not have to look at the blinding lights me and my friends had to look at over the years to see the ufos we had encountered .Gg","distance":"Over One

ground. most were at nightin remote areas but one good one was during the mid morning. it was a silvery metallic craft that was performing maneuvers, and, as if gravity was not an issue.  the ones i saw at night were out in a very remote area of nth east nevada 2 yrs consecutive yrs. both & the same were very close in the distinct order of 6 to 8 red & white small lights. these order of lights in the shape of some type of craft didn't emit any sound, as the night was extremely quiet, and no moon. anyways i've come a long ways and for the past 26 yrs i have had in my possession the plans for a propulsion system that describes an altogether revolutionary new way of propelling a space-vehicle. this new revolutionary propulsion system is a one-of-a-kind that nothing else can compete with.  there is nothing else like it either being constructed or proposed, and it will operate the way i describe in the plans unlike any system that may presently be under consideration or proposed as a viable means of propulsion. i do not have a patent on this system but i am the inventor and have the original stamped documents that were returned at my request from the doe (dept of energy), from 1983 to 1986.  simply put, they were not interested and/or could not encourage me with this type of system, as it was not acceptable under the energy related inventions criteria/guidelines because it purported to operate on a self sustaining basis.  i simply must state for the record that the fundamental principle by which this system operates is supported by a mathematical formula/equation that specifically dictates a positive powerful result. the doe was simply not interested in any system or device that doesn't produce a substantial reliable energy source/supply for a large populace.  the system i propose is capable of operating on a self sustaining basis and does not claim to produce energy for a large populace. this system will produce & maintain what i have come to refer in certain terms as an \"independent state of light energy/propulsion\". it will basically utilize powerfully efficient materials w/ specific properties that can convert mass to energy. it is done in a very simple yet complex manner that essentially creates a condition or state of propulsion that can powerfully propell a newly designed type of vehicle/craft.  in closing ;  what i need to do is to build a relatively good small working prototype to prove the validity of the system, to show the potential i know it will deliver.  this system will enable a newly designed vehicle/craft with the on-demand continuous inertia/propulsion that will enable various maneuvers to be performed, such as  hovering, and accelerating to tremendous speeds into deep outer reaches of space in the sublight range (a percentage of the speed of light).  i am quite confident if i could either have access to a small but adequately equipped facility w/ several qualified engineers, i could produce a working prototype of the system.  in  5 to 10 yrs i could develope the means of the ultimate propulsion that would send mankind on his way into space that might not otherwise had been possible.  i am confident this system will not only work but will meet and beat all expectations, in not only dramatically reducing the amount of travel-time involved space exploration endeavors, but in the expansion of the human race to other worlds.  i am convinced that the ultimate goal of traveling space like never before can be obtained, and will not only surpass everything else that claims to, but exceed it by light years.   can you assist me in my endeavor to build the one & only propulsion system that will completely change the way we presently think about traveling space in time?.... there is only one possible viable means of propulsion that is enabling advanced civilizations the ability to travel interstellar space. it is more than highly likely that the biological dependencies of the past (our present) has long since been rendered obsolete, whereby the things that once dictated terms for survival have been completely done-away with. the one & only system that will produce an altogether revolutionary new form of energy will work unlike anything now being proposed or considered as a propulsion system.   so-called antigravity, ion charged gas, solar sails, rockets, or any of the many commonly referred to potential means of propelling a spacecraft, can hope to accomplish what the system that i propose can.  it will accomplish what all the others can't hope to by utilizing a rather simple principle by applying an imbalance of weight to a specifically engineered/designed spinning rotor/armature center. the formula for determining centrifugal or centripetal force basically translates from to a 4 x's factor, and so, a 1-lb object spinning at 60,000 rpm's will exert a rough pulling-force of  4,000 lbs (2 tons) or considerably more depending on the specifications or dimensions.  in understanding this verifiable fundamental principle, it would be relatively easy to applied it to a system to create what otherwise would not be.  a substantial amount of  pulling-force could be maintained, enough to at least equal if not overtake the entire weight of an altogether newly designed vehicle/craft.  the spinning rotor center would basically resemble (in size) an average sized automobile tire and consist basically of 4 ea even slices (figuretively). 1/4 would be of a specific weight and 2 lbs lighter, w/ electromagnetic induced properties (light side or live weight). this opposite the other 1/4 heavier in weight by 2 lbs w/ no properties (heavy side or dead weight). so the diference in weight between the two opposite 1/4's is 2-lbs.  by surrounding the specifically imbalanced spinning rotor center with a housing of electromagnetics, in sections.  the pulling force exerted could be compensated (counter balanced) and would spin as a perfectly balanced rotor. this would enable the production of the necessary energy to propell an altogether new type of vehicle/craft. a substantial source of electric energy will be needed to supply the power to the entire system, but research should provide all the essential inputs & outputs and/or enable powering up & down as needed. keep in mind, that electromagnets have the potential to pull a thousand x's their own weight. even tho that is based on direct-contact it should be possible to obtain a significant percentage of that.  to continue, 3 or 4 entire systems would be needed to make a full-scale vehicle/craft fully functional or operational.  all systems would be situated parallel to each other and spin in a vertical position. each system would carry a part of the total vehicle weight. with this configuation, any and all maneuvers could be performed such as hovering, and/or accelerating & decelerating, and/or reach speeds in the sublight range, in deep space. propulsion is obtained and/or controlled by regulating energy to various select electromagnetic sections surrounding the s.R.C. via a t.O.S.(timing order sequence). the surrounding electromagnetics would consist of 12 ea sections, whereby 3 would equal in dimension the light side of the s.R.C., to interact with it, while compensating the imbalance. whatever surrounding sections are timed, will result in movement/propulsion to the opposite direction. it would be done in rapid sequence thus allowing motorization to recover enough to maintain the rpm's. the system/s could be designed and/or configured to produce a powerfully efficient pulling-force, that could enable it to exceed the t.V.W (total vehicle weight) by several times, if not more. this would enable maneuvers to be carried-out in the extreme, and would be measured as g-force, (1- g = earths gravity). the production of g-force could number in the 25 to 50 range.  one would not have to accelerate more than one can withstand, but it might be to ones advantage to be able to have the capacity to.  if you know of anyone who is genuinely interested in producing the one & only means of propulsion that will verify the existence of advanced civilizations and/or enable us to travel space in the extreme, please let me know,, or let them know about me.  the system that will totally completely revolutionize how we travel space & time, will produce an what will become to be known as an \"independent state of light energy/propulsion & eventually being\".... it could simply be referred to as \"light energy technology\".   theres only one way to do it, and if its done right there will be no mistaking it for anything else... it is literally a \"time machine' that can travel the vast distances to other stars that may have a earth-type planet similar to ours that is either presently supporting intelligent life and/or has long since supported this life, but has progressed to immortality-thru-technology, and is now up in the space above us, as we (humankind) live & breath, and go about our rather restricted limited temporary lives.  i have little doubt that our civilization has a god aweful long way to go before it attains/obtains this whole other complete independent heavenly exquisite technological state of being, like the majority of the human populace will likely never know or might even care to. thank you for your time.  sincerely, loren heyer
