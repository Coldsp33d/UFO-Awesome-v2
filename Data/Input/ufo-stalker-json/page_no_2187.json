States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Sighting occurred while traveling in a car from port columbus international airport in columbus, ohio, to logan, ohio. our parking ticket was validated when leaving the airport at 5:03, and we traveled on u.S. 270 south toward wheeling. right before we exited onto st. rt. 33 to travel southeast, i noticed a strange configuration of lights in the sky. i was driving so i tried to keep my eye on it as best i could. my son saw it, too, and then he saw another from the passenger side of the car that was like the other one. we did not have a compass to get a location on these lights, but our best guess was that one was southeast and the other was northwest. later in the trip, my son saw an additional light out the back window of the car which i was unable to see while driving.\r\n\r\nat this time of the day, it was still very dark and remained so all the way to our destination. it was a clear night until we went into dense fog for a few miles near logan. if i were to have held a ruler up to measure the object i observed from the driver's side of the car, i would estimate it to be (very) roughly 1/8\" at the broad side of the shape. this particular object was the closest to us for observation.\r\n\r\nat first, i thought it might be a helicopter just hovering. but as we drove on down the road, we would curve right and left and it allowed me to see something like a straight-on view of the object and then a side view of the object. in comparison to the stars, it looked nothing like that. these were much brighter lights. the object had three lights of different sizes stacked atop the other from what looked as though a straight on view. when seeing it as a side view, the same three stack of lights ran vertical and there was an \"arm\" of another line of three lights of uniform size as compared to the others which connected horizontally to the top light in the other stack in a \"v\" configuration. these horizontal lights were uniformly sized but didn't extend as far in length as the other arm of the \"v.\" at times a halo effect formed a thin line proceeding further from both lines from the \"v\" as if there were lights glowing above a dark \"edge\" of the body of the object. the whole set of lights nearly completed a teardrop shape with only the \"point of it missing and as if the teardrop were lying on its side with the larger, different-sized lights at the broad side of the teardrop but standing vertically from our observation point. i saw a red flash (a much smaller perfectly round light) momentarily at the apex of the \"v.\" i had my son try to take a picture with my iphone, but with no success. he was unable to operate the google maps app on the iphone to obtain any kind of coordinate details.\r\n\r\nthe lights on the broad side which were vertical from my view were oval shaped and not of uniform size which might indicate energy propulsion? i will attempt to draw a picture of this and upload it with this report.\r\n\r\nat times, the object on my side of the car appeared to be either higher or lower in the sky, but it hovered in the same general position all the while we drove approx. 60 miles southeast at which point we went into dense fog and it could not be seen. however, when we drove out of the fog, the one on my side of the car was still visible but we couldn't see if the other ones were still there because of the tree line. dawn was just breaking at our destination, but trees completely obscured our view of the sky there.\r\n\r\nthis is the strangest thing i have yet seen in the sky. i feel it was not a cluster of stars nor the moon partially concealed by clouds but gave the sense that it was a shaped object. the moon was perfectly visible at our destination. the object on the left side was close enough that as we went through the curves of the road that we could see something like a straight on view and a side view but how could something hover and remain in the same position from our view like that? at one point, i was mulling over in my mind whether it was keeping up us. if it were an aircraft, it would have left us behind minutes after first sighting it. we could see these objects out of both sides of the car and the back, so i don't think it could be possible to see stars that would be that uniform and clustered in opposite directions or even helicopters remaining stationery for that long so we could see them for 56.3 miles of driving distance.\r\n\r\nas far as time is concerned, i don't feel there was any missing time, yet we left the airport at 5:03. i could not see the time on the car clock when we first observed the object due to the fact that my son had the radio playing. i looked at the car clock when we were at carroll, ohio, and it was 5:17. since my thoughts were consumed with observing this object, at this point in the trip, i first was unaware of where we were in the dark but was quite surprised when i realized we were as far along on the road as we were. according to google maps, the distance was 22 miles from the airport to carroll which they say would have taken approx. 38 minutes. it just felt as if we got to that point much faster than we ought to have. i was driving 65 on rt. 270 and 60 on rt. 33.\r\n\r\ni compared the time on my watch to the time on an atomic clock we have in the office and my watch is off five seconds from the atomic clock. then i went out to the car and compared my watch with the car clock and found the car clock is slow by seven minutes. therefore at 5:17 on the car clock, the actual time would have been 5:24. roughly, we gained 17 minutes to that point. the clocks at our destination are not accurate, but we arrived there in the range of 5:50 to 6:10. according to google maps, the trip from the airport to our destination was 56.3 miles or 1 hour and 5 minutes. from carroll to our destination was 29.1 miles or 30 minutes. our arrival ended up in range of what was expected, but i don't know how we got to carroll as fast as we did and then arrive at the destination in the expected range. probably this was just a fluke or an error in calculation. traffic was extremely light at that time of the day on this sunday morning and at times, we were the only car visible.\r\n\r\nthe only other odd thing to report about this trip was that i would have a momentary sticking pain in the right side of my head at the top. this happened from time to time on the way home but it may not be related in any way. \r\n\r\nwright patterson afb is within easy flying distance of this area, so perhaps this was something of our own being tested.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18599,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.7209554,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08112009-0007","longitude":-82.5954894,"occurred":1249820220000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron,

stayed up late. weather had been odd lately. she stepped outside for her cigarette. i stayed inside watching t.V.\r\nshe called me outside,she seemed excited. i assumed i was going to see a falling star or something. we stood and watched a white ball hanging over the north east sky. at first it didn't seem to be moving. then we realized it was moving slow. as it got closer it changed into a red circle not a disc that was made up of small red spheres. seemed kind of large really. didn't know what to think. it got closer overhead. it began to act as if it knew we were watching it.Not sure if it really did know. shape changed again while i was uttering \"what the hell is that?\" it began to resemble a small cargo plane or a two engine passenger plane. i said oh it's just a plane. although we had seen the shape change before that one for some reason this seemed logical. fuzzy headed really. i was shrugging it off and began to walk in. she stayed to watch ..Just to be sure. the loud noise of a small plane engine suddenly came on. i said \"see it just a freaking plane.\" she was open mouthed \"saying no way,no way is that a plane\". i started acting cocky about it. i stood next to her again looking. making lame jokes. then it shot something green from the front end. it moved out fast like a rocket. the plane looking object stayed at the same speed for a about 3 seconds more then shifted into a straight line of white lights and caught up to the little green burning ball it had shot ahead of itself. then recollected into a small white ball. the grew a bit bigger all the while it moved slowly again toward the south east mountain line. the sound of the plane still present. almost as if the object forgot the sound behind itself leaving the sound over our house.  then the object drifted behind the mountain line out of view.\r\na month later a burning ball of white fire over those mountains appeared hovering. i saw it about 2 am while going to the bathroom i had an urge to look out the window. i went to the children's room to do that since their window is bigger. that is when i saw it. i watched it for about 5 minutes hanging there i was making sure it wasn't a star. then i ran down the hall to my girlfriend asleep in our bed. i woke her up and had her follow me to the boys room to see. i got her fast it seemed like maybe 30 seconds to 1 minute at the most. she got there and the object was gone. later i read on an online article that we had a ufo crash here in the 50's or 60's.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

nj).  i decided to take a quick dip in the ocean, and was hanging out in the water and checking out the sky... there was a really cool rainbow halo (sun dog?) around the sun, due to the lightly overcast skies.  anyway, i was watching a commercial jetliner flying through the sun dog (which was to the west) and thought it was pretty cool... as i was watching it, i noticed a small dark object about 1/2 or 1 mile behind the plane at what seemed to be roughly the same altitude (maybe around 7k to 10k feet?  there is a lot of air traffic at this location due to the proximity to newark intl & ny area airports)... the object was small since it was pretty far away... it looked like maybe the size of a small pea at arms length.  it was small enough that i couldn't make out any significant details or features on it... besides the fact that it was a solid object.  it was round/discoid and maybe spherical (but not sure) and was moving erratically.  at first i thought \"hmmm... wow is that a large bird flying/gliding in the thermals that high in the sky?\"  but then the object did something that totally dispelled that theory.  it stopped flying and hovered in a wobbly fashion... and then it moved very quickly to the left (towards the south) and stopped on a dime... it then hovered for a couple of seconds again while looking all wobbly... and then shot back over the right (towards the north) by what i could guess was a few hundred feet almost instantaneously and stopped on a dime again and hovered while looking a bit wobbly... at this point i was asking myself \"what the heck is this thing????\".  then as it was hovering it did a star trek \"warp speed\" kind of acceleration in speed and flew downwards and then back up in a \"u\" shaped flight pattern and just shot off and disappeared!!!  when it did that i actually said out loudly \"what the hell???? what was that?????\" and there were a few people that were swimming in the water a few feet away from me that were looking at me like i was nuts.  i stood there for a minute or two looking up at the sky to see if it would come back, but it was gone... and it never came back.  at that point i rand out of the water to my wife to tell her what i saw.  i have tried to think of several different explanations of what this object could have been.  it was definitely a real, solid object and it seemed to be intelligently controlled.  it was not a bird, not a balloon, not anything that could ordinarily be explained.  i don't have any pictures or any evidence... just an explanation of what i saw... and i'm hoping that there were other reports from the area that would corroborate my sighting.","distance":"Over One

descended to the ground. i lost sight of the smaller one as it dropped over the horizon. at that point the main sphere began to move in a more direct northwest direction, still moving slowly, and then

england, who with my wife pat were holidaying in north corfu and visiting my brother and sister in law who live there.\r\n\r\nmy wife, brother, sister in law and myself were driving back from a dinner party in kassiopi north corfu. the date was 29th july 2009 and the time 00.50(am). i was the driver and will add completely sober as were my passengers. we were heading to perithia village where my brother (david) and his wife (lyn) live. it was a clear and warm starlit night\r\n\r\nas you leave kassiopi there is a long straight well lit stretch of road about 400 yards long after which there is a long stretch of bendy road. to my right is the ionian sea and albania to my left inland corfu which is a high hilly terrain.\r\n\r\nas i left the town and entered the straight stretch of road i could see two very bright orange lights on the hill line and assumed them to be originating from lotses which is a large village up in the hills situated above perithia and thought no more about them.  i entered the windy stretch of road and drove through the little village of imarolia and drove up a slight incline away from the village which is followed by a long sharp left hand bend.  on completing the bend i then noticed in the sky above and in front of us 3 bright orange balls accompanied by a much larger (x 4/5 larger.  my brother who was in the passenger seat shouted out 'what the ...���.  everyone screamed stop the car which i did about 100 yards on just off the road.  we all got out of the car and assembled around it. i asked if anyone had a camera knowing mine was back at base in our beach bag.  unfortunately nobody did.  so we all watched the following events almost in complete silence apart from the odd shouts of 'did you see that' when something spectacular happened.  the objects did not emit any audible noise.\r\n\r\nthe three small lights at first appeared randomly spaced apart and were situated i would guess between roda (a town further along the road we were on) and mainland albania.  the larger light was above roda itself.  height is difficult to estimate, they were very high in the sky much higher than the neighbouring hills of corfu ad albania. all of the lights appeared stationery. \r\n\r\nthe three smaller lights then positioned themselves into a straight line.  well apart from each other in an alignment away from us.  the larger light continued to hover well apart from the alignment. then the middle light of the line up of small lights moved outwards towards albania.  the nearest and rear aligned light moved inwards towards corfu and towards the furthest light to form a perfect delta shaped v.  they continued to hover for roughly 30 to 40 seconds.  the larger light remained unmoved during these manoeuvres. then the furthest away light started to move off away from us and was followed by the light nearest albania followed by the light nearest corfu. they moved away from us towards southern italy and appeared to ascend at the same time.  not straight up but at an incline at i would estimate at 45 degrees. all three lights were out of vision within twenty seconds. the larger light remained in its original position for about another 30 seconds or so before moving off in the same direction as the others disappearing again within twenty seconds on the same trajectory. \r\n\r\nthe speed of the manoeuvres was terrific and perfect and the velocity of acceleration away from us was greater still.  i have watched 'the red arrows in england several times, this was nothing like that.  the speed they moved across the sky was much faster than anything i have seen at an air display and the acceleration out of view faster than anything i have seen at all.\r\n\r\nwe were filled with awe and disbelief during this spectacle and yet filled with excitement and euphoria to have witnessed this event.\r\n\r\ni am not claiming that they were aliens; i just cannot explain what they were.  it s difficult to get across the speed these things carried out the display of movement and acceleration, i have seen nothing like this before..\r\n","distance":"Over One

in the same place in the night sky last night, and looked the same.\r\n\r\ni watched it for about 2 hours.  \r\n\r\nit was a bright white light in the southern night sky, hovering.  it looked to be in our atmosphere, very big.  i called 4 of my neighbors out to see.  some cell phone video, and photos were taken.  they looked very low quality.  \r\n\r\nit was definately the biggest, brightest thing, not a star, not a plane. it was stationary.  it got brighter at times, creating a halo effect.   at it's brightest it looked bright white,cigar shaped, with a white aura.\r\n\r\nin my last sighting i didn't report it dimming, but it noticably dimmed this time.  when dimmed it was still very bright, but looked more like three light balls, the center slightly higher than the sides, sort of chevron shape.  \r\n\r\nit moved to the right and higher at one point.  i never saw it move again.  after that it stayed stationary.  \r\n\r\ni came in and filed a mufon report on the national site, and went back out to observe.  i watched for about two hours, and that is all i observed.  i called my friend, in indianapolis, and she observed it.  she also filed a report with mufon.  when i went to bed, i could look out the window, through the trees and still see the light hovering.  i don't know how long it was there, either sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":18580,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.5523265,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08102009-0006","longitude":-85.5935943,"occurred":1249795800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,

were at dauphin lake.  there were 6 of us that witnessed the actual event.  i have it on video tape, although due to the camera not having been on night vision or anything like that, we are unable to see the object on the video.  although the audio of what happens works just fine.  the ufo was a large orange light that was going the direction of the shore line, and then it stopped, and went off in the direction away from us.  it moved very slowly before it shot off away from us.  at a speed i've never seen a plane move at.\r\ndauphin lake is not on any flight paths.  the craft made absolutely no sound.  we were all pretty shocked.  no one suffered loss of time or anything like that though.  it was simply just a sighting of well we don't know what.\r\ni live very close to the airport here in winnipeg, and i've seen many planes fly over the house.  they all make noise, if you can see them, you hear them.  this was completely silent.  there weren't even any animals making noises that night.  it was silent but for all of us well freaking out.\r\nit was bright orange, not red like plane lights are red, white, blue even.  this was definitely orange, and a lot larger than plane lights are.  it wasn't a fire ball, there wasn't a storm, or any rain happening at the time of us seeing it.  i can be reached at my email address and can forward you a copy of what the camera did have on it.  i unfortunately do not know how to edit it to get whats on it to show up.  i just know that the lens cap was not on when he was shooting the video.  my husband had to run to the cabin to get the camera in the first place, but even though it said the cap was on, he had made sure it was not.  it was extremely dark out at the lake that night.\r\nwe were just sitting around by the camp fire.  i'm unsure of who noticed it first, but once we noticed it, we were all looking at it.  we knew it was not a plane, and well that makes it an unidentified flying object.\r\nit was orange, moved very slowly, came to a stop and shot off in a zig zag pattern away from us.  faster than any plane i've ever seen it was gone from our sight in a couple of seconds.\r\nour reactions are all on the video audio.  my feelings now are of this is important to tell people about.  that something not normal does exist.  was that man made?  i do not know, i'm leaving that up to professionals.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

every 30 seconds.   this lasted for at least eight minutes and ceased about two minutues prior to the arrival of the erie county sheriff's department and grand island fire department.  we had been

pilot, so i understand airplane lights and i am also familiar with atmospheric phenomena.  i have flown all over the world and am familiar with the night sky.  i am also a qualified microbiologist with a master's degree.  in a nutshell, what i am trying to say is that if something unusual catches my eye, i analyze it carefully and eventually am able to classify it rationally.\r\n\r\na bright red almost orange red light caught my eye far off in the ne sky.  it was moving in an easterly direction.  it seemed rather unusual, and i tried my best to look for other lights like a green right wing tip light that would help me identify it as an airplane.  there was no apparent engine noise, but that may be because it was far away.  it moved about through many different directions and all this time i was able to assure myself that there were definitely no other lights, only one red-orange light.  i called my wife and two boys (12 and 6) who also watched the event with me.  we watched it for at least 30 minutes from the time i first noticed it.  i tried to film it with my video camera, but could not capture it?  through my binoculars, it had definite solid spherical qualities like a solid red ball.  it did not flicker and glow like a flare.  at times it almost appeared to have a red spike protruding below it?  suddenly, a second smaller ball of the same color appeared to either fall from it or fly from it.  it went straight down towards the ground very slowly directly beneath the first ball of light until we lost sight of it on the horizon.\r\n\r\nthe first ball of light then appeared to gain altitude smoothly and reversed direction heading nw.  we continued to observe it and then noticed what appeared to be a faint bluish- whitish dim light appear to be on an intercept path beneath it.  we lost sight of this second very dim light.\r\n\r\nsuddenly there was a split second intensely bright white flash some distance beneath the first orange ball. the orange ball appeared to flicker?  a few seconds passed and i saw a second bright white flash and then without warning the orange ball flickered and disappeared.  i could not tell if it dematerialized or disintegrated or simply shot off so fast that i could not see it, but one second it was there and then the next it was gone.\r\n\r\nthe whole thing has left me slightly confused and irritated.  i am not one who thinks every light in the sky is a ufo, but i did feel that this observation was unusual and significant enough to report.  could it be a flare, i do not think so.  was it an airplane, definitely not!  maybe someone else also observed the same thing?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with
