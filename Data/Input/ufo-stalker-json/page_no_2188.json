however, this \"object\" made a right turn as it moved between the clouds.  what's odd (and why i'm reporting this) was that the speed and angle it turned at.  since the object moved through the clouds, i have an idea on the height it was at.  not only was the object moving 4-5 times (at least) faster than a normal airplane, it made a 80 degree, sharp turn.  the whole thing took less than 3 seconds and was completely silent.  there were other breaks in the clouds, so i kept looking to see if the \"object\" continued its movement, but could no longer see it anywhere.  it was as if it vanished.  don't know what it was, but it was pretty darn cool to see.  i would compare the speed the object was travelling at to a fighter jet going full throttle, but that's a guess.  based on the height of the object and the trail it left behind it, i would guess it was the size of a car (but this is also a guess).

clear but i am sure i would have never seen it.  my son has always been an \"eagle eye\"  he said look at those three jets flying in a perfect v.  i knew immediately what it must be.  i stood up and looked.  i said.  those are not jets that's a ufo and it is what people have been seeing all over the world.  we were so awestruck.  i was impressed with the beautiful blue color.  it remeinded me of phosphoresence i had onc seen in the ocean.  there was a jet tailing it very closely.  then i thought maybe the jet was projecting an image, and i said that.  my son said no it's blocking out the stars behind it.  i am pretty familiar with yosemite and i calculate it was 60 miles away and flying the same height 40.000 feet that jets travel.  it took just a few minutes to go from the left side (this would be as far  left of half dome till your vision is blocked by the moutain) and then we watched it till it went out of site to the far right.  my son said it looked like it was several footbal fields in size.  it was certainly much much bigger than the jet.  we just didn't say much, we were so stunned.  none of us had ever seen anything like this before.  i have always believed people that say they saw something but my son is a complete skeptic and was not a believer at all.  i think he would rather forget he saw anything.  there was another family up there at the same time.

(i play golf on monday and thursday so it had to be either tues or weds) the moon was to the se so i was looking towards the ocean. i noticed a light moving towards me. it was orange. it was not like a plane light, it wasn't a point source. it was bloomed circular like a light in fog except there was no fog. it came directly toward the inlet. when it got over the general dynamics electric boatyard it changed direction and headed ne and moved away until it dwindled and disappeared (i know it changed direction because it appeared to stop when it started to move directly away from me but i am pretty sure it never changed speed). it appeared to be going faster than a prop plane, like a slow jet. it never changed altitude or speed. when it got pretty far away i could guess its altitude to be somewhere between 10 and 20k feet. it wasn't nearly as high as commercial airliners would be but higher than most small planes. it was totally silent, i no engine sound at all. within a couple of minutes of it disappearing in the distance (it was clear enough that i watched it dwindle in size to nothing) another appeared where the first appeared and followed the exact same path, same altitude, same speed and same orange light. it disappeared exactly like the first, they were identical in every respect. at no time did either show any other light source other than the orange glow and i could not see any kind of craft outline. the light also looked exactly the same coming and going. as i was watching the first one someone was walking by and made a comment about how strange it looked. there were probably around 20 people sitting on the wall within a quarter mile of me who must also have seen them. after seeing the second one i stuck around for about 20 minutes to see if any more would show up. none did but a small prop plane flew by at a couple thousand feet. i could hear the engine clearly and saw red, green and white lights, one flashing. i could also see the outline of the plane. the lights were point sources too, nothing like the orange lights.\r\n\r\ni am an engineer. i have a few hours flight time and i was in the air force. this was like no plane i ever saw. i am not a true believer and i have never seen anything before that i would classify as a ufo but this was strange enough that i am reporting it.","distance":"501 Feet -
