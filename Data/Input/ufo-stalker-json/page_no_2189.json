around where this object was was terrified of it pointing toward the sky .\r\nthe craft from my reoccuring memories that i saw that day was \r\n was fairly big and it was the shape of a disc .The sides of it had lined lights on it  and on the bottom there was a hole where there was some kind of propulsion system that admitted a sky blue /neon flame.\r\ngoing up from the sides of the craft it was like a edged lid shape cocering the bottom up and was pure black.\r\nso my reaction i guess at my age to this object were like mommy what is that ,and i guess she was scared or something as i never remember her giving me a answer but i was set down and my mom walked across the street and this is what i can best

lately. i noticed some very bright white flickering lights in the northeastern sky, very low above the horizon. after about a minute or so, i started to see what looked like a more constant small white light within the flickering lights. this light seemed to flicker on and off much more slowly than the ones surrounding it. this went on for about 20 seconds or so before all of the lights suddenly went out. \r\n\r\ni continued to watch the skies for a few minutes more when i noticed a small white star/orb-like light approaching from the north. at first i just assumed it was a plane coming from miami international airport which is directly north of me at least 10 miles away. as it got closer i began to realize it couldn't be a plane because it made absolutely no sound, had no other lights on it, blinking,strobing or otherwise and i could not make out it's shape. with a plane you can easily make out it's frame,tail,etc. but i could only see a white orb-like light. i also noticed that as it got closer, the color started to change and darken to a dark yellow.\r\n \r\nunfortunately it didn't fly directly over me, but just to the side of my building instead so i ran out of my apartment to the landing in the rear of my building to see it come out on the other side. it was still moving south at the same speed and appeared to look even darker in color, almost like it's light was fading. i watched it as long as i could until it disappeared into the rest of the city lights. \r\n\r\ni suspect this light/object either came from the flickering lights i'd seen earlier, or it was the exact same object. it was very similar to something i'd seen about a month ago around 5am as i was walking my dog. i just looked directly up and saw a white star-like light moving very fast in a perfectly straight line and heading east. it flew right over me and again i didn't hear a sound or make out it's frame.

experience which originally seemed to strictly be a really cool dream that startled me.  i thought this until about 15 minutes ago when i noticed a common factor that is shared with a few other stories told by others on this site.  \r\n\r\ni recall having been extremely tired on this evening and going to bed around 9 pm.  i was asleep on my left side with my right arm over my girlfriend as we lay in the \"spooning\" position.  i know this as fact because i was in this exact same position in my bed, in my apartment, with the same exact surroundings in my dream.  i recall seeing an alien being standing at the foot of my bed.  it was about 5-1/2 to 6 feet tall.  you know, big eyes, grey, all the characteristics that pop culture has taught me to be characteristics of an alien.  the one thing that was different is the one thing that i now find odd.  it was wearing what appeared to be a 3 piece suit.  black.  i find this odd because i had never heard of sightings/encounters having beings wearing suits.  at the time i jsut thought it was some crazy detail my mind made up.  anyway, this thing reached out as if to grab me from the foot of the bed and it scared the living you-know-what out of me and woke me up yelling.  i've never woken up yelling about a dream before.  i truley to enjoy scary dreams, when i get them which is rare, and never wake up yelling.  my girlfirend woke up to my scream and calmed me down.  now from the time i had gone to sleep until this moment when i am now calmed down, it seemed as though i had been asleep for 15-20 minutes max.  when i looked at the clock it was some time around 1 am.  \r\n\r\ni do not recall having a dream about aliens prior to, or after this.  \r\n\r\nsome of you reading this are probably thinking this is absolutely nothing, and that may be the case as these are all the details.  but, the part that just put a big lump in my throat is that it was wearing a 3 piece suit.  like i said, i've never heard any story about an alien wearing a suit.  and if i was dreaming, why, if i've never heard of this, would this thing be wearing a suit.  i found this site about a week ago and am completely enamoured with it.  now having read others encounters on this site, it's making me wonder since a few of them report seing beings wearing suits.  \r\n\r\ni may have left out a detail or two because i tried to submit the form previously but didn't fill it out all the way and had to type all of this over again.  \r\n\r\nif you know of a similar experience and can shed some light on this, please do let me know.

different rooms.  one night i awoke in a strange room which was approx. 10'x10' with a two windows and \"door\"  in one wall below which was a metal bench attached to the wall.There were really two windows with the door between them and two benches.  the windows were slanted outward and into a hall way which appeared to be about four or five feet wide.  in the room in which i found myself was a man, about 25 to 30 years old sitting on the metal bench with his legs spread and his head bent down looking between his legs at the floor.  the door did not have a handle or means to open the door from what i could see or figure out.  i was walking around the room trying to find some way which to get out of it thinking that i must be sleeping and dreaming as i did so and i would wake soon.  about the time i turned toward the man and was getting ready to ask him why he was just sitting there a being which was so tall its head almost rubbed the ceiling walked past the window.  the being was covered with reddish orange hair  and was not wearing anything else.  i was so afraid that i almost got sick however i though that if i was afaid maybe i could \"attack\" or at least appear to be dangerous so that the being would not come into the room.  i jumped onto the bench then stepped onto the ledge in which the window was inset and started growling, scratching & pounding on the glass in an effort to show the being how \"dangerous\" i was.  all the time while i was doing this the man in the room with me never moved or made a sound.  the being walking past the window without even turning to look at me and i was so happy.  i got down off the window frame and sat down on the bench.  i do not recall anything after that point until i awoke in my bed at about 5 am when it was time to get up and do the morning chores.   i do not know who the man was, i had never seen him before nor did i ever recall seeing him again.  i do not recall being taken to the craft nor returned from

myself.\r\nhttp://slushpup62.Blogspot.Com/\r\n\r\nat around 2:00 p.M. today, my son and i were in my car going to a small town near by called deseronto. we were about 2 miles away approaching north towards the bridge that goes over the bay of quinte. (large body of water attached to lake ontario)\r\n\r\ndirectly over the bay was an object flying east just at cloud level. it was moving very quickly. it was a bright round ball with a thin long black line behind it. the tail was straight as an arrow, with no fins or rudders, almost like a pole sticking out behind it. i figure it was traveling near speeds of 500 mph or more.\r\nwithin seconds of us seeing it, the object simply vanished after flying easterly for about 10 to 15 seconds. the sky was very clear with scattered puffy clouds. nothing to hide it from sight.\r\ni was driving and i also never had my camera with me. included is an example that i rendered of the event. this is about 90% close to what we saw. in deseronto i will add is a small craft airport and this was not any cessna or hang glider/ultralight nor helicopter. i ever have seen before. it was way to quick. i kick my ass for not having my camera with us. things you see when you don't have it. live and learn.\r\n\r\nremember this is just a rendering, not actual picture. i tried to duplicate weather conditions and craft to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\ni thought i would share this with you. any

finally\r\ncame to the dry lake bed. as i started to get out of my truck, something\r\ncaught my eye. i looked up and saw an all white unmanned aircraft flying\r\nright above my truck and only about 200 feet high.  it looked like a\r\nglobal hawk.  i grabbed my camera but it was too late to get a picture of it.  since i had my camera out, i decided to take some pictures of the\r\nlake bed and surrounding mountains.  i took a total of 5 pictures in about a 2 minute period.\r\n\r\nthat evening when i got home, i downloaded the pictures and sent them to\r\nsome of my friends. then, later that night, i was reviewing one of the\r\npictures and was startled at what i saw.  i looked in the blue sky in the\r\nupper right corner of the picture and saw what looked like the moon.\r\nthe problem was that the moon should not be in that location of the sky.\r\nso, i zoomed in on the object and couldn't believe what i saw.  it's\r\nsome sort of large circle with another circle inside of it. it almost\r\nlooks like a petroglyph.  then, i looked at another picture and it has the same object but in a different location and farther away.\r\nif i were to go back to the lake bed with these

we've seen so many ufos from that room, which is surrounded on 3 sides by mostly windows.  we live in a quiet, heavily wooded rural area, with not many houses, in a bowl-shaped valley near the top of a really high hill (or small mountain).  my sister and niece from colorado were at my vacation place at the river.\r\nsince the first night here last thursday night when my niece witnessed an orange-ish/red ball of light whiz past the window, she doesn't want to stay here anymore. i admit, i was home ufo hunting that night since being called by a guy in irwin, pa who's filmed a replicating star-like\r\nufo dropping orbs on several nights. http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=bzbgbfjmkyy\r\nhe saw it again this night.  i also saw a moving star-like\"dot\" about 30 degrees on the east side of my house on the 3rd around 11 pm, that responded to my laser pointer by increasing in size from a dot to the size of a nickel at arm's length in a split second!  i should've started filming before doing so, because after i started filming, it didn't respond to it again and continued traveling south, fading out.  also 'busted' the ufos pretending to be planes--finally caught them doing something weird--a white orb shot into one--caught on film, will post that also on youtube today hopefully. a blow up from that one revealed non-plane structures too. \r\n\r\nanyway, back to the story.  i had only been asleep for about 2 hours.  i awoke to a high-pitched \"heeeeeeee\" sound (not very loud, but i'm a light sleeper) and looked out the front window to see a craft with flashing lights not far above the treeline on the other side of the valley.  the valley is approximately 500 feet to highest trees. it was travelling from east to west. even though i didn't have my glasses on, i grabbed the hdr-xr500 sony camcorder off the coffee table and ran to the patio door and opened it.  the screen door was also closed and i did a face plant right into it, ripping the screen!  started filming from the deck in same spot as my other videos.  never heard a sound from the other ufos and wondered what this was.  since i've filmed several other triangle type ufos around here, i figured i'll find out when i blow up some stills from the hd video, which is posted on my youtube channel: \r\nseeingufospa\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=9su3nh1t3gc\r\ni've uploaded some stills here.\r\nthere is a structure under the red light and a pole-type structure holding the upper white light that\r\ndefies a conventional craft explanation. also, since it was travelling to the right, a green right\r\nside navigation light should have been visible. the right side white light has a small red ball light\r\non it instead.  i also just heard from someone in toledo, ohio who said they saw the exact same thing at around 1:30 am this morning (august 7th). by altoona, pa also--80 miles east of here.\r\n\r\nthe cat had been next to me on couch but ran downstairs and hid for the rest of the night.\r\nit usually likes to go outside to hunt, but has been wanting to stay inside and sleep downstairs\r\nlately.  i find it unusual for a 7 year old cat to change her habits like that.  thunderstorms were\r\nthe only things that would scare her into hiding downstairs before.\r\nnothing was turned on previous to the sighting so nothing strange detected there.\r\nthe camcorder worked, obviously, except for some autofocus & manual focus problems\r\nwhen first filming (cut those out of video).  the video would have been longer if not for those.\r\nthe 'heeeeee' sound on video is almost like cicadas sound and sounds different than what my ears heard. \r\n\r\nyou guys on the star team should bring some high tech equipment here and camp out while this area is still hot with sightings. a 24-hour watch--especially at night, should bring you some good sightings of your own within a week. weekdays seem to be best.  never any sightings to speak of on the weekend nights, usually.  you can \"bust\" the fake plane ufos here--but hey, they might be in your neighborhood too.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18525,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4334215,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08072009-0009","longitude":-79.694275,"occurred":1249383240000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1249383240000,"summary":"Murrysville:

am on august 7, 2009. we were driving east on st. route 579 and we were actually talking about ufos and aliens. we saw some bright lights in the sky off in the distance straight ahead of us. we didn't think too much of it but we kept an eye on it since we were already watching the skies. we began to notice this object was coming straight at us, and it was very large. there were two visible white lights to the left and right sides of the craft, and one light in the middle and higher up, making a triangle. it was flying very low to the ground, we are guessing 500-700 feet in the air. we turned left onto reiman road and the craft was still coming straight at us since the road curved back to the same direction we were heading. i stopped the car and opened up my sunroof while my friends michael and aaron stuck their heads out the window to get a better look. the craft was very large and was triangular shaped and was moving at a steady course at approximately 75 mph. it was completely silent. it flew directly over us. we tried to get it on camera or video with our phones but we were in complete awe. we couldn't take our eyes off it to even handle our phones. it looked similar to a stealth bomber at first, but it was much larger and flying way too low and silently and slow to be one of those because i've seen those before and trust me this was nothing from this world. as it passed over us we then saw a glowing red light that was pulsing. aaron suggested maybe it was a plane because of the light, however, there was no white blinking light that most planes have on their wings. it looked like it began to pick up speed and the road we were on turned left. we were then traveling north as the craft was to the left of us traveling west. we were keeping up with it but after about thirty seconds we lost sight of it in the distance as we came up to some trees. we didn't see it again. michael went home and researched recent sightings and found a link posted on youtube of a ufo that looked exactly like the one we encountered. it was seen on the morning of august 4, 2009 just east of here outside of pittsburgh, pennsylvania. we know what we saw, and that video on

open view of the sky with not too much light pollution. i noticed a very bright orb looking object in the north that seemed to appear out of nowhere and then it shot up in a diagonal route from bottom right to upper left. it was so incredibly fast i can't even tell you anything more about it. once it got going it just seemed to disappear in the sky. my dad told me it might be a meteor, but from what i have seen of meteor's they fall at a downward angle and this moved at an upward angle. i didn't notice any effect on my dog when the object was overhead, but again it was so fast i barely had time to truly see it.\r\n\r\nlater i was inside watching television. from where i was sitting i had a direct view to the backyard. an object was flying through the sky with what appeared to be bright white strobe lights. we have many airplanes/helicopters (military, commercial and private) that fly around here, so i am very familiar with their light patterns and the colors of their lights. i immediately called the attention of my parents who also saw it. my dad, who has an interest in airplanes looked at it and said it wasn't like any plane he had ever seen before. we took some binoculars to the backyard and watched the object. it was moving north/northwest towards the city of rancho cucamonga/ontario and was approx. 3 degrees above the horizon. \r\n\r\nwhen looking at it through the binoculars we could see that the only color lights the object had were bright white. the lights flashed in a strobe light manner and the pattern appeared to be one or two lights, three lights and then nothing. when the lights stopped, no object could be seen. i was unable to see a shape of what the object may have looked like, unfortunately. i continued to ask my dad what he thought it might be and he couldn't figure it out either.

stopped, i couldn't discern it from the stars. i was very excited, my wife was on the porch but wasn't able to see due to lights and i couldn't get her to join me in the yard. at that time, i reported it to brian vike, where i have reported other objects similar to those posted on mufon this year. i regularly watch for the iss and shuttle, and also spot satellites and cosmos or other rocket bodies.

waited for my parents to pick me up.\r\n\r\nthey were late, and being bored, and an amateur astronomer, i decided to do some naked eye astronomy.  while i was looking up, a diamond shaped array of lights appeared over the steeple and slowly flew overhead.\r\n\r\nthe configuration was a white light in the nose, a while light in the tail, and two red lights, one on the left, and one on the right.\r\n\r\nas it flew overhead, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet up at most. the dark area between the lights occluded the stars as it passed.  there was no engine noise or any noise at all, it was perfectly silent.\r\n\r\ni kept watch on the object as it crossed the parking lot, and at one point i could see far above a passing passenger jet, with its white, green and red running lights and its engine noise; which was quite a contrast to the ufo's silence and unorthodox running light configuration.\r\n\r\neventually the object disappeared behind the trees on the other side of the parking lot.\r\n\r\nthe whole passage of time was short, a minute, maybe two. the object was not moving very fast.\r\n\r\ni've been an amateur astronomer for years, and have engaged in telescopic and naked-eye astronomy.  i'm also an airplane spotter, and am quite familiar with most aircraft; and their lighting configuration.\r\n\r\nthis object was not like any aircraft i have ever seen. it was not a simple light in the sky, a meteor, planet, or balloon. it was a solid object that occluded the stars with its dark body.\r\n\r\ni've never reported this sighting to any ufo agency before, and only mentioned it to close friends for fear of ridicule.  after hearing stanton friedman on coast to coast last night mention that few of the people who admit to seeing ufos actually reported them, i decided that it was time to make a change.\r\n\r\nthe only other object i've seen that behaved strangely could have been a meteor (though it didn't behave like any meteor); but this sighting was definitely of some sort of craft and worthy of reporting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18514,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.1427955,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08062009-0012","longitude":-73.3542155,"occurred":573120000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":573120000000,"summary":"Diamond
