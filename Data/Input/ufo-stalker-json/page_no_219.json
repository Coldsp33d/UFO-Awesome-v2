stretching and yoga and laid back and looked up at the clear blue sky. a star like object caught my eye. at first i thought it was a jet at very high altitude with the sun's light was reflecting off of it. however, it was not moving. it was stationary at very high altitude. not flickering, not flashing. no changing color. just a star like object stationary for at least 30 min. during this time i called tallahasse airport and asked to speak to the tower. after being shuffled around and having to tell my story several times, i spoke to the tower and they did not have anything on radar. i also took approximately 10 photos with my smartphone. i could not tell if i had got the object in the photos but i did notice while taking them that a contrail was present in my camera screen, but not visible to my naked eye. i then went in to work, and looked at the photos and saw the pictures did capture the contrail, and a couple did have the star object but only visble on greater magnification, although somewhat fuzzy. most interesting are the round shadow like objects captured in the photos but not visible to my naked eye. i also captured a jet in one photo and it does give one a bit of a perspective. could it have been venus, jupiter, or saturn visible at 8:30 am on a bright sunny morning? i dont know. i think it was really a object at very high altitute maybe 50-100,000 ft. there were a couple of jets that went by during the event and this object was higher. the contrail and round grey shadow objects appear to be at different altitudes. i dont think they are ghost images or reflections off of something. i took several photos with them in the photos and they are in the same location (using the playfort fabric roof as a reference point). i am sure i moved around and took each photo from a slightly different location, yet the objects appear in the same location in the sky. maybe you guys have someone that can analyze the photos.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":84232,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.479102542397694,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06062017-0016","longitude":-84.16934153474529,"occurred":1432080000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1496784001000,"summary":"Starlike

group or a team, i was practicing the ce-5 protocols for about 2 and a half hours and alternating between meditation, remote viewing, and playing certain tones recorded during a crop circle investigation. after roughly two hours and forty five minutes i packed up my things and began walking towards the forest parking lot. i decided i should walk backwards just in case i might happen to miss something in the sky behind me as i left, and just before reaching the parking lot and while viewing the south eastern part of the sky (the sky was very cloudy, i could barely see the moon above and the clouds blocked out the stars, and we also have a lot of light pollution in our area) i witnessed what looked very much like a shooting star and it was visible for only about one second. what is compelling is just how cloudy and light polluted the sky was, and since i could not see any stars i found it very bizarre that i should see a \"shooting star\" that was not only visible below the cloud line but also which traveled on a flat, horizontal trajectory. at an altitude below the cloud line, i believe that it would defy the laws of physics for a meteorite or space debris to be at such a low altitude and somehow traveling horizontally with no downward arc heading towards the earth.\r\ni find the timing of the event highly suspicious as well, i set out that night with the intent of peacefully vectoring in any et vehicles willing to appear for us and and demonstrate their beauty and peacefulness (i had some rather interesting visuals while meditating and remote viewing) and the chances of just happening to see an extremely rare shooting star that was somehow visible among the clouds and traveling on a seemingly impossible trajectory for an unintelligent object to be extremely slim. i've seen plenty of shooting stars in my life, but not a single one which i can recall in naperville, even on the clearest of nights. really the only resemblance it had to a shooting star was the speed at which it was moving, in fact it may have been moving faster than most shooting stars. it was also unlike a shooting star in that it did not appear to diminish and disintegrate, it popped out of view with the exact same brightness as it did when it appeared, and again it appeared amid a completely cloudy part of the sky. \r\ni truly wish i had been able to record it on video, or at the very least to have had a secondary witness. keep in mind, i take this subject extremely seriously and i do my best to debunk any \"potential sightings\" i may witness because if i'm going to see one, i want to be certain that i saw what i think i saw. i would not be posting this sighting were i not so sure that it was something otherworldly, i've waited several days in the time since i witnessed it, i have slept on it and have determined after much consideration, research, and healthy skepticism that it was not some extremely coincidental freak of nature shooting star somehow defying the law of physics. \r\nto anyone who reads this, believe in the truth. they are out there, they are visiting, and based on their lack of agression they are more than likely peaceful or at least neutral observers of our civilization. if you are like myself and would absolutely love to have a sighting, check out cseti/sirius disclosure and their ce-5 protocols. you do not have to spend any money in order to learn how to initiate contact, it just takes time and practice with regard to meditation, and a very open mind. anyone can have these experiences, and for anyone reading, thank you for taking me seriously and keep an open mind, and keep your eyes to the

very brightly.  then it looked like it was beaming a spotlight, and at first i thought it was beaming a light to search the ground but as i watched it seemed to cause a thing to materialize at the end of the beam (which widened), which thing looked like a sparkly cloud that kind of shimmered or had shimmering bits in it.  at all times when it was doing this it maintained the same distance between it and the object at the end of the beam.  while it did this, it was just sort of floating around in the sky, and then occasionally the first section, the red-white-blue cyclinder, would change into sort of a half-circle of lights that looked like candle-flames next to one another, like five or six candle-flames in a semi-circle.  then other times it became a glowing ring.  it would alternate between these the whole time.  oftentimes when it moved it reminded me of the way a butterfly moves. \r\n\r\nit did this while i watched for about two hours, and then the sun came up.  as it grew lighter outside, the craft seemed to just begin floating upward, and rose higher and higher til i eventually couldn’t see it.\r\n\r\nwhen i viewed it through the night vision app, it appeared just as a very bright glowing object that left trails, but no detail could be seen.  the only time you could see detail or even see it doing anything at all was with the binoculars.  with the naked eye, it

observed it slowly adjust it's path and change direction from north east to north west. it appeared to be attempting to morph. despite the surface of this craft moving around in a very unstable and liquid type motion it's velocity and trajectory were stable. it was almost like a cloud of heavy metallic black liquid but it's overall shape remained relatively uniform. the nature of this object made it very hard to focus my vision on despite the fact that the craft was dark black and the grey clouds and sunrise made the sky very contrasted against the color of the craft. i felt as though it was tricking my eyes into looking at the clouds above it instead of the craft itself. shortly after it changed direction (north east) it began to shift it's shape more noticeably and it went from a big morphing liquid blob to an elongated and very small boomerang type black craft that was no longer morphing. it seemed to become completely solid at that point. once again with no lights or sounds.

location and i was under the impression that it was hovering in place. in retrospect, it may have been advancing towards my position because this was the only point in my observation that i was under the impression it may have been hovering. once i noticed it was moving i also noticed it was doing so at a steady pace. it was traveling north east slightly (more north direction than east) and i observed it slowly adjust it's path and change direction from north east to north west. it appeared to be attempting to morph. despite the surface of this craft moving around in a very unstable and liquid type motion it's velocity and trajectory were stable. it was almost like a cloud of heavy metallic black liquid but it's overall shape remained relatively uniform. the nature of this object made it very hard to focus my vision on despite the fact that the craft was dark black and the grey clouds and sunrise made the sky very contrasted against the color of the craft. i felt as though it was tricking my eyes into looking at the clouds above it instead of the craft itself. shortly after it changed direction (north east) it began to shift it's shape more noticeably and it went from a big morphing liquid blob to an elongated and very small boomerang type black craft that was no longer morphing. it seemed to become completely solid at that point. once again with no lights or sounds. almost immediately after it shape shifted, it began to shrink in size at a extremely impressive rate. \r\n\r\n(5)i have witnessed many different types of unidentified objects and this was by far the most troubling and emotional sighting. i felt shocked and scared and for once i felt terrified instead of intrigued or awestruck. i have seen lights, orbs, but never anything like this. \r\n\r\n(6) it shrank in size until it was gone. either it literally shrank, or it traveled away from me at a great speed.

cheshire (uk) walking on our local field the george playing field, my  friend was taking pictures of the sky and cloud, due to there being lots of interesting  types of clouds, when he spotted what appeared to be a contrail from a crazy pilot. however when we zoomed in on a picture he took i realised that it could not, in any way be a contrail. there were many planes in the sky, and their contrails were totally different to this, and dissipated with the wind at a fast rate. not only this, but where ever there was a contrail a plane was clearly visible at the front of it. this ribbon shaped worm thing stayed in the sky un-changed for over ten minutes before it dissapeard completely!  i have sent the original un touched pictures to you. all i have done is zoomed in and cropped. when i returned home, i typed \"sky snake\" into google, and imidietly found identical annomalise, however no explanation as to what it may be. i have asked pilots that i know through model plane groups on facebook, they have said they have never seen anything of the sort before and agree that it isnt a contrail. each end of the (snake) has the same shape. there was no craft , helicopter, drone, plane or any other type of terrestrial craft near this thing. also there are areas of the thing which appear to be flattend compared to others, almost like a twisted ribbon, reminds me of a tape worm. the size of this thing must have been several miles long, as you can see by the pictures. this is not an image artefact, this thing really was in the sky.\r\nany help identifying this would

green disc/orb is nothing like i have ever seen before. it also has a wider ring with what appears to be smaller rings within.I cannot explain this shape being in the sky at all. i then took a much closer look at first photo (flash on) as there is no physical green disc/orb. but in the approx same area i pretty sure i can see a white sort of circle with smaller circles within. but i am not sure

ca. location was 133° sw 33.6748 latitude -118.0272 longitude. \r\nmy friend and i had gone to the beach for blue hour, but the weather conditions created low visibility and the marine layer was thick. we stayed a while after, at the shore talking about aliens, oddly enough, and we were thrown off and perplexed at the sight of bright neon blue lights out on the water, a distance at about where the oil rigs are located. just south of the last oil rig at the dog beach in h.B. these 6+ lights were horizontal, in a saucer shaped silhouette, just at the surface, what looked like a vehicle maneuvering faster and at more ease than a boat should. it was dismissed as coast guards. when the lights went just below the surface of the water, they changed to green. not a turquoise, but a neon green. searching for answers to what this might be, we agreed upon bioluminescent jellyfish. perhaps a school floating at the surface.\r\nbut then these lights turned red! the were now changing from blue to red.\r\nit had been quite difficult to make out these lights from our vantage and the weather was poor, making visibility challenging. the surf was strong and high tide was coming in.\r\nthese lights were in our visibility from the shore for at least 45 minutes.  about 30 minutes into the sighting a helicopter flew very low, and in the same course as the lights had been on, slowly drifting south. at one point there were two sets of red lights, from the helicopter above and at the surface of the water below.\r\ni shot this video in hopes that your instruments and technology can filter out noise of this very poor quality video.\r\nthank you, and i look forward to hearing back from your agency.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\n-kimi k.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ve t&#345;etím poschodí na balkón. m&#283;síc krásn&#283; svítil a byl i dost veliký. bylo sice trochu zataženo ale pár hv&#283;zd bylo vid&#283;t. když jsem se podíval po obloze, tak m&#283; zaujalo t&#283;leso, které se vznášelo nad panelovým sídlišt&#283;m u rohá&#269;ovy ulice v praze 3. zaujalo m&#283; blikáním mnoha &#269;ervených sv&#283;tel. nejprve jsem si myslel, že se jedná o vrtulník, ale tomu tolik sv&#283;tel nebliká. &#268;ervená sv&#283;tla byla velmi jasná, bylo jich více než 10 a neustále blikaly. poslouchal jsem, jestli neuslyším od t&#283;lesa n&#283;jaký hluk, ale nic jsem neslyšel. z tohoto d&#367;vodu vylu&#269;uji, že by šlo o vrtulník. t&#283;leso se pohybovalo velmi pomalu. spíše to vypadalo jako by každou chvíli stálo. t&#283;leso velmi pomalu let&#283;lo (spíše se vznášelo v&#283;trem) sm&#283;rem na vítkov. vzal jsem fotoaparát, po&#345;ídil pár fotek a 2 videa. jelikož nemám fotoaparát na no&#269;ní snímání, tak video je p&#345;i p&#345;iblížení rozmazané. fotoaparát canon má zoom 34x na který jsem filmoval.  neznámé t&#283;leso se asi po více než 10 minutách za&#269;alo vracet zp&#283;t a neustále celou dobu blikaly &#269;ervená sv&#283;tla. vzal jsem si dalekohled 20x60 a prohlédl si t&#283;leso ješt&#283; více zblízka. zjistil jsem, že t&#283;ch blikajících sv&#283;tel je kolem 20 a blikají na n&#283;jaké malé pyramid&#283;, trojúhelníku nebo &#269;tverci. uprost&#345;ed ješt&#283; blikají zelená a modrá sv&#283;tla, která se st&#345;ídají. ty jsem o&#269;ima nevid&#283;l, až teprve v dalekohledu. zárove&#328; jsem se všiml v dalekohledu 2 ramen, které byly asi 3x delší než ten pevný, našedlý prost&#345;edek t&#283;lesa. myslím si, že t&#283;leso bylo vzdálené n&#283;kolik stovek metr&#367;. myslím tak max. do 500m. velikost objektu si vlivem slabší viditelnosti (ve&#269;er) netroufnu odhadnout. t&#283;leso se po celou dobu pohybovalo velmi pomalu, beztišn&#283;

very bright satellite. i call my wife who was in the kitchen to come and see this. we both stood there watching this and could not determine what it was. i said i needed to go outside to see if i

definetely not an airplane or any known flying object. alien life never really bothered me,  until i saw what i saw. it was something like a round flying disk. i tried taking a clear shot with my phone camera, but back then my iphone 4s its camera was not good enough to take any clear pictures of it while i was driving (i didn't want to stop my bike because the object would be too far away by the moment i could take a picture. i saw it hovering for a period of 2 minutes so it was definetely not a glimp. it was moving at a speed of around 200km/h , definetely not very fast! i felt very weird. i didn't tell anyone but my girlfriend because (as a teenager) i was afraid friends would make fun of me. my girlfriend believed me however because she was surprised of how certain i was from what i saw.\r\ni tried to follow the object as it was hovering parallel to the road i was driving on. it disappeared in the grey clouds. i remembered being astonished by the fact that i saw a ufo in belgium, which isn't an important country at all and it would make way more sense if it was in the usa, russia or any other big important country.\r\ni am only reporting this now because the image i have of it still spooks my mind (almost 2 years ago). i searched some of it online and craig r. lang, close encounter researcher and mufon field investigator posted a post on quora on which he recommended this website. \r\n\r\nnote: i didn't really believe in alien life until that event, and i am very certain of what i saw. i only want to share my story and confirm the suspicions of alien life, in hope to encourage your work.\r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\nalbert","distance":"501 Feet - 1

behind my home but it wasn't the moon and there are no lights behind my house. just large trees. i could see it through the trees and then it was more clear. i got nervous. woke my husband and the light dimmed. my husband saw the dimmed light but assured me i was ok. i laid back down and the light was so bright i could see all of my trees (as bright as a baseball feild light) i jumped up and grabbed my son from his room and laid him next to me. closed the door and the light dimmed. i stared at it for a few minutes then it was gone and complete darkness outside. couldn't see a thing. my dog started to growl uncontrollably and my husband took her to walk the house until the dog was more comfortable. we all laid back down and fell asleep. wish i took video this went in for 20 minutes or longer.
