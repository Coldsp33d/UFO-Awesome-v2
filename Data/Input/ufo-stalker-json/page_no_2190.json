6:30pm, to play frisbee golf. many spectators were at the park and were awaiting a hot air balloon launch that was taking place at the balloon field neighboring the park . my friends and i started playing the course and got far enough into the course where we were seperated from the balloon spectators by alot of trees and wooded area. the balloons had not yet taken flight but our eyes were in the sky becase there was a plane flying above circling the balloon field which is about a mile away to the north east, we saw it on its southern pass aound the balloon field. i cannot remember who saw it first but i do remember that we saw one small white dot up and to the east in the very very far distance not moving. at first we thought that it might be a (very) high altitude balloon, but the more we thought about it, we came to the concultion that it was just too high up even for a plane let alone a high altitude balloon. the small white ball did not give off its own light, it was very faint and hard to keep you sight on it so we had to focus hard on it. if it had not been a clear evening it wouldn't have been seen, as we looked at it closer we noticed that there was not just one ball but three in a triangle formation. we watch the three balls for about 15 to 20 mins before we just seemed to loose sight on them. the strangest part of this all was that the balls seems to get slightly closer and further away very slowly changing the angles between the three balls but always keeping a triangle shape, as though they were all connected by somthing unseen.","distance":"Over

night.  my purpose was to observe the stars and look for orbiting satellites and meteors.\r\n\r\nit was a cloudless, clear night. visibility was unlimited.  there was some background light from the town of grand blanc, mi and floodlights associated with the buick open festivities beamed about the sky.  stars, the moon, and normal air traffic were clearly visible.\r\n\r\nshortly after i began sky gazing, i observed one meteor make a short streak in the sky directly above my location.  the meteor was traveling from west to east.  at approximately 10:50 pm. i observed what initially appeared to be another meteor traveling from west to east along a latitude well north of grand blanc, mi. i observed the first streak of light from the apparent meteor and expected not to see another streak due to the meteor having burned up in the atmosphere or skipped back into space.  shortly after the light from the meteor abruptly extinguished, a streak appeared again along the same heading as the first streak and appeared to be roughly the same length.  my subsequent thought was that the meteor had made two skips in the atmosphere and had burned out after he second skip.  when i saw a third streak of light similar to the first two along the same course as the first two i initiated a count (one-one thousand, two-one thousand) and determined that the subsequent streaks of light appeared at approximately two second intervals and had durations of approximately one-half second each. after the fourth or fifth skip, the apparent meteor made a rapid course change from west to east to south/southwest to north/northeast.  the course change was made while the apparent meteor was in contact with the atmosphere as the streak traced out a curve from the previous course to the new course. the meteor then appeared to skip two more times along its new north/northeast heading before its view was blocked by trees in the line of sight of the object.  the meteor appeared to maintain steady course and speed along its two headings.  the duration of this first observation was approximately 30 to 45 seconds.\r\n\r\nexcited about the behavior of the apparent meteor, hereafter referred to as the object, i immediately went inside of my house to tell my wife and one of my sons (the other was out with friends) about the object i had just observed.  my wife had been asleep on the couch and i woke her up to tell her about the object.  i also called down to my son who was in the basement either watching tv or on the pc or internet to tell him about the object.  both my wife and my son expressed interest in what i had observed, made a couple of joking remarks, and chose to remain in the house after i asked them to come out with me to watch the sky in the event the object was in orbit and could come back again.  i expected to see the object in approximately 90 minutes traveling from sse to nne if it was an orbiting object and if its course did not change again.\r\n\r\ni went back outside to continue sky gazing and to wait for the object to fly by again in 90 or so minutes.  i placed a call on my cellphone at 11:07 pm (the call is logged on my cellphone) to my parents' in virginia to tell them, particularly my father who also is a regular sky gazer, about the object i had just observed and its behavior.  my father was asleep on the patio according to my mother so i told her not to wake him.  i told my mother about the object i had just observed and its behavior, and explained to her that i was going to watch for another 90 minutes or so to see if the object was going to fly by my location again.  shortly after the call began, i observed what seemed to be another object traveling from west to east with the apparent light lengths, intensity, durations, altitude, and skipping intervals as the first object i had observed.  the object was traveling along a latitude that was farther south of the first object's latitude and passed almost directly over my position.  the object made approximately four skips and made a rapid course change from it's east to west heading to a sse to nne heading.  the course change was madewhile the object was in contact with the atmosphere as the streak traced out a curve from the previous course to the new course just like the first object i had observed earlier.  the object skipped a couple more times and was observable until its view from my position was blocked by trees along the travel and line of sight of the object.\r\n\r\nexcited that i observed the same type of object within approximately 20 minutes of the first object traveling in the same direction and making a similar course change as the first object, i continued to excitedly tell my mother over the cellphone about the second object and at the same time hurried into my home to tell my wife and son about the object and get them to come outside with me to look for more objects.  my wife stated that she was too sleepy and did not want to go outside to look for more objects.  i called down to my son in the basement and persuaded him to come outside to look for the same or other object and to witness any subsequent object with me as i didn't think anyone would believe that i observed these objects alone.  my son and i went outside to watch the sky in the event the same objects or other similar objects fly by or over again.  we watched the entire sky but expected subsequent objects to be traveling from west to east at anytime between 20 minutes and 90 minutes.  within approximately 15 minutes of going outdoors to watch for the same or similar apparently orbital objects, i was facing west when i observed what appeared to be a similar object traveling from north to south at an azimuth angle just above a line of trees near our position.  the object appeared to exhibit similar light lengths, intensity, durations, altitude, and skipping intervals as the first and second objects i had observed.  i observed the third object for approximately 15 seconds.  upon sighting the third objected, i immediately alerted my son to its position and line of travel by pointing and telling him loudly where to look.  my son picked up the object visually and watched it with me until the object made a rapid course change from north to south to nne to sse and immediately disappeared from both our sights behind the trees west of our position.  my son acknowledged that he did see the third object although he saw it for a shorter duration (approximately 10 seconds) than i did.\r\n\r\nmy son and i waited outside for a while longer to wait to observe any subsequent object or objects similar to the prior objects that might fly by or over our position.  my son went back inside the house after 15 minutes or waiting.  i continued to speak with my mother by cellphone and watch for similar orbiting / skipping objects.  after many more minutes, i did not observe any other orbital / skipping objects similar to the prior three objects, nor did i observe any other objects, to include meteors, other than the stars, the moon, the festive flood lights roaming the sky, and normal air traffic.  i concluded sky gazing and my cellphone call with my mother at approximately 12:15 am on august 1, 2009.  i went back into my home to speak to my wife and son about what my son and i had observed.  i went to bed at 12:22 am on august 1, 2009.\r\n\r\ni am reporting the object or objects i and my son observed on july 31, 2009 as a ufo or ufos as neither i nor my son were able to identify what the object or objects were based on our visual observations and our knowledge and previous observations of flying and orbital objects such as aircraft, meteors, comets, satellites, and manned spacecraft.  i am hopeful that as we sighted these objects on three separate occasions on a cloudless and clear night, that others who might have seen the same objects that same night have filed or will file a report of their observations of the objects as well.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:50:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

was very curious and confused but i took my dog inside and shrugged it off. \r\ni did not look on saturday night, august 1, but on sunday, august 2 between 10-10:30 pm i saw the same light in the same location. when i had gotten home around 10 i had specifically looked in the same direction and had not seen anything. i observed that it was very cloudy and not one star could be seen in the sky. i came out 2 minutes later with my dog and it was there again in the same location! it was the same size and brightness as before. again, i observed it for about 10 minutes and it did not appear to move. i showed my brother and he agreed it was not a star and not an airplane or helicopter. i was a little freaked out so i went inside. i checked it again about 15 minutes later and it was gone. \r\non monday, august 2, i again witnessed the same object at the same approximate time between 10-10:30. this time it was in the same approximate direction but lower and further to the east. it was right above the neighbors tree line in the far distance. this night i showed 2 other members of my family as well as my girlfriend. no one could explain what they were seeing. on this night my younger brother, girlfriend and i also witnessed the same blue and red flashing lights. this time there were two and they both moved slowly through the sky in different directions. at one point one of them passed directly over our heads and we could not identify the object. it is very hard to estimate how high these objects were. we watched the star-like object for about 15 minutes and it did not move at all. we all went inside but checked it about every 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes. every time we checked it after being inside the light had moved higher in the sky. each time it had moved clockwise, notably higher in the sky like an arc. when we would go out to check it never appeared to move, it would always appear fixed in the sky. \r\nthe next night, tuesday, august 4, i got home around 10 pm from a night class. as i drove up i looked but did not see the light. however, upon parking the car and walking to the front door i noticed that it was indeed there. it was in the same spot as monday night. i again showed my mother and younger brother and they agreed it was very odd. we again saw the same blinking blue and red light moving from the east to the west. my mother could not explain what it could be. i viewed it through binoculars and it just appeared to be a bright, ball of light. i tried to record it with a digital camera but could not get a could look at it. my brother and i followed the same routine of checking it every 10 minutes and it again moved in the same pattern as monday, clockwise in a high arc. the change in location were very noticeable, yet when we watched it always appeared to be fixed. after about 30 minutes it was gone again. this is all very strange and it is freaking me out because it appears to show up just as i return from being somewhere. it only moves when i am not watching and it always disappears when i am not watching. i would like someone in the lancaster area to get a telescope on this thing to try and identify it. i am contacting mufon so they can identify this thing and get me some answers. if you are in the lancaster area check the sky around 10-11 pm. tonight august 4 the moon was very visible and it appeared to be to the east of the moon and lower in the sky. this star-like object is definitely not a tower of any kind as it moves in the sky. it is also not a conventional aircraft or a star (again because it moves and disappears and is much larger and brighter than any star).
