lately. i sat watching maybe 30 minutes after seeing a couple falling stars and a plane when i spotted a brighter object out of the nw headed somewhat towards me going se. i first looked at it through my night-vision binoculars cause it wasn't moving irregularly but i didn't notice strobe lights. i then got video recorder ready and and started filming. i could not see anything in the lcd lens so i just pointed in the direction it was and hoped i was catching this just in case. the object was almost past me when it did some pulsating or something and disappeared, but i want to call it \"flickering out.\" i did manage to catch some video but the quality isn't great cause it's shaky and i played the video to my tv and recorded that with my iphone so it's a video of a video. i did upload the video to youtube.Com from my phone and if you search (possible ufo near victoria,tx) or search my username (joshtx1) you should find it. i do have the original video that i need to upload to the computer but i have to upgrade nerophoto if that's what it's called. i first tried to report my sighting through my iphone and got all the way through it all and it wouldn't let me do it so.. tonight (8-4-09)i was searching through texas sighting because i found a link about june being hot ufo month for texas and i went there to find a report from victoria, tx on the same night i saw something (6-26-09). my video recorder reads 10:09pm, their report is like 11:43pm. i thought that was really strange so it pushed me to come on and give my

noises, one of which was a high pitch whine, sort of like as a plane might be diving or crashing, the other sound was more of a rumble similar to a very large blimp. my sons, were awoke by the rumble.\r\nit had three lights which were airplane like,in a light red tone forming a perfect equilateral triangle. there were also two white alternating lights that appeared to be in a center-front position on the bottom of the craft.\r\n\r\nit appeared to be flying very slow and at low altitude as it flew over toward the refinery. i saw what looked like a wide flattish wing bending up at the outside edge, in a grey shade, as the refinery's flame reflected off the item, (the flares give off an eerie glow as they burn, so who knows the actual color).\r\n\r\ni saw the ufo from a different angle than my son, he was on the 2nd floor, i was on ground level. getting water, when i heard the rumble and then the whining . it sounded like a plane going to crash  and i went to look out back, it had already passed over, so i ran back inside and watched the triangle of lights continue towards the refinery (the color seems not as red to me, but i was looking through low-e glass).\r\nour guess is some sort of military item, but we can't identify it. my son, (who is very into military aircraft) thinks the closest likeness would be a c-130j super hercules, as perhaps a cargo plane for the blue angels, but he really didn't think that was it. he said it was moving too slowly for anything he could think of, and if it was in fact moving at a normal cruising speed, then that would make the craft a massive size, being that it would be at high altitude. when he went out in front of the house to look again, the craft started to fade off in the distance and for the last portion of visibility the only lights to be seen were the white flashing ones. we watched until it flew out of range and/or was no longer in sight we stayed up for quite awhile watching the sky trying to find it again, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nwe live very close to a naval air station, and also have the blue angles in seattle for seafair. we get all the navy jets, planes and helicopters over our house on a

up and downs, sudden diagonals, and rapid left to rights.  it was aproximately 30-40 degrees above the horizon facing almost exactly due east.  then last night, monday, 8/3/09, i saw the same type of light from dover, nh.  using my cell phone i called foster's daily democrat, the local newspaper, and a reporter came out who also observed the unusual object.  i then drove back to my apartment in rochester, nh and continued to watch it do its unusual movements until approximately 4 a.M. on 8/4/09 when i was too tired to continue watching.  before i retire, however, i used my compass to determine it was in the south-southwest area of the night sky (205-220 degrees on compass) and i also estimate it was between 30 and 45 degrees above the horizon (with zenith being 90 degrees, for

(again, just an educated guess). since this was not my first ufo sighting, i didn't freak out or lose my composure, but my friend was only conviced that they were helicopters, because he doesn't buy

but  we continued anyway. at the top of the road we encountered a red glowing orb in the background approximately 1 foot in diameter and about 15 feet off the road. one of my friends walked toward it to see what it was when it floated closer to us revealing that the orb was disembodied and floating in mid air. we freaked out and started running back toward the car, and realized that it was following us about 10 feet behind. once we got around the bend, it stopped following us and we returned to our car and left. we would like to find out more about this strange event if anyone can help or have received any other reports like this in the ventura county please let us know. thanks.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18468,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.4557495,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08042009-0005","longitude":-119.237699,"occurred":1223622000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

hudson river, it was october 29, 1977, i had been told by my boyfriend never to turn the lights out, outside or inside at night. i was home with my son who was 2 years old. it was a ranch house, and it had heating vents in the ceilings. i heard a loud rumbling noise, that i had heard before, it was so strong that it shook the vents out of place in the ceiling. i was tired of climbing up and fixing them. it was 7pm, my son was asleep and i turned on the tv and it was all scrammbled. i heard the rumbling and humming noises and turned all the light out. i went to the front bedroom window, opened it, and was kneeling down looking out towards the river area. i heard what sounded like a horse whinning in the distance, and could see beyond the woods flashing lights close to the ground in a circle pattern.I saw closer to the house my boyfriends dog and cat shaking from fright under a bush, near the house. i looked up in the sky and saw a aerial display of lights, one large main flying light surrounded by smaller ones. it looked like the smaller flying things were protecting the larger one. the sky was clear, i thought i could just watch all their darting and moving around and who would care.I even pinched myself to make sure i was seeing what i was seeing. then a glowing object left the formation and started coming closer to my location, i watched it fly towards the house closer and closer, i was experiencing great fear, but was frozen and could not move, the  dome,a red glowing thing hovered outside my window area, to the height of the roof eave, i was staring into a red fireball hovering, could not move or speak, only think words. i told them that i would not watch any more. a flash of red light and i was gone. when i found  myself back, maybe 30 minutes or longer, i had a stiff neck, and i was bleeding internally.My boyfriend came home and told me the truth, and he told me that he had seen them and was doing things for them by the hudson river. they would tell him to collect things and he would bring the things to them. he described them as 4ft high, slanty red eyes, they were sub human and knew everything he was thinking and doing. they gave him large vegetables to eat. the next morning the local paper had many stories about people calling the police, and reporting sightings, their animals were going crazy. central hudson electric would not allow any investigators on that property. i thought it was over for me but it was not, too make it short, i had to go to a doctor i did not know, and he told me that i had a perforated uterus. during the exam, which was a few months later he told me that i was not pregnant. i was being told that when something happened i was suppose to wrap it up and put it outside in a certain spot. i had no idea why they had told me that until one more month had passed and one day out of nowhere something came out and i did what they told me to do, wrap it up and put it in a certain place. for the next five months i ignored them, and then we were told that all the houses were going to be demolished, and my boyfriend was given the job to demolish them. i remember that they told me that 3 of them would come to ask me for assistance at some time later.I know what they did, an experiment to find out if they could impregnate humans. they had me reading all these different books for information. i know that they get you with fear, and mind control. they are very intelligent.\r\n\r\nit was october of 1987, monroe ny county of orange, i was listening to the tv about a black man that said he was abducted, he was illerate prior to the abduction, and when i heard him describe the aliens i went to watch and hear what he was saying, he said there time is not our time, it is 10 years difference. my boyfriend was visiting and woke me one night afraid and said that he heard flying noises and looked and saw ufos. i told him okay, don't worry. when he had left for a business trip and i was alone with the kids, one night i was woken up at 3am, october of 1987 and i looked out my two story front window. below on the ground in full light were 3 of the same aliens, 4ft tall, gray bodies, no segmentation of their bodies, and slanty red eyes. they were calling my name and asking me to come out. i told them no, and went to bed. there was no fear any longer. \r\n\r\ni never looked for them any longer, and figured that they were gone forever. in 2003 while shopping a strange lady approached me and invited me a stranger, to have tea at her house. she said it was important and i had to come. i will not name her, but i went because i was curious. she told me that she was a physhic and read for the queen of england, she needed to warn me about the ufo people. i had never said a word to her about what happened to me in 1977 and in 1987. she told me that they are evil, and they are not done with me yet. i told her that i was done with them and she they are not done with me. that was in 2003. i knew that day in the store, when this strange lady was following me around for hours, was odd, but she was really a very gifted person. that happened in naples, florida. i lived in port charlotte, florida from 2003 to 2009, and i ignored the flying  objects i would see. i saw that news article about rowley in north port, fl.I knew it was all made up. any person, that is taken against their free will, in fear, with their power of mind control, they have no mouths, who is awake the entire time, not asleep or dreaming, or taking medication, or drinking, does not consider the long term effects to be funny. i read later on about the guy in middletown ny, he was telling the truth, the halls, they were telling the truth. it is understandable, unless you experience it for your self, that you can not believe that it exists. i think the ufo crafts need the electric from the water and power plants, they experiment, they try to breed their people with humans, and perhaps that is what they want to show me. i do know, if they want to make contact they can, but if you show no fear it lessens their power. i can tell if a person has really been affected by the trama that such an encounter causes. i lived it. i have seen ufos on alligator alley coming from fort lauderdale to naples, the craft flew directly over our car, you could see the bottom and all the lights, my husband saw it, my kids saw it. my kids believed what they saw as unusual, my husband did not. my sons father, who has passed away, told me back in newburgh ny, that the alliens think it is funny how stupid we are, and how the cause and cure for cancer is so simple yet we can not figure it out. \r\n\r\nyou can check the records for the dates i have written, a lady in maybrook ny on the morning of october 30, 1977 saw a ufo, was so scared she had heart pains and the middletown record had a story about it. why did traprock want all those houses in that private area demolished without much notice?  i do believe that they are not good but they are evil, like the woman told me, and to stay far away from them.........","distance":"20 Feet or

noticed a 2 lights coming towards me. this didn't seem to unusual to me considering i live in staten island, ny and we have 3 big airports in the vicinity.(jfk, lag, nwk) as the craft got closer it seemed odd to me so i asked my wife to look out the window at the object. within seconds she ran outside to get a better look. the unknown object was moving rather quickly. like i said airplanes fly over my house all day and night and they are usually on approach so they are not traveling full speed, but this object was moving very fast thru the sky. at this point it was close to overhead and we noticed it it was actually 3 lights in a triangular shape with a blinking red light dead in the center. i could not see the outline of the object, but it was blocking out the stars above it. as far as the lights seemed, the object was somewhat larger than a plane, but this was because it was at a lower altitude than the planes that usually fly over. what was even more amazing was the fact there was no noise, even though it was low in the sky. as it passed over of us we just couldn't take our eyes off of it. then we noticed a 4th light in between the 2 lights in the back of the craft. it seemed very odd that a 4th light would just illuminate suddenly. my wife and i were puzzled as to what it could be and before we knew it it was gone and out of sight. we decided to watch 2 planes that flew over minutes afterward and not too surprising was the fact that there was no comparison. when the planes flew over you could not only hear them loud and clear, but we could actually see the outline of the airplane. and the airplanes had one bright light and 2 blinking lights on either side of the main light. they looked nothing like the object we saw. now i won't pretend to be an expert on airplanes, but i have seen planes flying overhead everyday my entire life leaving in the nyc area and this was different. if anyone can supply me with some opinions as to what it maybe or  know of any sightings of similar craft around this area or date please let me know. i do know it wasn't a balloon, kite, satellite, space debris, or a helicopter, so please do not give me some lame excuse. tank you and i appreciate it.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

probably less than a minute.  i walked outside on my patio early that morning and looked up at the stars in the clear predawn sky.  i turned my head to the left and at that moment i noticed a bright light, maybe twice the size of venus.  the light appeared to be moving right at me even though very high up and it seems that as it noticed that i was looking straight at it, it then began to move backwards and then to go up even higher until it finally became non-visible.\r\n  \r\nso many thoughts went through my head at a rapid speed regarding what i might have thought this thing to be as i was looking at it.  i knew that it couldn���t be a satellite because it was just too bright and because of the way that it had just suddenly reversed itself and went straight up till it disappeared.  i have never seen satellites behave that way.  there were no running lights, no port or starboard lights on what i was seeing.  it was just a big ball of light.  the light also seemed to be sort of flickering at the center.  i say flicker, but i mean that it was more like if one were to take some crinkled tin foil and move it around in the hand just slightly so that it throws light reflections around.  \r\n\r\nthere actually was a car going by at exactly the same time that i saw this light in the sky.  i remember thinking as it happened that the lights on this car could be reflecting on something and causing this light in the sky, but quickly dismissed that idea since the car was down below me and on the street behind my apartment, which is on the second level, and the bright light i saw in the sky seemed too high up to be a reflection from anything on the ground.      \r\n  \r\nthis sighting affected me in a very unfamiliar way.  i feel that my reaction to it was very instinctual and quick. i became very afraid as i stood there watching it move up into non-visibility.  i think the hair on my arms stood up and that it made my skin crawl.  the one thing that really got to me was that i felt this light was being stealthy and creeping in on me and when i turned my head to look at it, it just backed away, as though it knew that i was looking at it and sort of catching it in the act.  i felt like a frightened animal, or a cornered animal.  i then just gave up on watching it disappear and bolted back inside.  upon entering i looked at the clock and it was 4 a.M.  my clock on the wall is two minutes fast, so the actual time was more like 3:58 a.M.

planes occasionally fly over, and under it.  they seemed to be observing it.  i hope that means you have reports from skilled aviators this morning..  it looked to be about one fourth the width of the moon.  i imagine it to be a round craft, but what i saw was a straight line, brightly lit, about one fourth of the width of the moon, left of the moon in my line of vision.  the light was very bright
