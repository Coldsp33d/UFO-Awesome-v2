house (i live in montrose, colorado) visiting.  even though she was at her river house, i decided to stay at her house in murrysville because my lunch date the following day was close to it.\r\n\r\nmy 14 year old daughter and i decided to sleep in her great room on her l-shaped couch because she was hoping to see a ufo like her aunt had been talking about.\r\n\r\nit was approx. 10:45 when we both were talking about which window my sister had been seeing the most ufos from.  it was the front one that's 25 feet alpine style wall of windows facing the valley.  so my daughter propped up the pillows and was staring out the window (with disbelief that ufos actually fly by this house). the cat jumped up next to her, and as it was petting it, the cat excited jump down and ran around the living room smacking into the bird cage.  as that was happening, my daughter sat straight up and yelled, \"waaaaaa! what the heck was that!\"  \"mom, did you see that!!\" i was facing the wrong direction so didn't get to see it.\r\n\r\n\"mom, i don't know what that was! it was a big bright orange-ish/red light that just shot across the sky\" she indicated from right to left, horizonally, which would be w to e or ene approx. above the treeline.  she could not tell the shape, however, because of the high rate of speed it zipped across, appearing like a streak the size of a golf ball, held at arm's length.\r\n\r\nshe said, \"mom, did you hear it?\"  and i said, \"what, did it make a noise?\" \r\nand she said, \"yeah!  it sounded kinda like when someone shoots a firework with a whizzing sound\".\r\nbut it must have been not that loud because i couldn't hear it above laughing at the cat's antics.\r\n(her young ears are better than my 40 year old ones, though).  when my sister played back her ir daytime ufo video june 13, 2009, with the sound (on youtube channel:  seeingufospa), she said that was the exact sound it made.\r\n\r\nthen, she said, \"mom, it was the coolest thing...It had to have been a ufo! you got to stay up with me because i'm sure another one is going to fly by soon.  i just know it will!\"\r\n\r\nshe sat there with such excitement, like she had just drunk 3 energy drinks waiting for it to happen again, but it never came back and we fell asleep.\r\n\r\nwhen we told my sister the next day,  she hugged and told my daughter, \"welcome to the ufo seer's club!\"  she's estatic that someone else outside the immediate family was witness to a sighting.\r\n\r\nshe's afraid people will think she's a kook and doesn't want to tell anyone about it.\r\ni have to admit, that before this, i had reservations about all the sightings my sister had told me about, not because she makes things up, but because i seemed so unbelievable that so many could be seen in one area.  i haven't seen any yet in colorado, although your site lists several reports. i'm so jealous that i didn't get to see it.   i will definately start looking at the skies with more regularity now.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18442,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4363915,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08022009-0007","longitude":-79.689065,"occurred":1249020000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,

next to ours, northwest to southeast.  it moved quickly and then it was out of my sight line.  it was the size of a basketball from my vantage point.  there was absolutely no sound from it.  i was stunned but quite excited .. i just stood there questioning whether i had really just witnessed it and desperately wanted it to come back.  this week i read another report from pa and they described something very similar to what i saw.  i now feel more confident to report this and that my eyes and mind weren't playing tricks on me!  \r\n\r\ni don't know if this has anything to do with what i saw but our neighbors tree came crashing down in the back yard sometime in early june.  i called my neighbor to report it since they were away.  i remember thinking it had died rather quickly and it seemed to be in the same location where i first caught sight of this object before it rolled out of view.  in the past month, we also have had a maple tree that is dying and needs to be taken down.  it seems it lost leaves at the top this spring and is dying down from the top instead of up from the trunk. our property is heavily wooded w/ an easement that runs along the expressway.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

the sierra nevada mountains. i grabbed my binoculars (10x50) and steadied myself across the hood of my truck to get a better look at the light. it just hung in the sky, not moving at all. it was partly cloudy and the moon was out, about half a moon. this light was much brighter than the moon or any other object in the sky. i brought the binoculars into the house with me to show my wife, through the window. as i pulled up my \"night sky\" program on the computer, to check for a possible planet that was clearly visable (and large looking). i looked out the unobstructed window through my binocs and watched the bright white \"ball\" vanish right before my eyes. \r\n this is the second such object i have seen in a week. i am very confident that this was no plane or satellite. i am getting ready to view the persiad meteor shower this month, and have been seeing alot of \"stray\" meteors here and there. my wife and i reported the same type of sighting last october, but that one was moving from nw to se. \r\n i'm surprised that nobody else from my area has reported this strange \"light in the sky\"\r\n we are very close to lake tahoe, and i have to wonder if the lake has

was still no sound. the fire light appeared to be at the nose of a partialy revealed structure. i called for my wife joanne to come outside and serve as a witness, it took several seconds for her to

after the pass of the building. \r\n\r\ni thought this would have been some kind of light rotating or reflection of some sorts but kept looking around with not finding anything at all. there were several helicopters and planes we could see in the distance that did not compare to this spherical glowing object. \r\n\r\nmy clearest photo was in the 20x digital zoom. 12.1 megapixel.

 there were no fixed-wings, contrail, or sounds associated with traditional aircraft.  i also viewed it through some older binoculars, but can only use one side at a time, so it wasn't exceptionally optimal viewing.  it did not appear round or tear-dropped like a balloon.  but it's possible this could have been some type of inflatable object.  however, the sunlight really gleamed off of this thing and i couldn't detect any kind of equipment hanging down.\r\n\r\nit also seems unlikely that a balloon would just appear from nowhere, then vanish the same way.  it didn't drift at all for the 7 minutes i viewed it.  the nws in valley, ne releases weather balloons at 6am and 6pm every day, but the winds were very calm that day/night, so it's hard to believe it would have ended up above central omaha at that time.  they also expand to about 20 ft. in diameter before popping and it seems illogical that one could see that small an object at that altitude from the ground.\r\n\r\nfinally, about 15 minutes later the object in 9411 traversed the sky in about the same area from w to e.  i also took 5 or 6 pics of jets that same night and anything that high had contrails.  this one clearly did not.  nor was there any noise from it.  when zooming in on the picture, it almost appears convex and not linear as a jet airliner would appear.  the motion was also very smooth, but arced.  if this was a jet, why wouldn't it have also had a contrail?\r\n\r\n\r\nemail jbr3adventures@yahoo.Com with any comments.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":18418,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2599034,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07312009-0013","longitude":-95.9900483,"occurred":1248833400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Nebraska","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1248833400000,"summary":"Shimmering silver-mettalic ufo hovers at 20-30k feet, then vanishes","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18418_submitter_file1__100_9406.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18418_submitter_file2__100_9408.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18418_submitter_file3__100_9411.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18418_submitter_file4__100_9406A.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/18418_submitter_file5__18418100_9408A.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Omaha, Nebraska","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:203533"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Westport","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at john reed rd going to gumbys head when i saw this really bright object. at first, i was thinking it was a star because it was not moving, but i noticed that this was 3 lights together. i could see for approximately 5 minutes, then it simply disappeared without movement or sound. it was not an airplane. i can say because i worked 5 years in a airport when i was in the air force.
