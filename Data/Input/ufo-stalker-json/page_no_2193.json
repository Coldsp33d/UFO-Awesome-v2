reno on monday 7/27/09, and was driving it back to st. louis on i-80, on monday night.  i had just crossed over the utah border and saw the bonneville salt flats exit sign on i-80.  the wind was blowing about 30 knots, which caused my bike to lean as i drove at about 80 miles per hour. it was dark, very few if any clouds, dry and the conditions were nominal except for the tremendous wind from the north blowing southward. i was also wearing a helmet, full face.\r\ni was looking up at all the stars and the blinking lights of many planes traversing the sky as i drove in the darkness. a white light then appeared to my right (south) at very high altitude at about my 40 degree position.  i estimate the altitude and distance to be 15,000 feet at 10 to 15 miles out. when it shown its light, it appeared to be a plan with running lights, breaking through the clouds--in other words, it had a halo effect.\r\ni dismissed this as a plane, even though there were very few clouds directly above me; however, at that distance, there could have been more clouds.  as i drove, the ultra bright white light descended and was moving fast towards me.  about 2 minutes later, the light appeared again, altitude, much lower and much closer than before, maybe 8 to 10 miles. this kept happening about every 2 to 3 minutes, the light would power up, shine in my direction, then slowly turn off, as if were a river barge light. it didn't just switch off, it quickly phased down. i kept looking back thinking that the light should eventually cross the road behind me since it was on a 90 degree angle to me and heading in my direction.  at some point, i should have traveled east of it's trajectory to the north since we were on a perpendicular course.  but that never happened.  the light lit up about 6 to 7 times, each time, closer, brighter, lower and especially disturbing, always in the same 40 degree position as when i first viewed it.  logically, that meant that the light was keeping pace with me, which was very disturbing to me, but i was never afraid, just extremely compelled to continue to look on that same heading of south, south-east. i couldn't decide which was more interesting, the fact that it was getting closer to me, or the fact that it was always in the same position to me.  after about 6 events of the light turning on and then off, duration each time being about 3 to 5 seconds, it then was at it's closest point to me, about 1 mile.  what happened next was absolutely fascinating and the even then caused me to dismiss my assumption of an airplane or helicopter and/or the characteristics of a man made craft that i had ever seen before.  the second to the last time of this close encounter the light shown at me, very close, one mile and this time it continued to stay on.  one to two seconds later, two other lights to its left came on along with it, same luminosity, same distance, moving with me but not horizontally symmetrical to each other.  they were all three equidistant to each other, but the middle one was at a higher elevation than the other two making it appear to me as a very flat pyramidal grouping of three white, brilliant, lights about 1 mile away from me.  there was never any beam of any sort and i looked to see if the white salt below became illuminated because of the lights.  it did not.  just brilliant white lights off to my 40 to 45 degrees each time.  at the closest point to me, i estimate the altitude to now be about 600 to 1,000 feet at a distance of no more than 1 mile from me, if even that.\r\nthe three lights then all turned off at the same time, vaporising down, like a river barge's lights.  i now figured that these lights were directly pointing at me, why i don't know.  i felt that this was now a personal experience i was having and not just random lights.  there was too much evidence of this for me to dismiss it now.  i always saw stars in the background as if these lights were not a part of any craft or solid object.  they appeared independent of each other but uniformly symmetrical in their formation, except for the slightly flattened pyramidal characteristic described above.  \r\nthe last time it shown on me was amazing!  that same single light appeared one last time, same heading to me, same distance and same altitude as before.  from a distance of about half a mile away i saw what looked like lcd, brilliant orangish/reddish, lights scrolling from way behind the light, to the left in a huge circle and as it came around the circle, i could see more of the colored light, exactly as if it were and vegas lcd scrolling around the circumference of a huge, circular disk.  about 6 to 10 of these very fast pulsations of colored light came from the exact same spot way behind the light, circled around a huge disk shaped object and came in to full view to me and ended at the light that was still showing at me.  this was one giant pulse of about 6 to 8 individual scrolling lights which made the outline of a circular disk.  but the disk was on a tilt slightly, about 15 degrees, so the lights went slightly up, over and downward and then abruptly ended at the white light that had stayed on the entire time, about 10 to 12 seconds. \r\ni was so shocked by this......I pulled the bike over on the shoulder of the highway. the wind was so fast, it about blew it over.  i was speechless at what i had just seen and was hoping for it to appear to me again.  some time went by as i had resumed riding and the light never appeared close to me again.  however, i saw the light one more time. it had flown way off in the distance, just above the horizon, very far from me, south, where it blinked one more time as if it had lost interest in me.......And was now searching for someone else to totally freak out. \r\ni felt as if this thing was momentarily interested in me somehow.  it didn't seem hostile in any way.....Moreover, it seemed to want to show me that it was not a plane or helicopter that i kept insisting it was in my mind. why? i don't know. the last even, the pulsation, was absolutely beautiful.  it revealed a disk shape, 180 degrees of a half circle, in the most brilliant orange and red light i have ever seen, except a cutting torch, maybe.  i could always see stars behind it which i am now even more convinced it was cloaked, but the pulses did reveal a huge semi-circle.\r\ni had not been driking, nor was i tired nor was i on any kind of medication or drugs of any kind.  there was no reason for my mind to be impared what-so-ever.  i know what i saw but i can't explain the reason for any of it.  question: has anyone else reported this or a similar event over the bonneville salt flats, in utah?

stopped first in a place called ���area 101��� where i spoke with a number of ufo enthusiasts about the contact movement���s program of interacting with the intelligence (presumably et) behind the ufo phenomenon. from there i headed south and met with a young man who described his having positive interactions with what he identified as ets throughout his life with numerous sightings that he claimed had an interactive component. after i explained to him a term that i have coined called ���prime contactee��� (reserved for individuals who can request a sighting and actually have one occur)  he thought that he definitely was a ���prime.���\r\n\r\nat my mom���s house in koreatown i brought my luggage up to the second floor and looked out through a screen window. it was 1:45 am. the lights of the city reflecting off the overcast skies lit up the neighborhood. the silhouettes of palm trees graced the horizon. i gazed out to the west and immediately noticed a blinking stationary red light about ten degrees above the rooftops of the surrounding two story homes. \r\n\r\nfor many years i have looked through that window on visits to la and can never recall seeing such a light in the sky before. it was difficult to judge its distance as there were no landmarks behind it. it was relatively large, about a finger breaths wide at arms full length. in trying to figure our what it was my first thought was of  flashing red lights on a radio antennae array some 3 miles to the west.  they are not visible from my mom���s house and besides this light was solitary and far too large. as i had this thought the light began to slowly move horizontally to the north. this was no stationary aircraft beacon sitting on an antenna. police helicopters routinely patrol this part of central la and the light was not part of any fixed or rotating wing aircraft. at this late hours all was quiet in  this heavily residential neighborhood. the red pulsating object, circular in shape moved behind a tree. i waited for it to emerge into view on the other side. it did not. i waited and scanned the sky and listened intently for the sound of aircraft. none  could be was heard. \r\nwas this just another \"random sighting?\" or could it have been a consciousness mediated show of support for my networking efforts among the ufo experiencers that i like to call \"the contact underground?\" my guess is that it was a show of support because the next day i got a call from a contact team leader who told me that her skywatch team had a sighting of a round red ufo at midnight the previous night. it was less than two hours before my sighting. coincidence? perhaps but i don't think so!","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

noticed what at first glance appeared to be a helicopter descending from the sky in our neighborhood. it had two orange-ish/white flashing lights, and one that occasional flashed red. at first i thought that it was landing on or near the elementary school due south of our home in rita ranch. the school sits on a street called rees loop. \r\n\r\nit was immediately noted that there was no sound emanating from the object, which, if it had been a helicopter, would have been audible given our distance from the school. but there was no sound at all. i could see two flashing orange-ish/white lights and one red. we only got a quick look at the object before it descended below the line of houses and out of our view. \r\n\r\nwe sat back down and watched another ten more minutes of the movie. then we saw the same object ascending in the same place that it originally descended. my fiance noticed it first this time, through the sliding glass door that leads to the backyard of our home from the living room. she jumped up off the couch and ran out the back door. i immediately followed. \r\n\r\nby the time we were outside (less than 5 seconds later) the object had begun to move slowly west/northwest, in the direction of davis mothan air force base. this was at about 11:15pm. what was noticeable this time was that it was audible. the sound was not that of a helicopter, but more of a whirring noise like that of a jet engine. but very high pitched in tone, like when a jet engine first starts. this sound stayed steady as we watched it slowly fly low over the neighborhood. we lost sight of it when it went past the roof of the neighbor's house. \r\n\r\nwe then ran through our house and into the street out front. we again watched it move slowly across the sky, the same sound, same slow movement. we eventually lost sight of it as the view was blocked by a large tree on the north side of the street a few house to the west of us. again, there were two orange-ish/white flashing lights and one red one that could be see on the object. the lights were very bright and were not far from us at all. given the brightness of the lights, there was not way to distinguish the shape of the object.  judging from the size of the lights and their distance apart, it appeared to be far to large to be a helicopter.\r\n\r\nafter seeing it from the street out front, it was obvious that there were no propellers on top or back, and the size showed it to be far to large to have descended near the school.  past the back of the school on the south side there is desert, then old vail road, and more desert with train tracks.  a few miles further to the south lies i10.  the size, when viewed from the street, leads me to believe the area of descent was at least out near or past old vail road.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

was returning home from working at a festival. i live in chengdu, sichuan, china. i had been working outside of chengdu about 25 kilometers south of the city. i was returning home at the time of the sighting. i was riding a three wheeled electric bicycle traveling approx 10 miles per hour. i was traveling north bound. it was approx 9:00 to 9:15pm and the event lasted for approx 20 to 25 minuets. the surrounding area is a heavy traffic road with three lanes going either way, north and south. there is a meridian in between the lanes with foliage as well as foliage on the outer edges of the road.\r\n\r\nas i was traveling home i noticed four green lights in the sky clumped together like grapes or an upside down cone with a white light to one side of it. if i had to guess or how high it was i would say approx 300 feet, but, i really have no idea on how high, but i knew it was higher than any building, yet, just below the cloud cover since there had been light rain that evening. because of the height it was too low for an airplane to be flying.\r\n\r\nthe lights caught my attention because they were of an unusual green color and they were not moving. at first i thought it might of been a helicopter but then i noticed a second set of lights to the west of the ones i first saw. the second set of lights had two green lights and a white light. the second craft would have the two green lights on then one would go off and the white light would go on. it did this through out my observations.\r\n\r\nas i became aware that these were not any kind of aircraft that i am familiar with, i stopped my bike, turned it off and got off it and walk away from it a little to make sure nothing from my bike got in the way of what i was looking at. i kept watching the objects. at first they didn't move. then the second object moved about six inches to the south. the second object was further away, i would say approx a mile from where i was standing, where the first object might of been less than a 1/4 mile from me.\r\n\r\nafter the second object moved it started flashing the white light a lot. then the first object flashed it's white light and moved southwards very slowly and with out a sound. the second object then moved again and the first object then moved northward almost back to its' original position. again there was no sound at all.\r\n\r\nduring this time some people that were riding by, saw that i was staring upward and they stopped to look as well. some folks in a car stopped, a man took some photos and then sped away, (these were all chinese citizens). i only had my cell phone with me and sad to say that the quality of my cell camera is very poor and when i tried to see if i could photograph the objects, they would not even show up on the screen.\r\n\r\ni stayed to watch the crafts to see what would happen. the second craft started to go downward as if it were landing. the first craft in less than a few seconds caught up to the second craft and was behind it, or so it seemed, and started flashing a lot of multicolored lights. the second craft also started flashing multicolored lights and then both crafts descended as though they were landing.\r\n\r\nit was at this point that i lost sight of them. i stayed and watched the area for another five minuets to see maybe that they would lift back up but nothing happened. i really think they landed. i will go back tomorrow to the area where i think they went down to see if there is any trace of what happened tonight.\r\n\r\nin closing, i feel this is important and our government needs to know about this happening here. i will go to the american consulate and report what i have just said here to them and see what happens. my thoughts on this are that what i saw was amazing. i just feel that our government will just blow me off and this will be filed 13. i will write a report tomorrow after my investigation of the area. even if these craft can be explained my concern is that we do not have anything that moves as these crafts did to my knowledge. if the chinese government has craft that can do the speeds that i witnessed then we need to take notice.\r\n\r\nfollow up:\r\n\r\n26 july 2009. time of report is now 1:35pm\r\n\r\ni had returned to the sighting area to see what i could find of my sightings. the weather is very rainy with dark overcast clouds. there are a lot of black government cars traveling all over the area. it seems excessive to me but then i am only guessing. i have seen a couple of gov cars where the occupants were talking to local vendors and people standing around. i am not fluent in chinese so i do not know what they are talking about, and they seem to stop talking when i approach. i dare not take my camera out to take photos.\r\n\r\ni do manage to go to a road behind the tree line where i saw the crafts descend and there are many open fields in the area. it is very possible that the crafts could of landed in any of the many fields there. again i see gov cars ( a chinese gov car has a white plate with black lettering), around so i do not even attempt to go wandering in any of the fields where i suspect the crafts might of landed. sorry can not do more at this time, i do not know what the gov is doing here, nor do i know their attitude of these things, if indeed, that is why they are here.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18402,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.658601,"location":null,"logNumber":"CN-07302009-0007","longitude":104.064856,"occurred":1248580800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Sichuan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1248580800000,"summary":"Green

shots of the same location within 10 seconds of the one in which the ufo appears. only the third photo shows the anomaly. i remember noticing a black dot seemed to suddenly appear as i snapped the picture. i glanced at my digital camera and verified that, indeed, there was a strange black object in the sky between the two domes. i figured it was a bird and thought nothing further of the photo. but when i reviewed my photos from that day, i realized the black object was unlike anything i have ever seen. it appears far too organic to be a plane or a jet or any other kind of flying machine. i have never seen a bird look like this in any photo that i have ever taken. and if it is a bird, judging from the distance it seems to be from the dome, it would be an awfully large bird. it almost has a dragon-like appearance, with a pronged tail streaming behind it as it flies across the sky. i would have noticed such a creature soaring across the sky before taking the picture, i am sure! so, i don't know what it could be. i don't think it is a ufo in the classical sense--a \"flying saucer\" or some other advanced flying technology. perhaps it is a rare sighting of some other-dimensional being a la john keel and the mothman prophecies. or, maybe it's just a funky photo of a large bird in flight. if you look closely at the sky in the left part of the photo, there are circling birds, probably vultures, in the far distance. none of them, however, are in close proximity to the anomaly reported and none of them have a shape resembling the anomaly.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Unknown","city":"Moorhead","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While this is by no means my first ufo sighting, it is the most recent.  my pseudonym is arynn, and i am a resident of moorhead, mn.  since my early childhood, i have experienced multiple abduction incidients and ufo sightings, however the incident which i will describe here is one of the few in which someone else would be able to confirm it along with me.\r\n\r\ni was (and am still currently) living in an apartment complex in south moorhead, just off of 20th st.  it was myself and my two roommates, both of them brothers.  in this report i will refer to them as jeremy and michael.  i am still currently living with jeremy, but michael (who was the person who witnessed this event with me) has since moved out and is living with his sister several hours away from here.  \r\n\r\nthe approximate date of this incident was mid october of 2008, before halloween if i recall correctly.  it took place sometime after 11 pm, but before midninght, and the entire sighting lasted perhaps 3-5 minutes.\r\n\r\nmichael and i had decided to head out to the courtyard of our apartment for a cigarette.  the courtyard is on the western side of the building in which we live.  i remember that it was a clear, cloudless night, and we had a pretty decent view of the western skyline from where we were standing.  michael and i had been talking for a few minutes, i dont recall what about, when i saw what i at first assumed to be a satellite or a very distant airplane moving in the sky, a few miles out over fargo, nd across the red river.  the first thing that made me realize that this was not an airplane was that it appeared to be bobbing back and forth up in the air, in a north/south trajectory.  i pointed this out to michael, who as far as i know had never seen any kind of ufo in his life, and he appeared to be completely dumbfounded as to what it was.  i also noted that while i could not define the shape of the object, it looked very much like a star from the distance i viewed it at, it seemed to be rotating through a pattern of bright colors, seemingly the entire visual spectrum, plus a few \"colors\" that i can not really define as they don't correspond to anything that i see on a regular basis.  \r\n\r\nnow after about a minute or two of staring at this thing floating up in the sky, things took a bit of a twist.  it is difficult to describe how i understand this, but i somehow felt this object become aware that i could see it.  i felt some sort of consciousness reach out and touch my mind, and my right arm then seemed to \"jump\" of its own will, a completely uncontollable movement.  this startled me so much that i immediately looked down at my arm, breaking my view of the object up in the sky.  when i looked back up into the sky to find it again, i was suprised to see that it appeared to have moved several hundred yards north of its previous position in a matter of seconds.  a few moments later a very loud noise echoed throughout the courtyard, heard by both michael and myself.  the sound was very unusual, sounding like an incredibly loud meow of a housecat, but slightly more mechanical.  i quickly scanned the courtyard, almost certain something was about to attack me from somewhere around a corner (i have become quite paranoid at times due to the half-remembered events of my childhood experiences.)  when i looked back into the sky for the last time to try and locate the object again, it was nowhere to be seen.  i am fairly certain that both my arm jumping and the mechanical cat noise were both distraction techniques used by whatever it was that i saw, so that i was unable to witness its more intense movement capabilities.  i am also fairly certain that the object was not present for me, but rather for someone else on the other side of the border.  \r\n\r\nafter it had disappeared, i questioned michael as to what he thought it was, and he seemed almost as if he wanted to avoid talking about it entirely.  i have yet to see another object since that evening, although i have been experiencing flashback memories more and more frequently since then, and am having dreams about ets and ufos on an almost nightly basis.  lately after having these dreams i have been waking up with intense headaches, sometimes persisting all day.  i have been looking for answers to these questions for a number of years now, and i feel like i am getting closer to the truth than i have ever come before.
