(quite a silly thought now that i am older). we were trying to put out our fire as it approached we realized this was no plane it was black as night, triangle shaped, with three lights underneath one in each corner they were like spot lights very bright bluish white light, and one white light right in the middle. there was no sound coming from this object. and it was moving very slowly between 10 and 15 mph . my friend and i ran up under the tree on the hill. this thing was about half the size of a football field. the leaves on the trees were moving a lot but i can not remember if i could feel a wind or not. i could see the lights coming through the trees. the very next thing either of us remembered was running up the hill until we reached the fence, we were scared and nervous. we  watched this object flying of in a south east direction toward cedar rapids, and palo. we raced to his house and when we entered the clock  said 12:07 am. now mind you the place we were going to camp that night is only about  a five minute walk to the house and with in sight of the house. i can not say what happened  in the time between about 6:25 pm and 12:07 am. i  can go with out thinking of this all year but even now 28 years later this occupies my mind in the last week of july and the first week of august. and here it is i am writing this on july 29th . i have always been curious if anyone else had seen what we did. even living out in the country someone had to have seen this thing. a farmer in the fields or someone!!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":18383,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.1641667,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292009-0010","longitude":-92.0261111,"occurred":365217900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":365217900000,"summary":"It was black as night, triangle shaped, with three lights underneath one in each corner they were like spot lights very bright bluish white light, and one white light right in the middle. there was no sound coming from this object","tags":["sound","triangle","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Vinton, Iowa","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:205539"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Foley","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  a triangle shaped light in the sky appeared in front of the little dipper and moved west of that position and hoovered for about an hour. i went inside for a few minutes and returned to find it was gone.\r\n   on photos it was the only light appearing in the sky in the photo. as a photo appears to be multicolor light, but round and blurry.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18382,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.4094868,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292009-0009","longitude":-87.6758574,"occurred":1248676080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1248676080000,"summary":"Triangle shape light in the sky.","tags":["photo","triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Foley, Alabama","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:205540"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Benson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My wife and i were sitting in the backyard talking.I happened to look toward the north and noticed what appeared to be a very bright starlike object.I pointed it out to my wife.I happened to have my canon s5 camera with me and snapped a few shots of the object.Through the cameras viewfinder when zoomed in the object appeared to be a triangle shape with three points of light one in front and two in back.But the pictures show a totally differnt object.I will send the pics so you can analyze.You will have to zoom on them to see the object","distance":"501 Feet -

clock was all messed up. i was watching a movie and around 2 45 am i decided to head out onto my front porch and have a cigerette. i was walking up and down the path star gazing as i often do at night. i was about to say that suddenly i saw something but there was nothing sudden about anything that night. i looked across the street and in the distance beyond my neighbours house i saw and airplane. no big deal, they pass over frequently. i paid it no more heed.\r\n\r\nit was a nice pleasent night and decided to have another cigerette. as i lit it i noticed that the aircraft was still coming towards me. i realised that this was odd as it would mean the aircraft was traveling incredibly slowly. i began to study it and becam aware that it had three green lights. i double checked this as i knew that was not nomal aircraft configeration. i continued to watch this crafts progretion towards me and it took almost ten minites to reach me as it made it's slow progression.\r\n\r\nas it reached my neighbours house across the street i could make out more detail, or to be more specific, the lack of it. it seemed to be a great triangular, featureless slab drifting across the sky. it went on to pass over me and it was only then i realised that it was completly silent. not only that but everything had gone silent. the crickets had even stopped making a noise. i followed it to my my back yard and continued to watch as it headed away then in the distance it stoped and turned on a dime 45 degrees and headed out towards joliet. i continued to watch until it was obscured by trees.\r\n\r\nat this point i sat down lit another cigerette and methodically tried to rationalise what i had seen. it could not be some alien craft because that was all bunk. it must have been an aircraft, it simply could not be anything else. it took me an hour to convince myself and i finally went to bed. next day i had no recollection of the event.\r\n\r\nabout a year later i was watching a program on ufos when suddenly an artists impression of the same thing i saw. it was only then i recalled the incident. \r\n\r\ni am not a credible witness. i am the epitomy of the sci fi nerd. however i am a sceptic if there are two theories 1 earthly and 1 other worldly i would accept earthly more readily.\r\n\r\ni would very much like to hear from anyone else who saw this. the dates are very approximate...It could have been as early as june or as late as august.\r\n\r\ni finally decided to submit this to mufon because i do not beleive i was the only person to see this...Sure it was 3 am but it was there for so long and someone somewhere must have seen it too.\r\n\r\ni agree for my information to be passed onto third parties only for investigative purposes. not to comercial mailers

following took place in the city of stavanger, located on the southwestern tip of norway. time: april 19th 2009, at 12 o���clock, noon. the weather was warm with no cloud and no wind at all. i was at a friends house in hundvaag ne of the town centre, drinking coffee. from my spot on the sofa in her living room, looking out of the windows at the clear blue sky i noted that the contrails left by high flying aircraft didn���t move and were left hanging there, crisscrossing the sky and slowly spreading. i figured that the contrails would eventually turn this sunny day to an overcast one as they seemed to bloat over time in the perfectly still air and did not go away.\r\n\r\nthis was the reason that i had my attention at the sky in the first place.\r\n\r\nat this point i noticed a bright light moving fast towards us from the left. it looked just like the landing lights on an aircraft but without the aircraft. this soon separated into two light sources spaced close together and i could just make out that they were connected to a solid object. at this point i called out to my friend: what is that? what the heck is that?! and i got to my feet.\r\n\r\nwe both ran over to the windows to have a better look. at this point the object was rather close and it soon scooted in front of the windows and disappeared over the roof, out of sight and obviously moving so fast as there was no point in running through the house to have a final glimpse of it disappearing on the other side of the building. \r\n\r\nwe were both very shaky after this and we started right away to try to find a rational explanation. as of yet we are at a loss. the object looked like nothing i have seen before. it didn���t have wings or a tail (no control surfaces whatsoever). the closest thing i can compare it with is it had the general shape of a hat with a very tiny brim on it. the two lights were on the upper half of it (or at the very top) and they shone with a bright white light (just as normal landing lights would). the colour of the object itself was dirty gray or black. i could not detect any further details as it was moving so fast. i noticed that the sun reflected off the top of it. i estimate the size to be about 8-10 feet at its base and about 6-8 feet tall.\r\n\r\nit moved very steadily in a perfectly straight line with no wobble at all, in fact, it was almost as if it were moving on a pair of (invisible) rails. i estimate the speed at around that of the sound or slightly below (much like when fighter aircraft fly past the crowds in air shows, just under the speed of sound). there was no sound whatsoever (not even a swoosh), and the windows were open because it was a hot day. also i noticed that the leafs on a big tree in the garden did not move as the object streaked just a few feet above it. the windows should have rattled when an object of that size moved so close at such a speed and this fact puzzles me more than anything about this experience.\r\n\r\nmy friend saw it pass overhead, which i didn���t because of the angle in which it moved in relation to the windows and she said that it had a purple ���hazy��� colour on its ���back side���. \r\n\r\ni read the local newspaper thoroughly the next day but there was no mention of it. the course of the object was ne which would lead away from any built up areas.\r\n\r\nthis is the only experience of this kind any of us have had.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

altitude of 30-40k feet out the east window of our home.  i say \"official\", because i had never been inclined to report anything until my 2-16-9 sighting, though i had seen other strange lights over the years.  ironically, this object was seen over the same tree located two houses to the south where i would see another much closer object on 7-2-9.\r\n\r\nas the jet was flying w to e at cruising altitude with full contrail, i perceived another silver-metallic looking object come out from behind some high clouds in the same area of the sky.  i have pictures of these clouds since i had asked my girlfriend to take some shots of the beautiful patterns about 20 minutes earlier.  for some odd reason, i felt drawn to this area of the sky and had been looking around with binoculars for a few minutes.  the ufo literally appeared to drop from behind the more solid looking clouds in 9092 and then make a right angle motion to the east.  unlike the jet, it had no contrail whatsoever, yet it was obviously in motion and appeared to be at about the same height.  i screamed downstairs for her to bring the camera upstairs as i was actually viewing a ufo!  she got off the phone, tripped up the stairs and got me the camera.  \r\n\r\nthe ufo then stayed motionless high above the tree in 9092 for approx 4-5 seconds, then simply vanished.  i attempted to take photos, but the distance was much too far for my camera to resolve.  i shot pics 9096 and 9097 at this time.  i did see the ufo through binoculars.  but it was still too far away to get a real solid idea of the shape.  the best i can state is oval/disc shaped with no fixed wings of any sort.  a much better sighting was to come........\r\n\r\nplease email me with any other questions: [cms/tg/pid]","distance":"Over One

believe. watched it go by from w to sse (i believe). near the end of its visible path i started unloading camp gear from my pickup truck. my 8 year old son said \"hey dad there is something flying by (or following...Dont recall exactly) the space station\". i doubted his observation but looked about 15 seconds later and yep he was right. it wasn't following it when i seen it but it was headed almost due east (about two inches away at arms length when i fist saw it). perhaps they nearly intersected when he seen it so it looked to be right by it. \r\n\r\ni know airplanes well and consider myself an excellent spotter and i was saying at the time that it sure doesn't look like an aircraft. if it was it had to be at nearly 20-30k feet up and several miles south of us with its light on. actaully it was lit up like a  dim star then after a second or two would fade out slowly over a one or two second timespan then go all the way out, then fade back in. it consistently did this. it did not appear to be a typical nav light or comparable. i considered it maybe a satellite rotating on its own axis and reflecting the sun at each revolution maybe? after a minute of so it went behind some trees.\r\n\r\na minute or two later at maybe 9:37ish i happened to look up as i climbed my pickup bed to get more gear. somehow i noticed another moving star type object. i couldn't believe it. i called my son over and he too saw it. it was just like a dim star moving n to s. same iss speed and constant light not fading in/out like ojbect #1. watched it for about 2 minutes and it too went behind some trees.  again i doubted it was an aircraft and thought it really looked like a satellite.\r\n\r\nmy son and i have seen the iss and/or shuttle a good 20 times or more and watch it every chance we get. we have it down to the science half the time and can step out the door and see it immediately. we never seen another satellite that we know of so its odd to see maybe 2 the same time an iss sighting is going on. \r\n\r\noh yes...One last thing which is very interesting. i overheard a guy at work saying his wife and kids saw a light trailing nearby the iss and then it moved off away from the iss. this tells me it was not an aircraft. they live about 60 miles nnw from me which would make an aircraft (if thats what it was) look way off to their se i would imagine while the iss would still appear in the same location. so object #1 was not an aircraft. ojbect #2 was not noticed by them.\r\n\r\nperhaps this was (one or both) a satellite but i cannot find anything on the internet to go back a few days and see the path/times.\r\n\r\nplease please please let me know if there are others that saw this!\r\n\r\nthank you

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"7/21/2009, 10:40pm, happy valley, oregon. a cloudless night.  a clear view of a strange, fast-moving, round luminous, object. \r\n\r\nthis was the second sighting for me in three days, both from my home, both of more than a minute long, and this one has two witnesses.  two nights earlier i had seen from my north-facing deck, at close range and nearly directly overhead, a silent, wingless, flamy yellow-white flying object.  i reported that to mufon and informed my wife who was not sure what to think of it - there were strange aspects which make that observation hard to relate to everyday experience.\r\n\r\nmy wife was in a room adjacent to our deck in the late evening of the 21st.   i was outside, as i often am when the sky is clear and it is not too cold, to look at the stars with my binoculars. i honestly was looking for another unidentified object as the portland area was lately an area with many odd sightings, including mine.  because of a possible psychic aspect of that earlier sighting, i thought i would try thinking on purpose that i wanted those same operators to fly by again - i wanted my wife could see the strange flying thing for herself.  so i concentrated on that for about a minute.  this is true.\r\n\r\nin about 20 minutes a tiny bright light, slightly yellow, appeared in the southwest at about 30 degrees off the horizon, perhaps as much as two miles away.  as it approached in level flight, i estimated the height at about 2000ft. it had the brilliance of a single landing light of a commercial aircraft, seen straight on about a mile away.  i assumed it a plane heading for pdx.  with my binoculars i watched the light approach and in a few moments noted that i could not see any running lights, no wings, no stabilizers, no outline of a body, and that it was obviously round.\r\n\r\ni went inside and brought my wife out to look; this took perhaps 15 seconds.  at this point it was about 45 degrees above the southeastern horizon, about mile away, and for 10 seconds or more she viewed the object, first at an angle and then nearly perpendicular as it began its pass directly to our south.   she handed the binoculars to me.  i watched it for about 10 seconds during which it passed directly perpendicular to my vision, handed the binoculars back and she watched for another 5 seconds before handing them back to me.  i had a clear last look with the binoculars for about 3 or 4 seconds.\r\n\r\ni had the feeling that the object was in some sort of purposeful travel, as if its operators were attending to serious business.  both of us were left with an uneasy feeling about what we saw.\r\n\r\nas it neared we both saw that it was a bright cold-white light in the shape of a globe, perfectly round.  it had a smooth surface with a soft incandescent \"reading light bulb\" quality to it.  the intensity was that of a car headlight at roughly 150ft, or a powerful hand lantern at half that distance.  anyone who happened to be looking would have seen this thing; it was down low, bright, cooking along pretty well, and exceedingly strange.\r\n\r\nthe size was that that of a green pea held at arm's length - or in other words the diameter of a pencil looked at straight on at arm's length. with this apparent size at the viewing range, i estimate the diameter of the light was roughly 15ft.\r\n\r\nit flew west directly over the top mt. talbert, 3000 feet away to our south, and it was flying level at about 2000ft up. it was traveling somewhat faster than freeway speed, perhaps up to 75mph.  traffic on sunnyside road almost directly below it, travels at around 50mph and this object was going faster than that.  \r\n\r\nas it passed directly perpendicular to me, through the binoculars i clearly saw, for about 5 seconds, a surrounding \"globe\" of something like light dust or fog.  as if the bright light was centered inside a perfect ball of very faint cold-white fog.  this \"halo\" was two or three diameters of the bright center object.  when the object and halo moved out of the general perpendicular angle, this halo was no longer apparent.  my wife did not see it from her viewing angles.  afterwards i checked my binoculars against other point light sources and did not see any such halos or light scattering. with the apparent size and viewing distance, and comparing the size of the halo against the distances between fir trees at the summit, i estimate the diameter of the halo was 30ft to 50ft.\r\n\r\nright at the end of the sighting, with the binoculars i followed the object as it flew in level flight to the east.  at perhaps a half mile from mt talbert the object suddenly turned into an orange globe. and then probably 1 second later it instantly popped off leaving the image of an orange horizontal rectangular bar that itself faded out in perhaps 2 seconds - the bar did not appear to fall or rise, it just hung there and faded away.  no horizontal light was apparent in that area of the sky after that orange bar faded out. the horizontal length of the bar seemed to be the same as diameter of the globe.  the thickness was maybe one-third the length.  it was as if a huge suspended light filament inside a massive incandescent bulb had rapidly cooled off after the power had been cut. \r\n\r\nwe saw no engines or motors, no rotors, no wings, no wheels, no struts or stabilizers, no flashing lights, no projections or dangling things of any type, no flames or exhaust, no evidence of any propulsion source; just an evenly-illuminated unchanging light.  we did not hear any sounds from its direction.  it did not vary in horizontal/sideways position during the entire sighting.   no snaking in the air, no wiggles, no drifting, no spinning, no bumping along, no surface-like reflections, no balloon-like undulation. \r\n\r\nthis could well be my imagination, but at the instant this thing popped off and went into an orange bar, at that same instant i would swear that i felt a slight shock wave, sharp.  given the distance it makes no sense.  but there was an instantaneous feeling, sort of like with a fireworks launcher but without the sound, and the pressure wave at a higher frequency and going much faster.  in response i let out a \"hoh\" and not just because the sight was incredible. but then again, imagination is a powerful thing, so who knows.        \r\n\r\ntwo things that might be noteworthy.  this object apparently flew nearly over two possibly sensitive sites, certainly at an observational altitude.  on the south side of mt. talbert is located camp wythicomb, an active guard base - the object would have been the same distance from the base at it was from us.  second, the light first appeared to me at a position over the general area of the precision castparts company.  the company is a prime employer here; they manufacture very high quality aerospace parts, they make and use advanced alloys, and boeing is understood to be a major client. boeing is the dod's major supplier of flying craft and related national security technology.\r\n\r\nnow, if this thing was nothing more than an rc flyer made up to look like a ufo, any of the makers reading this are laughing now; i was tricked good as were probably quite a few others who saw it but are too shame-avoidant to report what they know.  but if it was a hoax, it was too good to be true - big, very fast, highly controlled, bright as heck: lots of technology and expense in that.  my wife and i have no idea what that thing might have been.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

\"star daddy\" as my back was toward it.It was pretty high in the eastern sky,almost directly above us. i thought it was too bright out to be a star, but i convinced myself it had to be a star. i am certainly not an expert on the heavens,what do i know,so a star it must be. i sat my son on my lap and we looked up at it and i did the \"star light,star bright\" rhyme with him and we made a wish. i kept glancing up at it and it just didn't seem right. so i went in and got binoculars. what i saw was a strange backward c shape, but i am still putting that off as a misfocus of the binoculars. at this point i was still going with the 1st star of the evening. it was unmistakably the brightest thing in that part of the sky and no other stars were visible. so i would glance up a few times while i was playing with my son. then the star grew dimmer, so i grabbed the binoculars and looked again. this time there were 3 more dimmer dots along with a still brighter star/dot that was now 50% dimmer than before. these 4 lighted points made an elongated diamond shape. i never saw where they came from or when they showed up. at this moment i am still trying to convincing myself that this was just a star pattern showing up as the sun was going down. but it was still so bright in the light blue early evening sky,and there were still no other stars to be found at that time. but i continued to rationalize it off as stars. i didn't want to jump to any conclusions. i had no reason to at this point, but now i was going to watch more intently. as i watched through binoculars, the dots/points began moving and formed into the four points of a square. once i saw the movement,i immediately put the binoculars down and called over my neighbor who was outside doing yard work. i wanted a witness! in a matter of that second of putting the binoculars down, and calling out to my neighbor,then raising the binoculars back up again, it was gone! the same point of light that was so bright that my 2 year old originally brought to my intention, \r\nwas gone! the brightest point/s of light in the sky just completely vanished. no clouds in that part of the sky, just gone. what i saw, who knows, i'm

at first but as i observed more it seemed there were two or three of them and they were interacting with each other and sometimes even lit up the ground like daylight. i became scared and pulled over to a friends to get off the road for a while. after an hour i returned to my car again the flashing lights,white, were in the sky but i continued my drive to desoto. i became lost twice, very unusual for me and frustrated me  a great deal. once i was turned around i drove upon a german shepard just sleeping in the road and i thought how strange as no one in the area owns one and to the right of my car i saw a huge ufo ,disc with one on top of the other ,blue and red lights and my car began to die. i panicked and tried to call 911 on my blackberry but it locked up completely and i could not reach anyone. i remember looking in the rear view and the dog just woke up and walked off the road. i  was 4 days later coming home and along the way on 61 again a huge light came upon my car very fast and i was followed by a disc with green and yellow lights for a few minutes and then it flew off.  truly terrified and car has had electrical trouble since. i do have some footage on my blackberry.

military planes along the northern mountain ranges i thought that was odd because the jets from the base only usually train in pairs. i then noticed a very large very bright orb traveling from the north west to the south east. the object seemed unstable traveling at such slow speeds and seemed to wobble as it traveled at about 150 to 200 mph judging on the base that i estimate it was at about 8000ft in the air and looked to be as big or bigger than the new raptor jets that were flying. as the object was overhead it was its brightest. after it was about 2 miles to the southeast another jet came loud and very fast from the west. the other planes seemded to be just trailing it not getting very close. as the latter plane approached the boject seemed to travel faster and them dissapeared into nothing. the light faded to black and the planes contimued on their route as if still following the object. is it weird to dream of things like this before they

one thing was clear: the light was too large to be a plane.  \r\n\r\ni couldn���t keep my eyes off the light, as it was so bright it could be seen through patches of trees.  the light was round and had a yellowish tint to it.  i continued to track the light until i lost sight of it, almost as if it had left my horizon.  the experience lasted about a minute or so.\r\n\r\nbriefly after, i tried to call my father.  when i connected to his phone, i heard muffled background noise.  i listened as long as i could bear before i was too freaked out to continue.  i called my father again, and when i connected, he claimed that i had not gone through to his phone.  i���m not sure if there was some type of electrical interference, but i have never had any type of call quite like that.\r\n\r\nmy
