(as if it did not want to be seen going up and going down..)he noticed that it would pulsate (at times slowly and other times a little quicker). one thing he did notice (or remember) was that even though the light was very bright, it did not illuminate its surroundings..At all. he finally lost the object while, he believes, it was still at the bottom of the hill.\r\nthe next day i asked him to go down there and take a look (i was and still am in california) and he did sometime in the early evening. he took our dog rex with him and as he was nearing the site, he heard footsteps ahead of him. he and rex stopped and looked towards the area of the sighting and noticed 7 or 8 men looking around. he said they were all dressed in black and were wearing gloves because he could not see their hands. they all had short black or dark hair (it was already getting dark). these men seemed to be huddled around the area where the ball of light was the night before. rex also stopped in his tracks and did not want to go further. my son then decided (wisely) to go back to the house and as he reached the top, he noticed the men climbing the opposite hill and then a black suv (he says it was an excursion, from ford) with dark tinted windows, came from the top of the street and all the men got in and left. \r\nno other incidents since then. please feel free to call us or email me if you have any questions. we can show the area to you also if you have someone in the area. very strange and exciting.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":18351,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.4732132,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07272009-0015","longitude":-110.9694553,"occurred":1248325200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1248325200000,"summary":"Greenish ball of light behind house stationary and moving up and then back down to almost ground level","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Rio Rico Southeast, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:206237"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Fawnskin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on vacation at big bear lake.  i took one family member and my two dogs to hang out at the lake... watch the starts.  currently i have been very interested in ufo's and alien activity.  i wanted to find a ufo.  we saw quite a few things.  almost everything we saw i considered to be some kind of satilite.  some were very bright.  one that would change color... i felt that was simply a satilite being seen through bad air.  \r\none we found interesting.  at first we thought it was simply a satilite.  it did hold a consatant course and eventuly disapeared behind the mountain... but the interesting part was that it would start as a dim light... start to slowly get brighter.  then suddenly burts of light then back to a dim color.  i knew that i was not just seeing it because my family member and i said \"wow\" at the same second.  we counted about 30 seconds between bursts.\r\nthe event was behind where we were sitting... we had to stand to see it.  my family member did see it first.  but the first burst that was witnessed we did see at the same time.  there was no chance of it being a reflection from the lake as it was far behind the lake... the stars were clear... very little cloud cover (despite the heavy and breif storm in the afternoon that day).

looking for satellites. prior to the time of ufo sighting i had sighted about six satellites and multiple high altitude aircraft. i had been laying on the ground for about one half hour in a way that no ground based lights were visible. my body was positioned in a north to south direction.  (location coordinates  41���37'45.18\"n  120���12'50.27\"w). around 2330 i noticed a bright white light traveling west to east from a point starting on a line about one half of the distance between my north horizon and the north star. the light felt like it was shining from a beginning distance of 15 to 20 miles to the north of my position which would be in the neighbor hood of mount bidwell (coordinates: 41���57'57\"n  120���9'56\"w). the light reminded me of a brightness of an aircraft landing light except that it felt like it was too far away and was traveling at an angle away from my point of view.  no navigation lights were visible at any time around the light.  the light did not appear to be directional like a landing light. the path of the diminishing size indicated possible travel away in an east north easterly direction, with the light fading and extinguishing from view prior to my north east horizon.  transit time was in the range of one minute.\r\n\r\nthis path would be consistent with possible travel for a military night training flight from kingsley field in klamath falls, or (lmt), to the hart south moa. however, the transit time across the horizon and perceived distance appeared much too fast for a jet not in afterburner and under the speed of sound. the night was still and no sound was apparent. my position was slightly east of airway v 165 and high altitude aircraft are regularly visible transiting north to south both west and far to the east of my position.  i have never seen a light maneuver like this one, nor have i ever noticed any other flying object that i did not feel could be reasonably explained. \r\n\r\nthis location is in a sparsely populated region of california.  documented cattle mutilations have occurred in the past on local ranches. i am a former navy and commercial pilot flying such aircraft such the c-130 in the atlantic and pacific regions so am familiar with aircraft and landing

the mountain community, julian, ca up hwy 78. it was a clear spring afternoon with no detectable air movement. we had passed rt.3 and then rt.2 and were climbing the narrow winding rd. approaching the julian area when one of the rear passengers got excited and had me pull to the side just as i approached an observation pullout. he pointed across to the other side of the sloped arroyo, covered with thick green 4-5 ft. high chapparal brush about 100 ft above the base of the mountain. it had no road nor pathway on that side and was less than 200 feet across from us.\r\nwhat we saw was a small chrome-like sphere, perfectly round with no observable markings approaching us . at first, due to the distance and speed, i thought it was a motorcyle rider's helmet reflecting the sun, but as it got closer there was nothing beneath it and was too big, perhaps 2 feet in diameter. it moved at a perfect steady speed and height just inches above the brush. it was too steady and fast to be a balloon and there wasn't even a slight breeze. nothing was attached to it.\r\nwe watched it pass and go in the direction we came, but on the other side of the pass. we watched it rise and fall with the terrain in a perfect horizontal path until it rounded the mountain about a mile behide us and dissappeared as it rounded the bend. it never waivered, other than to clear and follow the mountainside, in a straight path to some unknown destination.\r\nwhen it was over we all confirmed that what we saw and did was the same thing. we all described it exactly the same except for it's perceived size, which varied from 1 1/2 ft to 3 ft across. none of us could explain how it could have possibly manuvered the way it did. none of us had ever seen anything like it before. we all agreed that it was a ufo, but not anything like what we expected one to look like.\r\nsince then i have heard of similar sightings and decided to add my confirmation that these things do (or did) exist. four of us witnessed one.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

close range. i was at a party at a bay front house over looking jones beach and at around 4pm i was talking to a gentleman who is a commercial airline pilot.We were talking about cars. all of a sudden his wife says , hey bob check out that thing in the sky. we both looked. it was a brite red orange light off in the distance heading south.She chuckled and said it looks like a ufo. from where we were sitting we could see a commuter airliner on approach to kennedy airport.The light and the 4 engine jet seemed to be the same distance away.They also seemed to be at the same elevation.The light was as big as the jet from my vantage point.I thought it was strange and when i asked bob what he thought, he said he thinks he sees a flashing strobe.I thought humm, and we went back to talking cars.\r\n       at around 10:30 pm i was still at the party and all of a sudden i hear the children on the dock say, what the heck is that ? i looked up and there it was, a huge red orange egg shaped craft comming over the house.It headed due south out to the ocean.There was a cloud out in the distance and it seemed to dissappear into the cloud.A few seconds into this, another one comes from the western side of the house.It went in the same direction.A few seconds later a 3rd one comes over the house and heads out over the ocean just like the other 2. while the 3rd one was heading out i notice to the east that a commuter jet was traveling north west comming from over the ocean and i said to my girlfriend that gauging the jet i thought the ufos were as big if not bigger then the jet. they were moving about as fast as the jets look on approach.I was told that the jets come in at about 4000 feet.There was no way those pilots didnt see these craft. at that elevation these craft were huge.I also should mention that they made no sound.I am sorry that we did not take a picture or have a video camera because i believe this would have been the greatest ufo video ever shot.Some of my friends saw this from 15 miles west of where i was.Another friend was about 7 miles west of me and saw them with her kids.This was an awsome sight. all i can think is that everything i read about ufos came true at that moment.Its a little scary. i even spoke to stanton friedman after taking his phone # out of his book flying saucers and science. he was generous with his time and seemed interested in the

i was completely focused on going home and kept repeating \"it's time to go home now\" as i drove home to my apartment building.\r\n\r\nevery time that night, when i started to think about what i had seen, my mind would switch away to something else. i was very uncomfortable whenever i tried to remember what had happened. then, about a year later, in the summer, when there were a number of television shows about ufos, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the crash at roswell, i saw one very short clip of exactly the same object that i had seen. in the clip, it looked exactly the same, including the same size, and was slowly moving above some trees and across the screen. i was very excited because, in all of the tv ufo programs i had seen, this was the first -- and only -- time i had seen anything that looked like \"my\" ufo. that was also the first time in months that i had allowed myself to remember the sighting. prior to that, something had always kept me from thinking about it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":18332,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.5130103,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07262009-0024","longitude":-90.5139442,"occurred":817718400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":817718400000,"summary":"Driving home from work, i saw a small ufo hovering above a very large sign, beside john deere road, east.

very next day i did call the military police at white sands, they stated that a small missile was launched at about the same time or at 1:30 a.M. however it was directly east of my location & it was not any kind of near obital missile launch!!! my main ??? is i do not know if the main shuttle tank stays in orbit for any length of time & if any other nations have anything that large??? this siteing was around 2 years before the large delta  triangle craft was seen but at the very same location & address... can you please contact me with any possible  explanation for these siteing's??? the las cruces sun news is a very very hippy pot-loving college student liberal news paper that is almost totalee worthless when it comes to any kind news reporting!!!! p.S. little kid's & children could run the las cruces sun news much much much much better than they do... also way back in the 1970's my father and i had a siteing that was so  bright of a fire ball that at about 9:30 at night & for about 15 to 20 seconds this fireball lite the whole area at 1430 grover drive also in las cruces as bright as the mid-day sun!!!! but without any explosion sound. white sands missile range did have anti-missile missiles with nuclear tipped warheads but no info or data of such a outer space detonation was ever made known to the public!!!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18327,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.3234396,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07262009-0019","longitude":-106.7580538,"occurred":1070185020000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

the ufo appeared. i was staring off into the horizon, facing nw, just staring at the lake and stars. all of a sudden, (and i mean out of nowhere) there suddenly appeared a very bright red light. i shouted, \"what is that?\" my brother and friend turned and saw the bright red light, we briefly inquired amongst ourselves whether or not it was a flare. james, my brother, grabbed a pair of (8x42)bushnell excursions binoculars, (we keep a pair on the deck to bird watch etc.)he quickly got them focused. my friend and i sat amazed, commenting that there was no sound at all, we also agreed it increased in brightness. james was quickly able to determine that the bright red light (spherical or circular, as viewed from the deck) when focused in the binoculars was definitely an object with lights, he explained a red one and a smaller purple-ish/white. all the while we are quickly analyzing possible explanations in our heads. he hands the binoculars to me and i get the object focused and clearly there was a definitive object, with lights helping to define its features. the lights appeared as a bright red and in my opinion a smaller white/yellow one, possibly two, i yelled to him to grab the camera and in that instant it blinked out, it \"turned-off.\" it was there and then gone. before we got overly excited the natural skeptic voice in our heads was calling out. we all three agreed that there was no way that it was a helicopter of any kind. this is based on the fact that we have lived in this location all of our lives and have seen \"star - flight\" and other helicopters at all hours at any angle etc. and there is always a sound, this made no sound. the flare idea was shot down as well, after we focused the object it clearly was not a flare, the only reason a flare was thought of was to perhaps explain its sudden appearance. it also did not pulsate or blink out like a flare, nor did it drop in elevation as a flare would. after what appeared to be stillness and no motion of the object and/or it's flight path, it's course seemed to be heading, albeit very slowly, in our general direction (roughly se as it was coming in from the nw), and once again it was lower on the horizon and in the sky than anything conventional. i am very familiar with planes appearing on the horizon and coming closer and closer and closer until it passes over. this was not the case it was to low on the horizon to be a plane, at least compared to any plane we have seen from this deck, also there was no sound. it was not some private plane; it (the light) appeared, continued to increase in brightness, then seemed to fly towards our direction, very slowly and with no sound (so it appeared), and then blinked out, to be clear -- it did not fade out, or slowly dim, it specifically \"turned off.\" i consider myself to be somewhat (as well as my brother)an ametuar skywatcher; we have a celeston nexstar 130 slt and love gazing at the stars. our feelings were of amazement, nervousness, shock, realization, etc. we realized we saw an unidentified object in the sky, one that appeared to be cruising at a very low altitude and speed, with no sound. all of us are familiar with ufology especially what has recently been going on in texas. i am no expert, but if i were to classify this particular type of object, i (and my brother) agree it was somewhat triangular in shape and appeared to be bigger than a helicopter or small plane, but was not bigger than a commercial aircraft. basically the view through the binoculars was filled up with the object, the object and its lights seemed to fit fully within the viewing context (lens of the 8x42 bushnell excursion). as to its location, it was higher than the horizon on the other side of the lake by a few inches, that is to say if you are looking out at the horizon the object was roughly 1-3 inches higher than the green hills on the other side of the lake. we could also clearly tell it was not past the horizon, it appeared to be between us and the other side of the lake, our general consensus was that it was over the lake at the time of our viewing window.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

back of a truck. we were going to the movies and were going to the late show. i pointed it out to my companions and said, \"what is that?\" and they noticed it too. we pulled up to the stop sign and watched it. it was still there as we went another 2 blocks south and then pulled over and watched it. we stopped at the corner of 27th terrace and alabama street. once we got out of the truck it seemed to move faster away from us, we were trying to discuss what it could be. it was too slow and had a constant orange glow to be a plane or a helocopter and did not exhibit any flashing or pulsating lights. it was very slow and seemed to be flying in a curve upwards and right. as we watched it, it dimmed so that it almost disappeared and then came back for a few moments and then faded again and was completely gone. the whole thing lasted for about 5 minutes.\r\nthere were no clouds in the sky and you clearly see stars. we then drove to louisiana street cutting across westward on 27th terrace and continued south on louisiana. we were still hoping to see it in the sky somewhere because we couldn't believe that it had disappeared. we drove all the way to n 1250 rd, where there are less lights and traffic, and continued to look for it in the sky but there was no movement anywhere. if it was a plane or helocopter, we should have still been able to see it from where we

- one of the many parks in the heart of downtown toronto.  it was a clear day with no clouds in the sky and i was laying on my back reading a book. \r\n\r\na sudden feeling of peace came over me and i put my book down so i could bask in the feeling more fully. i was looking into the sky when i saw what i thought was a seagull (there were many gulls flying about that day). i thought it strange that a bird fly so high it would appear as a sphere. i then noticed it was not alone. there was an identical sphere traveling next to it. \r\n\r\nthe two objects smoothly glided across the clear sky far above the city. they kept the exact same distance from one another (you could probably fit five of the same sized spheres between the two), almost as if there were an invisible rod separating them. as they glided in what seemed a perfect line, i could see that they were perfect orbs with reflective surfaces. \r\n\r\nit was strange because i wasn't excited in the least, in fact i was very calm.  i had seen objects in the sky as a child but i never trusted the memories because i was so young and i had not experienced anything like it in my adulthood. i mention this only because i found my mood and reaction to be surprisingly uncommon.  \r\n\r\ni got my boyfriend's attention and pointed the objects out to him. he too was strangely calm throughout the sighting. we watched in contentment as they smoothly crossed the open sky, following them with pointed fingers so that anyone else interested in the park could see them too. \r\n\r\njust before they were out of sight behind a high rise building, a third shining sphere rapidly flew across the sky with unimaginable speed and stopped abruptly without slowing when it met the other two spheres.  keeping the same distance from its partners as the two original spheres had, the now three spheres (all the same size, same reflective anteriors and same distance from one another) glided together out of sight, forming a seemingly perfect triangular formation. \r\n\r\ni now look for similar things in the sky whenever there is a clear day (there haven't been many, we've had an uncommonly rainy summer this year) but i haven't seen anything in the daytime like this.  only once more on july 9th, approximately 12:30am. my boyfriend and i were out on a late night walk because we could actually see some stars in the night sky (a very rare occurrence in downtown toronto).\r\n\r\nwe went to a park that had low light pollution and we were able to see many stars. that is when we saw what looked like stars (they shined the same) moving across the night sky. they all glided quickly and smoothly in perfect lines across the night sky until they were out of sight. \r\n\r\nthey did not leave behind tails of light like comets do and they moved way too quickly to be airplanes or satellites.  my assumption is that the objects were out of our atmosphere and they were reflecting sunlight causing them to glow in the night sky as they flew by. \r\n\r\nwe saw four at different times within a twenty minute time frame. the third we saw didn't just fly out of sight. it moved smoothly across the sky then flashed, as if there was a big explosion then it was just gone.\r\nneither my boyfriend or i had the same calm feelings we had when we saw the three orbs in the daytime.  we were just excited and skeptical, not really placing too much in the possibility these objects were like the spheres.
