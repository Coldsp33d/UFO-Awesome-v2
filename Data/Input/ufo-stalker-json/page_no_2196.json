unidentified flying object. i was looking at the stars, identifying constellations, when i turned to look at the sky in the southeast, over the top of a building i saw a flying object enter my field of vision. the ufo flew seemingly in complete, eerie silence, at a low altitude probably around a few hundred feet and looked to be around slightly less than half the altitude i normally see planes at. it moved at an unusually slow, constant velocity which is difficult to estimate but safe to say that it was definitely the slowest air craft i have ever observed, maybe around the speed of the average bird. the object was dark with three large bright white lights in a triangular configuration on its underside, one toward the front, two in the back. it was somewhat difficult to make out the exact shape due to its angle, the prominence of it���s lights, and the darkness of it's outline contrasting little with the night sky. however it appeared to be flat and triangular, with each white light close to a vertex. the size appeared to be around that of a large helicopter but wider. there was one faint, small flashing light towards the front on the right side of the object (the only side i could see) which seemed to emit multiple, alternating colors of which i remember green, white/yellow, and blue. the object flew over us westward toward the university campus and was visible for around one and a half, possibly two minutes. my friend who was about 30 feet in front of me and who witnessed it for around 30 seconds, saw the same object.","distance":"101-500

off and make a circular motion in the sky and then form back into one oval light. at the end of this mysterious event, there had then been two sets of four oval lights forming a single oval meaning four lights circulating in the sky and forming one oval light while another four lights would form one oval which were very close in distance together. at the end of the thirty minutes of this

the time) i saw a high altitude (approx. 30 k feet) unblinking white light moving from northwest to the south east (more towards the east). i thought this was strange since it did not blink and it was too early to see a satelite.  it flew in a straight line until it eventually was out of sight.  about 10 minutes later, i saw what appeared to be the same light coming back from the direction which the previous light disappeared (same altitude).  the light again was white and unblinking but now moving from the southeast to the northwest.  the light continued to fly to the north of my house and was fliying away from me to the northwest when it started growing brighter.  i suddenly felt very excited.  for about 5-10 seconds it grew bigger and brighter until it suddenly had a bright blue/white flash.  after the blue/white flash it quickly dimmed and disappeared.  even though the object was very high, this bright flash was quite large and bright (about the size of a nickel held at arms length).  since the object was moving away from me i knew it could not be the headlights of an aircraft.  it almost appeared as though the light was a slow rotating light on the object or the object itself was rotating.  about 10 minutes later i then saw what i think was the same unblinking white light object fly at a high altitude back to the southeast again (this time nothing strange happened)...This is very strange because i usually do not see anything but satelites flying above my house and this was too bright to be a satelite.  then, about another 5 minutes later i saw what i think was the same high altitude white unblinking light fly over again.  i did not hear any noises coming from the light on any of these fly overs.  finally, about 15 minutes after my 4th sighting of this object, it flew by again only this time it was very low (approx. 3000-5000 feet) directly over my house.  the light was very white, very bright, and again no blinking and no noise.  i was extremely excited by this and fumbled around and took a picture of it with my phone (you can see the white light on the picture but it just looks like a very bright star on the picture).  if this would have been a helicopter or a plane i surely would have heard something.  this 5th and last sighting of this object lasted about 45 seconds as it slowly flew from the northwest to the sotheast.  i have no idea what this white light was...I really hope someone else saw this and will report it.

for a while looking up at the night sky  , i had to keep holding my hand up to block out some of the light from our back court lights , but in any case i���m looking up at the sky and deliberately waiting for the ufo���s to show up ���\r\n\r\n** i quite literally see ufo���s on an annual basis here in glasgow , always the same kind , small star like objects , flying at various speeds and directions , size and colour can vary , from being a small very dim stars to large bright golden orbs of light , in recent years though they have increased vastly in number and have also started to show up in formation , normally a v shape**\r\n\r\ni haven���t seen anything all year , and in the last week or so the weather as been rather bad , the night sky���s have nearly always been overcast , but tonight the sky is clear enough to get a good look at the stars .\r\n\r\nso anyway there i am standing there and waiting to see if the ufo will show up ���\r\n\r\ni don���t know if this has some significance or importance , but i can sort of feel that they will , its like there���s a sense of expectation in the air , so i continue to stand there and let my eye���s fully adjust to the night sky , i���ve been waiting for about 10 min , when suddenly i seen a very dim star move across the sky , directly above and in front of me , moving from west to east ���\r\n\r\ni fully admit i feel a sense of relief when i see it , the idea of it not showing up ���i don���t really know i think it would worry me be it would mean that something has changed ���\r\n\r\nin any case i decide to go inside and get my hat ( to help block out the light from the back court and save me from using my hand ) , i come back outside and wait for a further 5 or so minutes , but i don���t see anything , i figure what the hell���i go inside grab my coat , my office chair and a strong pair of binoculars .\r\n\r\ni settle down and wait ���\r\n\r\nafter about 5 min , i see a small star quickly fly ���from what i can see of the middle of the sky , south westerly , heading in the direction of the hill , a few minutes later an almost identical star does the exact same thing  ���i try to view them through the binoculars , but they���re moving far too quickly .\r\n\r\ni wait for a little while longer and decide to take my chair and binoculars inside , i go back outside to the back court and have a smoke ���\r\n\r\nwithin minutes , i see four stars flying in ���what i can only call a swirling v formation , and they head in the same direction as the previous two ���i had to laugh because it looked like one of the stars was playing catch up with the others , falling into formation and then lagging behind before trying to catch up again .\r\n\r\ni follow their path till they fly behind the rooftops out of sight ���curious as to where they���re all going , i wait a little longer , then see another star like object fly from the south into the north ���jokingly i say to myself ���ok next ��� and then another one shows up right on cue following a similar path as the previous one .( maybe it was the two that where heading south in the direction of the hill i don���t know but these ones looked a little brighter ) , i wait a little longer to see if any more show up and i see another flying from what i can tell quite high in the sky ..Moving in a sort of north-easterly direction ���\r\n\r\nat this i go back inside at around 1:30 am  , though i���m absolutely sure if i stayed out any longer i���d see more and i���m even toying with the idea of going back outside .\r\n\r\n\r\n now i don���t know what these are ..But they certainly don���t seem like any ufo i���ve ever hard anybody else describe , i���m trying desperately to find a way of describing how they move ���\r\n\r\nthey move in a very quick but very graceful fashion , almost like how an insect fly���s through the air , as for size , well as i���m sure you can guess , judging a small fast moving point of light in the sky is very difficult .\r\n\r\nheight���at my best guess , 20 /30 feet above the electricity pylons , maybe more , at times i get the impression that they aren���t very big  , maybe a few feet across at best the size of a small car seen at a distance .\r\n\r\ni know my eye���s aren���t playing tricks on me and i���m not mistakenly picking out insects that get caught reflecting light , best way i can describe is to say that they are balls of light , flying at a distance , but like i say it almost impossible for me to really judge their size and distance .\r\n\r\nso all in tonight in the space of half an hour ���maybe a little more , i���ve seen no less than 10 ufo���s , buzzing about the sky ���\r\n\r\n\r\n1 ) i live in a two story building , i live on the ground floor , we have a large back court area that faces a large wood directly north of my building , some open ground before you reach the trees , holds power pylons that branch off east and west and a power substation , i was standing in the back court with my dog , looking up at the night sky .\r\n\r\n2 ) to cut a long story short its something i���ve known about for a very long time , i���ve become very accustomed to seeing these ���what i can only describe as flying stars .\r\n\r\n3 ) well as i say , i���ve known about them for a great many years , i don���t know what they are , but over the years i���ve ruled out everything , they don���t fly like any conventional aircraft as they seem to move in an almost fluid and organic fashion , i know they are intelligent due to past experience , at one point one of them made a point of grabbing myself and two friends attention by flashing / blinking  at us , only until we where all giving it our full attention , did it make a point of flying away , at first slowly and then at impossible speeds .\r\n\r\n4 ) on this sighting they where all flying in different directions through the sky , the formation of four looked as though it was a swirling / rotating v formation ���with a single one , flying into , and then lagging out of the formation , i���ve noticed in recent years they have started to move in a very fluid like way , its hard to explain , but if they happen to be lower than normal ( normal being very high up ) , they almost wobble when they move ���the best way i can describe it is to say they fly much like a housefly or insect would  .\r\n\r\n5 ) well i have become very accustomed to them , i know this is gonna sound completely unbelievable , but if you���ve seen these things as much as i have , you become used to them , though i will say there was a sense of anticipation in the air , it was like i could feel that they where going to make an appearance .\r\n\r\n6 ) the simply fly out of sight , or so far away that i can no longer see them

humidity\r\n\r\nmy wife and i were sitting on our terrace overlooking the sea, enjoying the sunset, followed by the crescent moon setting in coral bay, on the western coast of cyprus.  in the darkened skies, as we looked out to sea, an unknown object flying in a north-south direction crossed the sky in front of us.  it was very, very bright. altitude was about 300 feet, speed about 200 mph or less.  the unknown object appeared like a fireball, extremely bright red-orange in colour, maintained the same altitude an speed as it passed to the south in the direction of paphos.  maintained a level flight all the time it was in sight.  slow & steady.\r\nno audible sound or visible shape other than a ball-like appearance. it was a spectacular sighting - very bright.  we knew immediately that it was a ufo.  there are often planes sighted in this area of the sky, as it is en route to nearby paphos international airport (pfo), but this was so different, this was easily ruled out as no plane on approach to landing ever looked like this!\r\n\r\nsighting corroborated by neighbours who telephoned shortly afterwards to ask if we had seen it.  shortly after the sighting, we noted the time and full details.\r\nno photos. number of witnesses known at time of this report:  6\r\n(i am a mufon member)\r\nbelow is article in cyprus mail today, 25 july 2009.  as a result of this newspaper

2009\r\ncopyright ��� cyprus mail 2009  \r\n\r\nfour residents spotted a strange light zipping across the coast off paphos on thursday night in the latest in a series of incidents of unidentified objects in our skies.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was clearly seen by john knowles, a research specialist with mutual ufo network, he told the cyprus mail the sighting took place near coral bay and is appealing for more witnesses.\r\n\r\nit was heading towards paphos just off the coast, slow moving and a very bright fireball, so there may very well have been other witnesses.���\r\n\r\n���we had been watching the crescent moon set in coral bay. in the darkened skies, as we looked out to sea, an unknown object flying in a north-south direction crossed the sky in front of us. altitude was about 300 feet, speed about 200 mph or less. \r\n\r\n���the object that appeared like a fireball, extremely bright red-orange in colour, it maintained the same altitude as it passed to the south in the direction of paphos.���\r\n\r\nknowles added the object, which he saw at around 20.55pm on thursday, finally vanished from the sky without trace.\r\n\r\nhis account was backed up by his next door neighbours, who also witnessed the bizarre sight and rushed to the phone to alert him.\r\n\r\nannie davidson of tala said: ���i was out walking my dog and i saw a brilliant ball of light travelling very slowly close to the coastline. it was clearly visible for a while and then disappeared. i have never seen anything like it before.��� \r\n\r\non monday, several sightings of five bright red lights hovering in the night sky near cape greco were observed. according to witness accounts, the lights moved creating several different shapes for around 8 minutes before disappearing. \r\n\r\nsome suggest that chinese lanterns could to be the most likely culprit, as they are often released into the skies at weddings and parties.\r\n\r\nrecently cyprus has been flooded with ufo reports from all parts of the island; last month a pilot approaching the illegal tymbou airport in the north reported being followed by what he described as a ���bright object which resembled a big man or a big garbage bag���.\r\n\r\nthe ufo followed the aircraft until it landed and then disappeared.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:12","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18295,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.8833333,"location":null,"logNumber":"CY-07252009-0010","longitude":32.3833333,"occurred":1248407700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Paphos","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1248407700000,"summary":"Fireball-type
