in penticton, i was on my balcony looking for signs of smoke clouds from the 4 fires we have burning aproximetly 60 miles north, north west of my location. after standing in the corner of my balcony stairing to the east i moved my eyes to the south and my eyes caught an object in the sky.\r\n\r\n     normally when i see somthing shiny in the sky i don't think anything of it, my city lies along one of the flight paths big planes use to fly in between calgary or toronto, or back to vancouver. but in this case my attention was instantly atracted to this object.\r\n\r\n    normally when i see a jet flying there is almost always a con trail behind it, this was not the case for this object. now i am aware that this has no significant meaning, however the object did not seem to have a typical flight path or even similar speed compared to that of a normal jet lyner flying over head. now the object at first glance was aproximetly 5-10 miles south, south west of my location at aproximetly     10 000ft, flying north, north east. \r\n\r\n   as i noticed the object, i was drawn to its shape, now when i see a jet i immeadietly notice the round shape to the fusilage of the plane, now with this object i could not determine wether the object was rounded or more boomerang shaped. \r\n\r\n   more to the point i noticed that there were no wings on the object. by the time i noticed it had no wings it was turning directly north, no longer heading in an easterly position, as if it was noticing someone noticing it. so its movement looked like what i would define as an s turn.\r\n\r\n   it was originally heading in an north easterly position when it then turned to a northenly position, proceeding north and almost flying directly over my position and then turning back to the north easterly position it had originally been heading on. its turn time lasted from start to finish no more then 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n   now this object made no sound, it had no defineable markings on it or \r\ntail which is visible on all jets when they are turning. the object had two white lights being emited from under the tip and the middle of the object. in comparison to the legnth & width to the object each light was no more then four feet wide, or five. if i had to estimate the legnth of the object it was in between 80 & 150ft in legnth & 50 to 80 feet wide.\r\n\r\n \r\n   now atfer the object began turning east following its original heading it dissapeared in behind the cloud cover. now from where the clouds were positioned the object should have emerged  on the other side of the cloud cover with in 5-10 seconds. but it never did and i never saw it again.\r\n\r\n    immeadietly after i saw the object i tried phoning the local air port and finding out if they saw the object or atleast picked it up on radar but i could not get in touch with anyone from the tower. so i wound up leaving a message on the transport canada 1-800 line with the time, location and question of wether or not there was any object or plane tracked in this location at that time. so right after that i thought of m.U.F.O.N. and new that i had to write down my sighting.  \r\n\r\n   i have seen multiple sightings in penticton, so mabey this is a good spot for sky hunting. so thanks for this opportunity once again. and lets hope that one day soon we are all able to confront the complicated truths that exsist, and that the great mystery and shroud will be unvailed for all to know, and even though some do not want us to know, yet, we will one day. \r\n","distance":"Over One

were not explainable in the past year in the springfield area. the funny part is i have always told my friend about it with him always responding with \"i would have to see it to believe it!\" none of them, however, was as close or vivid as this particular one. as soon as we walked outside i glanced up and noticed a light about as bright as the north star but it appeared to be moving. i showed my buddy and he instantly said he thought it was a plane. i laughed at him and pointed out how bright it was yet at this point it was almost directly under us. not to mention no strobe or pulsating lights. we watched it continue on over our heads until it was just past us and went from very bright to a very faint light and steadily decreased in brightness until it was completely gone. i waited about 20 seconds listening to hear something in case it was in fact a plane or helicopter. i have grown up around aircraft and consider myself fairly knowledgeable when it comes to flying objects and i know for a fact that this was flying low enough that even if it was a small cesna that we would have heard the engines eventually. long story short my buddy was pretty freaked out and called another

looking star. we had never seen this star before and were not sure what to think of it so we started watching it. as we watched it we noticed that it was moving sparatically so we called a friend on the other side of town and woke him up to verify that we werent hallucinating. he confirmed that he saw the same bright light in the sky that is normally not there. he got his video camera out and briefly filmed the object. the object had flashing lights on it and had blue and green lights flickering from it. it continued moving across the sky slowly but when it moved it would move like it was hovering with sparatic bursts back and forth and up and down. i continued watching the object untill 5:40 am hoping the sun would shed some light on the object. with the morning light the stars behind began to fade however the light that was coming from the object was still just as bright. above and to the south of it were two more faint blue and red flashing lights that were still shinning even when the little dipper faded. as well as one more set of blue and red flashing lights to the far north of the closest and brightest object. as the morning light got brighter you could vaguely make out a saucer shaped object with bright white lights on the top of saucer shape. i continued watching the object hoping it would be completely visible in the sun light. around 5 30 am i witnessed two more objects fly by way faster than the object in question. one looked to be a stealth bomber shape high in the air moving rapidly from the northwest to the south east. shortly after that another aircraft flying from west to east flew by and confirmed for me that this was not an airplane or helicopter of some sort. shortly after the two aircrafts flew bye the sun rose higher and the object shrunk. it stayed just as bright as it was when it was closer but just seemed to be rising further and further away. i guaged the rising of the object with a telephone wire behind my apartment it started from hovering around 5 inches below the wire {from my perspective} to being 10 inches above the wire within 10 minutes. as it got higher it shrunk but stayed just as bright. at that time i decided it was time to stop observing the event and went back inside. only time will tell if what i saw was a confirmed ufo. i still need to watch my friends video camera aswell as check the sky tonight in order see if the object is still there. the entire sighting lasted about 2 and half hours during that time the object had moved from the north east skies to the eastern skies by the time i was unable to clearly make it out.

i noticed there were some strange looking and very *fast* moving clouds in the sky. as i was looking at these unusual clouds, i noticed a cylinder shaped object in a clear part of the sky, almost directly above me and i was trying to figure out what it was. it was shining (apparently because of reflected sunlight) and it couldn't have been a helicopter because it was the wrong shape and it couldn't have been a plane because it wasn't moving nor did it have wings - it like was shiny log in the sky! \r\n\r\nthere was no sound except from the wind and an unusual amount of pigeons which at very regular intervals, were being scared by nothing i could see or hear. i have not seen pigeons act like that before (nor since) and no-one was around except me, who was perfectly still while looking at the object in the sky. so what was scaring the pigeons? \r\n\r\nit was surreal and within a few minutes a cloud went under the object, which made me realise that it was higher up than i thought and then i realise it was much larger than a plane! \r\n\r\nso i hurried home (about 20 yards away) and got my camera realising that that the cloud under the object would soon clear so i could take a picture of the object. so i went back to the same spot to take my picture and after a minute or two that part of the sky (and most of the sky) was clear - but the object had gone! \r\n\r\nthing is, it couldn't have been any type of balloon because: \r\n1) while i was looking at it, it didn't move. \r\n2) within the short time it took me to get my camera and return to the same spot it had gone! \r\n\r\nballoons do not move that fast - nor as far as i understand, do they keep still in very strong wind. can't have it both ways. \r\n\r\ni understand that there can be a different in air currents at different altitudes but i cannot understand how it could be stationary for the few minutes i was looking at it, yet a minute or two later, it had disappeared! \r\n\r\n\r\n(5) my own feelings towards the object is that it was not hostile but apparently the pigeons were scared by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

went outside and stood in his driveway, my friend facing towards the east, and i across from him leaning on the hood of my car facing west.  as we stood there my friend pointed over my right shoulder and asked \"what the hell is that\".  i turned and looked behind me.  i observed that across the street were several approx. 100 ft pine trees at about a hunderd yards east of where we were standing.  i observed that just below the highest tree branches was a bright yellow light shining through.  i could tell the light was a good distance away but it stayed stationary for a few minutes before appearing to drop in altitude and disappearing.  my friend said that from where he stood there had been three lights and had been in a triangle formation and had been moving strangly.  i told my friend not to get excited and that i had seen those kind of lights before, some months before, and that i thought it was just flares. \r\n we talked about what he had seen for awhile.  i first assumed that the lights had been miltary flares from the local military base, fort polk.  my friend brought to my attention that the base was to the north of where we were standing, and the training area was futher north and towards the west.  i laughed it off as a over active imagination.\r\n  it was at that time my friend pointed over my shoulder again and said \"there they are again\".  i looked over my shoulder again and saw just above the same pine trees as before three bright yellow lights in a triangle formation, the \"point\" facing up.  i moved into the yard, a couple of feet towards the north for a better view.  i observed that the lights seem to dip and bob, moving eraticaly.  i observed that the lights again appeared to be far to the east, over what i could only guess was pitkin la.  the lights slowly moved below the tree line again and blinked out.\r\n  my friend and i were both shocked and started trying to come up with an excuse.  we are both ex-military, air force and navy.  in my expeirence the flares used for illumination by the miltary are a brillant white, not a yellowish color, almost like a \"bug light\" you use on an outside light.  my friend agreed and told me that he had never seen flares act like that.  he also explained that it wasn't chaff from an aircraft because it was dropped alot at one time, not three.\r\n  as we stood there talking about what we thought it was another thirty minutes or so had passed.  again my friend pointed over my shoulder.  i turned again and saw the same lights over the tree line.  i observed that the lights were again in a triangle formation and seemed to \"dip and bob\" as they moved towards the tree line.  \r\n  about thirty minutes later my friends wife came out to see why we were standing in yard still.  we explained what we had seen to her and that we didn't think it was the military.  as she laughed it off and began to go inside, my friend yelled out \"look, there they are\".  again it was the same bright yellow lights, in a roughly triangle formation that \"dipped and bobbed\" as they moved slowly towards the tree line and out of sight.  this time i extended my arm, the thumb of my hand up, and fingers spread, pinkie finger even with the horizon.  i observed from where i stood the lights where just above my index finger.  that was my best way of calculating where in the sky the lights had been when they appeared. as best as i can remember the my friend and i had seen the lights on and off for approx. two hours. \r\n  on the fourth of july i stopped by my friends again.  i jokingly asked him if he had seen anymor ufo's.  my friend, who works at the airstrip on fort polk, said he had asked a person he knew at the tower the day after the incident if there had been anyone training in the area.  he was told there hadn't been any aircraft near that location that would have dropped flares, but he had heard that more had seen the lights than us.","distance":"Over One

northern turn-around of the trail and began heading back toward our car.  i glanced up as we were talking and saw five bright orange \"stars\" to the south-southeast at probably 30 degrees off the horizon, just above some orange streetlights (similar color).  there were clouds behind these \"stars.\"  at first i thought it was some strange reflection of the streetlights, but then i took a longer look and pointed these stars out to my friend.  she saw them clearly, as well.  neither of us could figure out what they were.  be began walking to the east so that the lights would no longer be just underneath the stars, and the stars didn't move.  we stood there watching them intently for a couple of minutes, at which point two of them began to fade.  after about one minute the two faded beyond my range of vision (they were \"gone\") and one by one the other three began to fade as well.  none of these objects appeared to be moving at any speed, although i did notice at least two of them move a small amount, slowly, in relation to the position of the others.\r\n\r\nthe formation of these five \"stars\" was like this:\r\n\r\n*\r\n     *\r\n          *

this, but they were hispanic and they didn't respond when i tried to get their attention, i'm guessing they didn't speak english very well.  we continued walking south toward the car, when we encountered other people, they were carrying on as if they had not noticed these lights.  we felt a little like our sanity would be questioned if we brought it up to others at this point -- you know how the stigma is.\r\n\r\nso at this point, we saw five bright-orange unidentified objects in the sky.  i'm not claiming they are aliens or anything like that, but we very clearly both saw the exact

night(longwood high school). we were sitting on the bleacher reminissing of our high school track career. the whole time i had been zoning off looking at the stars and airplanes and what not in the sky. suddenly me and my friend austin noticed a orange light kind of flying upwards over bnl.I started to joke with him that this strange orb was a ufo. the object looked like it was about a mile away when it stopped in its upward path and morphed from a bright orb into a very sharp triangular object. when it had shifted from an orb to a triangle it let off a strong flash. once done morphing it hovered in place for about a minute and then it headed flying over where me and my friend were. it passed directly over us! when it flew over i knew it wasnt any plane or helicopter or any thing i had ever seen in my life. it was trianlge shaped. it had larger triangle in the middle and 3 trianles on the outside. the lights were a dim yellow and never blinked. when i saw it i was amazed and a bit scarred, but more excited. the object flew out of sight over the horizon once it passed over us.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy personal opinion is it was some kind of military craft that was very silent and it might have been flown out of bnl. im not too convinced it was an alien craft becuase it didnt fly at incredible speed but it did hover for a while then it could change speeds very fast.","distance":"501

outside our camper when my mom pointed to the sky where there were several balls of fire heading west right over us. at first i had counted six but a few seconds later a few more appeared, there might have been around eight. at first i thought it was a bunch of balloons that were on fire or had candles hanging from them making them glow, a few looked like they had short tales of fire coming from either side. a friend and his family, about 100 feet south of us at another campsite, thought they were helicopters, but they made no sound. it had rained earlier so there were clouds, my mom was sure they were lower then the clouds. they all went in the same direction some seemed to move side to side while heading west it seemed as they were going higher, three started to fly in a triangle. as for my feelings, it mostly was of curiosity. we lost sight of the object after it had gone behind the trees. i do know there is a national guard base very close to there, but if these were aircraft below the clouds they would have made a sound. i regret very much not taking a picture, but i don't think my camera would have made a quality

\"dtw\" airport now it has moved to jackson airport area near i94. we \"my friends and other witnesses\" have dubbed this object the light bulb because it catches your attention as being a very bright star or planet? but maneuvers around if you watch it long enough then eventually \"blinks\" out like a light bulb.  someone other than myself and a bunch of people have had to have witnessed this i hope you have already investigated it.  if not then get your cameras ready cause it is here and has been here, i am former military and so are most of the witnesses of this even current iraq war vets
