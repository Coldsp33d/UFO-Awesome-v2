coming from the woods in my back  yard. this noise was unlike anything i have ever heard befor. i went to my back sliding door and began looking out the screen thinking to my self this is very unusual. then the lights appeared from the woods. the object seemed to rise from out of nowhere. then the object began to move and the sound became increasingly louder and louder. this sound it was making is very hard to explain. the best way to explain it is like very low digital frequency but without vibration like a jet would cause. the lights were in a triangle formation with a super bright red light in the center of the triangle. the lights at each point of the triangle were bright white light at a downward facing direction. these lights including the red light did not emit glare or shine like normal lights do at night. the lights looked unnatural. not man made lights. this triangle was no more than 2000 feet above the ground and moved at an alarmingly slow pace. conventional air craft such as planes and jets can not fly this slow without stalling and crashing. commercial jets do not fly this low in my area anyways. the closest airport is 20 miles away. the triangle did not have any blinking lights such as planes have. planes and jets have green and red lights that blink to let others know if they are approaching or going away. boats have these same lights. i had my girlfriend come out side to view this object. she was in absolute disbelief at what we were seeing. i told her to grab the camera and take a picture. the picture is very poor quality as many ufo pictures are. we watched this object for 2 to 3 minutes befor it disappeared along with the noise. i then texted my friend who lives a quarter mile down the street and asked him if he had seen the object. he replied he was listening to his radio in his room and this loud noise completely drowned out his radio. i have seen this object 3 times befor with now a total of 4 other people now. the first 3 times were all in 2000 and 2001. all these sightings were in within 10 miles of each other. two days later i went outside to snap a couple pictures of the area we had taken the first picture at so i could get a good refrence point in good light. i took two pictures right after each other without noticing anything at the time. i went inside to view the pictures and realized i had caught something on camera which i can not explain.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

thought it was an emergency.  she said \"sorry to bother you so late, but my husband is in the back yard looking at some weird lights in the sky and thought you might want to see them too.\"  i then said \"ok, i'm out back right now.\"  i then opened up my sliding glass door to go to the lanai and i looked up in the eastern sky at about 45 degrees, or the 1 o'clock position, and saw a triangular object in the sky moving from left to right and back left and up and down and it surely didn't look like anything i've ever seen in my life.  i then ran back into the house to wake up my wife, who is the biggest ufo skeptic that i know, and said \"wake up! wake up! you've got to come outside and see this thing!!\" she said \"no, i've to go to sleep, i have to work in the morning!\" i preceded to say \"you have to see this thing in the sky, just trust me, you have to come out and see this!\"  i then looked for our camera, a casio exilim 10.1 mega pixel camera, and went back outside with my dog and started recording footage of this thing in the sky.  i walked over to my neighbors house and we, three of us, watched this thing for 2 and a half hours.  my neighbor had binoculars and a telescope, but it was easier to use the binoculars to see the silohuette of this object.  it was moving in different patterns, but generally stayed in the eastern sky moving from left to right in a pendulum type pattern, but it would also moved westward a little bit, but still remained at the 1 o'clock to 1:30 position in the sky.  if you held a dime towards the sky, the size was a little smaller than the dime. it seemed to be about 1000-3000 feet in the sky hovering over i-75 near sr 54.  the feelings i felt was \"what the heck is that?\"  we sat on some chairs and watched this thing for a couple hours.  i started to feel really sleepy so i went back inside the house to go to sleep, but i kept checking out my window because i wanted to see where this thing will go once it's done hovering over wesley chapel, fl. i found my other battery that was fully charged so i went back outside for a few more minutes and fimed one more video.  i don't know what we saw, but it wasn't a plane.  matter of fact, we saw 2 planes fly by that night, one was flying from east to southwest.  we heard the sounds of the engines as it came closer to us and as it flew past us.  the sounds were evident even when the plane seemed to be further to us than the triangular object in the sky.  the next plane fly past us from south to north and you could also hear it as it flew past us.  but this object made no sounds at all.  the night sky was very clear and there was no or very little wind that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18256,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":28.1799711,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07232009-0013","longitude":-82.3460556,"occurred":1247899320000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1247899320000,"summary":"It

the west, and moved off in that direction. it appeared to climb into the cloud layer and faded as it ascended. i have witnessed other strange lights in the sky through the years but nothing so close

sick to my stomach, i dont know if it was just nerves or what, but i was shaking. as it got closer i noticed it was about 2 stories thick with a deep red glow coming fron the center at the bottom, with electrical discharges from the rear sparks in you will. the air felt electric like static electricty. it moved so quickly without a sound except for the snaping sounds of the discharges at the rear. i wached it from a dot in the sky and it went right overhead and disappered in about 15min. i could'nt sleep that night and my body has a static charge, anything i touched there was a spark, very weird i have never experinced anything like it in my life. i had a camera in my house but was frozen and could not move to get it. i wish i would of it was so clear just moving in the sky. it was just amazing and i am noe truly a beliver. could it have been miltary? i just have never seen anything close to that in the sky. it was almost felt like i reach out an touch it. i still have a very

running into the house to tell myself and my daughter (13 yr old) that there were ufos and to come look.  we didn't believe him and thought they were going to jump out and scare us since it was dark so we didn't go right away.  my son came running back in within a few minutes telling us to come look, seriously there were ufo's.  then my husband came inside and said we really needed to see this.  all 4 of us stood on our front steps looking north toward cr 6.  there were 4 orange lights in the sky in a kind of zig-zag shape.  some of the lights were stationary and some were moving really slowy up in the sky.  they were far enough away that we had no idea the shape of the object giving off the light.  they just looked like orage balls in the sky.  they were maybe, from our location, about an inch big and only a few inches apart.  so, i don't know how far away they actually were, or their actual size.  that is just what it looked like to us.  as we were watching the lights, the upper most light just suddenly disappeared.  then the remaining lights eventually moved up in the sky (one by one - not all at once - and some did remain stationary as others moved) and disappeared.  as one disappeared another one would appear below the others.  in total, my husband saw 7 lights.  i witnessed 4 when i first stepped onto the porch and a 5th one appeared before i watched them all individually disappear.\r\n\r\nwe tried taking pictures with my digital camera but they did not turn out.\r\n\r\nthis was the strangest thing i have ever seen.  i don't know if they were planes? but to us they were ufo's simply because we didn't know what they could be.  i'm not claiming i witnessed a ufo from outerspace filled with \"grays\" or anything.  just that we saw strange orange lights in the sky that none of us could explain.\r\n\r\nwe have looked toward the sky in the same direction at the same time since then and have not witnessed it again.  it was very neat but scared my

cigarette. we went outside at about 4:15am. the sky was mostly clear and could see many stars. i noticed a bright light over head and to the right of us in the north eastern direction. at first i thought it was a star and asked my girlfriend if it was the northern star because it was so bright. she said she wasn't sure and pointed out another group of stars and said it was the little dipper. i then pointed out a group of stars that i thought looked like a kite, she agreed. then my attention focused back on the very bright light that hadn't moved. i noticed it was much to close and bright to be a star. that's when it began to interest me. i focused on the light and noticed that it was slightly moving but not much. it was very bright and had little rays of light coming out of it like a light shinning into a diamond. i lit up another cigarette and watched the light. it would stay in the same area but move a tiny bit and would dim a bit, then grow brighter. it seemed like it was moving back and forth. i had to keep moving in order to keep it in view from the trees in the neighboring yards. it seemed to be several hundred feet in the air. after 3 cigarettes and about  20 minutes it began to dim and move further away, headed in the north eastern direction. another cigarette and 10 minutes went by before it faded to a smaller sized light, a little bigger than the other stars i had been looking at earlier. it then began climbing higher into the sky heading strait up. it climbed until it vanished into the clouds high in atmosphere.  the time it finally vanished was 4:48am pst. i have never seen anything like it. i felt overwhelmed, and memorized at the same time. i was very interested in watching it because i have never seen anything remotely similar in what i was whitnessing. there is no way it was an aircraft i have ever seen, and it definitely was moving under its own power. i am not sure what it was but i swear by what i saw and my girlfriend was there and saw it as well. i also called a friend during the sighting and told him to look in the sky. he said he saw a bright light but was not sure if it was the same thing i was seeing. i was unable to take any photos because all i had was my iphone and it was unable to see it, but there must be others who saw it. it as over a pretty populated area. i feel that it was significant enough to try and call any ufo sighting hot line i could on www.Google.Com at the moment, call the observatory, and wright this detailed description of my experience.  i am an educated college student who is known for being very credible by many many people. please take this seriously and look into. please contact me with your findings, i am very interested. this is not a joke! thank you for your time and effort looking into this sighting. i am very curious in finding out what i saw so please find me an answer.

another object appeared in the sky at about the same altitude and speed in a north to south direction and exibited the same pattern as the first. none of these objects blinked off and on they just appeared brightly and slowley faded from view.  when they disappeared they seemed to fade get bright and then go out altogether.  none of the objects disappeared over the horizen they just went out.

road and through a few, twists, hills, and slopes she had come upon long straight away. it was here where the strange morning was reminded and continued. she said that infront of her some distance up in the sky was a stationary metallic sphere. she observed this for just a few moments, the time the road and direction would let her, but more than enough time to take in the sight and give plenty of

while taking the picture but paid it no attention. when we got home i popped the camera card into the computer to tweak the light and contrast levels when i noticed a black dot on one of the pics that

cloud details nearby that are actually smaller than the object. to me this indicates that at that level of magnification, wings would be seen if it was a plane or bird. additionally, if it was a blur of a bird in flight, there still would be areas of lighter or darker shades where light would reflect off wing, head, leg or abdomen surfaces no matter how blurred it may be. there appears to be none of these as the object shows a consistent dark shade. there does however appear to be an area of lighter shade along the top of the object, possibly implying sunlight reflecting off the top surface.

150 feet west of the sandwich town line.. electrical storms and rain were in the area. strong thuderstorms had passed to the south, and other thunderstorms were to the west, east, and north over cape cod bay. we were sitting by a fire on the beach, and the fire was relatively low . the tide had gone most of the way out. we were possibly the only vacationers on the beach at the time because the rain had been fairly heavy at times (we stayed out because we were under waterproof beach umbrellas). my father told me to look towards the water beause he saw something. two blue lights seemed to dance on the water from right ot left, and they traveled fast. ther was no observable engine noise. they seemed to be over the water so its possible that we were seeing one glowing object and its reflection below it. if that were the case than it seemed as though it might have been \"skippoing\" off the water like a stone. it was probably about as bight as a storebought flashlight. the object seemed to follow the shore. when it got far to the left i lost sight of it. a few minutes later i looked for footprints down by the water, even though the objects seemed to be going much faster than a human could have, and found none.\r\n\r\ni made the following estimations that night, and recorded them on my cell phone. distance was 200 yds, water was 100yds away. the lights traveled from right to left in ~10 seconds.The traversed 120degrees of my field of view. if i were looking straight out toward the water, it was from 60 deg to my right, all the way to 60deg to my left.  i feel these numbers are probably high. reducing the numbers is more conservative anyway, so i will use the following: distance to the water:65ft. closest approach of object occued at about 100 yds away from the fire, straight out in the direction of the water. it probably took about 8 seconds to travel through 120deg of view from my location.\r\n\r\nusing two right triangles, with h being the 100yds closest approach distance in the center and two 60deg angles on either side, the object traversed about 346 yards in 8 seconds. (tan(60)*(100yds)*2).  that translates to 88mph. this speed is consistant with the visual observation. it looked like it was going at least highway speeds. using my origonal estimates gives the object a speed of about 142mph. again, there was no engine noise of any kind. \r\n\r\nwe were truly baffled by the sighting and the only possible explination we could think of was that perhaps it was some form of heat lightning or st. elmo's fire or something, but those are definitly not satisfying. i'd also like to note that i am an aerospace engineer and i received my bs in 2008. we saw what we saw and have no explination for it, but any explination would be most welcomed and greatly appreciated.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18238,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.7804907,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07222009-0014","longitude":-70.535438,"occurred":1247724900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1247724900000,"summary":"Two blue lights traveling northwest along the water at sagamore beach. spotted from the beach at about 100 yds away over the water (perhaps 1 light  +its reflection?).

the size of the moon moving across the night sky a fair distance away.  it was traveling rather fast and had absolutely no blinking lights required to identify itself as a plane or helicopter. it was heading in a westerly direction and i kept my eye on it for about a minute before other people began to notice it.  as more and more people began to question what it was the object suddenly came to a complete stop in the sky and floated there for about another minute before becoming noticeably dimmer and dimmer and eventually faded away completely in front of mine and about 30 others eyes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18234,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.05327,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07222009-0010","longitude":-114.0521422,"occurred":1247981100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1247981100000,"summary":"Orange

color except it was moving across the sky very fast, we watched it for about 2-3 minutes until it disappeared.  it definately was not a shooting star.  i was wondering if anyone else reported seeing

camp fire at their cabin. melissa had just gotten up to go inside, and use the bathroom. steve looked up, and happened to comment that the stars were more visible now that it was later in the night. the time was approx. 23:00-23:30 est. as soon as he commented on the stars, sharon, and i looked up. just then what looked to be a shooting star became visible. but it definitely wasn't. \r\n\r\nthe light was much brighter than any star in the sky. it was about as bright as a planet when they are visible to the naked eye. there was no tail. it was moving as fast as shooting stars i've seen in the past. the light was solid, not blinking. there was no engine noise. no sonic boom. no noise at all. the light was initially traveling along the horizon in the east sky heading north. it dropped 90 degrees, and got very bright. it appeared to be headed right for us. it dropped for approx. 1-2 seconds, then changed course to its original direction of travel until it disappeared in the distance. it was not the space shuttle. i've seen it before from the ground with binoculars. my initial thought was something skimmed the atmosphere, then plunged quickly straight through it, and then continued on its original course.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy wife came back outside just after the sighting. we told her what happened, and then we all watched the sky. several minutes later the object came back from the w heading ene. it was just as bright, but moving much slower. it appeared to be wobbling slightly side to side. again, no noise, no tail. we watched it until it disappeared out of sight. that was the last time we saw it.\r\n\r\nthe cabin is near camp grayling. i live right by selfridge air national guard base. i know what planes in the sky look like. i know what shooting stars look like. i know what planets look like. i know what the space shuttle looks like. this was something else.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

and waiting to fully wake up i happened to roll over and look out the window. i noticed the regular stars and among them this other flashing object that appeared a little bigger. so i got out of bed and got my binoculars. when they were not strong enough to make out any detail i got my camera with 12x zoom, knowing i can zoom far more on the computer as well. i watched it and took pictures for up to 40 minuets, during which the object meandered about the sky. from my point of view considering scale, it moved about the area over the building out my window. it changed the direction of it's nose and changed colors as well. first moving in a diagonal towards the ground, then up and off to the east. it soon came out of  the field of view of my window. \r\ni first assumed it to be a helicopter, perhaps performing some service in the desert (as the area it must have been over is semi-desert prairie land which is moderately farmed.)then when i had a better view with my equipment i may have thought it to be a satellite. once all the computer zooming was done i had no choice but to admit i do not know that the flying object it. weather it contains space men or government secrets is also up for debate.\r\ni did not feel afraid or anything but i was very curious and exited at the possibility of recording a ufo.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:37:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then
