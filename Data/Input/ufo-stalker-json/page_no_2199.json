comet, hale-bopp. as i was watching to the north sky, i saw something come from what appeared to be from the comet (or behind it). at first, i laughed at thinking a plane was offering me an illusion it was coming from space. as seconds rolled past, i noticed it appeared to drop into the atmosphere and was coming closer and fast. in addition, the vessel had no blinking lights-just solid ones. i remember thinking no plane could travel that fast, for it had flown from the comet to a distant plane distance in less than one minute.\r\n\r\nthe spacecraft quickly dropped to just above the vast forest behind the house, quickly slowing down and coming my way. as it approached, it looked like a plane with solid lights, maybe two lights. i had time to think it through that this slow ship just sped in from space. \r\n\r\nto my surprise, the spaceship dropped to just above the trees and passed in a straight line over my head. it passed so slow that i watched the nose go over my head. it was not very wide, and it was almost silent. all i could hear was a low roar. the trees did not move from the wind. the body kept getting wider. i was looking straight up at the dark colored spaceship. it could not have been more than 200 feet in the air. i kept telling myself to be calm. i was exhilarated with curiosity.\r\n\r\nthe wing i viewed as the right wing spanned across the house and yard. the left wing spanned over the neighbor���s yard. as the wings passed over, i noted the wings were a smooth part of the ship and pointed slightly forward. as the spaceship revealed its back, i saw a large and brightly lit rectangular window with rounded edges. all i could see was a wall of something at the back. i kept thinking it was a computer wall or something similar. \r\n\r\nthen, what appeared to be faster than when it sped in, the spaceship left. after the ship passed, it made a sudden jump into the sky, curving nne and then ne and the east and shot over the chesapeake bay into space. in less than five seconds, i saw the ship jump out of the atmosphere. \r\ni immediately drew pictures and started researching. i wanted to report the sighting, but i stopped talking about it, because when i did, i faced ridicule or ignorance. i never reported it until now. was this ship observing the comet, and did this ship take a side excursion to earth because we were so close? how could a ship travel so fast, quietly slowing to the speed of a slow car quietly, and speed back into space? \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

too low to be airplanes. \r\nthe main attraction was a cluster of approximately 5 or 6 orbs within relative close proximity of eachother, outlining an almost triangular pattern. they were all brightly illuminated and pulsing, almost like a fire contained within glass. there was no trail of any kind left behind. in the middle of the cluster i did notice one really faint white light moving steadily at the same speed as the others.\r\n\r\nwhen i turned west onto 39th street i noticed three more of these orbs spaced out across the sky almost to the edge of the horizon, also forming the outline of a triangle. all pulsing with the same red/orange fire-like luminosity.\r\n\r\non july 4th, my boyfriend and i witnessed a solitary \"fireball\" move steadily southward, ironically enough during a conversation about my experience in

start the grill.  suddenly an object in motion caught my eye as it moved from w to e above a large tree two houses to the south of our backyard at a height estimated to be about 5000 ft.  i first thought it was just another airplane, but i then realized there was no sound.  also, something just didn���t seem \"normal\" about the look of this object.  there were no fixed wings, propellor blades, navigation lights, or strobes.  i calmly, but briskly walked back into the house and grabbed my camera and returned to the patio to snap off a few pics before the object left my view.  i didn���t tell anyone else who was playing cards as i didn���t want to create too much excitement, have everyone run outside at once and miss a chance to get some pics taken.  fortunately, the object was still visible, but it appeared to be maneuvering.  when the 2 images are viewed in succession, one can get a good sense of the smooth motion of the object.  it almost appears to have been banking ne as i lost sight of it behind a big tree directly to our east.\r\n\r\nthe attached photo evidence seems to indicate something other than a fixed wing aircraft that was moving too quickly and at an unlikely altitude to be an approach path into eppley airfield.  at no time was there any propeller or jet engine noise.  we regularly see the omaha police helicopter, commercial jets, and private planes and jets.  they always have some kind of noise when at a similar height as this craft.  the enhanced versions of the pics tend to support my theory that this was a self-contained, dome shaped craft that was under power and control of the occupants.  perhaps this was some type of undisclosed military or other experimental craft of human origins.  based upon my other recent sightings in december 2008 and february of 2009, i am comfortable stating this was not a known aircraft of human design.  thank you for reading and feel free to email with any questions at

found some odd circles on which no hay had grown (or had grown and was ruined somehow, leaving the circles). i shot the first four photos in early november 2009 (the ground was wet and had been trampled by cattle). in late may 2009 i shot more photos of the same circles. they are even more pronounced now.\r\n\r\nthis land has been owned and hay grown/mown for 99+ years by the same folks. the

requesting anonymity, but are willing to show them to a mufon investigator.\r\n\r\ni don't know if snow \"stuck\" to them since i was unable to get to them during the winter months.\r\n\r\nnothing is growing inside the rings, and the outside edges of the rings actually look a little wider now than they did last fall.\r\n\r\nthe circles are in a straight line. the west circle appears smaller than the other two (about 8 feet in diameter). the center and east circles are 10'-12' in diameter. they are approximately 60' and 66' apart.\r\n\r\na fourth circle (the small one in the foreground of the landscape shot) is 5'-6' in diameter.\r\n\r\nif a line was drawn connecting the circles, the resulting shape would be triangular.\r\n\r\na mutilated animal was found at the top of the low hill sloping up to the south from where the circles are located ������ about 75 yards away from the circles. nobody reported any missing horses or cattle in 2008, so the ranchers are guessing the dead animal was an elk. best guess from the ranchers is that it had been dead for three or four months.

either 2003 or 2004 not sure think it was 2004 and i was in an office working out a steel order when a car entered the carpark directly outside and two men in suits got out and approached the main entrance. i then opened the door to these gentlemen who introduced themselves as fraud squad detectives who wished to interview another person in the building who worked for a different company who shared the premises along with ourselves. while discussing the situation with the detectives in the carpark a metre from the front entrance i noticed a object come into view on my left peripheral vision. while chatting my eyes were drawn to this object and one of the detectives noticed, turned and looked in the same direction and who instantly remarked ' what's that\". the three of us then looked at this object with the other detective remarking \"that is weird what the hell is it\" to which i replied \"you're the detectives you tell me\"(i know naughty but i couldn't resist it).My guess is it was maybe 6 or 700 feet above ground level, the sighting was in broad daylight, sunny not a cloud in the sky either just before noon or just after.I then put my finger in my mouth and remarked that the wind was blowing from the east, the object came from the west and was headed in an easterly direction hence against the breeze.The object itself was hard to pin down as to it's profile, i thought maybe a microlight as it was similar shaped and it seemed to be of one colour,a mucky brown bronzy colour with maybe a black spot where a head could be,( i suppose it could have been triangular with a protruberance at the front giving it that appearance). anyway we watched it for maybe a minute, it could have been less, it flew in total silence but never altered it's height or course and was really strange. a bit later when we were in the office the detective who first seen it with me remarked again \"that was really weird\" as he looked out the window to see if it was coming back. i hope you find this of interest as 2 servivg officers were as baffled as i was and they are trained observers. oh as for size i would hazard a guess maybe a couple of meters bigger all round than a microlight. spending 30 odd years in engineering reading blueprints gauging size and distance i think has given myself a pretty good grounding in observation and i,ve lived over airport flightpaths most of my life, whatever the object was i'd never seen it's like before or since. cheers anyway","distance":"501 Feet - 1
