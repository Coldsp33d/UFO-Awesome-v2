lights were drones. i noticed after watching them night after night they didnt move like drones ive ever flown. i got binoculars and a spotting scope and noticed a central white rgb type light in a v patterned small craft. i considered it to most likely be an alien drone or possibly a military drone.  possible since im so close to an airport. well i decided one night to go outside and signal the small crafts with a flashlight. ive heard math is the universal language. so i flashed a couple sequences of prime numbers. i told my wife come outside quick. i could see a large ship approaching from a few houses down nearly crazing the tree tops. turning and redirecting itself towards my backyard like it already knew my gps location. i looked is amazement followed by shock and fear.  it passed slowly like it was looking for a place to land. backyard too small and too many trees around. but it passed so close i could have thrown a baseball and hit it. it slowly passed my yard and went over neighbors yard and i couldnt see it anymore after. i look up and seen about 10 same type of ships flying fast high in the sky in a sequence. then i notice smoke everywhere. like my neighbors house was burning down. smelled like gun powder. i looked for the source of smoke. it was in a fiend a street over. obviously upwind of me. i believe the ship popped off smoke before it was going to try and land. i reallized i would have had a heart attack if it did land. to describe them. large square bronze looking metal. white lights around sides. circle pattern red flashing lights on bottom. craft looked egyptian from my point of view.My wife says she had a hard time with glare of white lights and couldnt give definite description. the next afternoon were all outside and hundreds of them are in the sky. i could hear the neighbors kids making jokes of an invasion. i saw people looking up down the street. i called my mom and told her. she said i need help. i started to film one as it got dark.  my wife and i are sitting in chairs in the middle of our lawn.  one is flying over and im recording. the next morning before work i decide to watch video. like usual when i record a ufo  the video isnt what was thought to be recorded. to sum it up  i recorded a ufo landing a few feet from me and a little alien next to it. looking right at me.Now the repercussion of this lasted 3 or 4 days. dark entities manifested in a bunch of my photos on my phone, my wifes phone. even pictures in other unrelated clouds. needless to say i had to delete alot of pictures. alien photo editors. please explain

backdoor to let my dogs in. i have a habit of looking up at the sky whenever i go outside. that night i looked up and saw a bright golden, yellow object hovering / floating above my neighborhood, seemingly above my house. it did not make a sound, it did not move in any direction. i stared at it for a few moments then though, i need to get my camera and zoom lens. i have a decent dslr and a 70-300 telephoto lens. i went back in my house and told my daughter as well, she followed me outside to check it out. i hand held the camera and tried to get a good focus on what the object could be, but every time i zoomed closer it just looked like a blob. i will share the photos too. i also took out my smartphone and recorded a video, i still could not get a good focus on the object. shortly after i started recording, my husband came home. i ushered him into the backyard so he could see the object as well. he agreed it was weird and tried to get a good photo too. at that point, to me, it almost looked like it \"separated\" slightly then went back together again, but it could have just been my eyes playing tricks after staring at it for so long. while i was recording, a commercial plan few by, this helps with the distance and size of what ever it is. after about another 10- 15 mins, the object seemed to ascend slowly, then after a few more minutes, i could no longer see it. it never

heading over sr 50 and mariner blvd area. took me a few seconds to realize i was looking at something abnormal. i looked for red beacons or directional green/red lighting on the craft and observed none. i hold a certification in airplane mechanics and noticed this crafts light pattern was unusual. unfortunately the sky was dark and i was unable to see a defined outline of the craft, there were several pale white lights which appeared on the underside of the craft in the shape of a triangle. see attached sketch. it was quiet enough out to hear a dog barking several blocks away and i did not hear any sounds coming from the sky, i questioned if it could be a drone but it appeared too large for something you could buy, and it was windy out with a very light drizzle. unfavorable conditions for hobby flying. the craft seemed to be traveling at or just under cloud level to possibly maintain obscurity? appeared to have faster than normal movement compared to usual air traffic. craft made a sharp left hand pitch, then appeared to level off and move up into cloud cover. observation time was short approximately 10-15 seconds. she asked what that was, to which i replied i was not sure. she asked again a bit more seriously but neither of us were sure what we just saw.

which was a very bright full moon that lit up the night, and a very clear sky.\r\nfor some reason i started huddling down along the side of the creek so as not to be seen by cars that were driving down the back alley towards their garages (and i wasn't comfortable with people seeing me with a tobacco pipe, in the middle of the night of all things; i can imagine police being called out to announce on a loudspeaker, \"put the crack pipe down and put your hands in the air!\") during times cars weren't driving through the alley i took steps back down into the creek bed and simply glanced in one direction into the night sky, and turned around to the other side, and after glancing back to where i was i felt compelled to look back up-over the creek edge and witness a strange looking \"craft\" (what appeared as some traditional aircraft though wasn't for some reason i can't correctly place) simply positioned over the nearby homes, and zip off what seemed to be a slight sound like a very low-key \"rocket thrust\" as it disappeared. my initial reaction to seeing it was a mix of expletives and shocked amazement, along with incredulity that it was what i think i saw.  \r\n\t\r\nthis proceeded an encounter with the train crossing lights two nights later when i had been playing gun's and roses 'night train' on a cd, and just happened to be approaching a train track as the song was starting. just prior to approaching i can only describe what was going through my mind as expecting something strange to happen; the lights start to blink and the train guard arms go down about half way, only to cancel out and retract back within seconds, though just enough to cause the oncoming cars to slow down a little (and i do believe that numerous train crossing lights will malfunction, and consider this could be interpreted as a possible random coincidence; and yes i do suspect they were malfunctioning around this time in this area for some reason.) \r\nseveral months would still pass following those 1-2 day's experience prior, and following quitting my day (side-cash) job to kind of “reset” myself back to normal circadian rhythm, i was already set on a quest during the night on my lunch break to drive around the area and try and make sense in determining what seemed out of place, which i would do for several months (partly to relieve stress by driving for 10-20 minutes and up to an hour,) but also because i was curious about the possibility of some of these apparent planes in the sky “not seeming quite right.\" driving to a neighboring city i noticed a craft stood out as hovering over some apartments, well away from any airports in the area and a decent few miles from where i noticed it and drove to, and which i stopped near the apartment’s road to turn the vehicle around to follow it as it starts to drift off back the direction i came from, towards the highways. during this time several dips in the roads and tree trees would block visibility of it, and i would only accelerate to keep up with it, noticing the \"back\" of the craft facing me. this continued on for about 30 more seconds in which the craft may well have assumed i would keep the same pace i was at, only it appeared to \"look back\" by having what would appear to be the front of the craft, completely rotate in mid air. . . basically what appeared as “headlights” rotated towards me, and perhaps whatever was in control of the object in the sky had done so deliberately, or it realized it goofed and it’s cover had been blown, at which point it disappeared. . . \r\nnote: this seemed completely unusual to me, though if you consider people claiming to \"summoning\" crafts to be recorded in video, some of them appear to mimic hearts or other strange shapes in the sky; and i suspect movies like transformers could be hinting at the reality, that a robot/a.I. from some advanced civilization could be eavesdropping on humanity, appearing to mirror the human consciousness to some extent, and play off humanities perceptions of terrestrial craft? perhaps if an advanced intelligence behind some program like the phenomenon were to let it be known in some ways to people that they might test in determining readiness for interaction; whether they were prepared for such an encounter, it might well take place in ways that could only be believed by the observer. any claim to the contrary would be expected to be met with ridicule, or outright denial (hence keeping people silent on coming forward with such claims, at fear of social reprisal.) \r\nnote: these sightings in the sky would continue but in different ways (and no, i didn’t choose to attempt to record anything using recording median, which is why i suppose this will perceived as possible confabulation and possible dubious interpretation resulting from insanity, which i hopefully can assure the reader it is not, and i will explain why i decided not to during the entirety of my experience.) \r\non one occasion i would notice two lights in the sky adjacent to each other and appearing to remain stationary together, and they would simply move away simultaneously. during this time i was of the impression they are here for the reason, that we are basically in a \"cradle\" civilization; basically around the time of these sightings while i was out in the back yard a little light orb (about the size of a large lightning bug) would hover over a tree where a hawks nest had been, and circle it. these crafts were hovering low and right above some houses across from the creek. only recently had that very tree been cut down as it turned out to be dead; though i believe it was a eucalyptus tree, and i had actually not long prior started to experiment with a camera attached to a c-adapter for a telescope, using a meade 8-inch smidt-cassegrain telescope as the lens, which i had bought after the initial sighting. the photos were made of the nest, so it may have stood out in my mind somewhat; and the more i look back, even though i don’t doubt any of my memory nor my sense of observation of it, i do sort of wish i might have done something to record the phenomenon other than the chosen method i resorted to (which is using a ghost radar legacy phone app. . .) which i won't elaborate much on for reasons it probably isn't considered credible. \r\n\r\nbackstory/preface: for whatever reason i stopped trying to document the paranormal; i figured that no matter how much evidence i gathered on any of it, most people were. . . (i'll keep it polite) incapable of comprehending anything that made them question their competency or sanity, of what they believe to be real; part of it's pride of appearing \"grounded,\" by conforming to social norms/conditioning. it doesn't occur to people that they should well forget everything they've ever thought they understood (about religion, about politics, about their peers) and really reflect on that. i had by that time considered myself an atheist or an agnostic, though with strong convictions based off prior recorded class-a evp, that something was similar with the ‘ufo’ phenomenon. i take jacquees vallee’s theory of observation that these things are somehow present in the sky, but also using the human observer as some sort of proxy for observing it. . . that religion and the paranormal perhaps is not unrelated, but that it is tantamount to a psychological praxis which is not altogether conflated with sanity. \r\n\r\n*****************\r\nthis following is an earlier account that i edited down, though also elaborates further in some areas such as what led me to compare the ufo phenomenon to other paranormal. while i did not record the phenomenon visually and relied on something very different, is part because i wanted nothing to prove to anyone and preferred to remain rather independent and decided to it was best i not attempt to share such claims of evidence. when studying the evp phenomenon i noticed that much of it seemed to manifest through atmospheric morphing of sorts (that is, when recording things other than 'class a' evp, it would seem to require taking advantage of ambient electromagnetic wave, which are all around us.) if something existing as a 4th dimensional non-corporeal conscious entity utilizes things within nature that may not seem apparent to our physical senses, i've wondered to what extent the ufo phenomenon exists, and i've come to identify with what jacques vallee describes of it, as something which is a form of non-human consciousness that manipulates space and time, having witnessed something that mimicked terrestrial aircraft and exhibited traits that were seemingly impossible. at the time of this experience i had already witnessed the presence of ufo in the area though i did not attempt much of any photographic evidence despite being relatively experienced with professional grade camera equipment, and studying errors of interpretation and human tendencies to confabulate or deliberately mislead people for attention-seeking behavior such as using cgi, so i didn’t put much stock in it as evidence nor was i convinced it would prove anything to anyone if they weren’t ready for it, and consider myself knowledgeable about perspective and observer phenomenon that misinterprets things such as lacking knowledge of lens phenomenon (such as people interpreting an non-collimated telescope as visual evidence of the stars being conscious intelligent beings; which they are clearly not. . .) i would spend a duration over the next year of trying to make sense of what i experienced, in part because some aspects of that night and the following night persisted in ways that seemed to explain a reality that is little apparent to us, but is nevertheless very real. one thing i left out was that a day or two after the 2014 creek sighting i did experience what i consider may sound like a hallucination such as, \"come closer\" upon waking up, which is the same night while driving to work, while listening to the cd player, the gun's and roses song, 'night train' was playing prior to approaching the train track crossing lights, which started blinking and descended enough to slow traffic towards it, but quickly resumed back to the up position (train crossing lights do glitch out, but this occurrence was uncanny for all the times i've driven over them.) my car's radar detector would also go off later on in the following weeks (and though i had for the longest time noticed an occasional aberrant ku signal, which would go off in sequences of 3, and specifically the ku band frequency (usually reserved for satellites, and non-existent in use within the us for car radar; it was a weird fluke of car radar detectors to have and my detector was a beltronics vector v995). it might have been \"defective\" and eventually i replaced it (though have the old one because of this experience, though what was unusual is how i would simply think of questions and the beeping would start in sequence, and i made an elaborate process of asking questions and elaborated on how sequences would imply a sort of yes or no (though more elaborate than that), and in particular i used an area alongside a highway where i work, which happened to have a toll station that was being dismantled, and i suspect it had an errant transmitter being used to keep track of toll payments, or at least something seemed to cause disruption to my radar detector; and this would make sense to some extent because it mostly only ever happened when at that location, however it would occasionally persist as a ku burst of 3. eventually i started to use a program called ghost radar legend (which is different from the classic version in that it enabled recording of what was spoken and sent via email to myself,) and some unusual things occurred with that such as the program turning off and on its own, and it would very clearly interact with what i was doing (and i would leave the program running with the phone turned off, and for whatever reason it was able to do things that should not have been remotely possible for it.) i am convinced of what jacques vallee has talked about, and i'm pretty sure at some point in time, humanity has become aware of its presence in various ways. at the time i had started meditating intently and experienced something that was very strange, and though i have in large part left these experiences behind and hardly looked back over it, it has persisted in ways that have only caused me to question the extent of how our society operates. perhaps it only makes sense for those that have attempted to make sense of it on a certain level, and that for most people (the vast majority) they would find it much easier (perhaps \"comforting\") to ignore that it must be real. in fact much of my exploration of things like evp and driving out into the middle of the night was to convince myself that none of it could be true; only to convince myself otherwise. i’m fully convinced that these kinds of phenomenon have been ongoing and likely have deep roots in humanities past.  \r\nsome reading this might have come to some conclusion, that i could not fully elaborate on all of the experience; take this account for what you wish.

sending this experience to you for the past couple of years.  for some, still unknown reason, perhaps not to be looked upon as another fool, making up a fantasy, and stating it as fact, could be one reason.  i have told my experience to family member’s, only to be looked up as aforementioned.  \r\ni have, from a child, been a sky watcher, and have seen many things i was/am not able to understand.  what i shall present to you, shall be the highlight of these many years.  i am 72 years of age.\r\nit is july 9th, 2016, a very warm evening, in the city of negaunee, michigan, i, and thousands of other’s, are about to watch the ‘july 4th’ fireworks.  the fireworks in negaunee, are always held the weekend after the regular celebration of the 4th of july over teal lake, within the city limits of negaunee.  it was a kind of partly cloudy sky this night, with a full moon to complement the sky.  there would also be a strange cloud that looked more like a flat hurricane, huge in size, which i could not help but to take of a picture of, and the moon as well.\r\nit would be around 10ish, when with anticipation from the thousands of waiting watcher’s the fireworks began.  over the next hour, perhaps more, we were all awed with the many flares of celebration of our nation’s independence.  it was sad when all this celebration came to an end, with hands clapping, whistle’s sounding, and people beginning to part from this wonderful experience.  it is here that my unknown experience would come to be.\r\ni, and hundreds of other’s, are facing almost directly west, perhaps somewhat south west.  i say this in correlation to where we watched the sun sent this evening.  as the crowd around me packed up their chairs & other paraphernalia, turned away from the lake, would be east, i took the opportunity stay put, looking over the lake, more specifically into the beautiful star like sky.  though the clouds, which were sparse, were still taking flight, i was able to pick out the light of a satellite, which i look for on many nights i look to the heavens.\r\nthis evening would be different.  as i followed the flight of the satellite, which was heading west, i noted as the satellite became less interesting, there was this other light that caught my eye (which gives me goose bumps as i write) that seemed out of place.  the rest of the universe appeared to have the same shade of color, but this one did not.  it was the color of a very old lampshade, brownish in color if you will.  this object in my opinion appeared to moving west, in a similar route as the satellite, but in a ‘much higher orbit’.  in my humble opinion, beyond what we consider normal.  i continued to watch this object of uncertain as to what it was.  unlike anything i have ever witnessed, but hear of stories of, this brilliant (orb) came shooting from the aforementioned object.  in less than a second, it came to a stop, perhaps just at the outer reaches of our atmosphere (guessing).  it would remain in this position for a few seconds, then it headed (my notes) west for some distance, then just like that it headed east of north, then headed directly north over the tree tops toward what eventually would be canada.  then it was gone, ascending to the heavens, and the place of its origins, where i could still make out the lampshade colored object, then it to was gone.\r\nso my fellow lover’s of the unknown, you have read my circumstance, which i have not been able to share with other believers, there is something alien about our universe.  perhaps once in my lifetime, i have been witness to this alien possibility.  the imprint on my mind shall last for whatever years i have left on this, our beautiful earth.\r\nthank you so much for taking your time to read my story.

encounter of the third kind with an humanoid/entity human-like\r\nencuentro cercano en la tercera fase con un humanoide/entidad como-humano\r\n\r\nquiero informar de un fortuito caso de avistamiento ovni/humanoide/tercera fase acaecido en una dehesa próxima a sevilla el 5 de abril de 2017. ¡ y que duró 24 horas !\r\n\r\nesto sucedio en un lugar muy próximo a sevilla. es tan extraño el incidente que todo este asunto se hace increíble y difícil de creer incluso para personas especializadas en la fenomenología ovni. pienso que este incidente se sale de la escala de lo creíble, pero realmente sucedió y yo lo vi tal y como lo escribo. es un \"encuentro cercano\" tan fantástico que por fuerza es verdad. ni hollywood podría imaginar una historia así. \r\n\r\nexisten pruebas grabadas de camaras de seguridad e incluso testigos parciales del hecho. en cualquier caso no puedo acceder a dichas grabaciones sin implicarme. \r\n\r\nvayamos al caso. estaba yo en un campo muy próximo a sevilla capital viendo gente volando aviones de aeromodelismo.  para ver mejor un aeromodelo que me interesó saqué mis prismáticos del coche.  cuando aterrizó el aeromodelo me fijé que al fondo del campo había un coche parado en un sitio donde nunca jamás se pone nadie. ! qué raro, pensé¡  y lo observé detenidamente. en un primer momento fué a través de una fortuita observación con prismaticos de un sujeto (un simple deportista, pensé yo) situado a 650 metros de mí, que lanzaba una pertiga de 2,50 mts y 5 cm de diametro a 350 metros sin esfuerzo, sin parábola, sin carrera, como si lanzara un pequeño dardo. yo creo que la pértiga apantallaba la gravedad con algún tipo de recubrimiento o pintura antigravitatoria ya que era completamente lisa y no emitía ningún sonido. ese día era un perfecto día de primavera, cielo despejado, sol radiante y ligera brisa del norte. era media tarde y al ser un terreno completamente llano, sin árboles ni arbustos, la visibilidad era perfecta.\r\n\r\neste sujeto al que llamaré ultra-humano seguía una rutina invariable. cuando recogía la pértiga volvía junto al coche tranquilamente, sin temor, la llevaba en posición vertical, sin ocultarla. se quedaba parado junto al coche, con la pértiga en posición horizontal un par de minutos y de repente y sin ningún esfuerzo y sin tomar carrera la lanzaba siempre en la misma dirección. hacia el oeste. inmediatamente comenzaba a andar para recuperarla, tranquilamente, como dando un paseo. y así una y otra vez durante la hora que estuve observándole.\r\n\r\nes dificil explicarlo, pero no cambié el chip a modo \"realidad mágica\" sino que pensé que esa sobrehumana capacidad era explicable. como la ignorancia es atrevida y el lugar es muy familiar para mi, quise acercarme a él para preguntarle. el caso es que me vió y se aproximó a mi ¡ siendo invisible! lo sé porque yo iba mirando hacia delante y toda la zona de lanzamiento quedaba dentro de mi campo visual, pudiendo yo ver todo lo que acontecía a más de un kilómetro frente a mi, excepto a este ultra-humano que se \"materializo\" amenazante frente a mí, con brazos en jarra y piernas abiertas,(no llevaba la pértiga con él) .\r\n\r\nse paró a 50 metros o menos frente a mi, , mirándome fijamente sin moverse y yo me quedé petrificado mirándole tambien durante unos 5 segundos, provocandome instantáneamente como un colapso mental, la palabra exacta sería \"estado de grogui\" de total confusión que me hizo retroceder, dar dos vueltas amplias de unos 10 metros en torno a mí y olvidarme literalmente de todo lo que había sucedido. lo recuerdo ahora porque producido el \"encontronazo\" regrese tranquilamente a mi coche (situado a 500 metros de distancia) sin volver la vista atras y sin ningún temor ¡porque ya no recordaba nada! esta pérdida de memoria me duró tres días, si no hubiera ido al día siguiente para comprobar si seguía allí o si había dejado algun resto o señal en la zona cero. fuí al cabo de 3 días y no encontré nada, ni huellas, ni restos, ni señales.... nada de nada. y algo muy importante, el \"visitante\" ya no ha vuelto más, y creo que ya no lo volveré a ver nunca jamás.\r\n\r\ndespués de 9 meses y más de 160 veces me he acercado al lugar un busca de alguna prueba, pero sin resultado. la sorpresa vino el pasado 16 de noviembre en un documental sobre los geoglifos en el cual apareció el sujeto humanoide que había visto. se encuentra en inglaterra y se llama \"el hombre largo de wilmington\"  (long man of wilmington) figura de culto desde hace siglos y de origen desconocido. ¿cómo puede ser que un ser así no haya sido visto por alguién más en 4 siglos? es cierto que su actividad era muy discreta y que se confundía con un deportista, pero aún así su indumentaria era extraña. espero que algún lector/investigador consiga las fotos satelite de ese día y esa zona, porque él estuvo allí durante 24 horas. hasta que llegue ese día sólo puedo informar con mis testimonios y mis dibujos descriptivos.\r\n\r\n========================================\r\n\r\nactualización al día 5 de marzo de 2018 (11 meses después del incidente)\r\nllevo 1 mes soñando todas las noches el incidente, reviviéndolo tal y como ocurrió. se ha convertido en una pesadilla recurrente todas las noches. ¿cómo pudo afectarme así si sólo el contacto visual me pareció que duro unos 5 segundos? espero que llegue el próximo dia 5 de abril.","distance":"N/A","duration":"01:45:00","entityEncountered":true,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":90591,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.396062400000005,"location":null,"logNumber":"ES-03052018-0023","longitude":-5.9793689,"occurred":1491419400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Andalusia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1520289999000,"summary":"Close
