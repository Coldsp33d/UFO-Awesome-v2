in 1983-1984 (i think i was about 13-14 years old) i was at my local aussie rules football (frankston ycw) club in frankston at a \"sausage sizzle\" with my team mates. a \"sausage sizzle\" is an event for the team to get together with parents and cook sausages etc and have some fun at the club house.\r\n\r\ni guess at about 8pm, after we ate, the parents moved inside the club house to talk and have fun etc while us kids basically ran around the football grounds getting up to mischief like nick-knocking and playing tag in the dark etc. we had a great sporting area called jubilee park with two huge ovals (and a smaller one) surrounded by creeks and scrub/bush and a railway line which is surrounded by housing. there were also netball courts and a swimming centre. we often used to get the railway crossing lights working using a coat-hanger and would have traffic stopped for ages. at the time a huge laugh!!\r\n\r\nthis particular night was just like every other sausage sizzle. young kids running around like crazy. at some point during the evening myself and another team mate (don't want to name him) ended up taking a break by lying on our backs on the north side of the smaller oval on a very small embankment star gazing to the north. we were talking and laughing etc and just watching the stars. i was looking at different stars and for no reason in-particular focused on what i thought was a nice bright star imaging how far away it was and which part of the universe it belonged to. i estimate i was staring at this 'star' for about 30 secs when it dropped from the sky as if someone had cut a string holding it in place. it fell for about 1 second (not fast) and then moved in a reverse 'j' motion and shot away into space at an incredible speed. it definitely accelerated and didn't just vanish.  being young i freaked out and said to my friend \"did you see that?\" he said \"what?\" at that i got up and bolted inside the club house and sat with the parents for the rest of the night which you can imagine was pretty rare as everyone else was outside playing.\r\n\r\nthe exact co-ordinates on google earth where we were, are: 38 degrees 09'04.36 s   - 145 degrees 09'34.72 e\r\n\r\ni've never documented this story but have told a few people, all who either don't believe it or seem intrigued. after reading back over the above it doesn't seem to be very believable but i know what i saw. it was real. the funny thing is i probably wouldn't be typing this but i just read someone else saying almost the exact same thing with regard to their experience...In the usa i think. i must say that did give me goose bumps when i read his/her

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Possible \"ufo base\" in eastern oregon.  on a military watchdog website i read that boeing operates a generally secret drone or cruise missile test facility in morrow county in eastern oregon. the facility is located on the \"officially\" decommissioned boardman bombing range located just south of the columbia river, about 140 miles east of portland, oregon.  also, some years earlier i had seen an unknown object fly directly in front of me at very close range, then making abrupt changes in height, when i was driving perhaps 50 miles south of the range.\r\n\r\ni believe whatever is going on at this test facility may have some relationship to ufo sightings in the region. remember, boeing is largest aerospace contractor to the us department of defense. it makes cruise missiles, surveillance drones, and it is anyone���s' guess whatever undeclared things that fly.\r\n\r\nnote the number of sightings in the portland, oregon area that are low altitude flying objects which exit the metro area *flying toward the east* toward the western mouth of the columbia river gorge, in the direction of the boardman range.   \r\n\r\nthe facility and its runway are easily found on google earth.  look for a large rectangular land area of brown \"scorched earth\" to the south of the columbia river, west of pendleton, oregon.  the coordinates are lat. 45.747927  longitude -119.801855.  the buildings and storage areas seem to be sort of camouflaged, as if this were a crop duster strip.  not exactly, a storage area at the eastern end of the 1 mile runway is on a track and apparently can be moved.  and the radar tracking dishes on the west end of the runway near the cluster of buildings.\r\n\r\ni am with jacques valle in guessing that most ufos are a form of psychic-physical phenomena, earth-based, of the types seen for thousands of years, whose appearance indicates far advanced technology.  therefore i think it possible that some recent, clearly ufo sightings in oregon and washington are actually some advanced boeing flying craft, such as drones, weaponless cruise missile, or other test craft that are flown out this remote facility. if so, it���s anyone���s' guess how boeing acquired such advanced technology.\r\n\r\nmost of the range is quite remote and well off main roads - it was regularly for bombing practice during world war ii, and although \"officially\" decommissioned for a number of years, local ranchers say that is not the case.  fighter aircraft from naval air station whidbey island, located in northwest washington state, are said to do training runs over the range; presumably air national guard bases in portland and pendleton, oregon, and boise, idaho use it too. fwiw, a few years ago two advanced fighter aircraft collided over the columbia river, not far from the range.\r\n\r\ni think it possible that boeing is currently testing some sort of advanced propulsion drone. it appears as a yellow-white oblong light, or amber colored or white globe, the size of a van. these have been seen at night running at low altitude over portland this spring and summer, 2009. it is a bright light, with no running lights, no sound, and no wings or fuselage can be seen. several witnesses report them leaving the areas going east.\r\n\r\nsomething interesting in my own experience, which has a relationship to ufo sightings.  it was in the mid 1980s, in the morning, just east of kimberly, oregon.  kimberly is basically a gas station and it is located almost directly south of the boardman range.  my wife and i were driving east.  what looked to be a torpedo, or very small jet crossed over the road, perhaps 150 feet ahead of us, 100 feet off the road.  trees shaded the road ahead of the object and the sun was not in our eyes.\r\n\r\nthe craft just popped into view in front of us and i slammed on the brakes.  it flew rather slowly at maybe 50 miles per hours per hour.  at first i thought it was a rocket or missile, and then someone's radio-controlled experiments, but it was flying right above the ground surface under very tight control.  it was apparently made of a shiny metal; it had a short tail structure and very short, right-angle, stubby wing-like appendages. it had an opening in the back, which looked like a jet exhaust, but saw no cowling for a jet engine. it seemed too small for a pilot, in fact here was no see no cockpit or window. i also considered that it was some kind of new \"shoot-em-down\" practice drone used over the pacific. it never occurred to me to consider it a ufo, but it was certainly of unknown origin to me.\r\n\r\nbased on the design of a video of a cruise missile i saw during the first iraq war, this thing could have been an experimental design.  but it was more like a rocket tube or guided bomb than the cruise missiles or surveillance drones i have seen - those have actual wings and taller tail structures and obvious engines. still, i would put my money on it being a flying military weapon of some sort because i recently found out about the boeing test facility at the boardman range. nevertheless....\r\n\r\nthat road we were on goes through an area of mountains and steep ravines.  this craft had descended down off a steep slope at about 45 degrees immediately to the north of the road. it crossed the other side of the road at maybe 15 feet and kept diving at that angle right straight at a river that ran perhaps 150 feet below the road level and 500 feet off to the south.\r\n\r\nat about 50 feet above the river the thing sharply veered upward, leveled out for a moment, and appeared to be heading directly into a steep slope immediately on the south bank of the river, looking like a flying bomb. we expected that this craft would crash head on, and just watched.  but when almost to the slope the thing snapped into a steep climb, exhaust started shooting out the apparent exhaust hole on the back.  it was about 1/4 mile away at this point, our window was down, but we heard no noise from it, we could hear the river.  it accelerated over the ridgeline, clearing it by 10 to 20 feet, but at the top made an immediate steep bank downward and disappeared on the other side. the change in direction was abrupt, like a playground seesaw - we saw first the smooth top side of the body and in a second the smooth bottom side.  we kept waiting for smoke to rise from the other side due its crashing.  there was none, the thing did not reappear.\r\n\r\ngoogle will clearly show a system of deep valleys that snake through hills and mountains between the boardman range and the region around kimberly.  i bet boeing or the military makes these things, sends them out from boardman, and flies them down low, far into in the ravines making them totally \"under the radar���.\r\n\r\nfood for thought and maybe someone in the dalles, hermiston, and pendleton oregon, or bingen and goldendale, washington can keep an eye out.  who knows, maybe fighter pilots are running training missions around boardman, chasing some hot new design, practicing up for a chance to chase some ufo *not* made by a military contractor.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Louvres,  Wings","flightPath":"Path with

the sky.  upon many occassions there have been several witnesses with me, who saw the same thing that i did, so i know i'm not losing my mind. the first object i want to tell you about, appeared early this morning right around 4:40 am.  this is also the approx. time that most all of the sightings have occurred.  i stepped out for a cigarette, immediately looked up in the sky to the left, about 45 degrees...This rectangle orange glowing lantern shaped object darted out from behind the tree tops, floating almost, but moving at a fast pace, made a zig-zag pattern until it disappeared behind the neighbors tree line.  i couldn't try to find out where it went, i had to stay on work grounds.  about an hour later, i stepped out for my last look at the brightening morning sky, as i stepped out of the door, i looked up to the right in the north eastern sky, i saw the moon, the morning star...And then there was this very bright light...As bright as the morning star,  moving at a slow pace toward the planet...It came to a stop in a wierd motion...And then grew very dim...Then it slowly rose higher up in the sky and just stopped.  i watched it for a good ten minutes, then i had to go back inside, though i wanted to watch it as the sun rose.  a week and a half ago, eerily, i saw this same object appear in the exact same spot in the sky right around the same time.  about 3 weeks ago, me and a fellow co-worker were sitting outside talking, this time it was around 2:30 a.M., flying saucers were the farthest thing from our minds at the time, when all of a sudden...Right above the tree tops was this squarish, disk shaped flying object, creeping up to us overhead, about 150 feet up in the air a pretty  low altitude...It was close enough we could see some strange markings on the craft...Almost like symbols with 4 blue lights at each corner and a green light in the center.  this object had no propellers whatsoever, no flashing lights, but wierder than that was that it made no

night as i was exhausted.  we were already a couple of blocks away from our house when i noticed this same kind of object hovering right beside the t.V. tower.  at first we thought it was a helicopter, but when we drove further on and it came in clearer sight, we saw that it wasn't a helicopter or an airplane.  it was this rectangle object, with blue and green lights...Just hovering in one spot right by the tower, which is a no fly zone by the way.  when we came to a stop at the stop sign...We listened for some kind of aircraft noise, there was none, just the sound of cars going by.

camcorder to take pictures of these things, but unfortunately i don't own one, can't afford it right now.  maybe thats why they're showing themselves to me.  i feel like they're observing us closely.

the sky.  upon many occassions there have been several witnesses with me, who saw the same thing that i did, so i know i'm not losing my mind. the first object i want to tell you about, appeared early this morning right around 4:40 am.  this is also the approx. time that most all of the sightings have occurred.  i stepped out for a cigarette, immediately looked up in the sky to the left, about 45 degrees...This rectangle orange glowing lantern shaped object darted out from behind the tree tops, floating almost, but moving at a fast pace, made a zig-zag pattern until it disappeared behind the neighbors tree line.  i couldn't try to find out where it went, i had to stay on work grounds.  about an hour later, i stepped out for my last look at the brightening morning sky, as i stepped out of the door, i looked up to the right in the north eastern sky, i saw the moon, the morning star...And then there was this very bright light...As bright as the morning star,  moving at a slow pace toward the planet...It came to a stop in a wierd motion...And then grew very dim...Then it slowly rose higher up in the sky and just stopped.  i watched it for a good ten minutes, then i had to go back inside, though i wanted to watch it as the sun rose.  a week and a half ago, eerily, i saw this same object appear in the exact same spot in the sky right around the same time.  about 3 weeks ago, me and a fellow co-worker were sitting outside talking, this time it was around 2:30 a.M., flying saucers were the farthest thing from our minds at the time, when all of a sudden...Right above the tree

white light; looked about the brightness of an aircraft in landing configuration.  it was just over the rooftops of the apartment buildings or 30 degrees above the horizon.  looked to be at a low altitude of 3000���, traveling north to south over lakewood, co.  we both witnessed the object traveling at a good clip; maybe about 150 knots. when my friend asked what the object was it stopped for less than a second then kept traveling.  it performed a few quick squiggles as it traveled, but did not change brightness. it was witnessed for a minute the disappeared.  it also seemed to respond to my mental greetings by the squiggles. i have seen many ufo���s in this area since moving here a year ago, and are all about the similar type usually (every two weeks or so).  there is a lot of air traffic into the departure/arrival  flight path of dia also in this area, but  they have not been traveling in the same air routes.  a few times they have paced aircraft but not very often.
