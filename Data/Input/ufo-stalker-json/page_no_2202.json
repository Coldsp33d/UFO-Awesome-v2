sighting. i am now a ufo researchjer but was not prior to the event. i have copied and pasted this article over from my notes. it also includes severe long term after effects. i haven't been back to wales since it happened but will soon to take photos so i can mark on the horizon where it was first observed and it's flight path over to us. also a mufon member has offered to make a 3d cg film of the event so you will be able to see what happened. i am ready to have hypnotic regression now and also would take a lie detector rest without prior notice.\r\n\r\nit was october the 4th 1996. my partner (at the time) \"s\", myself and my son had arranged to go to wales for the weekend. we'd hired a cottage in glyn ciriog and invited his sister \"d\" and her son \"j\" and their uncle \"jn\" along too. most mundane details have gone from my mind now, the journey there and the daytime on friday. i can remember walking to the shop with the kids and \"s\" and \"d\" and not feeling too good. i was edgy and irritated by \"d\" from some reason i have forgotten now. \r\nmy next memory is it's nighttime, well it's dark, it could have been anytime really but we were all in the garden sorting wood out for the fire. i can remember this because we had a particularly large part of a tree we were jumping on to try and snap it but all that happened is we bounced off it, it was funny and we made a game out of it for a while.\r\nwe must have had some food by this time and i remember going upstairs to unpack my things, i was in the bedroom with my bag on the bed when \"s\" started shouting me. it sounded urgent and the kids were screaming and so i thought something was wrong and ran downstairs. i found \"j\" and my son louis just playing about, relieved i turned to \"s\" and asked what was wrong.\r\nhe ushered me outside to a wall on our right and pointed out into the sky and said \"look at that\". i looked, all i could see for miles was thick dark cloud, he kept insisting and eventually i saw a tiny flicker of light. i said \"it's lightning\" he replied \"no it's not keep watching\" as i looked on it happened again, then again and again. it was just a little flicker in the clouds which repeated itself over and over. by now it was obvious that it had a uniformed pattern to the way it was lighting up. we called everyone else out after a little while and we stood and watched.\r\ni've no idea how long we were there until it stated to get bigger and we realized it was coming our way. it didn't just zoom over to us in a straight line, it kind of zigzagged, like it was following the contours of a valley or river maybe. but sure enough it moved to us at a steady pace. by this time we were all excited, i'm not sure what the children thought was going on. eventually it was above the field directly in front of the house and we'd moved up the garden by now. it was a spectacular sight. we couldn't see the actual craft because it was in the clouds but i remember thinking how low they were. this object was only a couple of hundred feet at most above us. it had a large round central light which was blue ish white and had lines of light that were rotating coming from the middle to the outer edge which also was lit but they were rotating in opposite directions. it looked like the underneath of a mushroom but through the clouds the lights were rippling and gave it the effect of being almost like a jelly fish. the lights in the cloud made them look like mashed potato, highlighting the different densities of the clouds. i seem to remember noticing a red light above the white lights but i'm not 100% sure on that point now.\r\ni can remember us all stood as a group in front of a small hedge that bordered the field that was in front of the house, to our left was a small wall and behind us there was a patch of ground with a chain linked fence bordering the property, behind the chain linked fence was a small copse of trees. as we stood there watching the craft moved over and was hanging directly above us. \"s\" had gone into the house to ring our housemates mark and \"jn\" to tell them but there was no one in so he left a message on the answer phone and came back out. while \"s\" was on the phone i'd noticed that the sheep in the field in front of us were all lying down and were quiet. i don't remember hearing any external noises at all. not even a hum from the craft above us.... just silence apart from our excited chatter.\r\nas we stood there something made me turn and look behind me. behind the chain linked fence there was another object, it was maybe 25 feet high and was a sphere. it was shrouded in a swirling mist and pulsed a grey ish white light... on... off every other second or so. i turned to everyone and said \"ooh look there's another one\" and everyone turned around, looked at it and said \"oh yeah\" with mild interest then promptly started looking straight back up at the one above us. it was gone from our minds instantly. at no point did anyone think \"oh [cms/tg/pd]! they've landed\"!!! \r\ni can remember standing with the hedge in front of me and my son to my right, we'd tried to tell the kids that there was nothing to worry about, the lights were from a tractor and were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds. this might have worked for a while.. but not for long. my son suddenly started tugging on my clothes and i looked at him, he was terrified. he said with his little ashen face and really wide eyes \"mummy, mummy, a hand came through the hedge and touched my foot. it was not my imagination... i saw it with my eyes\"! still nothing registered. i turned to \"s\" and said, \"come on, lets get them in they're getting scared\" so off we trotted back to the house to get them inside. \r\nas soon as we walked through that door everyone just went straight back to being normal... \"d\" and \"jn\" went in the living room to watch tv... and \"s\" started doing the dishes and the kids started playing. i was stood there agog! you'd think we'd just been watching fireworks and the display was over! i said to \"s\" \"i'm going back out\" and off i marched right to the bottom of the garden and stood right underneath it. now you would think that the fact that there was a craft on the ground and a hand coming through the hedge would have registered in my head... but it did not. i still can't get my head around that.\r\nso there i am on my own a good hundred yards from the house standing by myself underneath a craft that must have been 60 feet across completely oblivious to the one on the ground behind me, stood in front of the same hedge that a hand had poked through to touch my sons foot. i can remember thinking \"ok.. now what\"? i was awestruck and was full of wonder and amazement. suddenly i heard something running towards me from my right, the sound was of two feet running quickly... it sounded like when a child runs across their bedroom quickly to grab something after bed time.... whatever it was bumped into me, brushed across my back as it went dragging my jumper with it. i didn't look, i didn't think, i just ran for my life in absolute terror. i can only remember taking three steps and leaping from the raised bit of the garden onto the patio in front of the kitchen door but realistically that would not be possible as i was so far away. i think it's quite safe to say that was blind panic. i shot into the kitchen shivering and shaking and trying to tell \"s\" without letting the kids hear. he just turned to look at the clock on the cooker and said \"well you haven't been out there long so you haven't had any missing time\" like it was the most normal thing in the world. \r\ni was a mess. i made him shut the doors and lock them, close the curtains.. all that last defence stuff even though i knew that didn't make any difference!!! i can remember sitting in the middle of the bed shaking, not daring to even put my feet on the floor in case something was under the bed, i wouldn't even go to the toilet on my own.\r\ni can remember putting the kids to bed and hiding out in the bedroom, i left the door open so i could see the hallway and my sons bedroom door. \"s\" looked out of the bedroom window once and he didn't say it had gone which he would have if it had, he didn't say anything, he just closed the curtain again. then we went to bed and went to sleep.\r\nthe next day was dreadful. everyone was arguing, \"d\" was screaming at me in the kitchen while i was making some sandwiches, i turned and told her to shut her mouth or else... so she went outside and continued to carry on hysterically at me through the window. \"jn\" was being foul too. we were all in a state. \"jn\" and \"d\" went out in the car with the two boys and me and \"s\" went for a walk.\r\nwe walked into the village and saw someone stood outside the pub so we tentatively asked him if anyone ever saw lights in the sky in the area. he just laughed and said \"if you want magic mushrooms they grow in that field over there\". we didn't bother asking anyone else. we walked towards a hill we could see in the distance with a solitary gnarly looking tree on it. when we got to the top and looked around there was nothing to see for miles. we were hoping to see a town or anything at all because we thought 2well, maybe it was lasers from the roof of a nightclub or something\" hahaha! bloody good lasers if they were. as we stood there i felt something on my leg so i looked to see a massive ginger tom cat rubbing itself on me and purring it's head off! we were in the middle of nowhere! where the hell had the cat come from???? after realizing there was nothing to see we headed back to the house and got out maps. the nearest town was wrexham and that was 16 miles away! \r\n\"jn\" and \"d\" came back and the day grew worse, \"s\" ended up ringing to book tickets for the coach home, the thought of being in a car with those two was too much to bear. he booked the tickets and a taxi for 4.30 am and we sneaked off and left them there on their own. they'd been so horrible we didn't care, we didn't even leave a note.\r\nin hindsight i can see that this was their reaction to what had happened, but what i couldn't understand was why it was directed at me. my reaction to it was strong. i was terrified all the time. if i wanted to walk into a room and the door was shut i'd bang the door wide open fast so that if anything was hiding behind it i'd knock it senseless. i can also remember running up stairs and realizing the light wasn't on and running back down to switch it on before going back up there again. i couldn't sleep with the light off for years after this.\r\n\"s\" and i split up after a while, i'd turned into a nervous wreck. i got my own house with my son and started to build a new life. the only problem was, was that i couldn't stop thinking about it. some day's i'd think about it all day. then because i was living on my own i daren't go to bed. i had a small window above the door in my front room and i'd sit looking out of it for hours looking for them... i don't know where i went in my head... i just used to sit and stare. eventually i started to take amphetamines to stay awake all night and would still just look and stare. when my son was with his dad i was out partying all the time, anything to make myself feel good, and not be at home on my own. i took it to the extreme though, lost lots of weight, wouldn't eat... i think deep down i was trying to make myself disappear. no matter how much i tried to distract myself, every single day i saw those lights and heard those footsteps. it's safe to say i lost the plot and nearly lost my son. things got so bad i eventually decided i couldn't cope anymore and my son would be better off with his dad anyway and i took a lot of pills and hoped i'd die. i'd pretty much been hoping i wouldn't wake up ever monday after a heavy weekend. thankfully i did wake up, i made some new friends but was still a mess. one day i found out i was pregnant with my oldest daughter. that was what saved me. i sorted myself out and made a nice home, she was what i needed to keep me from continuing in this death slide on self destruct. my nights were taken up looking after her and i hardly thought about the ufos for a while.\r\ni first talked about this in 2005 on the 25th june..... that was the biggest thing for me. talking to other people about it and them taking me seriously. even though this event terrified me and forced a massive paradigm shift onto me, i would not go back in time and change a thing. actually maybe i would, maybe i'd stand my ground and look around to see what it was that touched me. maybe i missed an opportunity for contact? but then looking back on my life there are many strange memories that i have that seem to make sense to me now. i have a feeling this was not the first time this sort of thing had happened and maybe that's why i wasn't afraid to go back out on my own? somehow though i think that our behaviour that night was modified. not manipulated but just to the point where we weren't afraid. how come we all forgot about the smaller craft on the ground? why didn't the fact that my son saw a hand come through the hedge register as it should have? he told me recently that at first he thought it was part of the hedge moving because it looked like twigs but then as it came forward he saw it was a hand. he suffered terrible panic attacks as a child after this and when i tried to hold him he would say \"get off me your fingers are like twigs\" and once he scrabbled around on the floor in a panic saying to me \" i want my mum, where's my mum, can we go home now, i want to go home\" he slept with me a lot because he heard strange noises in his head and felt like he was falling backwards through his bed and if he did he would die. i've had this myself and it's hypnagogia. a common thing for experiencers.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

shooting stars when a strange object came into sight. it was travelling east and although it appeared to be moving slowly. it must of been very high as it was star size. so in reality it was probly moving quickly. it wasnt a plane because it was too high and it was orange without any flashes. it couldnt of been a chinese lantern as it was far too high and didnt seem to flicker at all.\r\n\r\ni would of mistook this object for a satalite or a piece of space junk etc. but there was something very strange about its movement that we couldnt believe. it seemed the be slowing down slightly and then speeding up slightly and also seemed to move from side to side (very minutely) as if it was drunk or something! it did move in a straight path but it seemed to be moving in a gentle irregular fashion. it continued east towards granthem and went out of sight in cloud. no sound seemed to come from the object.\r\n\r\nall of this information is 100% true and i would personaly never make a hoax

the night of july 14th, 2009 at approximately 9:50pm (21:50). i don't do drugs of any kind, and though on very rare occasions i have a drink or two, that night i hadn't touched any alcohol.\r\n\r\ni was laying on my back on top of a picnic table, near the foot of a very tall pine tree. my feet were pointing east, my head, west (the base of this picnic table is concrete and securely anchored to the ground, lengthwise, in an east to west (or west to east) orientation. it cannot be moved. i was staring straight up stargazing through the openings at the top of the tree. i suddenly felt disoriented, almost dizzy, as if i could feel the rotation of the earth or something. what was actually happening however was that three of the objects i had thought were stars were moving.\r\n\r\nthey were in a scalene triangle formation (shortest side facing north) and spaced quite far apart. i have no idea how to estimate exactly how far apart they were spaced. if they had been satellites i'd guess the two making up the shortest side of the triangle could have been many miles apart. if they were beyond satellite altitude, they could've been hundreds of miles apart. there's really no way for me to make an estimate. as to their altitude i can only guess. i've seen my share of \"satellites\" and these seemed at least that high if not higher. they were most definitely higher than any fixed winged aircraft could fly (at least to my knowledge). the were moving more slowly than most satellites i've seen though, and they were moving in that triangle formation in a line that ran from the nnw to sse.\r\n\r\ni kept my eyes on them until they were obscured by the denser part of the tree, but i estimated where they might appear again on the other side, and sure enough they eventually appeared again as they cleared the tree. i followed them until they disappeared at just above the horizon. they never altered formation. when i say \"disappeared\", i'm mean became to dim to see.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound that i could detect associated with these objects. it was a very calm/peaceful night. i could hear bats above my head using their sonar, it was that quiet. there was no breeze to speak of. all night long i could hear random planes (prop and jet), and helicopters as they'd cross the sky and disappear their sounds fading with them, and distant traffic come and go, as well as people talking in distant campsites from time to time. but most of the time you could hear a pin drop, and i heard nothing coming from these objects.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

mufon and i will have patience until i have mufons members present to witness this fleet of ufo's that can be seen by the naked eye on any clear night. last summer i tried communicated with one alien of one ufo and the alien litely laser me on my face as i sat down on my folding chair on the beach on jamaica bay howard beach queens new york 11414 near where i live adjacent jfk intntr airport. i spoke to this alien for about an hour then i went home nothing happen. the next day in the morning while i was lying in bed the alien litely laser me on my leg i'm not and i don't anyonewho is familiar to communicate with super-intelligince so my reading so much on the internet of aliens of being either friendly or vicious i just became leary and didn't continue to communicate. so now that why i became a mufon member i like to know if their are any members that can help me to communicate with this fleet of aliens ships that have a changing of the guard on every clear night sky flying out to the east like right over the atlantic ocean. i almost can't wait to have other members witness this happening. i guess i have to put in a report from every clear night that i view these ufo's until other mufons members verify my sightings thank you all for reading this and seeing is believeing gang. julio m barriere p.S. i notice the six questions and this is my first written report on july 14, 2009 like any night i go down to jamaica bay queens ny for years i go fishing in the bay and i witness on any clear night sky all these aliens ships. their follow me up and down the atlantic coastline. the first time i spotted the ufo was in broad daylight a couple of years ago it few by my bedroom window. i called my brother and told him the experience amd he said it impossible only you saw it and no one else in howard beach saw it. it was round with lights on the outer rim flashing the lights on and off. i had another experience when i came back from atlantic city n.J. this ufo just turn its light off and was hovering quietly right over a shopping mall as i was coming out of a pizza joint after i got the bus from a.C.N.J. i just stood in the parking lot looking at the saucer with the lights turn off and no noise for about a minute then went i started to move it move very slow but it was noticable about one to two thousand feet elevation and about the same distance from me. i didn't know what to do so i retire because i know these ufo's are on to me and i'll be seeing them for life it seems. its was obvious a ufo the first time i saw it it flew very low to be identified. i explain number four i don't know how to explain question no. five we live in a dangerous world and mankind is the most vicious most intelligenr animal and these aliens find it hard to deal with us so this is a big gamble and i'm a big highroller i think if these aliens meant any harm to me their would have abducted me and either experimented or mutilated me already i think. question number six myself and these aliens ships don'r lose sight of each other i can't wait till i have members of mufon and other to witness this ufo fleet thamk you for reading this i know even linda moulton howe a

facing the sf bay in sausalito and saw directly above me 2, then 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more diffuse/transaparent orbs/spheres/balls of light in the sky. they were diffuse balls of light zooming at very high speeds in circle formations that would intersect/criss-cross making the overall pattern look like figure eights in some places. also some of these orbs were popping in and out of my view in patterns of movements that were in shorter duration and appeared to me as not moving in circles. however i had the thought that these orbs were further away from me and i was only seeing one end of their trajectory or path. when i would shift my focus to the whole sky rather than trying to follow a couple of the orbs i then noticed that there were many more balls of light zipping all over the sky.  \r\n\r\nlast night was a beautiful night with a light cloud cover, patches of clear sky and stars peeking through. all day the clouds over the bay were unusual, multi colored, and diverse formations, several rainbows appeared in the late afternoon, early evening. a summer thunderstorm was trying to express itself. a few drops fell. it felt like a hawaii day and night. i often go outside at night to look over the sf bay and up at the stars.\r\n\r\nas i was watching the orbs/spheres last night i wondered if they were absorbing energy from the clouds. the phenomenon stopped when the cloud cover dispersed and the moon rose into the sky. i felt excited watching them, thrilled by their skill and translucence, speed, agility and mystery.\r\n\r\ni wanted to be analytical about what i was seeing, so at first i wondered if the lights were searchlights. i did not see any beams. i only saw the balls zipping and circling about. they were not the lights from normal aircraft. i wondered if they were being projected from a ship/boat but as the lights were above my head and my house in on a hill half a mile from the edge of the bay.  the fact that it went on for so long i found especially amazing. \r\n\r\ni am not a ufo buff. so i am not sure of the correct vernacular to use to describe what i saw. i have done an internet search wondering if anyone else saw what i saw. but i have found nothing thus far.

checking the photos my friend noticed something in some of the pictures i took with my camera (lumix 10 mpx). it appears to be a sphere above the forest but no to far from where we were. i must say that in the opening event there were no balloons thrown to the sky. the object was not visible with naked eye only on camera. this is the second time it happens to me to photograph a sphere in this

of light that were very bright and were not strobes.  i decided to film it at this point, as soon as i started to film the object it started to move. it seemed to go up and to the right, growing

the case as it had become so bright again. the motion was slow and smooth, it didn't make any quick movements.  after moving up and to the right for 10 minutes it then reversed the path of its motion

later a 2nd \"satellite\" like object was on a very similar orbital path that the iss was on. this object was also star like, but about one third the brightness of iss. it had a more bluish color than the brilliant white of the iss. the speed appeared to be similar or possibly a bit faster. the iss was still barely visible to the ne.\r\n  it seems that the iss wouldn't be intentionally put in the same orbit as a satellite, so could this have been a resupply craft ?  are resupply craft ever unmanned as it would take some pretty precise manuvering to get close enough to iss to transfer supplies ?  the shuttle is still on the ground due to storm related launch delays at this time.\r\n  we observed both objects through binoculars. we did not see any navigation lights or strobes as a plane

it sounded like an \"swooshing\" jet engine noise in the sky that abruptly stopped. i was looking around in the sky for the plane, when to the east i saw what at first looked like a brownish red balloon. when i realized it was too round to be a balloon, the object \"leveled off\" and seemed to reflect in the sun as rotated up and headed north-northeast. no sound was coming from the object. i called to my son, pointing and following the object in the sky. we watched as this object with no sound or a vapor trail sped out of view faster than anything i have ever seen. \r\n   i am a veteran

a small (or very high) bright white star-like object moving west to east, in a straight line and silently, on roughly the same plane as the planet i was observing but below the moon and approximately 75 degrees above the horizon. i instantly identified it, based my personal observations and previous experiences, as a near-earth orbiting object such as the shuttle that is currently in orbit or a satellite. after it had traversed about 3/4 of the viewable sky it made an instant 90 degree turn south and increased speed by at least 4-5 times it's original rate and disappeared behind the treeline. i felt very shocked and disoriented by the sudden course change as i had already dismissed it as a readily identifiable object. there is no question in my mind that this was not a meteor, conventional aircraft, satellite or terrestrial spacecraft. nothing i know moves like that. the entire event encompassed no more than forty seconds, but i stood, staring at the sky, for several more minutes trying to comprehend or rationalize what i had just seen. it didn't work. it was my first sighting and although i always believed i wanted to see a ufo before this happened, i almost wish i had not seen it at all. it has fundamentally changed what i thought i knew about life and the universe around me and i will never again look into the night sky without thinking about this event. ok, i
