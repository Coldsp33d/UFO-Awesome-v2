daylight. stopped to rest at wagner park in battery park city,which is across from the statue of liberty.  i was lying down on a bench looking up at the sky and an apartment building (approximately 30 stories)about 200 feet away when i noticed something out of the corner of my eye moving left to right.  before i could tell what it was, it flew (floated?) behind the apartment building.  a second later it appeared from the other side of the building and i called to my friend \"what the hell is that?\"  \r\n\r\nwhatever it was was round, all white, and solid looking. it had no lights and made absolutely no sound. i would estimate it to be about 15-20 feet in diameter and it must have been about 300 feet in the air because of the building height.  i would have needed a large grapefruit held at arms length away to hide it from view.  in five to eight seconds it was far in the distance heading south towards brooklyn. my guess was that it was traveling between 50 and 100 mph. unfortunately, we had no time to grab the camera-- it haunts me that we didn't get to take a photo.  \r\n\r\nmy friend thought she saw something spinning on the bottom of the sphere-- i don't remember seeing that. for most of the evening, we discussed what we had seen. definitely not a plane because it had no wings.  i thought it traveled much too fast to be a balloon and later checked the weather to confirm there was a slight wind blowing north-- the opposite direction it was traveling. so it had to be flying under its own power.\r\n\r\nthe thing that impressed me-- and i still think about--  is how smoothly and silently it traveled.  btw, this is my first time i've ever reported seeing a ufo. i would have doubted myself if my friend haruko wasn't with me to see it.  i've not reported this to any radio or tv station.  do you have any other reports?\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:12","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

on lake of the ozarks missouri to stay the night off the route.  i got the directions wrong to his cabin and was heading west on highway 54 at about 11:00 p.M. cst right on the outskirts of camdenton missouri when i noticed a large sphere on the left hand side of the highway above a commercial building (it was south).  i thought it was a large dealership type balloon at first, but it started moving very slowly across the highway in a zig zag style fashion.  i immediately slowed my motorcycle speed down to about 10 mph, as i was transfixed on the object and could not keep my eyes off of it.  i thought it was maybe a hot air balloon ride as i got closer and thought it was amazing that they had hot air balloon rides so late and so low to the ground in the ozark hills.  it was a spherical type object but was not static in shape...It was hard to identify what it was for some reason.  i couldn't see any type of hot air balloon basket, but for some reason i felt as if i was being watched while riding on the bike.  i kept wanting to pull my bike over to take a picture, but was too amazed at the object that i didn't for some reason.  it was large (the size of a small house) and floating about 150 foot above the ground...It was reddish colored with a glow (i thought the glow was the fire for fire for the hot air balloon).  it passed right over the top of me along the highway and was hovering along the right side of the highway (the north side).  i was trying to find a place to pull my motorcycle over so i could take a picture, but trees were getting in the way, but i could still see the object for another 10 to 15 seconds or so.  i finally found an open spot with no trees to take the picture and within seconds of getting off my motorcycle, the object faded extremely fast heading in a 45 degree angle.  it was literally gone within a few seconds, but there were no obstructions or trees for it to dissappear behind.  it couldn't have been a hot air balloon because of the exit speed and how low to the ground it was.  it was definitely sphere-like.  the whole experience lasted only a minute or two, but i have tried to rationalize what i saw almost every minute of the day since then (it was 6 days ago).  the professor's cabin who i was staying at knew what i had seen, as he had seen the exact same type of object hovering above lake of the ozarks 3 years ago in late fall 2006.  we are co-workers at a university...Both professors...I am a law professor and he is a marketing professor.  he told me that i could come forward with his information as well.  him and his wife both witnessed the object hovering above lake of the ozarks for about 5 minutes...They could not believe their eyes...And were also so transfixed that they didn't capture it on film.  he informed me that he kicks himself all the time for not taking a picture or video, but for some reason he was so mesmerized he didn't move.  the fellow professor and his wife never told anyone but relatives in the past...But him and i have talked for hours in the past 6 days to try to rationalize what we saw, but there is no rational known explanation of the object, how it moved, it's size, shape, and aura around it.  i have never been an avid ufo follower and was not looking for a ufo...It found me...And i completely believe and now intend to spend my summers investigating this phenomenon (as a professor my summers are fairly free).  i will help you in any way i can...I am 100% certain that i witnessed a ufo...As a lawyer and law professor i am very skeptical without evidence...But the evidence was literally about 150 feet right above in front of me...It was the most amazing thing i have ever witnessed in my life.  i will remain anonymous for now, but if for proof or other purposes you may request me to come forward, i may at some later time.  i also plan to get a tattoo of what i saw on my body...I do not have a photo, sketch or audio or video as of right now, but i intend to have one created for my tattoo.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

our local news team on wave tv3 that very night.  i never heard back.  here it is:\r\n\r\n\"me, my wife, and at least 4 other neighbors witnessed what can only be explained as unidentifiable flying objects over our neighborhood on the night of july 4, 2009!  over the course of one hour, there were 5 total sightings.  on the first wave there were two sighted back to back, then every 10 minutes or so, another one would come by.  my description is as follows:\r\n\r\n- the craft were bright orange in color.    on the approach side of the craft, it gave off a very bright, not foggy, but an almost laser precision cut orange glow, then as the vehicle would pass by, the glow dimmed a bit and appeared to morph into three nozzle-like dots, sort of like the afterburners on a fighter jet, yet still deep orange in color!\r\n\r\n- the vehicles appeared to be just a bit lower to the ground than a typical airline glide slope height, but not knowing how to judge the size of the vehicle, i couldn't give you a good estimate as to the size or distance of the vehicle. suffice to say, they flew lower to the ground than a typical ups or commercial airline flight pattern.\r\n\r\n- no sound was emitted by any of the vehicles, but a lot of fireworks were going off at the time, so it's hard to say, but i will say that with any standard aircraft, or helicopter, flying that low, some kind of sound should have been very noticeable!\r\n\r\n- my left hand neighbor got a call from a relative in mt. washington, ky, who asked her, \"did you see that big orange thing in the sky??\" she replied, \"yeah, we are watching them right now!!\"\r\n\r\n- our neighbor jackie got some video of the object, but didn't think it took, because when she had the object in her camera site, her camera went dead, or white, or some malfunction happened.  it wasn't until a few minutes later upon looking at her video again, that she actually did secure some shaky, yet stunning video of the object.\r\n\r\n- i set up my cellphone camera on standby and waited for the next pass.  sure enough, i got some footage, but, when i tried to review it, my phone's software reported \"unrecognizable file format.\", and the clips wouldn't play.  now, how does that happen?  i've shot, saved, downloaded and converted hundreds of videos off of that phone, and have never had trouble like this before!  i'm so glad miss jackie and miss laura was able to grab something!\r\n\r\n- i ran across the street and yanked yet another neighbor out of her house,\r\njust to see it and have one more eyewitness.\r\n\r\n- i called wave tv3 just to see if anyone else had reported these sightings.  no one had, but the lady on the phone had to go because she was due on the air for the 11 o'clock broadcast.\r\n\r\n-  i also called the bullit co. emergency services office, and while i was on the phone with her, another one flew over.  i was hollering and trying to explain what i was seeing as she was listening on the phone.  she said she'd send a car by, but no one ever showed up.  they probably thought it was a joke, or that i was drunk.  i was not.  i do not drink or use any kind of recreational drugs. i'm willing to be tested on that point in any way necessary to prove my sobriety.  my neighbors were sober and very lucid as well.\r\n\r\n-  the flight patterns and turns that these vehicles made would never have been possible by standard commercial or military aircraft.  i spent 4 years in the usaf, so i know what i'm talking about.  they eventually just flew off into the horizon, and ascended high up into the atmosphere until that orange glow dimmed out of sight.\r\n\r\nmy phone number is ### ### #### if you think this is news worthy.  as many people that were outside, lighting fireworks, i just know someone else besides us 5 people saw them, and that 1 lady in mt washington too!!\r\n\r\nlet me know if you received other reports!!  i have no idea what they were, but they were a spectacular and quite scary site to behold!!\"\r\n\r\njuly 04, 2009, from shepherdsville,

out.(they turn off that time every night because of a timer) we looked up at the stars because the sky was really clear. we all noticed a little bright light that looked like a star, only it was moving. we kept watching, and it kept moving in a slow straight path. we know we were watching it for about 4 minutes because our friend called right after, and that was at 10:45. while we were all watching, we saw it dart very quickly to the side..Like it was zig-zagging back and forth..But very fast, and then going straight again on its original path. it did that a bunch of times, then it started to fade in and out, and finally it faded out completely. there was no way it was a plane, and we are all certain of that. it was definitely a cool

at the sky and see these black dots{actually, first i saw the white puffs, then i noticed something was actually making the puffs, little black dots} flying formation and leaving behind them a series of puffs of smoke (best way to describe it) i could hear jet engine noise and piston engine noise, however we were really close to the groton-new london airport. so i can't tell if they were making any noise. we were on the way back, close to the water and we could see the airport across the water.\r\nmy daughter got very excited and thought they might be space ships, my wife didn't know what to think about them. i thought it might be a secret plane, but i'm puzzled at the slow speed and the fact that the dots seemed to make a new puff every 1-1/2 to 2 seconds, a slow interval i thought for it to be an engine. besides they seemed to be moving at the average pace of airliners when they are leaving contrails, when flying high.We then took a few photos and tried to play it off. however, my wife later encouraged my to report the experience since we had taken some pics.\r\noh! the dates on the pictures are wrong. i never took the time to enter the right date on the camera.\r\nas far as our right location we were headed north towards the picnic area. we were on the western most trail just before were the trail forks.\r\nthe objects seemed to be going roughly from west to

falling very fast.  it then became yellow and started flashing white at the nose.  it was falling in front of the sunset and then turned black. it then fell below the tree line.  she thinks it was at
