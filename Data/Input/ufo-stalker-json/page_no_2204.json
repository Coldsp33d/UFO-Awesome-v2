sight of a meteor when a dark gray object with 2 lights moved into my range of view. it was moving at a slow speed ( about as fast as a slow airplane) over the city of philadelphia art museum area. it was traveling from north to south directly overhead and had no sound. the lights were located on each end or to be more specific (in the middle of the circumference of the ends, underneath) they were not blinking and were as bright as the stars around them. the object blocked out the stars as it moved and you could see its gray silhouetted on the dark blue or black of the skies background. it was cigar shaped with a bulge in the middle on one side. the ends were rounded like a cylinder. it was moving sideways with the bulge leading, not long ways. there were no windows that i could see. at arms length it was the length of my thumb. the sky was clear, almost pristine except for the light pollution from the city. just before i lost sight of the object i observed panels opening and closing on the ends, condensing vapor coming off of the objects surface like it was getting very cold. it then appeared to tilt up and quickly faded into the darkness of the sky in a kind of haze. in my opinion it was as large as a commercial air plane but it���s hard to be all conclusive about its size or its distance when there is no point of reference. but the details i saw make me feel that it wasn���t that far away. i'm still looking up at where it was, facing south when another light appeared from the north traveling as fast as a shooting star, made a long 90��� turn without slowing down and shot off to the east. how do i feel about this event, well it rocks my sense of reality. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

mom���s vcr / tv after a power outage caused by a storm. we all tend to stay up late on weekends, and we wanted to get this done to have sunday free.\r\n\r\nas we drove west on interstate 70, and approached the i-435 interchange, i noticed a strange orange light low in the sky, to the south of i-70, and west of i-435. my wife asked if i saw the light in the sky, and i said i did. it was about the same color orange as the streetlights commonly used in metropolitan areas. later, my wife commented that it seemed more white at first, but i did not notice this.\r\n\r\nwe kept watching it as we got onto i-435 and proceeded south. the light seemed to be moving southward slowly. i tried to pull over to the side of the highway to get a better look, but was unable to do so due to traffic. i was finally able to pull over somewhere between 51st st and 350 highway.\r\n\r\ni grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look as my wife tried to get a photo. unfortunately, she wasn���t able to get a photo. i did get a pretty good look at the source of the light through the binoculars. it seemed to be almost a shield shape with a long spire pointing downward. it was a bright orange color, but not at all blinding. the long point seemed to be moving from left to right as if the object/craft/device was slowly rotating on its vertical axis.\r\n\r\ni was able to observe it for approximately 10 ���12 seconds, then it just faded out. it did not click off suddenly ��� like someone turning off a light ��� but more like someone used a dimmer switch, and went from bright to black in approximately 3 ��� 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nwe watched for a couple minutes, then started southward again. we saw the object one more time as we approached the vicinity of 87th st. it was much farther south, i would approximate roughly 8 miles or so. it almost appeared as if it had separated into three separate objects, but due to cloudy conditions, i cannot be entirely sure of this.\r\n\r\nwhen we first noticed it, it appeared to be 8 ��� 10 degrees above the horizon, and about the size of a small marble held at arm���s length. it did not change altitude significantly during the time we observed it, and did not exhibit any rapid maneuvers or changes in speed. it seemed to travel in a southerly direction, with no deviation in either speed or direction.\r\n\r\ni did not experience any feelings of fright, or anxiety, mostly it was wonder and fascination. i have included a photoshop rendering of what i observed as closely as i can remember it.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

(let me just say a week and a half ago i saw the same thing around 4 in the morning, i told my mom about what i saw but she did not believe me. it was a very bright light, white bright light and had a small red light above it moving around, it would be there than vanish than come back.) anyways back to last night. so i saw something moving in the sky when i looked up. the way it was turning was so quickly and smoothly that there was no way it could be a plane or a helicopter. it made no sound at all. it had 2 blue lights and one red light. i screamed for my mom and she came running out of her room to where i was, i looked up at the object, oh yeah and i couldn't make out the shape because the lights were too bright and it was still a little too dark, anyways, my mom got over there and at this point it was just flying straight and looked pretty normal. my mom was like you called me out here to look at a plane in the sky. i didn't say anything and we both kept staring at it. all of the sudden it started moving up and down like it would drop 100 feet and than go back up again way to smoothly and easily to be anything like a helicopter or plane, it was turning very quickly also, like it'd be going in one direction and in a split second it'd be going the opposite way. me and my mom were speechless. i looked at her and asked her to explain what that could possibly be and she just laughed. she did not have any idea what that could possibly be. she started nervously laughing. we watched it for another 5 minutes and it started flying away towards the west and all of the sudden it completely vanished. about 2 seconds later it showed up in a completely different part of the sky. so it vanished and than popped up on the opposite side of where it vanished. impossible thing for a plane or helicopter to do. my mom looked at me and was like how in the world could it do that. we stayed out there for about 10 minutes watching this thing vanish and come back and do turns and smooth flips making no sounds. than one of our neighbors came out who lives below me. he looked up at me and my mom staring into the sky and was like what are you guys looking at. we didn't say anything so he looked up in the direction we were looking. he was like oh a plane..? the object was again flying straight so looked kinda normal. than it started doing those 180 turns and going up and down the guy stared at it and pulled out his camera phone and was freaking out. he tried to take a picture but of course it didn't come out good. being a cell phone camera. i can't even take picture of a huge full moon on my camera phone. anyways, it started getting far away and vanished behind trees. the guy ran out into the parking lot on the phone telling his friends what he saw, while looking for it. my mom still didn't know what to say, and i went inside to call friend and tell her. i came back out and my mom was still staring in the sky, i looked up and the object was gone but now smaller lights that were further away began to pop up in the sky out of no where. they were sparkly to the point where they looked like they were on fire. again with red and blue lights around them. i don't know what this was. it was definitely not a plane or helicopter or a jet or anything like that because those can't vanish and pop back into the sky or morph around like that. it was both fascinating and a little disturbing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"08:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18058,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2017496,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07132009-0023","longitude":-117.3773834,"occurred":1247456700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,

heading west on us 50. when i first noticed the object, i was approximately eight miles east of town. the object was to the northwest, brighter than venus, and not very high in the sky, maybe 15-20 degrees of elevation, barely above the hilltops. at first, i thought it was a plane with its landing lights on approaching the gunnison airport.\r\n\r\nafter a few minutes of watching it and watching the road for oncoming traffic and wildlife, i noticed that the light had an oval shape, and that it was indeed getting larger. because i was moving, i couldn't tell for sure if it was too, so i pulled onto the shoulder and stopped. yes, it was moving, and moving east at a fair clip, about the speed typical of aircraft around an airport. it then began to arc to the south, actually heading almost in my direction. and, it kept getting larger, and the shimmering more pronounced. \r\n\r\nat this point, i still thought: a plane. in fact, on the trailing edge, a reddishness, not a distinct point, but a reddishness was visible intermittently, though the reddish color was not cycling regularly, just visible now and then.\r\n\r\nas it continued arcing in my direction, it grew to an amazing size, say, 20-25 percent as wide as a full moon, and the larger it became, the more it shimmered, but still i thought it was a plane coming in for a landing, or, maybe, i wanted to believe that. i'll confess: a light that bright and big, and arcing in my direction unsettled me just a tad.\r\n\r\nwhen the object was about 60 degrees overhead, it abruptly disappeared. at that point, i began to wonder about its being a plane. had the intermittent reddishness actually been landing lights, at the distance it seemed to be from me, fairly close, i would have seen the running lights. no running lights were visible. the object had vanished.\r\n\r\ni pulled back onto the highway immediately, thinking that maybe it had dropped behind a nearby hill, though, i didn't really see how that could have been possible because i'd been watching it intently. i guess it's the rational mind looking for a rational explanation.\r\n\r\nit was nowhere to be found, and at that point i became confident that it was \"unidentifiable,\" at least by me. first, very few aircraft land at the gunnison airport at night, and no large aircraft land at night. second, i've lived here 28 years, and have never seen any landing lights as bright or as big as this object. third, as i approached town, the runway lights were off.\r\n\r\nand, this is the second such object i've seen this year in this valley. on march 16. at approximately 10 p.M. with clear and starry skies, a friend and i were returning from a meeting in crested butte, when i saw a light that at first i thought was an outdoor light on a house up on the slopes of red mountain. i watched it wondering why i'd never seen such a bright light before on my numerous trips between gunnison and crested butte. then, i noticed that it seemed to be  above red mountain. i pointed it out to my friend who confirmed it was above the mountain. it was night, the road was a bit snowy, and we were ready to be home after a long meeting, so we didn't pull off the highway. it wasn't as bright as last wednesday's object, though it was about as bright as venus. in fact, i thought maybe it was venus (the rational mind again), though i knew venus probably had set.  we watched it for 3-4 minutes before it too disappeared, i mean clicked off abruptly.\r\n\r\ni am an amateur astronomer, and i've been watching the skies for more than 50 years. i've seen satellites, the iss, jupiter and venus, meteors, several sky-crossing fireballs, aircraft of all sorts, balloons, and yes, geese. lol  i've no idea what either of these two lights were, and i've never seen anything in the sky as large as last wednesday's object, or as bright. \r\n\r\noh, i definitely had a premonition before seeing the light in march. and after wednesday's light, i feel like i will see another, and, crazy as it sounds, maybe more than just see another.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

begins.  friday evening july 10th i was riding my bike on the mesa (on blm land) near where i live.  it was dusk and the sunset was behind me as i headed east on a dirt trail.  suddenly, in front of me by approximately 20-25 ft, hovering at ground level, a 6' x 6' semi-translucent form which had a wavy appearance (like water) crossed the path, heading south into a deep ravine/arroyo next to the path. i called out, \"who's there?\" to know one.  the slight color of this mass was a deep red, but the color was barely visible.  i stopped my bike at the point it crossed and looked over into the arroyo, but i didn't see anything and as the drop-off into the arroyo is quite steep, i didn't want to get too close to the edge.  as i have seen 2 other different types of ufo's (solid mass) i quite didn't know what to think of this.  still, i knew i'd seen something.  the following evening (7/11/09) at 9:30pm, i had just pulled out of my driveway and and was about 200 ft. east of my house going about 15 mph, when the same object was caught in my headlights - same size, still \"ululating\" like a wave w/ a tinge of the dark red color, crossing the dirt road in front of me by about 25 ft again, this time heading north towards the blm (bureau of land mgmt property) into the darkness.  outside of my headlights, you could not see it. i was surprised to have seen this \"thing\" twice and my experience from the prior evening was validated. both times the \"thing\" seemed to take no notice of me and therefore did not stop or do anything other than go on its way. i've returned to the places where i saw it and saw no evidence the \"thing\" had adversely affected the terrain.  lastly, these events occurred w/in 1 mile from each other.

want to report a stange event that happened during the summer of 2007.This is not about a sighting of an object in the sky.Its more about an unusual person i met during the coarse of conducting a cash business i operate on the streets of toronto,canada.This would be a tourist business called the \"rickshaw\".Its a two wheeled cart that seats between 3-4 people the driver pushes the cart forward from behind a bar that extends out from the wheelhubs.This is done with no assistance from engines or chain pulleys.I would like to paraphrase this report to stop and make an honest admission of sorts. i am fascinated by the ufology phenomenon,i must have read at least two dozen books on the subject:j allen hynek,stanton friedman,whitley streiber,david jacobs and bud hopkins.Ive evan gotten a hold of a book by eduard j. ruppelt who published a paperback in the late fiftie,(ive read it twice) he wrote of his experiences/perceptions as head of project bluebook.  on a night in mid  july 2007 i was covering what is called in the biz a \"letout\" of the rock group the police,(which helps pin point the exact date;however i dont have that info at this time!!)upon reflecting on this encounter i realized that a series of incidents contributed to this situation.I hope the following details do not seem overly convaluted i think they carry a certain importance towards the understandind of this situation.     that day was going badly for me because the day before i had gotten into a brutal physical confrontation with another driver for reasons that are unimportant to this reportage.The fighting left me sore and tender in the facial area and  most importantly emotionally drained.For this reason it set up a crucial circumstance for the unfolding of this encounter.That is the breaking of a basic pattern related to \"rickshawing\" which is in order to solicit your services you typically face and call out to the public.Instead because i was in  quiet and uncommunitative state not only was i not talking i was standing behind the backside of the rickshaw blocked from view by the passerbys.Not surprisingly the other runners picked up their rides and i was the only one left.Resigned to the fact that his day was not going to be very profitable.I then heard a ladies soft voice from directly behind me asking if i was available for hire,startled more because i didnt want to let this opportunuty slip thru my fingers i turned quickly to see her but she turned away just as fast to move around the front of the shaw cross the bar and get herself seated.From what i could notice of her profile was that she was kind of 'plainish' shoulder lenght brown hair,basically cut. she might have been no more than forty years of age. her tunic like top was like a sweater and their was something peculiar in the tone of the purplish colouring of the cloth,what little time i had to observe of her their was something you couldnt quite define in any obvious way.As this is happening she asks to be taken into the downtown area whereever i think is the best spot.Again hard to define yet something that stands out just enough you can notice it vaguely.The timber in her voice had this kind of resonance it carried a kind of 'hypnotic cadence' to it that makes you want to agree with whatever is being said.The accent could have been some sort of obscure easteran european slant to it.As i pull the bar around to position it for the street entrance another lady about ten years younger gets into the rickshaw,i give her a quick glance she seems normal enough.Now its my turn to cross over the bar normally i'd kneel down with my back to my riders then pick up the bar.Then walk/run forward.But  because i was'nt inside the bar of the rickshaw like normally,i was going to kneel down grab the bar then twist around and then start forward.As i go to pick up the bar i'm looking at the ground but my head is almost level with my passengers.Whithin my peripheal vision i can notice something most unusual about the first lady.Her eyes are enormous and pitch black with no white matter in the socket area what so ever .The impact of this observation is momentous for reasons related to my understanding stated before hand of this report.The obvious features of her face could very well mean but one thing,i was standing a few feet away from some sort of alien being.A moment in time i  thought i would never believe to be a reality.It's one thing to read about it,fantasize about it.It;s impossible to describe the kind of exhilaration that takes hold of you.So instead of turning around to grip the front section of the bar to start moving forward,i put the bar back down and stand up to let her know that i am interested in talking/confronting her.I lock eyes with the 'strange lady',for about twenty seconds or so.She and i just checked each other out and it was just an amazing thing you coudn't escape the fact the fact that behind or immersed within the dark lens of the eye cap was a cornea and pupil .One thing you can tell about someone when you first meet them is a sense of intelligence they give of thru the eyes its  something that is visually apparent that gives you a strong impression of their awareness or perceptivity,(thats how i understand it anyways).If their is one thing that was alien about this person was the intensity level of that sense.It was 'astronomical'.(ha,ha),that is conveyed from this persons eyes.Her eyes exuded an animated cat like zeal and ferocity.,but their was no central slit running down the middle of the pupil the way a feline would have,it just felt that way,then their was these squiggly  lines shooting out from the center area.The pupil itself i have no memory for.In one respect their was  a

waiting for the late fireworks display. at about 10pm i saw two lights to the west or northwest, moving rapidly in a straight line across the sky from north to south, one behind the other. what was most odd was their erratic speeds: the second light kept speeding up and slowing down, like it was playfully chasing the first one; it would nearly catch up to the first, then slow or stop and fall back. i'd guess the sighting lasted about 30 seconds before the lights disappeared behind trees.\r\n\r\nthese lights were not bright -- the sky was very illuminated from the city lights, and only a couple of the brightest stars were visible, and the lights i saw were about the same brightness as those stars. i did not get any sense of their color. they seemed to be at a high altitude and moving at a good clip, but the erratic speeds made made their motion quite distinct from planes or helicopters or satellites.\r\n\r\ni had a flip cam with me and attempted to film it, but nothing is visible

i was headed north between booker texas and elmwood oklahoma.  the skies were very dark and very clear.  i was going about 60-65 mph. off to my right or east, i noticed a bright light, which i thought was a planet i had sort-of identified earlier when i was headed east.  it took me a second to realize that the light was brighter than the planet and to the north of the where the planet should have been and was.  i checked my mirrors, and down the road in front of me for traffic, there was none so i looked to my right or east, and again looked at the object for a few seconds and realized it was moving across the star-field behind it.  it looked like maybe a small airplane with a landing light on, by far the brightest thing in the sky, but the light was just a solid whitish light.  it was headed what looked to be straight south, and it was a little north of straight east of me.  it also appeared to be one to three miles from me and maybe less than a mile above ground level, don't know hard to tell.  i am about half-way between booker and the oklahoma state line.  i decide to stop to watch it, i'm not in a hurry and i guess it got me curious.  i slow down and stop and as i am stopping in the road i notice the light has been getting brighter, just 10 or 15 seconds in this whole deal has elapsed now, and a lot is happening at the same time. this thing is getting very bright, like streetlight bright at about a block or two, i'm riding a motorcycle and trying to look up at the sky and trying to stop at the same time without getting run-over.  okay now for the good part.  i have stopped in the road and between me getting stopped and glancing back and forth at the object this thing turns and accelerates. dramatically. unbelieveably fast.  it goes what appears to be about a 45 degree angle up and maybe due south-east, so now its headed up and away from me, and it got so bright for an instant that it might have lit up the ground around the area.  it looked like about half as fast as a shooting star would appear, super fast but watchable.  it accelerated from what appeared to be about 150 mph., to maybe 50 thousandish mph or faster.  just guessing only, yes speculation.  it stayed on the exact trajectory for about 15 seconds and i watched it until i had to look to each side of it to be able to see it.  as it was dissappearing from my sight it appeared to be curving to the south a little, maybe a optical illusion,  its possible the thing was now maybe satellite-high, or higher, thats what it looked like as it was dissappearing, maybe a dim satellite.  there was a jet in the area that might halve seen this, north of me and headed west. the moon rose exactly as this was happening if you want a exact time.  and as i was about to take off a south to north or north to south cant remember...Shooting star went across the horizon directly where i was watching. thats it.  this  all seemed matter of fact to me even though its the weirdest-coolest thing i've ever seen.  thought i'd tell some-one who might be interested. thanks. \r\np.S. had earplugs in and left bike running never heard anything.  thanks.","distance":"Over One

1-2 in the morning.\r\n     i got up and looked out the window to try and put an object to the noise (was it a horse caught in a fence or kicking at a barn wall, fire works? what was it) i didn't see anything so i went back to bed about 1-2 minutes later we heard it again but this time their were three different rounds of ammunition so my husband got up and looked out the window and said it was coming from fort lewis, he went back to bed a minute later it went off again and i got out of bed and my husband got out of bed we went to two different windows and looked outside, i had to view that was pointing to the fort i saw \"tracers\" from the ammunition that was being shot from fort lewis, i thought that was odd, again in 9 year i have never seen tracers off of ammunition from the fort.\r\n      i continued to look outside and saw a blue spherical ball of light in the sky darting around and zig zagging through the sky it was very apparent that someone (weather it was fort lewis or a private party i don't know) was trying to \"shoot down\" this thing from the sky.\r\n      the object was in the sky for about 10 seconds (that i saw) and it disappeared, just vanished once it
