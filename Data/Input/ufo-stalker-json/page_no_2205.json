been barking for about 10 minutes, which is not normal unless there is an animal in the yard. i saw a gigantic orange/yellow glowing sphere hovering about six blocks away at about 200-300 feet above the ground.  i just thought \"that is weird,\" and kept watching it for about two minutes and trying to make my dog stop barking.  he was very agitated.  then it started moving in my direction very slowly and i got a little nervous, but couldn't move because i was so mesmerized by it.  as the object got closer i could see that there was some kind of structure to it that looked like a dark silvery color under the brightly glowing light. there was a weird static electricity feeling in the air and i felt that they were watching me and maybe probing my mind or something.  the light from the object did not shine on anything, which was very odd considering how close it was to the tops of the houses. i called to my wife but she didn't hear me.  \r\n\r\nit moved right over my head and i was thinking \"this is a ufo!\" and i reached for my gun instinctively, but i had taken my holster off earlier. i still could not move away - i think i was watching it for about a minute or two, then watched it move on and away several blocks, then it just shot up at a 45-degree angle and it was gone in a second!  i was very shaken up by this and actually started shaking.  it was at that moment i knew that i had seen a real ufo and it was nothing from earth. i looked around to see if any of my neighbors were out and they weren't.  then i went inside the house to get a beer and noticed that it was 2:12 am.  that was too long - i was not outside that long and i don't know why the time was so much later.  at first i thought that whatever it was messed with the electricity in the house and caused the clocks to go haywire, but they were all the same time. i tried to get my wife up to talk to her about it but she was too tired. i went to sleep a few minutes later and slept in late this

anyone at work know about it or i could risk losing my job.    \r\n\r\n\r\nnote from field investigator:  i took this report by phone.  witness refused to make a report to mufon.Com on his own. he wants no further contact.  i told him to call back if anything else happened.

because of the way it moved and how high in the sky it went in a short amount of time. it then went into the clouds and seemed to go out of sight for good.  i have seen balloons flying over before and we also have a lot of planes and helicopters (due to a small airport being nearby)--but this was not like any of those.  this hovered for about ten minutes, then rose up much higher in the sky till it

enjoying the night sky, listening for animals and watching the sky, enjoying the fire and the very nice night. we do this often. he has never seen a shooting star, but is always looking for them. he said dad there is one. he is 5 1/2 years old. i looked and saw a star. then i noticed it was moving. i started to think yea he finally saw one, when i began to realize this was still moving. it came in from \"up\" direction like a shooting star, but it was travailing much more slowly. it was along ways away and travailing extremely fast, but very slow compared to a shooting star! we had an extremely light scatted high attitude weather tonight. the clouds were extremely thin and way up. this thing was behind them and travailing towards us. it came from north to slightly northeast of us. it was heading at a direction nearly towards us, which would make it traveling \"down\" and south to slightly south east. it continued to get brighter and brighter. color was white like a star only brighter. it had a slight halo effect around it but i believe it was from the very thin very high altitude clouds it was flying thru.\r\nit continued to head our way for probably close to a minute or a little more. i hollered at mom to come see this. me and the boy ran to the front of our place to watch it. it started to get dimmer. it was still coming down and getting dimmer; when it stopped coming down and made an instant 90* turn, to fly parallel with the earth. thats when i hollered at the boy: get mom, get mom, get your mom, get mom, damnit get your mom, get your mom, damnit i dont want to be the only one too see this thing, get your mom right now!\r\nthe object flew away from us in a north to northeast direction and continued to get dimmer and smaller until it dissapeared. by the time mom finally made it out, it was no longer visible to the naked eye. i was standing beside my truck when it went out. it was at that moment i remembered i had binoculars in my truck. i dug them out and continued to try and see this thing. when i looked where it dissappered i saw 4 to 6 (more or less),tiny but bright lights heading away from me.  1 to 2 of them dissapeared almost immediately. they were in a diamond shape formation (for lack of a better discription),and the area between them was real wavy looking like looking thru water.  2 more of them dissapeared within a few seconds. the other 3 turned west and continued to travel across the sky. the front one of them went out after maybe 30 more seconds. one of them was a little higher and quite aways ahead of the last one. the last one had a vapor trail coming out of it and was blinking. the last one looked different. i wondered if the last one was a fighter jet chasing the rest of them??? all of them dissapeared in a north to northwest and a distinct \"up\" direction. anyway the rest of them grossly outran the last one. i watched it dissapere as it neard the north horizon. it was very far north of me, traveling in a west to north west direction.\r\ni spent the last 2 to 3 hours searching the skys and did not see anything out of the ordinary, except alot of airplane flying around tonight. the airplanes were clearly and unmistakeably different at any speed or distance from what i saw coming in from outer space!\r\nwether this was an alien craft or some kind or an unknown anomaly, i could not tell you. i can tell for sure and absolutely for certain, what it was not. i have absolutely no clue what it

to watch the july 4th fireworks show that was due to begin at 2200 est. at the time of the sighting we had been at the beach for a few hours. the sun had set and it was dark but not completely dark. the sky was mostly clear with just a few wispy cirrus clouds and a full moon. we were looking at the night sky in the east southeast direction of the sky when we noticed a glowing fire red, oblong, cigar shaped object in the sky. we both noticed it at the same time. it was hard to miss.  at first we thought it may have been a glowing ember from fireworks but it lasted much longer then a firework would last and also there weren���t fireworks in our general vicinity. it was traveling at a very slow speed in more like a floating fashion. the first thing that i noticed right away was the fact that there was no flashing lights on the object, as all airplanes must have. we could not discern any audible sound from this object. at no time did this object make any erratic moves or deviate from its flight path. it seemed the center of the object had more of a concentrated light then the rest of it. we were able to witness the object glide through the night sky for about ten minutes or so. there were scattered families on the beach and we did not observe anyone else commenting on the object in the sky. when we first noticed the object we were both baffled by it, and tried to identify what it could be and neither of us could draw any conclusions. i have never witnessed an object flying in the sky that did not make a sound. i grew up in the flight path of a major airport in ny and was in the air force so i am very familiar with the sound of both commercial and military jets.  i was able to take three pictures of the object. two of the pictures i took depict the object as a red ball but the third picture more closely resembles what we actually witnessed. it was very hard to focus on it due to the minimal light at the time. after about ten minutes the object either disappeared from our line of site or just disappeared. the reason i am submitting this report was due to the fact that i read an article online with a video of the same one that we may have witnessed

not the only one to sse what i saw and i definitely won't be the last. but i believe my side of the story is unique because i was one woman standing alone among men chasing something we till this cannot forget or explain. at 9 p.M. on july 7 2009 i sat in the living room of my boyfriend of over one year enjoying a movie, when he recieved a call from a close childhood. when he when outside to take the call he was urged by his friend to look up in the sky. there he saw something extrodinary a green orb-like object hovering in air a mere hundreds of feet up. he ran inside and coaxed me outside. i looked up and saw something i never imagined i would've seen my whole life. we watched the object in shock. then we realized in was moving. we quickly gabbed a digital camera and jumped in my boyfriend small vw bug. we drove to his friend's house anxiously. when we got out of the car the object was still in our site. we urged his two friends to get in the car but they didn't want to lose of it. at that time we hopped back. though i was very uneasy and unassure of the situation my boyfriend insisted we try to get as close to it as possible. we drove with the object in sight and stopped when we felt we were near. we got of the car it was at this moment we realized the green object was right above us. for once i am not going to put on the tough girl front i try to in life and tell the truth. there had been few occasions up to this point in which i had ever been so frightened. i grew more nervous by the second. i was so scared it was difficult for me to even look at the object. i only knew two things at this point this thing was definitely real and it was like nothing i had ever seen before in my life. i got in the car quickly and begged my boyfriend that we leave. after a few minutes he got in the car an headed back to his friends house. the four of us me, my boyfriend, and his friends got in the car and returned to the street where we had been directly under the object. we all jumped out of the car barely before it stopped moving. and then we saw we weren't the only ones. there in the middle of the street was a middle aged man. he had pulled his car over with his two small children and his wife. he was looking up at he object in pure amazement and confusion. it was at this time a woman and her children imerged fom the house we were parked in front. we later found out that she had heard her dogs baring and went outside to see what was happening. this is when everything started to happen. all at once we were all on the phone calling every close neighbor we could. soon of few of our friends began to arrive. most of them had excuses \"its a plane or a helicopter.\" they were quickly silenced when the object began to move unlike any human-made machine we had ever seen before. it zig zagged erratically up and down, side to side at a rapid speed. i was completely amazed,excited and to be perfectly frank extremely scared. i began taking pictures. i took over a hundred pictures that night. and a young man who was there caught the strange object on video. but none of the photage could even slightly conpare to seing the object hovering in mid air. the people and families that had stopped to see what was going on grew tired and began to leave. we asked everyone there if they had a telescope. only on young man did but he lived far and refuse to go get it from his home. so we tried our best to keep a steady view of the object through a pair of binoculars. it was difficult since at this point my hands were a bit shaky, from a mixture of excitement in fear. but still we all could make out the same thing. a rice shaped, oval like , glowing green object hovering in the sky. at this point there were only few of us left three young men, and myself. four of the witnesses had left to retrieve the telescope. that when the object began to move again. not being to let go of what we were seeing we all jumped in the car and followed the object over to the next street. thats when another two cars stopped near us. five young men emerged from the cars and stared at the object amazed and skeptical. we shared our story with them and thats when the four young men arrived with the telescope. we tried but could not get the object into focus. it was at this moment that a police officer arrived he emerged from his car. here we were a dozen teenage boys and one girl camped outside a perfect strangers house with a telescope. you can imagine we assumed the worse. but we couldn't accept being force to leave. so though we knew he wouldn't believe us we pointed out the object to the officer. and to the suprise amd relief of everyone he saw it and he believed. this officer then stared in wonderment and looked through our pair of binoculars. searching his mind for any excuse he could feed us. but in the end he couldn't deny hat he had no explanation for what we all had seen. he quickly called in the report and left. a little after 12 a.M we were tired, hungry , and the object was nearly out of sight. so we all reluctantly decided to go home. i may never know exactly what i saw that night. but i know i will never forget it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":18010,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.3608885,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07112009-0002","longitude":-80.0767684,"occurred":1246950000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,

that i'll cherish forever...My nephew and neice were having their graduation party at the pavillion of the lake where i took the photo. this lake(lake granger-willis creek park) is located about 20 miles south/southeast from my current physical address. my son and 3 other children had been begging me all day to take them down to the water so they could swim. i finally took them all down to the water when it became cooler that evening. just me, my son and the three others went down to the water, which was about 50 yards from the pavillion, down the bank that leads to a tiny(non-swimming) beach area. as they were playing in the water i decided to take a couple of pictures of them, while just sitting there in my lawn chair.The kids were about 10-12 feet out in the water from the bank. it was still pretty sunny and hot and the lake was very calm. in the picture you can see the kids are playing with and around a lot of logs and sticks, due to the low lake levels because of the hot weather and drought here in texas.I only took two pictures of the kids with my cell phone camera. i never heard nor saw anything while taking the pictures and as you can tell from the picture, the kids don't even notice what's behind them ! later that night i was looking through the pictures i had taken throughout the day and realized i caught an unidentified object over the water of the lake !!! i've held the picture for over a month now because i had no idea who to contact and who i could trust. i e-mailed the picture from my phone to my computer and saved it in my hard drive (personal copywright). as i zoomed the picture of the disk to a very large size on my computer, i noticed the disk seems to have large green and red lights, which are very bright to the right side of the disk.... please contact me asap for any further details you may have or need ...Thanks so much for taking your time to evaluate my photo!!! delia

time was in bed with me .I always kept the bathroom light on and left the door open therefore the light would shine in at the foot of my bed and you could see in the room very well. on this night i couldnt fall asleep and was laying on my back.My son was sleeping beside me it was about 12:00 at night. i happened to look down to the foot of my bed and thought i was seeing things or my eyes were playing tricks on me.There was a small reptile like being with a very large head and hugh roundeyes staring at me and it looked very agressive. the eyes were not almond shaped but large and round. they looked like the eyes of an animal when light shines on them at night.I felt as though i was being held down against my will i could not move,speak or scream. i was terrified. i could not even call out to my husband it felt as though the force of gravity was holding me down on the bed. this thing moved in a strange way not as a human but like when the picture changes on tv.Extremely fast.It went from the foot of the bed to the side of the bed in about 2 seconds flat. finially i broke away from the bed and ran out of the room screaming for my husband there was no way that thing could of gotten out of the room yet it was gone.This incident happened to me back in 1975 and iv told this story many times over the years and to this day i still think about it and wonder what it was. however

other people were standing in her driveway. the street was full of people and we were not the only ones to see the object. as we were standing there, out of the corner of my eye i caught an object appear to the northeast just above the tree line. from where we were standing the object was approx. a 1/4 mile from us so it was probably 100-200ft. above the trees. at first we thought that it was a firework burning out and falling back to earth. after watching the object for a second we realized that it was holding a steady altitude and direction. the flight path was very controlled and proceeding from my right to left and lasted a minute or two. the object was a sphere that was bright orange color with a hint of red and was flickering slightly. the object seemed to slow for a seconds in its flight path never losing altitude and then curved off to the right heading directly north. we could see the object gaining altitude and speed as it went off into the distance until it disappeared. as you can imagine we were baffled. my mother lives in the flight path to the airport in town and planes fly over everyday but you can here and plainly see them. this object did not make a sound or have any familiar lights on it to signal it was an airplane. that same night about an hour before the sighting a helicopter even flew over at low altitude and we could distinctly hear and see it. the strange thing is the object returned about 10min. later in the same exact spot it appeared the first time i saw it. it held the same flight path that it did the first time and the object looked exactly the same, with no sound as well. the object slowed for a few seconds and then speeded up again to take off in the northern direction it had left the first time. both sightings were exactly the same only about 10 min. apart. we thought the first sighting was strange but when it came back and how it got back so fast from the direction it left was baffling to us. no airplane or helicopter i have ever seen around here has that kind of shape, color, or ability to fly like the object did. i would say at least 10 people saw the object both times it flew by and nobody could explain what it was and none of us had ever seen anything like it. we were all excited as well as confused by what we had seen that night. the object flew off to the north until it was out of view and we did'nt see it again. this is the first experience i have had like this with a unidentified object in the sky. to my knowledge there are no aircraft that travel the way this one did nor do any look like the object we saw that night. it is possible that it was some kind of debri burning out but the flight path, speed, and the fact that the object returned led me to believe that it was something else in the sky. i was not the only one to see the object and there are several people who saw the same thing i did and were as stunned as i was. i cannot explain what we saw but i do know that it is nothing i have ever seen in the sky before then.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

standing outside in my garden as usual with my mother. suddenly she pointed at the sky and asked me what the bright red orange thing up on the horizon was. it was emitting a radiating beam of light like a star or some similar object, hovering above buildings in the distance. it was like a bright orange fireball. \r\n\r\nit started moving from side to side above the buildings. it was close to the city's television tower and a big chimney from a coal-powered heat-providing station, so that the first thing my mother asked was whether it was some kind of tower identifying light. it moved from the left side to the right, stopping to hover slightly above each building, then continuing its motion. after it had gone to the right side it started moving backwards, then stopped and made a slight upward movement and then started moving extremely slowly. i ran around the house looking for a camera, and when i came back it was gone. the whole sighting lasted for no more than five minutes, although i have no idea for how long it was actually hovering there.\r\n\r\none rather strange thing that i might add is that immediately before i actually saw the ufo i felt an impulse to go downstairs to talk with my mother. it might be completely unconnected, but it just seems strange that one minute i was engaged in one kind of task and the next i felt i had to go into our garden. i usually feel really scared when i see something like that out of the blue in the sky, but when i saw the light i actually felt somehow relieved, and when i started writing this i had a feeling of real ease and happiness. these might be just my own emotions unconnected with ufo activity, but then again...
