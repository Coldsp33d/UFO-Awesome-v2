jen was starting to swerve a little, and looked away to correct the car in the right lane. we watched as the ball of light then split into 5 or 6 separate pieces! each piece started to go in it's own direction, all headed more or less towards earth. next, all the separate fireballs paused and hung suspended in mid-air, maybe as low as 5,000 feet above the earth. i judge their height based on the fact that there was a commercial airliner flying high overhead at the time, and if it was at 30,000 feet or so, i placed it about 6 times higher than the fireballs.\r\n\r\nwe were very excited! this seemed like something that could not be explained typically. i have a strong scientific and skeptical background, and this was something that could easily be dismissed. i've seen meteors, comets, space stations with telescopes, thousands of planes and helicopters flying at night, balloons, etc., and none of them moved liked this or glowed with such ferocious intensity. and we really got excited when we saw it split into 5 or 6 pieces. it was an exhilarating experience and one we are glad to have shared.\r\n\r\ni just wish i had photos or videos of the event, or that someone else on florida's east coast had seen the same thing. if you know of any video of this event, please share so i can compare it with what we also saw.\r\n\r\nwe almost pulled off the highway to investigate, but had gotten such a late start on the road trip we decided to press on, noting the time and location so i could look it up online later. i watched the floating 5 balls until we were totally out of sight. to my knowledge they never moved.\r\n\r\nlater, my extensive internet research revealed nothing regarding the event.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":17996,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.2156847,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07102009-0006","longitude":-81.0138131,"occurred":1226120400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1226120400000,"summary":"Saw glowing balls hovering at 5,000 feet, then splitting into 5 seperate balls.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Daytona Beach, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:214003"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Virginia Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I just discovered your organization today in an article in the virginian pilot newspaper.  just thought you might like to see this image while it is still on google streetview.  i attended a funeral service at 1801 baltic avenue, virginia beach, va yesterday, july 8th 2009.  prior to going i used google maps to find the facility.  if you spin the streetview tool to the southeast and look over the portico you will see an interesting object.\r\n\r\nthere is a naval air station nearby.  i flew out of there myself for many years.  so there are many possibilies, but the object does not appear to be a jet, helicopter, or even a blimp.  other possibilities include a banner being towed along the beach.  i ruled out a streetlight, because they can all be accounted for in the images.  i can't determine the date the image was taken.\r\n\r\nbill miller","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17995,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.8584763,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07102009-0005","longitude":-75.972345,"occurred":1247122800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1247122800000,"summary":"Unknown object caught on google streetview.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17995_submitter_file1__Googleimage.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Virginia Beach, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:214004"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Marinette","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"You know the first part, now let me tell you that this object made no noise such as a jet or propeller driven plane, its flight path was from west to east, there were very few scattered clouds and the sun was setting at the time.It moved a little eradically not in a straight line,and slowly.I would guess it to be just above the clouds too.I have seen these before,i decided that i should all make these sightings known.They are real!!!Do you think mankind has evolved far enough to handle the truth? i do!!!

(gases)\r\n\r\nduring hurricane andrew, i had another weird few encounters. i was staying in a quanson hut for protection against the hurricane in palm beach gardens fla, and i heard and saw weird things during the storm.\r\n\r\nso much happened that night i'll just give you the skinny.\r\n\r\n)i heard things outside my door walking around\r\n)i saw something looking in through the metal door hole. \r\n)i found a scorched symbol on the inside of the quanson hut, i had never seen before, it was two rounded corner triangles inside one another that were inside two circles, and between the triangles and circles there were 2 lines of several lines that looked like some kind of writing.\r\n)i also found some strange rocks... probably meteorites or something,(same property) but they looked like a rocks and were hard. until you put a flame to it, then it crumbled like dust where the heat was applied. it was kind of silvery inside.\r\n\r\nanyways, i told my freinds about it, they asked if i had weird dreams, and i did, so they told me to contact someone. and i did. but i forgot who, some world renowned ufo investigator at the time, and we corresponded up to the point where he asked. \"are you sure it was a ufo?\"\r\n\r\nand well, since i wasn't really sure, i had to say no and go one about my business without ever really understanding any of it all.\r\n\r\nthen recently when i saw them kids in the news in boca, i was speculative, but when i saw what they described and what it did, i was stunned. because over time i was sure what i saw years ago was a fluke of nature or something, that is until this happened.\r\n\r\nif i didn't have a witness with me the night i saw the green orb, we wouldn't be talking right now, because she saw it too. we have long departed ways and i have no clue where she's at, but if she see's this story, she might say something.\r\n\r\ni think i reported this to another site, along with other strange things, i'll see if i can hunt down what i put up there... i'm pretty sure it was a little more detailed than what this report has in it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

light in the sky, but it was too close to be a star.  it was moving side-to-side and hovering, like nothing i have ever seen before.  i jumped in my car and drove to its location.  it was a green glowing diamond shaped object, about 100ft above us, floating.  we watched and took pictures as more bystanders showed up.  it slowly started to move ne.  then all of a sudden it shot 30 ft east in seconds.  it was unbelievable.  we watched it move half a block east then come to a stop.  a police officer eventually showed up and asked us what we were doing.  he saw the object also and had no idea what it was.  around this time we saw a white wire sticking out of both sides of this ufo.  i have no pictures of it though.  it eventually went very high in the sky and slowly faded away.  it was the strangest thing i have ever seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nmonday night i was driving west on sw 18th street in boca raton to pick my family up at my brother���s home in the area and i noticed a ���different��� light in the sky. what caught my eye is that the angle changed as i was driving. that���s what first increased my interest. there was a car behind me so i turned north on isabella and stopped the car. i got out of my car and observed something really incredible. after a few minutes a jogger came buy and when i pointed it out to him, he got a little freaked out. i was on the telephone with my wife at my brother���s home telling her what i was seeing. they all went outside and didn���t see anything because perhaps for the tree lines and they were about a ��� mile away. i went to pick everyone up, my wife, two daughters and my father-in-law and went back to the scene. when we returned, there were about 20 people, mostly kids in the street all on their cell phone going a little nuts. my family got out of the car not really expecting anything. that didn���t last long. about 5 minutes later, my brother showed up with his daughter, he was skeptical from the onset. when he got out of his car, the ufo was just hovering, but when it started to move, he, like everyone else started to scream. my brother is a local dentist in town and he called a colleague of his that lives in the neighborhood too, same reaction. this was a very clear night with a full moon. there were a few white clouds. one of the kids had a pair of binoculars. eric vandernoot, the astronomer at florida atlantic university has no clue. there were no sounds, no motor sounds, no weather balloon, no laser, nothing but the shape with movement that is unexplainable from any technology we have to produce such an event. the movement at times was so vast that a weather balloon would have to be miles in size and in that case you would have to see it.. this was truly a remarkable event that can not be identified. it was in the air too long to have been propelled too fast by a remote hobby aircraft, and no sound. i can see now how someone would have to explain this away as a hoax. i have better than 20/20 corrected vision, don���t drink etc, have a very technical and mechanical background and know this was way beyond a backyard hoax or even a far, far stretch for disney. \r\n\r\nit

quickly realized there was only one light, it was the wrong color and way to large.  as it grew closer we could see that it was actually fire and not a light.  the object continued at a fairly moderate but steady speed the entire time. the time that it was nearest to us we could see it going above low level clouds and under upper level clouds. also at this point i got our binoculars from the engine and tried to view the object.  due to a problem with the binoculars and trying to focus on an object that far away without any other objects closer to base my attempts at focus i could only see the object cleary for a second or so.  it appeared to be a very large fire ball that mostly covered the object, the upper rear portion of the fire ball had what appeared to be the edge of a square object sticking out of it.  there was no noise, vapor trail, or anything else that could be associated with the object.  it continued on its trajectory at a seemingly constant speed and altitude untill it could no longer be seen in the southern sky.  as the object passed us the fire ball seemed to dim somewhat as if it were hidden partially by the object in it, but some fire was visible until the entire object disappeared from sight.  i would estimate the entire duration to be in the 5 minute range.  i would appreciate any information you have on this.","distance":"101-500

bright, pulsing light, round in shape, through patio door over the valley in front of south side of house.  it was like the color of a dimmed down halogen light, but more white when it pulsed brighter.  it headed east coming from the west.  totally silent.  had left my good hd camcorder at river house, so i grabbed daughter's cheap sony handycam and shot video of it, which would have been

another bright one higher up appeared overhead silently and headed one tick above east.  it was steady lit until it started descending into the tree line, at which time it began to pulse like the night before.\r\n\r\nhere are some blown up stills of it--the color perhaps is a blend of all the colors shown together to get the orange or dirty yellow color-- the video is posted to my youtube channel name:  seeingufospa \r\nchannel name of nimitta1 has video of the same thing too (by altoona, pa) \r\nthe video from the 8th will follow  soon.\r\n\r\nthe orange ones seem to be an epidemic lately all over the world--wonder when the powers that be will address their presence?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17972,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4324615,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07092009-0008","longitude":-79.692675,"occurred":1246950000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1246950000000,"summary":"Murrysville:

distance south of me.  i at first thought it must have beel a plane banking or something because there's lots of air traffic around here.  i kept chatting with my neighbor and after a few minutes i noticed it was still in the same general area and still only red.  so i started watching it while we kept talking.  i noticed it wasen't flashing but it was pulsing.  i was able to tell it was moving very slow. i started thinking of what it could be. i've seen plenty of satelites and this was moving much much slower and pulsing red. so i kinda thought that was out.  no blue or white and it wasen't flashing like a plane either so planes were out.  same with the helios around here.  i had my camera in my pocket so i pulled it out and snapped a couple of shots and shot a couple of videos.  all still talking to my neighbor.  then i asked him to take a look and he said that it was kinda strange also.  he sat back down and we continued to talk.  it kept moving slowly to the north.  at one point i thought it had stopped but i think that was because i was watching it on me camera screen.  finally when it dissappeared it faded like the space station does.  it just dimmed out and was gone.  the whole sighting lasted better than 25 minutes.  i got 6 minutes on digital video.  my camera isin't very good quality in the dark like that but it turned out better then i expected it would.  the first snap shot was distorted because i flinched a bit when i took it and the other isin't very clear for some reason but the videos make out better.  i thought afterwards that it moved kind of like a ballon would have.  attach a pulsing red light to a ballon and let it go.  that might do it but the way it faded diden't seem to fit.  i diden't catch the moment that i lost it because i coulden't hold the camera on it any more and i shut it off.  it was kind of fun watching it.  i don't know what it was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

southern california skies, while swimming in the pool.  i spotted 3 white/silver shiny objects first.  i observed them for a minute or so, and thought that they were just balloons.  then i noticed that they were not floating up or drifting like a balloon would.  the 3 objects were staying the same distance from each other and not being blown around by the wind.  they moved back and forth for 20 seconds or so against the wind and sometimes would stay in the same spot for a few moments. i���m guessing they were 3000 or more feet up.  i showed the family what i was looking up at and they watched them too.  my son pointed out that there were 4 more white/silver objects over there in the east.  all 7 of the things stayed the same distance from each other while we all watched them for about fifteen minutes.  my wife said that they were probably just balloons.  my son said that they were definitely not balloons, he pointed out how they were not moving with the wind, and they were staying in the same formation from each other and the surface did not look like balloons.  they looked kind of like bright stars in the daytime.  when i first spotted them they would have been over the seal beach weapons station.  all 7 of them eventually moved west towards the 405 freeway and golden west street and disappeared from our view.
