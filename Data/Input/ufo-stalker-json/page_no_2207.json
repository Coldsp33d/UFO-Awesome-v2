(and i was fumbling with the camera and my dogs leash).\r\n\r\ni called the tamiami tower who routed me to mia approach control. i told them my location and asked if there was any traffic in the vicinity for the past 20 minutes and they could only confirm 1 airliner out of mia that flew over me from the north as i was speaking to him. he could not confirm the small plane or any other traffic in the area. i uploaded the pic to my twitter account (threv65) and made an entry in my facebook from my phone.\r\n\r\nthe funny thing is, i thought i was looking at it for about 5 minutes but when i got home and looked at the timestamps on the picture and my video attempt almost 30 minutes had gone by.   i called channel 7 news and reported it but they had no calls (they are the local sensationalist news station everybody calls them first with the the weird stuff). \r\ni have attached the phot and the video thoug htey are of course really crappy and i'm not sure whether or not it is on the video (maybe near the end but i could not get it framed as it was heading away and my dog kept pulling me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":17965,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.6693274,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07092009-0001","longitude":-81.5135335,"occurred":1247112900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cone,  Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1247112900000,"summary":"Light in low in sky heading e-se ","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17965_submitter_file1__UFO-2009-07-08_21.49.22.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17965_submitter_file2__UFO-video-2009-07-08-21-49-47.3gp"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:214713"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Wilmington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Halloween, 1952 - when i was very young, my father used to take me trick-or-treating around our neighborhood. in those days, commercial costumes were not available;

        \r\n\r\nthe object was approximately 300-400 feet from where i was watching it. i thought initially that someone was in my field illegally with a truck and trailer. as i watched, i noticed that it was apparently hovering and made no noise. i immediately concluded that it was not a motor vehicle of any kind and noted that it made no noise whatsoever. as i was watching it, my friend came running out to the back deck asking what it was and then my son came, asking what the bright lights were. we spent approximately 5 full minutes trying to figure out what it was. totally perplexed, i got my flashlight, gun and we all got into my truck which was parked in front of my house. we drove around the house and noticed that the object \"was just gone\". we drove to the exact location in which there are many trees that are part of our nursery. they are approximately 15-20 feet tall. at no time did we see anything \"fly away\", flash of light or anything. it was just gone. had it been a motor vehicle of any kind, there would have been tracks, dust,etc. additionally, my ranch is fenced in with one way in-out. i got out of my truck and approached the landing-hovering site to look and obtain physical evidence. the area in which the craft was located consisted of soft,thick dust that had just been sprayed with water several hours earlier. i found absolutely no physical evidence whatsoever. there is debate within the three of us if the craft was in fact hovering or had actually landed. the brilliance of the light in which the craft produced was \"unearthly\" and like nothing i have ever witnessed in my life. i had no logical explanation for what had happened and this incident defied the laws of physics. no sound, no con trail, no disturbed soil, no bent trees, nothing.\r\n\r\nwe drove back to the house. extremely bothered by what we had just witnessed, my son and i returned to the area approximately 20 minutes later. i was not afraid but intrigued by what had occurred. i turned off my truck, noting it was a beautiful moonlight night, and the moon was extremely bright.\r\n\r\nas we were re examining the area, we both hear a loud bizarre \"click\" noise off to our right in the area of green houses. we looked into the nearest green house when we heard another distinct loud \"click\", this time coming from a thicket of trees. as we approached this area, we heard another distinct \"click\" noise coming from behind us in another thicket of trees. we heard a total of 5 distinct loud \"click\" noises. in all honesty, the \"clicking\" noises  were coming from all around us and after the fifth one, it was a little eerie (even though we could see nothing with our flashlights) and i instructed my son to return to my truck and we left.\r\n\r\nthe most unexplainable part of this story is as follows: my brother came over to my ranch approximately an hour later (10:30)pm. he has a doctorate degree, three master degrees and works for a international company. additionally, he has taught physics. we are both skeptics and believe that most ufo sightings can be logically explained. when i told him of what had just occurred earlier, he suggested that we go back down to the location and figure out what it was that we saw. as we were at the location (which was approximately an hour and a half later) we both witnessed an extremely bright \"swish\" in the western sky. it was probably a half second. but what we saw appeared as if the atmosphere \"opened up\" for a millisecond and an object \"went inside\" or poked through and then the atmosphere closed up leaving a \"swirling\" motion in the sky. a \"wormhole\" or \"porthole\"?. it terrified him so bad that his eyes watered and his voice cracked, insisting that we immediately leave towards the house. he cannot believe what he saw and both of us have had several sleepless nights.We can verify and confirm our credentials. we have absolutely no idea of what we saw and my brother, as educated as he is, can not give a  logical explanation of what we saw and i think this is why we both are so disturbed by the incident. we cannot report it in fear of ridicule and do not want to utilize our names. we both are heavily connected at the local/state/federal political level. if you have any questions, i did leave my email address. hope you have some answers, because we do not!","distance":"101-500

let the \"sailors\" out, wished them a safe journey. then we made our turn and as we did, we saw a strange-looking ball of light hovering close to the center of the road. this was an intense light but did not hurt the eyes. as we drove closer to this light, it disappeard. \"wow\", we both exclaimed. as soon as we drove through the spot where the light had been, a bone-chilling icyness passed through our bodies. we looked at each other with questioning surprise...\"what the heck?\" when i checked my rear view mirror-there it was- behind the car! now we were both scared. my date screamed and got down into the floor board. i said \"i'm going to stop\". she was sobbing, shaking and clinging to the floor board. her sudden terror was contagious and i did not stop. the light appeared to be following us now.\r\n   up ahead, there was an intersection where the road made a dip. after going over the dip, i watched in my rear view mirror to see whether the light made the dip as we had... it did not!\r\n   there was a car coming up the road toward us. i switched my headlights off and on and pulled into his lane which caused the approaching car to pull off the road and stop. as we passed the now stopped car, the ball of light illuminated the scene, the car was a taxi, the driver wore a white shirt and his left arm was resting on the door window frame. he didn't look at us. he appeared to be quite calm-looking straight ahead.\r\n   in the meantime, we and the ball of light continued down the road. because the light was becoming smaller, slowing and lagging a bit behind our car, i thought it was ending it's pursuit.\r\n    ahead, i could see the street lights of oxnard. i determined, if i could make it to these lights we would be safe and could possibly see what this thing was. as we went under the street lights, the ball of light\r\nstopped abruptly just before reaching the street lights, hovered over the street for a moment then made a departure at a forty-five degree up and out into the night sky. nothingness. no vapor trail, no tracking lights- nothing.\r\n   we drove to the first avaliable phone booth and called the police,i told them briefly about our encounter and they sent a patrol car to us. we then related the entire encounter. the policeman got into his car,and we in ours and we retraced our route, stopping along the way to point out significant facts. the most important fact being the forcing of the taxi to pull over off the road. the policeman called his dispatch officer, they in turn called the taxi company. the policeman asked the taxi company whether they had a taxi in that vicinity at that time. they replied in the affirmative. the policeman further asked if the driver had reported seeing anything strange or unusal. no, nothing said the taxi company. i was dumbfounded! i told the policeman i could process the fact the driver did not see the strange ball of light but i could never accept the fact he had been forced off the road, came to a complete stop and yet, had no knowledge of the event. i reported the incident to my superior and he filed a report.\r\n   i, in fact, was given orders to report to the very same base the \"sailors\" called the coos head naval facility almost a year later. when i arrived at this base, it was not ready for occupancy. i and others there were bivouacked in a local hotel in coos bay,oregon while we prepared the base for residency.\r\n   while at the coos head base i had another encounter. this encounter was with four thin and tall persons that looked quite normal. no big eyes nor green skin, they all wore blue jump suits.\r\n   this encounter took place within and on a secure base doing secret military work. i am a plank owner of this base. i was there from 1957 through 1959.\r\n   i found myself laying on a waist high gurney looking at the four strangers. i was quite relaxed. over my head and at my feet was a round flat screen. my head was laying on an elevated pillow that was responsible for transforming my thoughts into movie-like images onto the screen.\r\n   the location of this encounter was in a room in the front of the chow hall doors. no one came through this area while the encounter was taking place. it was during the early morning hours. one of the \"men\" questioned me about the spinning gyro and what i understood about it. instantly,an image appeared on the screen. now i did not feel so relaxed and i tried not to co-operate. the \"men\" looked at each other and i sensed the session was over, whatever it had been.\r\n   the next thing i remember was waking in my bunk wondering what had just happened. i did not mention this encounter to anyone as i did not want to appear as unstable working on this base.\r\n   now that time has elapsed,i realize this encounter was to place time-release information into my sub-conscious.\r\n   since that time at coos head, i have obtained a united states patent which is for a vehicle that operates using harmonics. furthermore, i have just recently invented and made working models of the world's first hybrid boat motor, runs on a sound wave. this motor has no mechanical propellar and will not harm aquatic life.\r\n   there were many things revealed to me. and now i know things like a seer would know.\r\n   in 1988, i retired early and found myself easily bored. having always been a high achiever and a busy doer type person, i pondered what i could possibly do with my extra time. i decided to renovate my small outdoor utility shed into a workshop. there i reasoned, i could tinker with small ideas and repair minor household malfunctions.\r\n   as time went on i found myself attempting to make a working model of some sort of new motor with internal push. this idea had floated around in the dark recesses of my sub-conscious for years. i was basically experimenting with odds and ends of materiel which were on hand around the house. i knew what i wanted to build but was not entirely certain just how to get to the end results. after several days and many failures, a small model of the motor began to take shape.\r\n   because my \"shop\" was so tiny, i usually worked with the door slightly ajar. no one was aware of what i was working upon.\r\n   one day while working on the motor, i noticed a man walking into my back yard. i stepped out of the shop, pulling the door closed behind me,  and went to greet him. he was a well-dressed person, average looking, about forty-five or so. i said hello and could i help him. he looked at me and i knew at once he worked with computers as we stood together, my thoughts returned to the encounter in 1958 at coos head naval facility. without saying another word i smiled and he pointed to my shop door. i knew he was well aware of what i was working on.\r\n   he left the back yard  and i never saw him again.\r\n   know this, the time travelers, are real and the (u.F.O.)is there time machines.\r\n   \r\n   know i know this report is lengthy i do have a shorter version.\r\n\r\n                                  i am virgil e atkinson","distance":"20 Feet or

it went quite a distance away from the others but they were all still in sight. it slowly drifted off to the side maybe a quarter mile. i was probably 30 miles or so away so that is my estimate. then the lone orb started moving back toward the other orbs. slowly it made it's way back to the original group. after the orbs re-grouped, one by one they appeared to merge with eachother. all the orbs merged into one and then the orb slowly disappeared into the horizon. when i first saw it, i knew it wasn't ordinary, it was very different form all the other lights around it and it wasn't close by any fireworks. it didn't move like anything i had seen before and i looked for any sign that could disprove what i though it was, a ufo(s) of some kind. no blinking lights like on a plane or

waiting for a cable repair guy to show up. i was facing west towards the rocky mtns. i noticed several commercial aircraft flying overhead at about 17k to 20k ft. they were traveling from the south toward the north. just after one of them had passed by, i noticed what looked like a star directly above the mountains and quite stationary. i called the object to the attention of my friend who could not tell what it was either but did find it strange. he thought that it was rotating and could possibly have had a second object very close to it. i could not tell if there were two of them but it did look like it was rotating. after about twenty minutes of continuous viewing, it starting moving from west to southeast. at this time, i ran into the house and got my video camera. i tried to zoom in on the object but at full zoom, i could not get an image. this told me that the object was very far away. i asked my friend for a pair of binoculars or some other viewing device but he didn't have any. as the object continued to move toward the southeast, i watched it continuously. it finally stopped traveling and came to a rest. the total travel time from west to southeast was about fourty minutes. as i continued to watch the object, the size and brightness did not change. after another ten minutes at its new position, it started moving straight up. at this time, the object kept climbing until i could not focus on it with the naked eye. all in all the total view time was about 1hr 10min. the weather conditions for this day were clear skies and very sunny. being 10am when the object was first spotted, and the sun shining brightly, the sun was low in the sky behind me and was shining brightly on the mountains in front of me. the conditions could not have been any better for viewing such an event. at no time did i loose sight of the object until the very end when it climbed too high to view any longer. this object was close enough to dia airport that radar signatures could have been picked up. if they do not have reports of this object then maybe commercial aircraft flying in the area may have spotted it as well. i noticed that when the object was at the southeast position, at least one aircraft flew under the object at an elevation of more than thirty-thousand ft. i checked with the nasa web site for tracked objects and i could not find any man made objects in

some trees.  once we were in an opening again, the object was gone.  there was no sign of it anywhere in the sky.  we had approx. 30 secs of a clear view of the object and it did not move at all.

(it's just my opinion that it wanted us all to get a good look at it, since it went in front of our vehicle and then around to the side where all of us except the driver could continue to try to figure it out.)\r\n\r\nthe driver of the vehicle is a good family friend in the jewish faith, who tried to reason that the anomaly must have some logical, rational explanation, like a fireworks after-image or a weather balloon. he had to agree, though, that due to the rapid and continuous rate of speed at which it traveled, while retaining the see-through, cloud-like appearance and shape, it did not behave in a manner that fits our understanding pertaining to clouds, smoke, or wind. he stated that it looked somewhat like a narrow, vertical chariot, and that whatever it was that we'd observed, \"it seemed to be on a mission.\" he describes the curling moving smoky or cloud-like areas as paisley, especially on the bottom of it. my son drew his version and had the paisley curling swirls at the bottom area as well.\r\n\r\ni was the front-seat passenger who, likewise, suspect that there is probably some scientific explanation for what we presently have no knowledge about. what we saw seemed to be solid and yet fluid, as if moving around w/in the confines. we were able to see the white clouds behind it, through the areas where there were \"holes\" in the object.\r\n\r\nthis did not seem to be of metal or any substance that we know of, as it did not reflect light, similar to how the moon looks at night during an eclipse, is how the object seemed to just be there in the air, but flying, and as it passed us, the shape had changed yet stayed within the space. so while it was coming into our line of vision and while it was in front of us, and as it passed us, and after it was traveling southwest of us, the shape it took within it's rectangular confines was similar to seeing moving ultrasound image of a moving creature, except seeming to have no 3-dimensional depth to it.\r\n\r\nthe shapes that we observed did seem somewhat as angels are depicted, having what appear to be wings, and although it was strange to see such a thing travel around us, we were really not frightened by it, just amazed. like my daughter said, it could have been either an angel or a demon.\r\n\r\nwe are still working on making artistic representations of this thing, which is how we determined that it had actually changed shape yet stayed w/in a certain confined area, being fluid like smoke or cloud in movement, and yet not dissipating as it traveled upright and then as we entered the i-25 freeway, we could no longer see it behind us as it was no longer in our view.","distance":"21-100

started to move towads us and side to side. it moved very irregularly, not like any aircraft i have ever seen. it didnt have any noise that we could tell, but it may have been a few miles from us and we have a highway close to us. it was very large and seemed to spin and rotate. we looked at it with binoclars and noticed beams coming off of it that looked like they we spot lights. blue beams that moved up and down. the object had 3 to 5 lights on it. all diffetent sizes. e tried getting ictures of it but all were too blurry and dull. our cameras wouldt work becuase there wasnt enoug light. the

than 2 hunfread feet form me.I woke my wife to witness this as i knew the was something was out of the oprdinary.It was a star like object but was much brighter.I would say 4 times as bright as the start of david.It moved like it was in control.It went in a straight line.No erratic movements at all.I was very excited at this time.I do not have a video camers at this time but i certainly wish i did for this was totally out of this world.I watched the object until it went out of view behind a large hill.I still continued to watch incase it reapeared but to no avail.That night i could not sleep well as i was still very excited due to this experiance and i will never forget it..My god this was so close to me..If i had to guess the sixe.Well mabe a ..A small mini van in size.But it was exactly like a star.The shape.Round.The brightness.Yes it was a massive star floating 200 ft away from me going its own way.Since this sighting my mind has not stopped going in circles.Well that is

midnight, as always i peered through the window to look at the northern sky.  then i noticed a multi-colored shining object to the north, beyond some trees, which have to be at least 100 feet tall (about 200-300 yards north of my house).\r\n\r\nmy first instinct was it was a glare on the upper portion of the window, from my light.  i then moved towards the window, realizing this was not the case.\r\n\r\nthen i actually said to myself aloud; \"why is that plane flying so low?\"- i do live a few miles northwest of the des moines airport.  then i actually had a solid 6-7 seconds to take this object in...  the problem was it was not moving towards the airport... or away for that matter...  i will admit i have studied this kind of phenomena, in-depth...  what i saw, before this anomaly literally faded out, looked very similar to a supposed case in the early 1990's in carp, ontario, canada.  this object seemed to have multiple shimmering orbs, however...\r\n\r\ni will admit- i only had enough time to decipher what i was looking at, which obviously, i have no idea what, or who's it was.  i know these were not fireworks, it was too late for that on a weeknight (in my neighborhood), i did not hear a solitary firecracker lit that night, there was not a sound, expect for my mouth hitting the floor, that is.  not to mention this thing was above or parallel to trees that are 100 feet tall (plus) trees and it was already behind them, and didn't look like fireworks!  i would also have to admit the lights were not quite as bright as a local firework. \r\n\r\nfrom the 10 seconds of the entire event, i would have to say this object was large, larger than a single engine cessna, etc.  from it's position from me- i would surely say this was probably larger than a commercial jetliner.  \r\n\r\ni take these things seriously and would not post unless very serious.  please, if anyone else saw this thing- please repost!\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

valley of el cajon. we saw a single red light in the sky. at first we thought it was a plane. we stood by our cars talking before we took off, and during that time we noticed that the light was moving very slowly across the sky. several helicopters and planes went over, but this was much farther away and moving 1/10th the speed and was 100% red in color. it looked like a really large, really bright red pulsing star. so i'm glancing at it, and notice several bizarre course corrections, all of which completely defy the law of physics. we started to talk about it with unease. my sister called her husband at home over in la mesa, and asked him to walk outside and look in the sky. he saw it but had no idea what it could be, and he used to be in the military. we watched it creep across the sky, hover in one spot for a few minutes, creep some more, and then after about a total of 15 minutes, it began to flicker, turned bright silver, and literally disappeared in front of our eyes. i could not believe what i saw. anyone else see this around 9:30 over el cajon, ca?\r\n\r\ni don't know what it was, and i will not speculate, but there are apparently various websites where people reported
