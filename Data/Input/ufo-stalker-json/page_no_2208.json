was driving home on the highway when i came over a small hill and this is when i saw this. this was low enough i just happened to see this looking through the windshield. when i first glanced, i thought it was a plane, but i know better, i worked at an airport years ago, i've never seen an orange, golden yellow, glowing airplane, sitting in the sky. this was not very high in the air, it was not low, but too low to be an aircraft. it did not move, it just emitted a very bright glow. it was just bright and big. i was just stunned and thought it was strange. i also questioned is it a tower? all of the towers in our area blink red. this was much bigger than a tower light and it just glowed. when i looked up again it was gone. i only looked away for maybe one or two seconds. this was a solid glowing ball. that was last night. my husband, who gets off work at 10:00p called me on his way home tonight and told me he saw a big orangish yellow ball in the sky. he was driving south coming home and saw this thing. when he got home we drove all around town looking up to see if we could see this again, but we didn't. i have no idea what this was, and neither does he , but i think it is strange that we both saw this. i would like to know if anybody else saw this too. we live in a small town so maybe i'll find out.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

about this event.  i really don't feel like having to re-type everything word for word.  if you need additional information or clarification, please contact me directly.\r\n\r\npaste:\r\n\r\nposted on 07/07/09 @ ~9:30am on topix.Com (bartlett, il forum):\r\n\r\n\"did anyone else notice the strange lights over bartlett at night on july 4th? our group had set up camp for the fireworks display in the big, grassy clearing across the street from the carnival. while waiting for the show to begin, i looked up in the western sky and saw an odd glowing orange-red light. it was quite bright and very high in the sky. at first, i didn't think anything of and just assumed it was one of the many planes coming in for a landing at o'hare. \r\n\r\na few minutes later i looked back up in the sky and saw that the same ball of light was still there and hadn't seemed to move at all. i thought this was very odd. i pointed the light out to everyone else in my group and we all watched it for several minutes trying to figure out what it was.\r\n\r\nthere were no blinking/flashing lights coming from the ball of light that would indicate it was some type of aircraft. it didn't make any noise. for several minutes, it didn't move at all. then after about 5-10 minutes, the light started to move very, very slowly to the north. eventually, the light moved behind some trees and we could no longer see it. the fireworks started a few minutes later (or maybe they had already started, i can't remember). i turned my attention to the fireworks and forgot about the light.\r\n\r\nafter the fireworks display, we pack up and started walking south on the bartlett nature trail to get back to our friends' house where we had parked our car. as we were walking along, i looked up in the sky and saw the same glowing light again. it appeared to be back in the original position it had been when i first saw it. this time it wasn't moving at all. it remained stationery. it just hung there in the sky faintly dimming in and out. i pointed it out to everyone again, and we all were very perplexed as to what this light could be. of course, the jokes started up about ufos and independence day.\r\n\r\nwe kept walking along the trail and at one point passed a clearing in the trees to the west so that we were able to get a good view of the distant western horizon. at that point, we saw 3-4 more of the very same glowing lights way out in the distance. at first, they appeared to be arranged in an arch formation. then the distant lights started moving up into the sky and formed a perfectly straight line pointing from the ground to the sky at about a 45 degree angle and angled towards the south. the distant lights remained in the formation for the rest of our walk back to our cars.\r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes after re-spotting the original light in the sky that was closer to us, it slowing dimmed and finally went black as if it were a light bulb that had just burnt out.\r\n\r\ndid anyone else notice any of this?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nposted on 07/07/09 @ ~4:30pm on topix.Com (bartlett, il forum):\r\n\r\n\"nope, hadn't been drinking yet. i've got at least seven other people from my group that saw the same thing. i'm not trying to claim i saw a ufo. i was simply asking if anyone else noticed this and, if so, do they know what it was. my description of the events was lengthy because i tend to be anal and ocd about describing anything. also, i was hoping that the detailed description might possibly spark an idea in someone else's mind and they would be like, \"ah ha! based on your description, what you saw is most likely such-and-such.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nposted on 07/07/09 @ ~11:20pm on topix.Com (bartlett, il forum):\r\n\r\n\"sweet! someone else who saw the same thing we did, and you had 30 in your group! like i said, i'm not trying to start some kind of ufo conspiracy. i would just like to find out what i saw. if there is a reasonable, terrestrial explanation, i would be happy with that. however, there is nothing in my mind and experience that i could compare these lights to and think, \"oh, that's what that was.\" and i don't mean to sound like these were some sort of bright, intense, other-worldly lights that made your jaw drop and exclame, \"we are not alone!\" these were just odd lights in the sky that didn't fit in with the rest of the lights in the sky that i would expect to see in everyday normal life. they behaved oddly, and i cannot logically equate what i saw with anything that i have seen before.\r\n\r\nnormally, if i were to see lights in the sky, especially if there were numerous ones in a formation, i would just assume they were planes lining up for landing at o'hare (given that i live in a reasonable proximty to the o'hare airport area). however, the lights from planes have a tendency to move in the sky as they descend and approach the runway. also, planes (and other aircraft) have blinking lights.\r\n\r\nthe lights i saw in the sky were fairly stationary or moved very, very slowly. there were no corresponding blinking lights associated with the orangeish balls that would indicate they were aircraft. after about 10-15 minutes, the light would slowly dim out and disappear.\r\n\r\nas i am currently typing this, my wife is on her pc searching for these same type of observations. apparently, there have been a ton of these sightings within the il, mi, in, wi area over this past weekend. i need to look into this more and see what other people are reporting. my wife is looking at reports at www.Mufon.Com .\r\n\r\ni really wish that the forums on topix.Com had a wider readership so that i could get responses from more people.\"","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

facing cayuga creek toward aurora street.\r\n\r\nour youngest son needed to use the bathroom, so my fianc��� left with him to go to the port-a-potties.  while they were gone, at approximately 10:00 p.M., a glittery, white firework shot up into the air to the left of the town's water tower, turning my attention to the west.  i then noticed a fiery, orange globe rising slowly over the creek to the immediate left of the white firework.  i expected the globe to explode into thousands of sparklers, but as the real fireworks display got under way a full 90��� to my right, i realized this fiery globe was not a firework at all.\r\n\r\nthe globe rose gently, floating overhead, gradually ascending and moving at a steady pace to the southeast.  my fianc��� returned with our son, and i pointed out the globe to him, which he had also noticed while waiting in line for the bathroom.\r\n\r\ni had my 35mm camera with me, and my fianc��� asked me to take a picture of the object.  but my camera (set to auto focus) struggled to find a focal point in the night sky and would not take the picture.  the globe kept ascending and moving farther away until it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\ni was disappointed, but then we noticed a second fireball rising from the same point of origin as the first, behind the creek.  and this time, i was able to capture a photograph with my camera on manual focus.\r\n\r\nthe second globe behaved the same as the first, following the same southeasterly course and gradually getting higher and farther away in the sky to the point of no longer being visible.\r\n\r\nseveral spectators who had gathered to watch fireworks were distracted by the globes in the sky, all shouting out speculations as to what the objects could logically be.  the consensus seemed to be that they were hot air balloons.  i personally find it peculiar (not to mention extremely dangerous) to set off on a hot air balloon joy ride at 10:00 p.M. in such close proximity of a fireworks display.  the globes were totally self-contained with nothing attached, hanging or dangling from them, and they ascended to such heights they were no longer visible - clearly higher than hot air balloons would be capable of traveling.\r\n\r\nwhile the center of the globes appeared bright orange-red and flickering as if on fire, i am doubtful the globes were any type of flare, as a flare would eventually fall downward.  these objects continued to rise higher and higher, drifting off into the night sky.  they also did not burn up but maintained their size and perfectly circular shape.\r\n\r\nafter the globes disappeared, we turned our attention back to the fireworks, and, when they were done, packed up for home.  we thought we had witnessed a rather odd - but innocuous - event until we noticed several reports of similar experiences cropping up on the internet.  we, therefore, felt we should share our own 4th of july / fire globe event as well.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

outside in gibsonville, north carolina, and there wasn't a single star in the sky - i looked hard, too.  the sunset was scheduled tonight for 8:38pm, and it was now shortly after 8:50pm.\r\n\r\ni watched a car pass by, and when i looked back up, i saw this bright object, as bright as jupiter, directly above my head, at 12 o'clock.  it wasn't moving, as i had stationary power lines right above me to determine movement.  i watched it get slightly brighter, and after watching it for about 5 minutes, my neck started to hurt from looking straight up.  i looked down to stretch my neck for a second, and then looked back up, only to notice that the star-like object is starting to slowly fade away.  as it fades, i see another \"dot\" appear right beside it - it looked like a millimeter away from my point of view.  then both objects stopped fading, and another dot appeared right beside the second one, and finally, a third object appeared right beside that one!  they were in the shape a single parenthesis \")\"...  once they seemed to make that shape, two of them (the second and fourth one) faded away, leaving 2 left (the first and third one).  then those last 2 faded away together, until i could just barely see a faint \"smudge\" of white in the sky.  they then faded completely out of view, and i watched for five more minutes, only for nothing to return.  ...The whole event last for approximately 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nby the way, i saw just about the exact same thing a year ago, where it started as one bright \"star\", straight up, while the sky was still blue.  then as it faded, more \"stars\" appeared directly beside it, forming the shape of \"(\".  then they all slowly faded away at about the same moment.  again, no movement at all - just what seemed to be at a very high

headed to my home. after we crossed the 75 to 23 south exchange we began to see what looked like a large plane it appeared to not be moving in any direction. at first all we could see were two very bright lights that were too low to the ground and seemed to large for a plane. the closer we got the more uncomfortable i became,( i do not include how shannon felt as her reaction was and continued to be before during and after, \"i'm ok really,\" with white knuckles on the steering wheel.) we passed hill road and lost track of the object due  to a land fill. as we came around the other side of it we could see it again, it still remain motionless as our direction once again was true south. \r\nshannon said that she felt it could be a tower,but as we got closer that was discarded as we could clearly see it was some kind of air craft. the closer we got the more lights we could see on it, at least 15 blinking in red white yellow and some times blue. as we drew even closer it became clear it was very very large, we both got the feeling it was as large as a  747, and when we drove under it, we could see it had no wings and was completely stationary. that's when we could see the rest of the lights, there were another 5 very large very bright lights, i am not sure if they were under or on the leading edge, maybe both. what was clear was that it was low enough to the ground that i could see the underside lit up by the lights on the back of it as we passed under and away from it. once we were maybe a mile away from where we had drove under it, we could no longer see it. i was very uncomfortable, and even commented to shannon that i wish i had anxiety medication. i felt scared and kept looking all around us as we drove on till we exited 23 at m-59 and headed west to my home in howell. unable to sleep i stayed awake till 6am and it is now 6:30pm, my chest hurts and the headache that started after the sighting is still with me.","distance":"101-500

these orbs can dim or get very bright. they are low in the atmosphere and appear at various times of the night and in many different positions in the sky. they speed up and slow down and make sharp maneuvers at times. i usually see one at a time so i do not know if there is more than one or if the same one is appearing over and over in the sky cruising along. i have been wanting to get one on film getting brighter but have not had that opportunity until on this night. at approx 10:45pm est after i had just filmed the orb passing by some stars i sat back down and continued to skywatch. i was scanning the sky with my eyes and looked above me to catch a glimpse of a very bright, low, star-like object maybe a few hundred feet passing over where i was sitting. it was very low and very bright. it was moving west to east. i jumped out of my chair and began to film it. i was so astonished at the complete silence of this slow moving object! i could not see if it was a structured craft or what it was at all. all i could see was the bright light. you can see how low and bright this object was when it passes the stars as it is moving across the sky. i am an avid skywatcher and have been involved with this ufo phenomenon my whole life. i have filmed airplanes, helicopters and satellites and other various explainable aircraft. this was none of those things! the complete silence and appearance of this ufo light was amazing and i am so very grateful i was able to document it! i have the other ufo orb footage from various days in june and july i will upload after this one as

the area to the north east.  this is not seen around here too often as there are no major airports for 60 miles or so.  they looked like f-15s, but i don't think they fly those any more.  they were definitely military jets one seen very clearly, and the other jet was heard.  there are not any bases close by.  while i was looking up to see the jets something else caught my eye.  there where maybe a dozen or so objects to the east - south east possibly over juneau, wi area.  the best way to describe them is to liken them to a school of fish.  they where going in a large circle moving fast and in sync like a school of fish.  i lost them once and went to get my wife to see them.  while looking up to see them again, i reacquired the strange lights due east from my position. the lights seemed to be very bright -9 magnitude and then change to very dark all while going in a complete circle. the circle seamed to be horizontal (side to side) and not vertical (up and down). at times seen above the clouds and at times seen below.  the objects where moving quite fast in a clock wise circle.  the second sighting did not last very long and my wife was not able to see the objects. it seamed that the objects disappeared and less than a minute or two later a jet was again heard at a very fast rate, and you can clearly tell the difference between military and civilian jets.  the cloud layer was very thin higher altitude clouds.  i would guess the clouds at the time to be 6000 to 10000 ft.  at least one military jet was heard again, but not see after the last ufo sighting.  sounded very fast, but not super sonic.  possibly super sonic at high altitude when jet was last spotted heading straight east toward lake michigan.  i would very much like to find out what these objects where, and

 family owns a small island on semi wilderness lake in ontario, canada.\r\nwhile on vacation 6/16 niece (amy) awoke early to walk around the island and take pictures.  she took a picture of the lake because it was so calm and a bit misty.  when looking at this photo afterwards she noticed a bright object leaving the lake and headed skyward.  she did not notice anything prior to this, nor did she see the object with the naked eye.  looking at the object thru the camera, and blowing it up, it appears to be rod shaped, brightly lit with colored bands around the top, a rounded gold tip, and what appears to be a possible \"vapor\" trail behind it.  she was alone at the time.  there were no people or boats on the lake.  the photo was taken in a northeasternly direction with a cannon powershot set on auto.  the area behind is heavily wooded.\r\nwhen the rest of the family awoke amy showed them the picture.  they were all puzzled by it but basically blew it off.  after being shown the picture myself i felt it was worth pursuing as it appeared to be more than just a light anomaly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17909,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.677509,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07072009-0015","longitude":-76.402184,"occurred":1245162600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1245162600000,"summary":"Lighted

was seeing. everyone else felt the same way. no one really knew how to react. eventually the object continued in a southwest direction until it was out of sight. it did not disappear behind a cloud or change direction; it simply just continued its flight out of sight. a few minutes later another person at the party stated he saw a satelite traveling in the same direction that disappeared behind a cloud, but i did not see this. before i could get a camera the object was gone.

several phd programs my reputation may be at stake. \r\nduring a vacation i visited the rainforest that surrounds lake carite of puerto rico i awoke in the middle of the night from restlessness. i wandered around the forest as i always did. but after wandering for a bit started to notice a strange metallic vapor smell.\r\n\r\n i recognized the smell from  my freshman year in college when we were turning silver metal into a vapor compound. very similar, but with something indistinguishable mixed in. i followed the smell and stumbled upon an area full of tall grasses and ferns. in the middle of this was a large black almost diamond shaped object. it was faceted on top like a diamond and rounded off at the bottom. it touched the ground on its rounded end and somehow managed to stay upright. i got closer in an attempt to find an opening but i found none, it was almost like a solid black stone in the ground. i attempted to use a stone to scratch off a sample of the material and a small chip came off. the material peeled away from the object almost like obsidian. i ran to the house to get my camera and returned as quickly as i could. \r\n\r\nwhen i returned the object was in the air almost indistinguishable from the surrounding sky, the colors mingled perfectly to camouflage it. i attempted pictures but they were pointless. the object was too dark in colour, the light too low. as it rose however, i did notice and almost honey colored row of circles appear on the faceted top. they seemed to be lit almost like a tungsten bulb behind paper. they seemed to move independently from the object and circled the faceted top. \r\n\r\nto make things even stranger the hole in the ground the rounded edge of the object had made was covered in plants by morning. it's as if overnight the forest had sprung up to repair the damage. i cleared them away and try as i might i could not find the hole left behind. the only thing i found was an abundance of plants and insects in unusual numbers near the area.The only evidence i found was a 1mm-ish burn on a nearby rock with the impression of the small shard that i had managed to chip with a rock.\r\n\r\nnow i don't know if i'm going mad and this was all a dream or something. but it feels good i suppose to get this all off my chest. as a scientist in training i have no explanation, there is obviously no rational explanation for anything that happened during these night. maybe someone will have a similar story and this will be of use, maybe not.","distance":"20 Feet or
