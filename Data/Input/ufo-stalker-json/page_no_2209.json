of about 1-1.5 miles away at the oregon ridge park , myself and my group of 6 adults 5 children witnessed a glowing orange orb . i noticed it approaching from the southeast at about 1-2 thousand feet in altitude. my first thought was that these were the lights of an approaching helicopter or a small plane, a bright orange round light that apeared to be glowing when directly overhead. the skies were mostly cloudy, so i figured that was why i couldn't see any blinking lights, until it flew silently overhead and had the immediate thought that this was not a plane or helicopter. before it flew directly overhead i announced the strange object to the group, everyone took notice and assumed that it was an aircraft of some kind , but also verbalized that it was odd and silent. i as two others in the group observed it closely as it passed overhead in a sort of wonderment as to what we could be seeing , it kept a steady speed as it moved away to the northwest, the light faded out but the object was still visible for a minute . at this point i and two others of the group were intrigued but resumed our conversations, games w/ kids etc. please note that we were a group of 12 sitting in a grassy knoll at a parking lot , on top of a hill , directly west of interstate i83, there were approx 400 people taking advantage of this vantage point to see a local fireworks display. about 30 minutes later while there was still some light in the sky the object appeared from the same direction and floated overhead as before. upon this second sighting it was clear and evident that this was not a plane or helicopter , just a glowing orange sphere that made no audble noise. as a person who is familiar with the ufo phenomenon, i am extra careful to label something as a ufo , this was so odd that i am perplexed and felt obliged to make a report.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

the same. they were all generally flying on the same flight path. they kept coming one after the other and we estimate between 6 and 8 of the orange ���balls���. i was able to snap 2 photos but no

house with my 4 year old. we live in spartanburg county about 3 miles from the greenville/spartanburg airport. we were hanging out playing video games until about 10:30pm when we decided to turn in for the night.\r\n\r\nas i was getting our blankets ready i looked up and through the mesh door of the tent which was facing to the west. through the mesh i saw an incredibly bright red light of considerable size moving slowly over the treeline. my first thought was that it might be an airplane, but i have lived in this area my entire life and i literally see planes come and go every night. this was like nothing i had ever seen and i immediately knew that it was not a plane. i fumbled around in the dark for my video camera, unzipped the door of the tent and was able to start filming the object about 20-30 seconds after it originally caught my eye. \r\n\r\nat first the bright red object continued slowly moving south, but then unexpectedly a much smaller white light emerged from the top and went upward at a fairly rapid pace. when the light was a good 2x higher from the ground than the red light, the red light quickly disappeared. the white light continued to stay in view and continued to move southward at a speed of perhaps 3x faster than the red light was traveling. after a bit it flickered and disappeared. when the red one disappeared, it just blinked off like a switch was flipped, but the white one flickered and faded more subtly.\r\n\r\ni got the entire thing on tape, and the footage of the small object emerging from the larger object is quite good. my only regret is that i zoomed in to try to get a closer look, and some of the footage is rather jerky... serves me right for always making fun of people who don't seem to be able to hold a camera still while filming a ufo. still though, it's pretty exciting video. here's the link to the video on youtube: http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=ii9g-kvdzh0\r\n\r\ni was very excited to see this. i've kept my eyes open for stuff before when i'm looking at the stars, but this was completely out of the blue and entirely unexpected. plus, i never carry my video camera with me, so the fact that my camera on hand is still amazing to me. \r\n\r\nskeptics may point out that:\r\n1. this sighting took place very close to an airport\r\n2. the sighting took place on july 3rd (fireworks) \r\n\r\nhad i not seen the object myself for the duration that it was visible, and especially the emergence of the smaller white light, i too would have argued these as possibilities. however, the footage easily dismisses these arguments. it made no sound, and it moved unlike any fireworks i have ever seen. especially the way the white light sped up after separating from the red light. my 4 year old can be heard in the background trying to figure out what it was that we were seeing. he obviously didn't think it was fireworks, but he did say \"maybe it's a rocket ship\", which i found interesting. \r\n\r\nwhatever it was, it was a blast being able to see it and film it.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

came on here this morning and i started reading about everyone's sightings about an orange glowing sphere moving in the sky.  i couldn't believe what i was reading because i too saw this on the 4th of july.\r\n\r\ni had just arrived at my friend's house just after 10pm to join them for a few beers and to light fireworks.  when i got there, i stood in front of the house, drank a beer and chatted with my friends and watching the elaborate fireworks in the sky (they bought those fancy fireworks from indiana which are illegal in illinois). well i just so happened to look up after a firework had exploded in the sky when i saw a flickering orange glowing object moving in a linear direction.  it looked almost like a chinese lantern.  as my friends continued chatting i would look up every couple of seconds and it was still there moving across the sky!  i tried to think nothing of it because i intially thought it was a lit amber from one of the lit firework, but it just kept floating in a linear direction (east to west) till i lost sight of it.  no one really noticed except for me because everyone was drinking beers or occupied with lighting firecrackers.  also, the sky was really cloudy and the atmosphere foggy so it resembled a burning amber in the sky. i kept staring at it because this \"flame\" never died out!\r\n\r\nso when i come on here this morning and read that people saw this orange glowing light in other states, i can't help to think it was definitely a ufo. however, ever since i was told the last one was a satellite, i hope someone can tell me what this may have

on my front porch smoking a extremely disgusting cigarette.  so, to save myself i was going to go down to my sisters truck to grab a marb. as i was going down the stairs i flicked my lighter a few times until it lit.  as it was lit for about 2 or 3 seconds these lights shown through the trees (picture 1: the lights were to the right of the opening [on the left side of the pic] in the trees shining through) i would say there was about 3 or 4 lights.  i stood there watching anxiously, and adrenaline pumping throughout my body.\r\n\r\nit moved after about 2 or 3 seconds into the clearing (picture 2) in a medium speed.  what really blew my mind was how quiet it was for being so close.  there was no noise at all, all i could hear was my fast breathing and heavily beating heart.  as i watched it moved above the trees behind my shed, and it shone through them.  the light was bright enough to illuminate the trees but not the ground.  i couldn't tell what kind of shape this was all in all because the lights were hiding it.  i was shocked.. scared.. and shaking.  and for a big dude like me, its hard to scare.  i ran up the stairs and into the house and told my mom.. she didn't believe me and her first reaction was, \"what did you smoke now?\"\r\n\r\ni wasn't under the influence of anything.  i was shooken and kept having these chills go up my back throughout the hour after.  \r\n\r\nthe only reason i could give for seeing this event would probably be when i was at my cousins house about four weeks ago.  he is into this ufo crap, and hes encountered something really weird, but i won't get into that.  we were sitting on the backporch watching the sky and he told me you tell them with your mind that you want to see them and they will eventually come.  i didn't believe him.  but i tried it, and i really wanted to see one though.  well low and behold 4 weeks later i'm typing on mufon about a ufo report.  \r\n\r\ni'm going to keep trying to see them everynight now.  and i have more of a respect for the unknown.  with the lunar eclipse coming tomorrow and the crop circles they produce warning/teaching us of how to predict astronomical events, i have nothing to be afraid of.  they're trying to help us, as far as i know.\r\n\r\nbut, all in all this was the most freakish and bizarre thing i have ever seen......\r\n\r\nit was silent and bright.  \r\n\r\ni just want to know 1.Why they were at my house (because the \"calling the aliens\" thing probably didn't do anything).  2. why did they leave when they saw the lighter (obviously they're intelligent) and 3. do they have something to do with my sisters time warp?\r\n\r\nabout a month and a half ago.. my sister was woken up by her dog at about 2 am i think she said, and she took him outside to pee.  an hour later she woke up in the bathroom with the dog.  and she is the lightest sleeper, and she has never slept walked.  i mean i live in a pretty wilderness environment, could this just be a good place for the unknown to dwell at night?  i don't know.  i hope someone contacts me.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\ncody","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

out to see where this light was coming from and we couldn't find nothing on what would be transmitting this strange light so my mom said it's most likely nothing more then a car light reflection. well then i thought to my self it's a nice warm night i'm going to take a walk down the street to visit a friend because i know he would be up late as i started walking i felt like i was being fallowed as strange as it seem i looked up in to the sky and noticed star like orb the very one that i have been seeing now for quite some time since the summer of 2008 as i would look up into the night sky i would see it moving really slowly and then stopping and becoming dim like as if it didn't want me to see it so as i started walking a little more this star like object or orb would brighten up and fallow me more i ran to my friend's house and knocked on his screen door and as he came out the door the star like orb disappeared if any one would like to question me on this please contact me at wright10301973@gmail.Com i now know for sure that it was no satellite in fact this orb also turned as i was watching it and had no noise to it what so ever at first i thought maybe my eye's are playing tricks on me but i watched it long enough that it was moving and it was no satellite i'm writing this statement out of all god's honest truth of what i seen just hope not to get abducted after

that job) i was working on a chimney for a client east of waupun, wi. i was on the roof and was tuckpointing and so i was looking up at the top of the chimney. out of the corner of my eye i noticed some movement. i turned my attention to the movement and saw something strange. i saw two (2) orbs way up there in the sky. they were moving in a straight line south to north. these objects were so high that if i didn't concentrate my focus on them i would lose site of them. they traveled across the sky weaving in and out of each other. i got the impression that they were enjoying this weaving around each other. from what i could tell they were silver or chrome colored orbs moving fast at perhaps way over 10,000 ft., maybe 20,000 or more. it took them about 2 minutes to go across 25% of the sky and then they were so far away that i could no longer see them. my estimate of there size is approximately 10 to 15 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nhad i not been looking up at that time i would have missed them. i'm pretty sure no one else could have seen them that day because they were difficult to see and you would need to be looking in the precise area of the sky at that precise time. i checked the jet stream that day when i got home. it was west to east that day in wisconsin. these things were traveling south to north. they're movements were similar to what i would call intelligently controlled (weaving)silver balloons floating high in the jet stream. after that day i was no longer a skeptic about ufo's. i think of that day often and wonder.\r\n\r\ni've told a few
