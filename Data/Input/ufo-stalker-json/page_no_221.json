from landing at dfw, time was appx 7;13am the sun was impressive in the clouds, so i decided to take a picture.  i snapped the attached photo with my galaxy s7 phone and when reviewing it right after, i noticed the orb looking thing in the photo.  i was seated in 3f.\r\n\r\ni looked outside and the orb was difficult to see because the sun was bright, but it was there.  we were traveling at about 400mph, at about 14,000 feet on approach so it is hard to judge movement.  it appeared to move back into the clouds, but it could have been the planes flight path giving the appearance that it moved into the clouds.  i showed the photo to the flight attendants who took the phone to show the rest of the crew, all of whom i could see their confusion and excitement about it.  they asked me to show the captain upon landing, which i did.  the captain said he thought it was a drug balloon (instead of a drone) and i said do they look like that and he admitted he had no idea.  so he really didn't know what it was either, but said it appeared man-made.  i had no idea what it was and still don't know what it could be.  i woulf have not noticed it were it not for taking the photo as it was kind of tucked under the clouds and i was watching the sun.  eventually, after about 2 or 3 minutes, it went out of sight from my vantage point of looking out my plane portal window as the plane was still moving fast. \r\n\r\neveryone i've showed the photo to has been confused on what it could be, so i was hoping by submitting this, perhaps someone else saw the same thing, or you may have seen similar

it wasn't my parents but a very tall person, along with another that was the same size as me. i had this mental image as i walked to open my door. i saw exactly what i was imaging and was not scared at all. i never had seen these people before, but i did as they wanted. know-one spoke, but i could hear them talk to me in my head. my dad was sleeping in the other room. there was a blueish low light so i could see. i followed them to the hall closet.There was an access panel to the attic. i said i could not climb up. the tall man said,\"just try\" it was as i floated up in the air and and easily went through the hole. i was so excited,it was fun. then the small person went through the roof like it wasn't even there.So i followed him.As i started to got through,i got really scared and grabbed the ground wire that ran across the house.The wire broke and i fell back into the house. something bad happened to the small man. i didn't realize that he was badly hurt.I found out later it was the ground wire that caused a problem. the tall man reassured me and i went through the roof. it was like swimming through water.As i stood on top of my house, just looking around the neighborhood, i was amazed at all i could see. they must have replaced the small man with another person that was my size.He put a sleeve that loosely fit around my forearm.Then suddenly it conformed to my arm tightly. there was lights that i could see on this sleeve. red, green, blue, they were flashing. the tall man pushed the lights and we suddenly started going straight up. we got so high up that i was scared to death. there was absolutely nothing under our feet. i grabbed and held tightly on to the tall man's leg. just liked a son does to his dad's. he did not say a word and let me hold on to him. he knew how scared i was. i started to feel safe with him. we ended up in a room that had other kids walking all over.This was 1965, maybe 1966.That was what triggered my recall of events that had been surpressed in my sub-concious for all most 50 years.I have many bits of memory of things that happened.That's when i relized i had been taken many times before and after.","distance":"20

cigarette.  i was looking into the sky and noticed what i thought was a satellite.  it was fairly bright like the iss as it passed.  i was excited to see it as i rarely have seen satellites so clear and large. then, it stopped for a few seconds and began to back up.  after a few more seconds it began to zig zag back and forth in a slow but controlled pattern, before coming to a stop.  it looked to be pulsating or spinning very fast, a bright ball of light that was stationary. i looked at it with my telescope but it didn't look any different than with my naked eye.   i called my wife over to look at this object which was now stationary.  she could easily see it, as it looked similar to the stars that were out that night. i explained to her how it was moving and then backed up, zig zagged, and then stopped to where it was at the time i showed it to her.  she could tell i was excited but also concerned as i couldn't explain or imagine what this could be.  my wife suggested i call nasa which i did.  it was approximately 11 pm or 1130 pm but i was hoping she would suggest i call.   i was certain that this should be reported.  i looked up the local nasa phone number in our phone book. this was the year 2000 so it was before smart phones. i called the number and the call was answered by a woman.  i told her my name, my address, and described to her exactly what i saw and could still see in the sky.  she responded that this was more than likely a satellite and that they are commonly reported as ufos.  i asked her directly.  can a satellite stop, back up, zig zag, and then become stationary?  i knew the answer was no but wanted to hear it from her.  she said no that's not possible. i explained that this is exactly what i just witnessed and i can see it hovering like a pulsating star as i spoke to her on the phone.  i could tell she wanted to dismiss my call, but thanked me for my call. she didn't seem startled or even interested in what i was telling her on the phone.   we then hung up.  i looked at this object at least 3 more times that night before going to bed.   the next day to my complete shock i could still see this object in complete daylight.  it continued to look like it was spinning very fast or pulsating but wasn't omitting any light during the daytime.  for 3 days and 3 nights i observed this object above my home. and on the 4th day it was gone and i never saw it again.  i wish that this is all the info i had on our experiences. but this was just the first thing that we noticed.  over the course of the next few weeks, my wife and i were having the exact same dream that we were somehow paralyzed in bed but were fully aware and calm with our eyes open. and that disco lights were seen turning on the walls of our bedroom.   and then maybe once or twice a\r\nmonth i would wake up with my wife upset at me for having blades of grass al in the bed.  all over the sheets and attached to my legs as if i had walked around in the yard for a while and\r\njust climbed back into bed.  i have never sleep walked and have never to this day since sleep walked. \r\n\r\nafter a few weeks more my wife had discovered during the day at work that she remembered a dream that happened to her the night before.  she was on a spaceship with small alien beings surrounding her.  she was sitting in a dentist chair and the beings were speaking to her in demanding voices but not moving their mouths.  demanding that she stick out her finger.  of course she was afraid to but they kept demanding she do it.  when she remembered her dream she was at work the next day moving a shelf and bumped her finger. it was a normal bump but it caused her an overwhelming amount of pain for such a common amount of force.  she looked at her finger and saw that something was lodged under her fingernail and that's what caused so much pain.   the pain itself is what caused her to remember the dream as she had no recollection of this dream prior to bumping her finger.  they had implanted something under her index finger nail and she showed it to me.  i have no recollection of being on a space ship or seeing an alien. my only encounter was seeing this object in the sky, having the same recurring dream as my wife and waking up looking as if i walked around outside in the grass and got back into bed.  i would swear on a stack of bibles that these events occurred and none of this has been created in my mind.  i'm sure if you ask my wife she would attest to the same even though we have been divorced for a few years.  \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

family went to bed, i took the dog out for a walk, sometime around 11:15pm et, can't be sure of exact time i wasn't looking at the clock.  walked the dog around the back yard, it was a very clear night, was looking at the stars and saw nothing out of the ordinary.  walked to the front of the house and down the sidewalk of my street (typical residential neighborhood) for about 300 feet before turning around to walk back.  that is when i noticed a light through the trees.  i live near multiple small airports and assumed it was a low flying plane.\r\n\r\n2. i noticed a light through the trees along my street as i was walking back toward my house.  as i walked around the tree the object was in full view.  it was fairly low, i'm not sure of the exact angle above the horizon, but maybe just a little higher than i would fly my drone.\r\n\r\n3. when i first saw the light through the trees, i immediately thought it was a low flying aircraft, we have many of them, including a helicopter with a very bright light that flies a route near my house almost every night.  once i walked around the tree and saw the object in full view i knew it was not a \"normal\" aircraft.\r\n\r\n4. the object was a very bright orange colored light.  it moved at a constant speed from the south-west to the north-east, which put it roughly above and slightly behind/over my house as it moved across my field of view.  this also happens to be the approximate direction that most wind and storms move through our area, although i also noticed that there was not much wind/breeze at all outside (at least at ground level where i was) - it was a completely clear night.  the altitude did not seem to change at all, if i had to guess i would say it was between 1000-1500 ft but since i couldn't tell the size of the object that is only my best guess.  it just moved along at a constant speed and direction like it was on a wire, until it faded into the distance.  it was very quiet, i did not hear any engine noise at all, neither a drone of an airplane, nor the whir of drone motors, nothing.  the object was so bright, it looked like a twinkling light, meaning that light seemed to radiate from the center of it out in all directions.  it didn't pulsate or change brightness, but just had the radiating star-like effect because the light was so bright.  i also noticed that it was orange colored which struck me as odd since really bright lights are usually white or even blueish as is the case with some newer car headlights, yet this light was definitely orange, not deep orange like a pumpkin, yet decidedly of an orange color verses bright white.  many times i have seen bright white lights, which if watched long enough, resolve themselves to be airplanes which are viewed head on with very bright landing lights turned on.  this object, the entire time i watched it pass by me, had no strobing aircraft anti-collison lights anywhere, no red, no white, just the constant very bright sparkling orange light.  it was moving at a \"medium\" speed, i would say i was able to watch it for a 60-90 seconds as it crossed in front of me and continued off, fading in the distance.\r\n\r\n5. my reaction was surprise but not fear.  as i moved around the tree i expected to see airplane lights, as mentioned we have many where i live.  when i first realized that it was not the expected airplane lights, i still thought perhaps if i watched it long enough i would see a \"normal\" airplane marker (anti-collison) light, but the longer i watched, the more surprised i became that this was unlike anything i have ever seen before.  surprisingly i didn't feel scared since it seemed to be moving along it's own path and didn't turn towards me specifically.  i stood there on the sidewalk in amazement trying to figure what it could be.  i looked at my dog to see if she was reacting in any way (many times i have read that dogs react in fear to \"ufos\"), but she did not have any reaction at all, and didn't look at it.  i would describe myself as \"cautiously curious\" regarding ufos.  they are one of my favorite topics of interest, yet while part of me wants to know if they are real (can all those people reporting them be lying???), another part of me hopes they aren't real.  also, if they are \"real\", i don't know if they are possibly some earthly phenome - what i am trying to say is i am not a tin-foil hat wearing ufo nut.  i am also a scientist (bachelor of science in computer engineering) so i tend to approach things looking for a scientific explanation.  i myself have a dji phantom drone and i have a very bright led light i can attach and fly it around at night, so i am familiar with what that looks like (and even it has blinking marker lights).  i can't figure out how someone could float a balloon with enough power to be as sparkling bright as the object i saw.  also i don't think a balloon would move at the steady medium pace that this object did on a calm night.  but here is the strangest part to me...I just recently found a copy of the book \"project identification\" on ebay and have spent the last week reading it, and have almost completed it as i found it pretty fascinating (it is an account of an investigation of a ufo flap in the 1970's by a university physicist, no longer in print).  many (most?) of their \"ufos\" were similar to the sighting i just had.  i have had an interest/curiosity in ufos all my life, and i have talked to many people who claimed to have seen one, but i have never seen one.  as mentioned, i'm not a \"ufo nut\", i don't own any other \"ufo\" books, yet i buy this one, am absorbed all week reading it, then take my dog out for a walk and \"bam!\" i see an orange floating/sparking orb float by unlike anything i have ever seen in my life.  it just seems like the most amazing of coincidences (which, coincidentally, is what happens a lot in \"project identification\", many things the author calls \"coincidences\").  if anything disturbs me about this sighting, it is probably the weird timing that i would see something like this just when these types of sightings (glowing orbs, etc.) were on my mind.  last thing: i didn't have my cell phone or any other camera with me since i was only taking the dog out for a short walk.  i thought of running into the house for a video camera, but figured by the time i did so the \"object\" would already be fading from view.  i kept standing there trying to ascertain any clue as to what it could be, and was afraid i might miss something if i ran into the house for a camera (boy i wish i had one!).  unfortunately no such clue ever showed itself, just the same sparkling orange light the whole time.\r\n\r\n6. the object moved at a constant speed and seemingly in a straight line from south-west to north-east.  i watched it until it faded in the distance in the night sky.  it didn't disappear or wink out, it just faded into the distance.\r\n\r\ni have never submitted anything to mufon before, but maybe (hopefully) this will be helpful to someone.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and made a joke, \" hey look those are ufo's you just found \", as i really looked at them i noticed that they were not right and when they turned off then really not airplanes either. we live close to an afb and hear and see planes everyday as well as not being far from the sat airport. these lights were not in the right flight pattern to go either the afb nor the sat airport. they were flying towards us and to our right.  there were 2 lower and 2 higher and as they were flying one by one they turned off slowly. their lights kinda dimmed starting with the one in front then the next and so on. that's when i realized that they couldn't be planes. the last one that we saw would be the 4th one in the row and it came out  from where there was some lightning starting to happen in a cloud. the sky seemed clear other than that cloud that lightning was coming from.  now when the 3rd one went out(lights) we didn't see another so i took off driving back towards the house. as i got to highway 1604 we noticed another which was the 4th and so i pulled over after all the shops. so we were now totally in the dark so i could see better. i got out of my truck and watched as the 4th one went the same way as the other 3 and there were no clouds in the sky where their lights turned off. and then they were gone. i would have stayed to see if anything else would have happened but we had to leave for mother nature called and had to answer so i didn't see if anything else happened after that.

approximately 50 of us gathered to watch the sky and share at least 15 pairs of generation 3 military goggles provided by the host of the event.\r\n\r\nat approximately 10pm, a few people noticed a bright red-orange point of light glowing constantly bright, not blinking and moving from one field of view to another in between the two giant rocks and hills.  i and approximately 10 others joined the observers to catch a quick glimpse before it left our field of view.  \r\n\r\nat this time, for approximately 1-2 minutes i observed this light through the goggles.  the first thing i did was adjust the depth of field in the goggles. the goggles were in focus for high altitude focus, making the stars above look very clear. to view this object up close, i had to lens all the way to the closest depth to see the object clearly.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw during the time the focus was clear was a diamond shape with sides very close to being equal all the way around. i could see definition in the object enough to make out brighter areas in all four corners of the object and once more in the middle. in the spaces in-between, it glowed with less intensity.  once the object was out of view from being behind the rock, i immediately drew what i saw on paper and shared it with the event host. \r\n\r\napproximately one minute after, in the same area we saw the diamond craft fly from left to right in our view, now i saw three military air crafts following the same route. i am aware that military aircraft blink with multiple flashes in quick succession, whereas commercial and personal planes blink once.  this is how i came to my conclusion.\r\n\r\nmoments after we noticed the above mentioned aircrafts, a large bright light appearing red-orange emerged from over the hill we stood below. the light zoomed quickly over our heads at the height of approximately 1000 ft. i remember noticing that there was no sound coming from the light.\r\n\r\na moment later, following the light, emerged a military jet craft making loud noise as it flew by us. the jet seemed to be chasing the light. the light flew straight towards the hills to our other side and the jet chased it until they could not be seen with my physical sight.\r\n\r\none of the group participants using his own goggle recorded from his device a video, with no sound, showing the event. \r\n","distance":"101-500
