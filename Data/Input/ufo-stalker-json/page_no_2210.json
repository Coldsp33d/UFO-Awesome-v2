some of the lingering fireworks and a moving light caught my eye in the southern sky. just above the tree-line was a hovering object, composed of 5 glowing orange lights in a very tight pentagon shape. although my initial thought was that it was some sort of firework, as i continued to watch it, it didn't burn out as i would have expected a firework to.  in fact, the object continued to hover for a good three minutes, gliding slightly side to side, turned a little and then very slowly headed up.  during all this time the glowing orange lights did not dim or become lessened, although they rotated slightly as the object moved.  i still didn���t believe what i was seeing and ran back in to the house to get my husband.  at this point i was starting to believe i was seeing something not from this world and my heart was racing and i felt excited and a little scared.  by the time my husband came out, the object was still there, hovering. after we watched it for another 2-3 minutes, it continued to slowly glide up and gradually grew smaller as if it were getting farther away.  i said to my husband, \"oh, they're leaving\" - it looked as if it was a ship flying away.  and after a few more minutes finally became a tiny orange pinpoint of light and then it was too small to see.  i feel very intrigued by what i saw, and quite curious in thinking about what it might have been.  i've always been fascinated by the idea of visitors from other planets, but until tonight have not seen any first-hand evidence of it actually happening.  i only wish i hadn't been so caught up in watching and had thought to get my camera, as i do not have any physical documentation.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering

23rd, 2004. we were attending a patient in hayle. the doctor was in the patient's house while i remained outside with the vehicle. i was standing beside the car pouring a cup of coffee when i noticed a bright flash in the sky towards the north. i thought it was a shooting star, but when i looked in that direction i was astonished to see an object which i couldn't identify burst into light and begin moving across the sky towards me. it was visible for some fifteen seconds, during which time it traversed an arc of about forty five degrees, moving at a steady rate due south until it was directly overhead with me staring up at it. i was so surprised i didn't even notice i was spilling coffee all over my trousers and shoes! at that point the lights went out and it simply disappeared. i searched a very bright, clear, moonlit sky for several minutes, but couldn't even see a silhouette. i am an ex soldier with a very keen interest in aircraft. the profile of this object resembled nothing i have ever seen or read about. i can only liken it to the plan view of an aircraft carrier's angled flight deck. it was brilliantly lit by bright blue lights surrounding each one of multiple panels covering the underside of the object. the blue lights made it difficult to see what colour the rest of the object was, but i could clearly make out shape and structure. i saw no wings, rotors or engines - it flew over me making no sound at all. i recall saying aloud, 'what the **** am i looking at?' just before it vanished. i made a quick sketch of what i'd seen and noted the time - 2330. i still do the same job - long night shifts out on the road - and i spend a lot of time watching the sky.

moving very, very fast.  one of the adults was former captain in military (father 3 star general) and coments that it is like nothing he has ever seen in the military and they wouldnt be flying manuevers on july 4th evening.  also estimates craft is flying faster than the speed of sound.  craft is flying on straight path from beach and pretty much flies right over house and continues going in a atraight line (still about under clouds, in terms of altitude and about the size of our thumb in front of a cloud, so seemed pretty big is size) until we cannot see it any longer as it is too far off in the distance.  about 8 minutes goes by and exact same thing happens with another craft doing the exact same route.  another rough 8 minutes goes by and a 3rd time this same thing happens.  we are all pretty much going crazy in astonishment.  even all the kids are just in awe.  final 4th craft comes straight up from ocean/beach area (hard to tell as we do not have a direct view of the beach from house) and this one glows red and looks kind of like a very large orb.  at first we thought it may be part of a fireworks disply, but all the fireworks that we could see all end about the exact same height int he sky, way below the clouds.  this one just keeps slowly going up and up and finally though and over the cloulds alotogether.  that is when we knew it could not be a firework as it was way too high.  suddenly it just disapeared and that was it.  we waited outside about another 20 minutes but didnt see any more activity like this so called it an evening and went in.  everyone has spoken today and are all 100% convinced we witnessed some sort of ufo activity.  i decided to post this here in hopes maybe someone else saw what we did and has information.  also, on the beach today

none nearby and absolutely none visible anywhere near my house. to the east there was a solid red light about the size and brightness of the brightest star in the sky but not at big or bright as venus appears. i waited for the light to blink like a plane but it did not. i got my meade 400mm telescope and locked on quickly. it was simply a pinpoint of redlight not flickering. the most logical explanation would be a suspended flare but it did not flicker and from living at the beach for a decade this didn't look like those emergency flares as it was solid, extrememly high and not moving. after comparing it against background stars it did move very slowly horizontally about the same speed as the moon or even less. it really struck me as an impossible red satellite as it appeared that far out, but there aren't any. if it was a flare it would have been ten miles away and several miles up and burning like a super led. the light did fade away into the darkness like a satellite, not like a flickering flare. other people in el cajon ca saw three and four lights. with my horizon blocked by trees and houses i would only see the highest.  here are other witness accounts:

a firework but lasted too long, looked far away and very controlled movement then disappeared. at that point figured it may have been a satellite although really did not look like one.\r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes went by and saw it again, my daughter was with me thankfully because i would have thought i was going crazy if she did not see it also.\r\n\r\ntook a pic on my phone but it did not turn out

watching the fireworks from all over i hear my cousin go what the hell is that. when i looked up there were 4 glowing amber colored ojects fly in the sky with some distance in between them.We all seen it and people were like its helicopters but  they were way to high for that, i thought they were planes at first but they werent flashing and were very bright.My uncle was saying it could be missles but obvoulsy we would have heard bout that sometime after.They just flew north i belive following each other, they seem to be very high in the sky, and how i lost sight of them because of the trees and line of sight as they kept going, but one did look like it went more up than the others and just disappeared. if anyone else has seen hopefully some pictures will surface, my mother did take picturres but they did not come out very well and she erased them.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

very slowing.\r\nit was red/orange in color and started off very large. we kept watching it and it would get as small as a faint star, and then return very brightly.\r\n\r\nall the sudden there were two more objects, same in color and shape.\r\nthey were flying around each other in all different directions still moving east (i think it was east)\r\none would become fainter as if it was getting further away, the others brighter.\r\none continued to almost flicker out until it was gone, then another one.\r\nthe last one lingered for another 15 seconds before disappearing almost instantly.\r\n\r\nour initial reaction was that it was firework embers, but clearly it was not, it made no noise, although it was the fourth, so fireworks were going off.\r\n\r\nthe stopping and going, and direction changes of the objects were too swift and fast looking to be a plane, helicopter ect..\r\n\r\nand we decided we had never seen any aircraft that luminous in color.\r\nwe all knew what we saw....We were so hoping we were not the only ones!!! we have been on the internet since last night looking for anyone who saw something similar to what we did.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
