binoculars, when i focused in on the object i noticed that 1) it was not clouds, 2) it was tilted from my view point  left up and right down and it would slowly move like pivoting length wise but never completing a revolution, 3) it seemed to radiate a red/blue and silver color with the red becoming gold every few seconds, there was a light breeze and it never moved away from its position 4) there was no tower or any structure visible below it, it did not seem tethered, and it was over a heavily wooded area, there was a few people at the lookout taking picture with the background of the valley and i did not notice anyone else noticing, except a gentleman looking in the same direction with what looked like decent binoculars in an suv four cars over from where we parked he then rolled up his windows and started talking on a car phone, i continued to watch then i decided to go ask the man in suv and he had left. my girlfriend took a few pictures of object and surrounding area and i had her shoot a couple of shots through one of the binoculars eye pieces. i have pictures and hope to post them a total of 12 and posting the 3 allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nregards","distance":"Over One

expecting a storm to run through the area, it had not started raining yet and the power went out.\r\n\r\nmy wife headed outside to watch the storm, as i shut down the computer equipment and turned off backups.\r\n\r\ni went out on the front porch which has a fairly good view of the north. we like to watch storms roll in from there.\r\n\r\nit was still day light out and the clouds were fairly high and white at this point of the storm.\r\n\r\njust after the first or second lightning flash went off i saw something through the trees.\r\n\r\nas it moved into view it moved at a steady flat pace just below the clouds. \r\n\r\nit was in view for about 20-25 seconds, long enough for me to grab my wife and run to the other side of the porch for her to see it before it was hidden by trees & clouds. \r\n\r\ni am not an aviation expert but i'll describe what i saw comparing it to common items seen in the area. \r\n\r\nholding my thumb and forefinger out at arm���s length it was about 2 inches long. \r\n\r\na cessna plane that flies over frequently at a similar distance would be about a 1/4 inch or smaller.\r\n\r\ni was able to see it very clearly at first as it was below the clouds and i could see 2-3 lights in back and the same amount up front. i saw the body of the object fairly clearly; it was a pipe or a tube shape.\r\n\r\nthe angle it was at, i'd expect to see wings or more of the object, but there were none.\r\n\r\nit is uncommon to have aircraft fly this low in the area and when they do, it is usually small private jets and cesena type aircraft, all of which can be distinctly heard before being seen. \r\n\r\nthis object made no noise and traveled at a speed (once again comparing to a cessna), would be about 4-5 times the speed of a cesena, possibly more. it's very hard to put a size/distance to it. \r\n\r\nas it moved across my line of sight, it entered the lowest parts of the clouds still fairly visible. \r\n\r\nthe lights front and rear seemed to pulse, possibly flash, but it could have been because it was going through the translucent clouds. the lights were all white front and rear.\r\n\r\nit was traveling west to east approximately 5 miles north of highway 80 and i saw it east of fm 450 travelling toward marshall tx.\r\n\r\nthe object i saw had 3 maybe 4 lights that appeared to be round, the number of them was not something i was paying attention to at the time. what i was trying to remember is that the space filled with lights was equal front &/or rear was approximately 1/3 the total distance of the object.  at no time did i see any wings, or tail fins, or any other color of lights but white front and rear. \r\n\r\nthat is about it, not sure what it was but it was nothing i have ever seen before.\r\n\r\nthank you for

me and my nephew were at his house, prepping for an evening of stargazing.  we were at the car when we saw a light in the sky.First i dismissed it as a plane.On further inspection, we could not dermine what it was and did not seem to be a plane as it was stationary otherwise and then it was going back and forth.  this was a relatively still night.  no outlines of a plane to be seen.Just this white-bluish light south of us about 400-500 metres up.We were heading to where it was stationary so we decided to follow it.By then it had started to move south, out of town where we were going anyway for stargazing which i do quite frequently and see some strange things.  we managed to follow it for some time not ever really seeing what it was until it stopped above a wooded area, which we then promptly entered.We stopped the car in a little clearing and couldnt see the light object anymore.  we stayed there for awhile and then suddenly this red-orange, flash of light, came from the southeast sky to due north and just disappeard very quickly,lasted only about probably less than a minute i think.It went into the woods, it was very small, like a flare, but not.  i would have thought it a meteor, but a meteor that close as i saw it would have had to had a trail and being so close would have done damage and obviously been visible longer upon inspection.I was stunned at seeing something so close and obviously i tried to go through what it was.If it had been a flare of some sort, there would have been noise, and it would have gonu up or down not sideways.It was not a light bug as there are none in iceland.It was not a meteor or comet as this light was closer than a big meteor could be without destroying a vast area, disappered into the woods.  it was to quick to decide if it was man made or otherwis a constructed object, i can say it was a ball of lightning, which is sort of what it was,however, but they are extremely rare in this country, and would they travel in mid air going downward for a few meters, i dont know.I have so little to compare with. although we do have something called snowmoon that are sort of whispy lights during winter like swamp gas or balls of fire.\r\nnote.  i have numerous other accounts in those woods and in that general area, it is close to an airport, where people have seen things come on the radar and then disappear.People have been chased by balls of light in their cars and a few stories here and there from people who have had amazing experiences.  p.S there are 1 thunderstorms in this town every 10 years or so.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path

(as if it were a old fashioned photo flash bulb.) only very bright and much larger. \r\n\r\nwe both looked at each other. i slowed the car. i said did you see that? she said i saw the bright light flash 3 times but not at the same time, as if it was in a delayed pattern. i agreed.  we decided to pull over on the side of the shoulder to see if we could see anything more. \r\n\r\n i looked behind us and there was not a car in sight for miles but could see an overpass ahead. we pulled over to the shoulder on the right side of the road just past the overpass. we stopped the car and pulled to the side of the road but there was nothing. \r\n\r\nwe took off back onto the interstate. we were going about 50 miles hour increasing our speed when another bright flash occurred. closer this time almost touching the car hood, in front middle. \r\n\r\n the light floated to the passenger side of the vehicle almost as if it was hugging or surrounding the car. again it was off the ground above the car approximately at the height of the rear view mirror. the second blink 2 seconds later, a short surge of light was directly even with the car at the passenger window. the third flash again in a later 2 second delay pattern from the first. it was if something was flying like a very large lightening bug only with a very bright led light flash about the size of a volleyball. after each flash it appeared to have  a diamond shaped light or a cross formation as it dimmed out.Itseemed to hang over the car. \r\n\r\nwe kept driving in disbelief as to what we just saw. we never did see an object. just very bright orb like led lights in 3 sequential flashes but with a quicker delay between the 2nd & 3rd flash. 2 separate times. driving at that speed we were just dumb founded as to what it could be. especially after the second incident as it was in front of the car and we were traveling over 50 miles an hour but it seemed to mock our speed and hang in the air right with us. we never heard any odd sounds.

the house sits up on a bluff surrounded by trees. the way the house is situated on the property, as well the location of the property it is statistically improbable this was the result of fireworks. we live by mcchord afb and ft. lewis and they had festivities on base so no night flight activities there. our house is also on the approach to seatac airport (south to north)however yesterday they were on the north,south approach. moon rise had not occurred as of yet either. ok, now that i have tried to dispel the usual suspects let's get to the story. as i was saying. my mother and i were sitting on the back patio when she noticed a red spherical shaped object suddenly appear in the evening sky and move slowly and silently from east to west. this lasted about 1 minute when all of a sudden it flashed real bright stopped changed from east to west to a southwesterly slight climbing in altitude direction it flashed two more times very quickly not as luminous and just disappeared. ok, i am thinking this could have been a meteor skimming across the atmosphere before bouncing off into space. well i would have been fine and dandy with that explanation, until not even a minute later it reappeared in the same position doing exactly the same motions, except varying speed then coming to a complete stop. it flashed brightly and then changed direction climbing in altitude and heading due south. it flashed two more times although not as intensely bright then just disappeared. the whole duration lasted five minutes. from 21:59 to 22:04 pdt. i thought that was pretty fricken awesome, it was what happened afterwards that has me thinking this baby wasn't from anything we manufacture. because at 22:06 i saw a low orbiting satellite fly over going from south to north and at 22:08 a second low orbiting satellite flew over heading from west to east. i understand there is a lot of equipment flying around in orbit, and maybe this is just coincidence. but...At 22:16 a low flying aircraft was over the same general area as the ufo not a normal flight pattern and this was a jet. still coincidental? at 22:26 another jet this one smaller and older because the engines were louder not fighter more like an old 727. flew over the same general vicinity. at 22:28 a third aircraft this one a cessna sized aircraft flew around the same general area this time flying in a circle around the general area before moving on. after that the skies were quiet except for the fireworks in the background. the episode ended at

witnessed by mechanical engineering, logistics specialist, peace officer. seen on 07/04/2009 22:24 for 4 min 19 secs. if the moon were 12:00 the red object came out of the horizon at 07:30 then increased altitude steadily with the same speed and heading of direction (reason im not saying north south east or west is i was not familiar with the surroundings). at first glance thought to be red coast guard helicopter, but as it passed under the moon we could see it was creating its own red light. the red light was under the flat black angular ufo.The best description of the red glow like looking at red glowing moliton steel.The reason i use the tearm angular is,i cant explaine the shape of it. ive tried to sketch a drawing but i just cant seem to get it exact. i know what it is not. it was not the international space station because it was on ground side of the clowds. it was not a jet,helicopter,blimp,small air craft because it had no tracker beacon or vapor disturbance. it was not a hot air balloon because it was too fast and entering proximity of no fly zone of selfridge air national guard base. we lost sight of the ufo because of the buildings and tree line elevation. this was real it was unknown and it was in the air.The slang military/airman tearm for this is \"rock\"=rauc r=real a=airborn u=unknown c=craft.To describe my feelings i would have to say at first jumpy/shaky but within a few minutes after fulfillment/collected. when i got home at 02:44 i could not sleep untill after 06:00 and only slept for 3 or 4 hours. i will agree to the release of my

arrived at the corner i noticed this flashing green and red light over the city hall buildings. usually when i come to this corner i can see a large variety of airplanes, some with flashing lights, some with bright flashing lights, bright steady landing lights etc. this was not one of the usually lights i seen. we ran back to the house i grabbed my digital video camera and ran back up to see the lights. they were still flashing green then red, i took video for a few seconds but the zoom couldn't capture the shape, so i tried to move closer and grabbed some more video. i took 4 all together. i noticed the object shift to the left, unfortunately i didn't get this on video, but after it was in the new position, the only light i could see flashing was the red. at this point the object was not moving just staying in that spot, so we proceeded to get our pizza. came back out and crossed to the dollar store for drinks. looked up and object was still there, i grabbed another video and i asked some neighbors and walking pedestrians to acknowledge the light and ask what there opinions were. some said they thought it was part of the building until they realized the object was above the building, someone said it may be a helicopter, but i doubt it, i have seen helicopters and from that distance its noway a helicopter would be as big or as bright. hopefully you can analyze video and

the distance.  i told him yes, that was the color.  we sat in the back yard and continued to watch the sky.  within 20 minutes we seen another two from the north.  every time we would walk toward it

all the way to the horizon. i saw five very bright objects, relative to the size of bright stars, but brighter, hovering in the air. they appeared to be closer to the horizon than to my house. when i first saw them they were in a zig-zag pattern, like an elongated letter 'm'. i was curious, since i often look at the night sky and this formation did not look familliar, so i went outside to watch them. \r\ni watched them for more than half an hour. after watching them for a few minutes, i saw them start to move, in different directions. when they started moving, other objetcs appeared. i called my daughter out to look, and a few minutes later my whole family was watching. the objects changed formation while we watched. they formed a triangle, they formed a diamond, they formed a concave semi circle, they split into two groups, they came back to their 'm' pattern. sometimes, other lights appeared (we saw as many as 8 at one time), sometimes they dimmed so that only three were visible. it seemed that when they were moving, they got dimmer, but when they were hovering, they were brighter. a couple of the objects pulsated, and the color of the light quickly changed from white to red to white to red, etc.... \r\nwhile viewing these objects, i was awestruck at what i was seeing. i knew they were not stars or planets because of their independent movement from each other. i knew they were not aircraft because of the way they were hovering, motionless. if they were some sort of helicopter, i would have expected to hear them. when it was over, and all the lights dimmed, my skin as covered with goosebumps. we finally lost sight of the objects when some of them just blinked out, and others flew off in different directions and dimmed out. while the objects were dsispersing and dimming out, i heard the sound of an aircraft flying by, but did not see anything.\r\nusing a compass, from my porch their position was very close to exact north, maybe a degree or two to the west. i would very much like to speak to an investigator about this sighting.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

spring or summer. the night of the sighting was pleasant, the night skies were clear and beautiful-cloudless and stary.\r\nmy mother had taken our dog out into the front yard. she left the front door open so i heard her through our screen door say, \"what the hell is  \r\nthat?\" i got up and went outside immediately to see what was wrong. my mother pointed to the sky toward the east. at an altitude of about 3000 feet and a distance of about 2 miles,we saw a strange light in the sky- it is difficult to describe because i've never seen anything like it before or since. a moment or so after, my father came outside and saw the object as well. we saw three primary colors of red, green, and yellow surround- \r\ning the object. what was particularly strange was that the light had a vaporous, cloudy, luminescent, quality to it-a very eerie sight.We watched the object for what was probably a few minutes-it was not moving-\r\nit just hovered in one spot. my dad told me to \"get the binoculars\" which i did very quickly. we all took turns looking through the binoculars and \r\nit was then that i saw a white triangular shape inside the vaporous colors that were described earlier. the triangle shape couldn't be seen with the naked eye.During almost the entire time of the sighting, the object continued to hover almost 20 minutes. i had enough time to knock on neighbors doors and call my best friend who lived about a block away but strangely enough, noone was home. we continued to watch but then an airliner (probably a 707) flew into the airspace of the ufo. the plane was\r\non its final approach to linberg field in san diego. they must have gotten a really good look at it becasue as the plane decended, it parralleled the altitude of the ufo for a moment. suddenly, and for the first time the ufo moved at tremendous speed into deep space! within 7 seconds the object seemed to disappear into space. it was then that my father who then worked for rohr aircraft on military and commercial aircraft and satillites and even had security clearances for some of the more secret work then being done, said,\"well, we've just seen a ufo, we don't have anything that moves like that.\" this story is absolutely true and i hope you can send a record of this sighting to me -i have never had it verified.  the sighting took place from our home in san diego.\r\n gregory

to drift slowly south-eastward. i went inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars to look more closely at the lights but they didn't look much clearer though they were of an elongated triangular shape which i've seen before. a fourth light appeared to the east and began to pace the 3 lights, and on top of a nearby hill (dictionary hill) we saw a red flaring light on the top that almost seemed to be signaling the lights. around 9pm, when the fireworks were to start, the triangular lights formed a line, and the middle light faded quickly away. i predicted that the lights would probably be gone by the end of the fireworks display, and sure enough, by 9:15, they were gone. i did a search online this morning, and saw that such red lights have been sighted over el cajon on the 4th of july now

the night of june 30th 2009 (kingston ontario, 44.2 lat., -76.5 long) myself and my mate were walking our dogs at 12:00 midnight to 12:10. always being interested in the sky and keeping an eye open this night was perfect, clear sky's the moon just partly lit in the south west sky, when i noticed a glint in the southern sky at about 10 o'clock position looking west.\r\n\r\n\ti have seen lots of sat's give up there location to the setting sun glowing brightly and then going out. i watched this to see where it was going and how long it would last. it then got bigger and i figured i was looking at a plane headlight, but then it got longer so i asked my mate, what do you think of this light. she quickly looked up and we both watched as it got brighter and larger, looked like an hour glass on fire to me, how far off, no idea but it seemed a great distance, then after about 15 seconds it went out, just sort of a grey outline in the sky, so i thought wow that was some light show. it must be huge to look that bright down here and still be seen as an outline (looked to me like a bus flying through space, from where i stood) i thought, spacestation but it travels west to east i thought not south to north, i did assume thats what i must be seeing.. \r\n\r\n\tthen i noticed that there was a red light on the object. i thought, what in orbit would have a red light on it that i could see from here? then i noticed the red light was moving. it traveled a circular pattern as it it was mounted on the outside and was going around something. the object could not be seen, it was as if it was invisible, but the red light gave it away, it took about 5 seconds for the light to do one revolution (counter clockwise), i watched 3, 4 revolutions as the object was directly over head moving towards the north. no sound, nothing, just then i noticed, it was glowing on the top, i could not see the top but the air above it was lite up like the color of a sunset, pink, orange, red, i mentioned, look it's glowing at the back on top, just then a small orb came off of the larger object, this orb looked like an ember from a hot fire, about the size of a star, and just as bright. it made several loops behind the object (like an ember in the wind) , seemed to follow, but i watched the larger object due to the fact that if you took your eye away you could probably not locate it again, the object continued to the north with the light rotating. \r\n\r\n\tthe red light was the red of a tail light in a car or a jet, how fast would it have to have been going to go from sunlight to over my head in 25 seconds, then to the north and back out of sight in another 35 seconds? the circular path the light took was very large, i would say that if you held out a 5 inch disk at arms length it's about the size of the light path when the object was overhead. the whole event lasted about 50 seconds or so. i have never seen anything like this and i am in my 45th year here on earth. i will try to get my mate to submit what she saw. \r\n\r\n\tnever stop looking up you never know what you'll see ! james in

part of san diego. last night was the 4th of july, so around 8:30 i went to this tiny church on a hill, it's where my friends and i go to just sit around basically, and there's a great view of san diego from the spot. so we were up there waiting for fireworks and at about eight forty five one of us noticed three really bright red \"dots\" in the sky. they were flickering, not like a plane would but not like stars either, simply getting brighter and dimmer and brighter and dimmer. they simply sat in the sky for a minute or two, then started slowly moving, went directly over our heads, and eventually formed a very distinct triangle in front of us. then after about fifteen minutes they seemed to disperse from each other again and headed in a different direction. they moved slowly, about the speed they would go if they were drifting with wind currents, but they were moving with purpose. they moved away from us and got dimmer but were definitely still there. i'd guess that there was probably a light on one side of the object, and it rotated the light away from us making it seem duller. anyway, as they moved away, a fourth red object rose into our sights (it was blocked by the church until that point), and this one was as bright as the other three had originally been which makes me think that it had the light facing towards us? a few of my friends said that they saw one of the objects \"drop\" something dark, but i didn't see this.. a few also said that it looked like there was something \"behind\" the red lights, but i wear contacts which hinders my ability to pick out things like that. i ended up going home about when the 4th light came, which was probably around 9:15. i googled the red lights, and it seems like people have seen something very similar to them on the 4th of july in 2007 and 2008. so maybe they are some kind of government aircraft out there to regulate fireworks? i really don't know, i just know that these were not any kind of planes or flying object i had ever seen before.
