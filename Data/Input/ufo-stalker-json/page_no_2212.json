orange river in south africa's remote richtersveld national park. looking up at the sky, my attention was drawn to a bright yellow object moving from left to right across the night sky. i directed my friend's attention to the object and he saw it too, moving rapidly on a course parallell to the earth. i had it in vision for about 10 seconds before it changed direction and vanished into the sky. i was truly amazed to see this phenomenon, as it was the second sighting we had made at the same place within two years. the nature of this sighting was very similar to the first, which we made on an assignment in the richtersveld national park on november 21, 2007 at 10 pm and which i subsequently reported to ufoinfo.Com. the sighting made on june 24 2009 left us in absolutely no doubt that what we witnessed on both occasions was a ufo. \r\nthe area is hundreds of kilometers from the nearest airport and remote from any towns or air traffic.\r\nfor your interest, i attach the report of the first sighting we made on november 21,2007.\r\n\r\n\r\nlocation of sighting: richtersveld south africa. november 21,2007\r\nnumber of witnesses: 2 \r\nnumber of objects: 1 \r\nshape of objects: oval.\r\n \r\nfull description of event/sighting: an author, tim o'hagan and a journalist, geoff dalglish, doing a road trip through southern africa, were staying alone at a remote bush lodge on the banks of the orange river in the richtersveld when they saw an elliptical shaped object emanating a yellow/gold light move across the sky directly within their vision at an angle of about 70 degrees. the object had a trajectory that seemed parallel to the earth and this trajectory continued for about seven seconds. the object then turned south and seemed to maintain its parallel course before disappearing entirely in a nanosecond. both parties have no explanation for this sighting which was several hundred kilometers from any airport.\r\n\r\ni hope this information is useful to you,\r\n\r\nkind regards\r\n\r\ntimo'hagan\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

the sun shining reflection on it, suddenlly lights came out underneath this triangle, as of it had some kind of led lights underneath, then it left and another one showed up this time following a plane ...At this point i realised it was an ufo as it started flying around the plane. my son of 6 took my camera and made two pictures, while but it was quite far away at that moment so you would have to zoom it to see it, what you see as being white is the reflectionof the sun on the metal.\r\n\r\nit was a clear evening, the sun shining brightly, almost no clouds, and no birds something i'm

our direction.\r\nit was traveling in a north to south direction coming from the santa cruz side of bay towards monterey/seaside side of bay.\r\nat first i assumed it to be an inbound craft heading to the monterey airport as usual.\r\nthe color and was a bright orange color however and seemed to be a blurry sphere shape. nothing like the light from inbound craft - ever.\r\nas we live under a traffic pattern for the monterey airport i kept watching it and straining to see nav lights flashing.\r\nthere weren't any.\r\nas a side note; i used to fly, my father was a pilot and my older sibling as well. \r\ni've been watching planes fly in this area since i was little.\r\ni just expected this one to eventually look like all the others. it never did.\r\n\r\nat that point all of us began asking what it was as the flight characteristics were strange.\r\nspeed was hard to determine because the approach was coming straight towards us and it didn't hold a straight line. it wavered a bit a couple times and seemed to speed up and slow down a bit?\r\n\r\nestimated height appeared to be between three and four thousand feet but since craft size and true speed was undetermined that figure could be off mainly due to lack of experience witnessing anything of this nature before.\r\nthere was a twin engine plane circling the area at the same time and that craft appeared to be flying at about 12 to 1500 ft and the orange sphere appeared to be at least three to four times higher altitude.\r\n\r\nafter watching it's approach just over the coastline it began an accent. \r\nthe ascent didn't seem rapid but gradual. \r\ntowards end of assent it appeared to be going nearly vertical.\r\nas it did, the light grew dim quickly. \r\ni'd estimate about five to eight seconds then nothing.\r\n\r\nthe sky was still a bit light and had there been a typical craft there we'd have seen the silhouette against dusk sky even without nav lights. there was nothing to see however.\r\n\r\nas for the shape the best we could determine was sphere shaped.\r\nit seemed blurry as well.\r\n\r\nsadly, i have to add the following to this sighting to keep things open and balanced?\r\nthe sighting was made on the fourth of july. private fireworks are permitted in this area.\r\nsome fireworks were already beginning to appear at this early time of evening.\r\nthe fireworks of even the \"illegal\" variety only travel up a couple hundred feet at most over the houses in the immediate block where we live .\r\nthey only last mere seconds.\r\nthe light in question traveled horizontally long enough for me stare, ponder over it and ask questions to the family about it.\r\nhave them all turn to focus on it and to run inside to fetch a camera. the light during assent wasn't strong enough to show up however.\r\n\r\nfinally - this object made no sound. as it ascended a commercial jet much higher up going south to north was seen and could be heard.\r\nwe see those and military over this area all the time.\r\n\r\nperhaps they came to see the fireworks?\r\nour first ever ufo sighting!\r\n\r\njim p.\r\n","distance":"Over One

no anti collision lights - pictures and video were taken and will be added - the event lasted about 3 minutes, and it was not a firework. two of the adults are ex-military and very familiar with military craft. they both stated that what we were watching was not a plane or helicopter or any other conventional craft. the object moved slowly, with slow pulsing strobe of bright gold that would light the center of it. it was about three miles away and very beautiful. it seemed that the center was darker than the rest of the ship, and as it traveled, it went from a reddish color to an orange - the object appeared to be lit from inside - like a frosted glass shade on a lamp. there were 12 adults, most of us non-drinkers, and we had been watching fireworks in the distance and were alerted by the fact unlike the fireworks that had been going on all around the neighborhood, this object was moving horizontaly, did not explode, made no sound, and made a slow arc towards the west before it got so far away we could not see it. the flashing and the lack of anticollision lights as well as the shape and color set this craft apart from any of the aircraft we have ever seen. two of us noticed it at the same time and called out for the others to look and to stop setting off fireworks. we all stood in amazement, confusion, amazement, and fear -a few of us we excited and almost euphoric - feeling lucky to see it. we all discussed the object as it flew in the sky, ruling out every flying craft we could think of as we watched it. we lost sight of it when it flew out of sight.\r\n\r\nthe

half a mile west of a major interstate, in a country setting. there were approximately 20 people outside at the same time at this particular house. someone pointed an object out in the sky, to the south west of us.  at first we thought it was a plane due to the speed it was traveling and where it was located in the sky.(there is a small city airport nearby, and a larger airport in a city northwest of this area) if it had been a large airliner, we should have been able to see details of it, as it wasn't all that high in the sky, but we couldn't. almost at once, everyone realized it was quite bright, an orangish color, and looked like it had flames, or some kind of glare shooting out or off of the top, but it also appeared to be glowing.  at first i thought, oh no, this is a plane on fire and i thought it was looking for a place to land or it might crash but then i thought, well, this plane doesn't act like it's in trouble.  there wasn't any erratic movements, it just continued flying smoothly.  it seemed to be traveling south to north but as it passed by to the west of us, we were still unable to make out any distinguishing features.  at no point did it lose any altitude. we did not have any sun glare in our eyes as it was cloudy/overcast, we just couldn't see anything except the glare/brightness of the object.  the object continued to move north and then seemed to turn somewhat west and gain altitude, as it appeared to be stationary in the sky, but was getting smaller.  it looked like it was moving up and away from us.  we watched until we could no longer see anything at all.  (a second group of people next door appeared to be watching the object as well) i should also mention, that at no time, could we hear any noise during this whole event. i took one picture with my cell phone.  now, i don't know what to think it was. i do believe that there are other life forms we don't know about yet, but did this have anything to do with that?  i have no idea.\r\n\r\nthe attachment was taken with a samsung sch-u340 phone with a vga-camera.  the resolution was 320x240, the white balance was \"cloudy\", the quality was \"fine\", the color effects were \"normal\".  if you can open it, and then enlarge it, you will see what looks like a star with a reddish glow coming off the upper left corner.  it also appears to have some sort of heat signature emitting from the entire

10 degrees off horizon.  it was blinking very slowly but rhythmically.  the light was a very large, extremely white and extremely bright single source white light.  i would say the source of it as it blinked looked larger than 50' feet across.  it was only a few hundred feet off the ground.  no other little lights anywhere near it was observed. no other obvious airplane type wing tip lights were observed. the light source was so bright that we cannot see what generated it or what was behind the light source.  whenever it blinked, it looked like a giant starburst of pure white light and it looked to be just flashing rhythmically.  it did not change colors while it blinked along. the speed of it was quite slow as it moved along the freeway. i'd say no faster than 100mph.\r\n\r\nas we moved south on the freeway, the light slowly came closer and closer to us and finally it flew past us going northerly.  its altitude was at best 500 feet.   however, as it passed overhead, i opened the car window and could not see anything behind it and did not hear any noise beyond wind noise from the highway.  certainly, there were no helicopter blade noise nor were there engine noise.  it is highly doubtful at a mere few hundred feet that a normal single engine or other type of airplane engine noise would not be heard.\r\n\r\nit continued north after passing the car.  there were trucks and cars on the road at the time.  nobody stopped.  the incident lasted about 20-25 seconds from beginning to the point where it we cannot see it in the rear view mirror after it went northerly and passed us going southerly on the freeway.\r\n\r\nit doesn't look anything like a helicopter, single engine or any kind of jet plane.  it did not make any noise.  the white flashes were very large and extremely long.  it also held the white light much longer than a blinking flash would normally hold.  i'd say when it \"pulsed\", the bright light source was on for at least half a second to 1.5 seconds each time . then, it would be dark for about 1 second or less and it would blink again. the pulse itself looked at a distance to be wider than 50 feet.  certainly it did not look like a bulb or a wing tip light.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17782,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6259414,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07042009-0003","longitude":-97.1333453,"occurred":1246558500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1246558500000,"summary":"Extremely bright single source pulsing white light moving slowly over the freeway.

national security agency from 1991 to 1995. this is only the second time i've witnessed a sighting in real time.\r\nit was truly amazing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17781,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.491141,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07042009-0002","longitude":-114.3145648,"occurred":1246675500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was awakened by my dog who wanted to go out at approximately 4:25 am.  i let the dog out and went and got some water.  after a few minutes when the dog hadn't returned i stepped to the front door and called his name.  i turned and put on my shoes and stepped out onto my front porch to call for the dog.  as i did, i noticed small, round white lights in the woods surrounding my home. *i live in a fairly heavily wooded area of five acres* these were multiple, white lights that numbered probably 20 or more.  i initially thought they were flashlights but i realized some of the lights were high and others lower to the ground.  at this time i became aware that the lights were moving towards me and i felt a little frightened.  the dog came around the house and i told him to hurry.  the lights were still moving towards me and becoming closer.  my dog saw the lights and stopped and looked towards them.  i urged him to come and i hurried us into the house, closing the storm door behind me.  i turned back to the door and  some of the lights were quite close to me and the door.  one went right over where i would have been standing and i realized a breeze had come up and that some drops of fluid appeared on the glass of the door.  i couldn't figure out what i was seeing and even though it was odd and scary i couldn't move away from the door and continued to watch these round, white lights.  there seemed to be a pattern to them, almost an ebb and flow.  i changed my position slightly and saw deeper into the woods a fairly large red light.  i thought it was a police car at first and then realized the red light was not blinking like the lights of a police car.  i then heard brakes and towards the highway i saw a car come to a quick stop and i think whoever was in the car was seeing the same thing i was.  *which was a big relief!*  after several minutes the car on the highway pulled away.  i wanted to see the red light closer and so i grabbed my car keys and ran to my car and drove down  the end of my driveway. once i was at the end of the drive i realized that i couldn't see the red light any longer.  i looked up towards the sky and saw a large, brilliant white light.  at this point, i drove back to my house and was able to see a few of the smaller white lights that seemed to still float around the woods.  the smaller white lights seemed to be approximately the size of a baseball an smaller.  they were not identical in size.  \r\nthis experience lasted approximately 20 to 25 minutes.  i'm fairly sure of the duration as i was texting my sons who were gone for the week-end, telling them what i was seeing.  i wish i had thought to take a picture but i was so freaked out by what i was seeing that all i could manage to do was watch.  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500
