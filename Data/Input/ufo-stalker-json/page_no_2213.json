myself) were relaxing by the pool on a typical hot phoenix afternoon. while laying on a pool side lounge chair i noticed what appeared to be a star visible at mid-day in a bright cloudless sky. the object was a faint amber light that was difficult to see and i wondered how it would be possible to see any star in such daylight conditions. i removed my perscription sun glasses to view the object with my naked eyes just to ensure myself that the object was not an artifact caused by the lenses. the object was visisble to my normal vision also. i watched the object remain motionless for a few minutes and then noticed another faint amber light to the southwest of the object apparently appear out of thin air. the two objects then began to close on one another and appeared to get rather close and then seperate. it was at this time that i alerted my son, wife, and girl friend who were in the pool to look up to see if they could locate the objects i was pointing out. the women gave up looking after a few quick glances skyward. my son stuck with me and climbed out of the pool to sit behind me so i could point and direct his sight toward the objects. at  that time one of the objects began to change brightness and color becoming much more visible and he picked it up. the brighter object began an erratic zig zag pattern of decent, then climbing higher into the sky and then a movement toward the west. a high flying airliner became visible as it flew west to east and we could easily estimate that the objects we were viewing were much higher than the aircraft which appeared to be above 35k feet.\r\n\r\nwe commented back and forth about what the objects might be as two or three other small amber lights appeared in that portion of the sky. we ruled out satelites because of the motions the objects were exhibiting, as well as birds catching sunlight. we were convinced that the objects were intelligently controlled, very high and wondered if they were experimental aircraft. then one of the objects began exhibiting a strange flight that resembled a bow-tie or highly angular object floating down from a high altitutde like a leaf falling from a tree on a windy day. the object grew brighter and changed (flickered) from white to blue to green to orange back to bright white and blue as it seemed to decend closer to us. we both were very excited by what we were seeing as well as confused and filled with more than a bit of wonder as to what they were and what it might mean. we viewed the objects for up to a half an hour before the objects appeared to increase in altitude and move out of sight to the west. \r\n\r\nwe had a camera available but because of the daylight conditions and the apparent size of the objects in the sky, i believed we had no chance of actually getting a decent shot so i never tried to take a picture.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

(dusk) when suddenly on the outskirts of town we observed what i thought to be an ingenious 4th of july stunt. as it became closer i realized we were seeing something truly unique. yes, a real ufo! the craft had a dark mass underneath and a bright orange/yellow bright light spuing out an aura of same. it continued at a steady speed approximately 70 mph at about 500 feet in height. i could not pull over so continued on as it passed directly over our vehicle. wife put her head out of the window, looking straight up at the bottom of the craft, and saw what i have drawn, the bottom was flutted black/gray with indentations, with a round, bright light of orange/yellow in the middle and she probably got the best view of it. i then found a parking lot, pulled in, ran out and grabbed the binoculars. the height of the craft had increased by this time to about 800 feet and i zeroed in on it. the bright, flaring light had dimmed to a ring of continuous light of the same vibrant red/orange color and distinctive black round disk-like rearend. there was no noise. it gained in altitude to about 1500 feet and my wife said it made a slight curve (turn) but maintained speed. just then another motorist pulled in beside us to ask- what the heck is that??!! he and his son saw it too. i watched as it disappeared out of sight, and gained more height. there is no reasonable explanation for this sighting. it had no wings so that its slow speed would invariably send it stalling to the ground. no balloon i know of could have such a varied light show this displayed with such intensity. i am a recreational pilot, and have a good sense of height and size. the size was approximately 30 feet in diameter.","distance":"101-500

live within 75 miles of seymour-johnson afb and cherry point marine air station so jet contrails are common place, but had never seen the large number i saw that afternoon (approx. 12 jets).  the contrails were very high in the sky.  i noticed what appeared to be a contrail that looked different than the others in that it was blunt on both ends, not narrow just behind the jet and wider as the jet moved away.  i could see the jets just in front of the other contrails but not this one.  it looked so unusual that i pulled over and got out of my truck so i could watch it a little closer.  i then realized that this one particular contrail was much lower to the ground than the others and it was still blunt on both ends and was not growing longer as a normal jet contrail would as the jet moved through the air.  as i said, i could not see any jet near this contrail.  as i looked at it i realized that it wasn't a contrail at all, but was a mettalic looking object, silver gray in color, just hanging (hovering) in the air.  i could see what appeared to be facets along the edge.  it was about the size and shape of a silver dollar held out at arm's length and the right side was approximately 45 degree angle from the ground.  i could not believe what i was seeing, but the longer i watched it the more certain that i was that it was some kind of a flying craft.  it did not appear to have a dome on top like pictures i have seen.  it was flat on top and bottom and appeared to be disk shaped and i was looking directly at the edge (side).  while i was watching this the jets were continuing to criscross the sky but at a much higher elevation that the object i was seeing.  it seemed as if the jets were searching for something.  i watched it for about two minutes more and it began to shorten on both ends untill it was gone.  i assumed that it traveled directly away from me at a high rate of speed and this is what made it appear to \"shorten\" on both ends.  the sun had just gone beneath the horizen but the sky was completely bright so my visability was very good.  there was no glare from the sun and no clouds - a beautiful day.  i never reported it and never saw

observed literally was a perfectly round, black spot that changed shape to a thin line and back again, with a period of about 5 seconds. it looked to me a like a disc that was rotating about its planar axis, to give the appearance of a spot that was alternating its shape with that of a thin line. it was travelling along the direction of its axis of rotation, towards the north before it got lost to my vision behind other buildings and trees. i tried to find it again after getting on my motorcycle and heading north, but to no avail. as i mentioned, it's speed was relativity slow, and it was not moving in a straight line. it was meandering and hovering, but it's general direction was north.\r\n\r\nfrom its movement, i estimate that it was about 1km away and had a diameter of 50-100

the star-like entity grew to incredible brightness whereby a large halo of light surrounded it.  shortly after comments of awe from my son and fiance, it began to dim as it traveled n reaching about 1

this place because it is a good location for star gazing as well as ufo hunting. i had not seen anything that i would call a ufo until the past several weeks.\r\n\r\ni believe the first ufo sightings i had at this location started on june 6, 2009. i saw several objects that looked like stars except for the fact that they were moving and changing brightness. i assumed what i was seeing were satellites until i got on nasas website and did some research on visible satellites.\r\n\r\nafter doing my research, i realized that what i was seeing did not fit the criteria for orbiting satellites.  for one thing, the objects i was seeing were traveling across the sky faster than what nasas website showed most satellites travel. another thing that seemed strange was the fact that almost all of the objects i saw changed brightness as they moved across the sky.  several of them would periodically get so bright that they would look to be several times the brightness of venus.  when the objects increased in brightness it also appeared that their size was increasing.  i would estimate the size to be 3 to 4 times the size of venus when looking through 10x binoculars.\r\n\r\nmost of the objects i saw traveled in a straight path across the sky until they got so dim that i couldn't see them anymore. one object did move from off of its straight line course and changed direction. i knew that this particular object could not be a satellite.\r\n\r\non june 26, 2009, i saw 8 of these objects between 10:00-10:40pm cdt. this is another thing that made me think that these can't all be satellites because i don't believe that 8 satellites would have orbital paths that would take them over the same location in that short a period of time.\r\n\r\nthe reason i sited the date of the event as june 27, 2009, is because that night i was able to get a short video of one of the objects on a camcorder i borrowed from my brother.\r\n\r\nas of monday, june 29, i am still seeing the objects. i plan to continue to go to the sight to try and gather more video evidence.","distance":"Over One

the pool enjoying the sun (108f that day) when the sun finally set my gf and i enjoyed some quality time sitting on my extended patio looking up into the night sky. i was remembering my childhood and those summer nights spent hunting for satellites, looking for planets, and watching the jets come into sfo doing their modesto three arrivals of which i was just a part of as i recently flew in on a delta flight from jfk-sfo. the coolest thing was actually counting 8 satellites of which 3 were circumpolar. my gf is a nurse and had to get up early on monday morning so she asked if i wouldn't mind if she laid down for a bit because she was tired. so she goes in the house, i grab my favourite recliner and lay back to count more satellites. i had an idea to grab my night vision binoculars and did. i love the night sky and have been looking at it since i was a boy. i decided to put them away after about ten minutes and went back to just looking straight up with my naked eye. just then out of the corner of my eye i see something that grabs my attention. at first i thought, what a big bird that is, then after looking at it more intensely i decided it was a bunch of orange ballons drifting from nw to sw. as i lookedmore i realized that there was not any wind at so at because of the record 108 temps we had that day. so, i stared and stared even saying out loud, \"what the hell is that?\" what i saw had fuzzy edges, but also like it was made up of objects that were round glowing orange like when metal is heated. it moved so elegant and so straight. not fast, and not too high because of the duration that i saw it (25 secs) also, it did not disappear of trees but rather into the haze of the night sky. funny thing, satellites never go all the way across the sky because at some point they are no longer in a direct path of the sun to reflect light. i was so excited with seeing this thing that i ran into the house and woke my gf up telling her every detail. again, orange, glowing appearance, moving in straight line, not too fast but elegantly, made up of circular round looking light sources, and disappeared into the haze of the sky. i'd like to hear any explaination

east.  as soon as i got on the road i noticed a blinking light i figured it was some plane and didn't think to much about it. when i first saw the object it was about eight miles.I kept driving and the object seemed to be stationary and it wasn't moving. i got within a mile or so the  object started moving at a cars speed.  it was following the road and there was alot traffic going east and west. i saw the object had a blinking light on the top of it i figured it was probably a helicopter.  i kept driving and then i noticed the object started to slow down a little.  then i driving right next to it and then i knew it was something else.  it had the blinking light on the top and then it had five lights underneath it.  the lights were going around in a pattern i have never seen before.  about six to five miles away from getting on to u.S. 27 the object crossed the road and started heading north i turn to look at the road and i looked back and it was gone.  i never got a good look to see what the object's shape because it was already dark outside.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

out on my 3rd story appartment balcony to enjoy a cigarette, and my eyes were immediatley drawn to the horizon to the east, where i saw a huge dark object, like a cigar laying horizontally, and it seemed to slowly float, it was more like a bouncing or skipping, but it almost seemed to move in slow motion.  i've never seen anything move like that in my life.\r\n\r\ni yelled for my girlfriend and my 7 year old son to come outside and look to make sure i was seeing what i was seeing, they were both stunned and had no idea what it could have been.\r\n\r\nwe were watching it float from north to south togeather for about 1 minute, and then it dissapeared.  literally just dissapeared.  no lights turned on, nothing.  it was there, plain as day, then it was gone.\r\n\r\ni called eppley airfield & the local police station to ask them if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the sky, because i had, and the operator snickered and told me no.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was like nothing i've ever seen, and i hope everyone gets a chance some day to have the same experience.  it was very exciting, it made me feel like a giddy little kid.\r\n\r\nnow that i have seen one, its very frustrating to me how people just laugh it off.  even when a report is so credible that it makes it to the evening news, every time, the anchorpeople laugh it up & don't take it seriously causing the people watching not to take it seriouly.
