it was very obvious in contrast to the jet, that the second object was capable of shifting speed/breaking quite easily.\r\n\r\n2) the second object left no contrail. now i am not a pilot, and i have not found one to confirm my suspicion, but i would think that if two aircraft were high enough for one to leave contrails, the other would also leave contrails.\r\n\r\ni pointed out the phenomenon to my wife, she confirmed that she also saw the same strange contrast between the two objects. this lasted about 30 seconds?

on i-70 and just got into the vail area just between avon and vail. as i was looking around enjoying the beautiful views a shiny metallic looking object somewhat similar to a cigar caught my attention. at first i thought maybe i was seeing a planes reflection from the sunlight. i continued looking in that direction again just enjoying the view, but the object didn't move. i watched the object for several minutes just waiting to see some movement like a plane or helicopter but to my surprise it did no such thing. i then thought, \"ok, maybe it's some sort of balloon. still nothing. i was puzzled and mentioned it to my brother. i continued to watch but no movement. i then said to my brother, \"you have to look at this. it's still there. what do you think it is?\" i took the wheel (although dangerous of course) and steered the car so he could bend over to look out the front passenger window.  i was telling him where to look saying \"see! it's just south, maybe southeast between the moon and the mountain top.\" he then saw it and said, \"yep. it's there.\" i glanced at the road to regain bearing as we're driving then bent over and looked again. he said, \"no kidding, it's just not moving and it looks like it's several miles away\". he took the wheel back and i again just continued to watch the object as we continued traveling east on i-70. i then said, tell me what you see. i think it's looks kind metallic, and long with rounded ends. that doesn't look like a plane, helicopter or even a balloon as far as i can tell.\" i took the wheel again and my brother bent over and looked at object again. \"your right\" my brother said. it doesn't seem to moving at all. it looks what you said, long and cylindrical or something. he took the wheel again and i continued to watch as we passed through vail and were climbing the pass. i said, \"it's just not moving, not up, not down, not sideways, nothing. whats south of here that would be launching something like a weather balloon or something. my brother said \"nothing\". i just can't think of anything that would be south of here in that area. hell it seems like it about 15 to 20 miles away judging from the mountain tops, trees and the moon in the sky\". i had agreed. i just could think of anything that might explain why something appeared to be floating and stationary for long. the moon was very lightly lit as it was still daylight. it was a crested moon. the object looked to be about half way between the moon and the top(s) of the mountains. you could see the outline of trees across the mountain tops, slender sticks if you will. my brother and i tried to asses how big it was. we both agreed that if it were right above the treeline that we could clearly see, it would probably cover 30 or so, as you could tell it was set back several miles away. my brother said, \"damn, if we gave the base circumference of a tree around 30 feet, that's the branches and everything, i bet that thing would span the length of 30 trees or so. that's definitely bigger that a football field\". i replied, no kidding. i bet would cover at least 30 trees if not more from end to end. i lost view as we climbed vail pass. my brother and i are native to colorado and have traveled i-70 both directions from denver to grand junction and many other places quite a lot considering i'm 44 and my brother is 48. i have traveled many time by plane, quite frequent in fact do my some of my employment and i am pretty familiar with the flight paths. you do see a lot of air traffic in that general direction for lets say seattle for instance or portland, you get the idea. the flight paths are quite high, mostly around 35,000 feet direct flights.  this object only seemed to be a few miles in the air, 15,000 to 20,000 feet if i had to guess, and again, several miles away. i think i've covered all the details. thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n\"r\" [cms/tg/pid]","distance":"Over One

the stars and watching for satellites when my husband pointed up toward the northeast sky.  when i turned to look i saw a faint dot, like a satellite or faint star, which was brightening to an intense whitish blue light.  the brightness was more intense than a jetliner head on in the night, more like a helicopter spotlight.  the object was too far in the sky to be an airplane or helicopter and it was moving from north to south.  the brightness lasted for about fifteen seconds then it diminished and again resembled a satellite or faint star as it changed direction and began heading up and eastward away from us until it disappeared.  it was about 3/4 up from the ground and appeared to be at the same height as satellites are normally seen.  at the time my husband noticed the object we were discussing possible new job plans and just as i said, \"seems like we are supposed to be on a different path\" he pointed to the object.  he said it looked like the object turned toward us, like a flashlight that is pointed away and then turns straight at you.  we would just like to know what it was.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

to see if there was any clouds, which there wasn't. it was then that i spotted the two objects traveling toward me. at first, i thought it was two planes, possible military so i decided to stand there and wait to see what kind they were. they looked about the height that a military plane would fly, but the sun was reflecting off of them so i couldn't see the bodies of the objects. i watched, and then got the surprise of my life. one, the first one, sped up and then stopped in midair. the second continuing at the it's speed, caught up to the first. then the first repeated the speeding up and hovering. the second caught up again and then made a sharp right going from w to straight s in the blink of an eye. the first then pulled ahead and stopped. i tried to see the one going s, but it wasn't visable, just like looking into empty sky. then i started to watch the hovering one. about that time my dog came barreling up and i took my eyes off of the whatever for a second, looking back up again and it wasn't visable. both objects were moving about the speed of a commercial plane when i first saw them. i didn't know what i was looking at, but since then i've done some computer searching and found what i think it is. i believe it is the tr-3b, the plane that can hover indefinately and reach mach 9. it could have been a photo shoot or just an escort following it. i've seen a triangle (which has been reported) back in the late 69-70's up fairly close. that one still has me puzzled. so far, i haven't seen the cigar, wingless kind- but if i did, i would wonder if it was the canadian monolith that flew a couple years back. as for seeing the objects and then seeing blue sky, our goverment must be using alot of reflective paint-$2500 per gallon. that is gleaned from both tv and the computer. all this did is fuel my curosity, wanting to know the truth- goverment black projects or alien.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I want to make it very clear that what i am about to write is 100% true. i don't care about alien fanatics, but i do care about the truth. just 40 minutes ago, i was about to fall asleep sleep when i noticed an unusually bright star outside my window. i have seen two ufos near my home before, so i knew i had to take a better look at what it was. one of the previous ufos i had seen, just like the one i saw 40 minutes ago, was a star-like object, but as soon as i stepped out of my car to take a good luck at what it was i was seeing, it shot off into one direction at an incredible speed. when it took off, the string of light curved into the shape of the letter \"c\". this occured last summer, but i did not report it. the other ufo i saw, was a black triangle that had no visible lights (almost like it was trying to remain unseen). i saw it three years ago (between march-april). me and my ex-wife exited the backdoor of our house and walked towards my car (this was around 9:00-10:00pm). the sky was grey and completely covered with clouds. for some reason, i had the instinct that something was above me, and to my amazement, i saw this black triangle hover across the sky, under the clouds- at a very low alitutude and with complete silence. it moved slow enough that i could clearly see it in contrast to the grey sky above, but because it had no lights, i had a feeling that it was a foreign object not from this world. it felt unreal watching it, and in a way, i think it traumatized me because it put me into a state of disbelief. i watched it closely as it passed by (straight above me) and disappeared in about 20-30 seconds into the dark, grey sky that lied ahead. i wanted to tell you about these events because i strongly believe that after seeing what i saw just moments ago, that this area (around atlantic city/pleasantville), has undeniable ufo events that are taking place. i am 22 years old and very smart, so i will try my best to make this report brief and bring it down to a human level for good comprehension. \r\n\r\nit was 4:40am and i had just put my ipod away. i was listening to some good, heartfelt music. immediately after turning it off, i put my head down, ready to go to sleep. then, for some reason, i thought i saw something outside that i should check.  it was just a light that i figured would end up being a plane or some bright star or planet. then, when i moved the blinds, i realized that it was just a star. or so i thought. \r\n\r\nso i kept looking at this star, thinking to myself, why is this the only star in the sky? i mean, i looked around and only saw one real star in the background, but it looked completely stationary, as it should. so as i let a minute pass by, i realized that the light wasn't stayng the same. at moments, it seemed to get brighter, then just a tiny bit more dim. maybe, possibly, a star does this. but after the next few things i realized, i knew that this phenomenom was something that could not be dismissed. remind you, it was late (and it's still late), i wouldn't have gazed for so long if i didn't think it was a cause for alarm. so, there i am, looking at this big, bright star in the sky. as i looked harder (while holding my breath to make sure the object wasn't moving because of me), i noticed one blinking light on the left side. then i saw a brighter blinking light on the right, except when the right side blinking, it looked like a dim, white beam went from right to left straight to where the blinking light was. while i'm noting this in my mind in awe, i realize that it looks like it's hovering from right to left and up and down and so on. it was not completgely still. in fact, it was moving. just not dramtically like the first star-like object i saw in the sky just last year (around this very time). i began to think that maybe this was a news chopper getting an oversight of the atlantic city skyline. but then i began to think, \"how can that be? it's freakin' 4:40am and it stil very dark outside. in fact, it was dark enough that, the object i was looking at looked like the northern star (in comparison). but two answers must be answered and i think i already know the answers to them. first, \"isn't a chopper or plane required to have clear, visible lights blinking in a set sequence? also, isn't it spposed to have distinct colors like blue or red to identify it as an aircraft?\" this helicopter idea had to be ruled out right then and there, because i knew that the one blinking light on the left was far too dim to identify it as plane because i had to really look at this thing to even realize it was blinking. also, the other blinking light on the right was not set to a perfect sequence or timing. it came off and on, but again, much too slow to identify it as some type of human aircraft. the minutes were flying by, and at this point, i wanted to get a pic or vid. but my camera phone's quality was too crappy, and me being a truth freak, i hate watching ufo vids that aren't clear for they still give the reason of a doubt. i watched the hovering object until the night became day, and soon enough, the star-like object could not be seen. 5:20am is when i lost sight. as a note, i'd like to add that the object had several random tiny specks of light blinking all around it, but they were much too small to describe with complete accuracy. there was one moment where i saw a dim, white glow around the bottom of the star-like object. it continued to move up/down, right/left while gradually moving up the sky, higher and higher- like the sun, moon, and stars would. but if that was an alien spacecraft, wouldn't it be likely that they would use the glow of white light to fool a human into thinking that what they seeing was the northern star or venus or something easily explained but not proved. also, the gradual movement up the sky tells me that whoever controlled this thing, knew what they were doing and have probably done it for a long time and many times before. \r\n\r\nthis event is described to the best of my knowledge and i want a response with possible conclusions and or clues to what this star-like object was. i am here to help as much as possible. in fact, tomorrow night, i will watch the sky around the same time, and have my video cam ready for quality footage. \r\n\r\nnote: i completely ruled out the ideas of a helicopter, plane, flare, star, planet, comet, meteor, shooting star, satellite, or the international space station. since the object was hovering several centimeters horizontally and vertically (from my point of view) and not stationary or still as a \"real\" star would, i ruled out the possiblity of it being  a star or planet. again, it clearly and definitely moved horizontally and vertically in 2-3 centimeter length, but this was from my point of view and it can also be concluded that as far as the object must have been, those centimeters could have easily been many feet in length. now, since the object was not constantly moving in one direction across the sky, it can be concluded that it was neither a satellite, comet, meteor, shooting star, \"space station\", plane, helicopter, or flare. this object was hovering in the air at a very high alititude for over 30 minutes before disappearing with the morning sunlight.
