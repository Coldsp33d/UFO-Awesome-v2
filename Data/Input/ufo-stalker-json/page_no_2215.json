outside to have a smoke. i kept the patio lights off in order to keep the bugs away, and to better see shooting stars.\r\n\r\nafter gazing at the sky for about 5 minutes a drifting object caught my eye. it was moving west at a slow pace, with no lights on, and it did not make much of a sound like most aircrafts would. i live next to the west palm beach airport and i am aware of the sound of most

change.\r\n\r\nthe object was triangular with almost like a circle inside the triangle. i watched as it made it's way west until it stopped, and accelerated backwards as if it saw me see it. i couldn't do much but shake and listen to my own heart pounding as the triangular object hovered almost directly above me. then it began to sort of dance in the sky, my initial reaction was that they didn't know where or which direction they wanted to go. but it stayed in a general area above me drifting north, then south, east and west. i knew for sure at that point that it wasn't any aircraft belong to us. silently this object danced in the sky for about 3 minutes. i then decided to get my camera, but being so terrified i couldnt even think straight enough to do so. i ran inside searched for my phone and called a friend. after i returned outside to see if it was there still, it was gone.\r\n\r\nnow that i think about it, it seems that they wanted me to see them, as if to confirm all

these lines, intending to contribute in some way in the ufo research, more than by any another motive. what i do tell from now on  really happened.\r\n\r\nwas more or less, 11:00pm in the night in middle part of 1974. i was 15 years old then. arrived at home in a calm and starry night... when i look at the high sky, i saw a big ball of an yellowish light like a big brilliant ring dislocating slowly of northeast for southeast, followed by many other full colored lights smaller in size than that first one. the colors and tones varied of the alive red to the many scales of the blue. i do not remember certainly from the quantity of lights, but i am able to say that were more of ten. the lights were blurry, foggy, as in a sign of neon, and they passed to impression of something strange, unknown...\r\n\r\ni began to cry to my mother, she was sleeping in that moment. meanwhile, the lights enlivened decreasing the altitude (i saw it because near from my house there is a quarry of some 800m of height and the airport is relativamente nearby and we could observe the airplanes in the raising flight). \r\ni thought that the lights was dislocating themselves to, at least, some 1500m of altitude, without any noise. only my frightened shouts broke the calm of that hot night of vit���ria, capital city of the esp���rito santo state. my mother still living at the same place, called joane d' arc, in vit���ria.\r\n\r\nin the following day,  the tv news, that covers all the country, i remember of the announcer narrating the event in short and laconic way. he said in the note that the objects had been observed dislocating from the north from the bahia state in direction to the esp���rito santo and rio de janeiro states... i remember well that in the newspaper of the following day - the headlines alluded the facts, and a note said that an inhabitant from a city called serra, a mountainous city  near vit���ria - that is in a plateau. the note said that a man observed everything with binoculars.\r\n\r\nsome years later, already adult, i was in the vit���ria public archives, looking for newspapers from the epoch to find the correct day of the fact, but it did not succeed. after very i looked for, i gave it up and no more i tryed...\r\n\r\ntoday, passed so many years, i continue remembering that night . what i saw, was not something i already had seen before. that experience went very awesome and decisive in my life. i read and research everything  about these strange phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nthese are my memories.\r\n\r\ni would like that you did a research to verify to truthfulness of these facts. i apologize by do not be able to say the correct date. but, in fact, it happened.\r\n\r\ni take advantage of this moment to thank you for the attention and i say good-bye putting myself to the his entire arrangement.\r\n\r\nvery best regards,\r\n\r\nd.A.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nprezados srs., \r\n\r\neram, mais ou menos, 11 horas da noite em meados do ano de 1974. eu tinha 15 anos ent���o. chegara a casa aquela noite calma e estrelada e...Ao olhar para o c���u, v��� uma grande bola, de uma luz amarelada e brilhante que se deslocava lentamente de nordeste para sudeste, seguida de muitas outras luzes menores de todas as cores e matizes, que variavam do vermelho vivo, ao azul esverdeado.\r\n\r\nn���o me lembro ao certo da quantidade de luzes, mas posso dizer que eram mais de dez pontos brilhantes que voavam em forma������o perfeita e sem nenhum ru���do.\r\n\r\ncomecei a gritar por minha m���e, que j��� estava dormindo ���quela hora, a nossa pequena casa estava toda ���s escuras. as luzes movimentavam-se ��� baixa altitude ( calculei isto porque pr���ximo havia uma pedreira de uns 800 metros de altura e o aeroporto ��� relativamente perto e pod���amos observar os avi���es ao levantar v���o). imaginei que as luzes deslocavam-se a, pelo menos, uns 1500 metros de altitude, sem nenhum ru���do. somente os meus gritos asustados quebravam a monotonia daquela noite quente de vit���ria, capital do esp���rito santo.\r\n\r\no bairro onde mora aindo hoje a minha m���e fica na ilha de vit���ria, chama-se joana d'arc.\r\n\r\nno dia seguinte, assistindo o jornal nacional, importante notici���rio de tv, que cobre todo o brazil, lembro-me do locutor anunciando o evento de forma lac���nica e breve. dizia ele na nota que os objetos foram observados deslocando-se do norte da bahia em dire������o ao esp���rito santo e rio de janeiro...\r\n\r\nalguns anos mais tarde, j��� adulto, estive no arquivo p���blico de vit���ria, procurando jornais da ���poca para certificar-me do dia correto em que o fato se dera, pois n���o conseguia recordar a data correta. depois de muito procurar, desist��� e n���o mais tentei...\r\n\r\nhoje, passados tantos anos, continuo com a lembran���a viva daquela noite. o que observei n���o se parecia com nada que j��� tivesse visto.\r\n\r\naquela experi���ncia foi muito marcante e decisiva em minha vida. at��� hoje leio e pesquiso tudo que posso sobre estes estranhos fen���menos.\r\n\r\nlembro-me bem que no jornal do dia seguinte-- manchetes aludiam ao fato e uma nota dizia que um morador da serra, uma cidade vizinha, que fica num planalto, havia observado tudo de bin���culos.\r\n\r\nestas s���o as minhas lembran���as...\r\n\r\ngostaria que fizessem uma pesquisa para comprovarem a veracidade destes fatos. pe���o desculpas por n���o poder precisar a data correta. mas, de fato aconteceu.\r\n\r\naproveito pra agradecer pela aten������o e me despe���o colocando-me ��� sua inteira disposi������o.\r\n\r\natenciosamente,\r\n\r\nd.A.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

northeast of los angeles, ca. we were staying in a campround called guffy, located at 8,225' elevation. it is accessed by taking blue ridge road (fs 3n061) off of the angeles crest highway (route 2) at the junction of big pines highway (n4). the entrance to the road is on the south side of the 2. this is a fairly well graded dirt and gravel road that winds through the mountain high ski resort before passing through the blue ridge campground and eventually reaching the spur for guffy and eventually a camp called lupine. beyond blue ridge campground, the road is undeveloped and in poor shape, limiting the amount of usage by anyone other than dedicated campers or those looking for solitude. i arrived at the sight after my two friends and made camp as the sun set. there was only one other party of campers staying there on the east side of the campground. after eating dinner and enjoying campfire talk, we decided to drive back along the ridge road to observe the sky and surrounding mountains. the time was approximately 11:30 pm by the time we were situated and rolling in my jeep, headed back west along blue ridge road. we drove about a mile, made a u-turn at a pullout and stopped in the middle of the road. this should give you an idea of how isolated the area is. we exited the vehicle and hung out for about 15 minutes, watching the sky and surrounding hills. as we got back in the jeep and i turned on the lights, we surprised a coyote standing in the middle of the road. we then continued on to another turnout on the south side of the road, overlooking the sheep mountain wilderness area. to our extreme right we could observe the silhouette of mt baden-powell (9,399') a lower peak called inspiration point (7,385') and between them, the pass called vincent gap. the night was extremely clear and a significant amount of stars were visible. we observed a high number of planes and helicopters. los angeles airspace is extremely congested, seeming to almost swim with the amount of moving, blinking aircraft of every imaginable type. there is a constant stream of commercial flights as there are several airports in the area, including lax, long beach, orange county, ontario and more. after about 15 minutes or so, our attention was drawn to a bright light hovering over the treeline of inspiration point. all three of us observed the light grow in intensity as it began to lightly bob up and down then back and forth. it seemed to be appearing and disappearing as it dropped below the trees. rh thought it looked like it was out over the desert toward pearblossom. it continued to move slightly to the south away from the ridge and in to the open sky over vincent gap. it would abruptly move in one direction, stop, then move in another, both up and down and side to side, all the while moving slowly toward the south. the movements were fluid, not jerky. there was no apparent pattern to the movement, and it did this for about 30 seconds or so. the object seemed to pulse in color, between white, yellow and orange. at times i thought i could make out a dark shape, but the intensity of the light made it difficult. we were all talking at once either asking what it could be, describing what we were seeing or just exclaiming in surprise. at one point i asked if we were seeing a helicopter or a plane and they both agreed it was not either of those. rh said, \"it's dancing. look at the way it's moving... it's dancing up and down!\" still in complete amazement, i started to wave my arms and say, \"come over here! come fly over here\" and both rh and jg simultaneously said, in so many words, \"don't come over here!\" we had a quick laugh and continued to observe the object. i think it was rh who said, \"why don't you give it a yell?\" i cupped my hands around my mouth and started to let loose with a mountain style yodel/yell. as soon as i started to make a noise, the light suddenly changed with a solid flash of white to few dull blinking yellow lights. there was a random series of flashes, and the object began to move more steadily at a higher rate of speed toward the south. as this happened, we all became more excited, as it was entirely obvious that there was no mistaking this object as any conventional aircraft, leading us to the conclusion that this was in fact an unidentified flying object. we continued to watch the object as it faded in intensity and eventually disappeared behind my baden-powell. a straight trajectory would have taken it out over the pacific ocean. our total observation time was anywhere from one to two minutes. we had enough time to completely discuss and react to what we were seeing. later, back at the campfire (which i quickly stoked up) jg and i agreed that it almost appeared to be shaped like an old german army helmet with a light on the bottom, but neither of us could be sure to any degree of certainty. i drew what i saw in the dirt and he concurred that it was close to what he saw, but neither of us can be sure. rh said he could only saw the light. at this time, i should add that we are all completely sober, competent observers with excellent vision and senses. rh is a retired u.S. navy aviation machinist mate, 2nd class with tons of air time and experience. he also worked at edwards air force base for 30 years after leaving the service. during this time, he worked search and rescue in the san gabriel mountains for the la county sheriffs department. he has an intimate knowledge of the area and has spent countless hours, both on the ground and in the air in san gabriels. he agrees after discussing our observation that what we witnessed was not normal. all three of us were very open minded before this event, but i now feel even more confident that there is more going on in our world than what we are aware of. i feel very privileged to have seen what we saw. i feel confident enough that i have no qualms or second guessing about filing this report. i wonder if there were any other people who witnessed something similar that night or at other times in the area. were there any strange weather anomalies, military exercises or other events that night? maybe someone at mufon can let me know. thank you for your time.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

concentration was on the beautiful rock formations. when we stopped at a hotel later that evening we downloaded our photos to a laptop computer.  on the larger screen, i noticed two dark marks in the sky above courthouse butte (p6240087).  since my daughter loves hawks, and we saw quite a few on the trip, i joked to my son-in-law bill, \"let's magnify these two hawks for sandra\". when we did, it appeared to be two ufos; the left one silver colored and the right one darker.  when magnified, each appeared to have a different color directly around it.  they did not look like birds or planes.  we then searched about 10 other pictures looking for other \"black marks\" in the sky.  that is when we discovered the dark mark above bell rock (p6240088). we magnified this one and it looks similar to the one appearing on the right above courthouse butte.  the pictures were taken about 10 seconds apart, so if it was the same object, it was traveling fast from my right to left. we looked at the

(after finally getting back to civilization i tried to find what sats are stationary in the northern sky's and couldn't locate any, any help on that?? are there any??) we watched it for approx 45 mins and our talk turned to other strange things we have seen in the sky over the years and about watching satellites floating by. we all went inside to grab some chow and came back outside to eat and the object was gone. this kind of made us re-think what it was we saw.. \r\nso now we were really into talking about what that was and had our heads strained to the sky. my buddy spotted a satellite traveling north to south at around 60deg from horizon. it was now approx 2045 hours and some of the brighter stars are appearing. i picked up visual of the object and it seemed to be just a satellite, the dull glow, size and speed were typical. my dad was having a hard time picking it up so i spotted a bright star (ive tried to figure out exactly which star it was but i couldn't tell you) the star was to the sse and at around 45/50 deg to the horizon and the brightest object in that sector. i asked my dad to look at that star and i began to call out the position of the satellite, ie; \"its 9 o'clock high about 3 hand widths away, now its 10 o'clock its now at the 11 o'clock\" all relative to the bright star.. and so on, he still was having trouble picking it up. i finally had him look at the 2 o'clock position and a hand width away and me and my friend called it out \"its now at its 12, 12:30, 1 o'clock...\" and as it got to the 2:30 position it just stopped. we both yelled out \"it freaking stopped!\" it didn't slow down, it didn't fade out, it stayed a constant brightness and speed until it just stopped dead..\r\nat this point i was really freaked. my father never did get to see it before it stopped but saw it after the fact but now it looked like a regular dim star..\r\nme and my bud never let our eyes off of the object for the next 4 hours. we actually took turns resting our necks. we finally just layed down and kept on starring at it waiting for it to move. \r\nduring this i would see flashes of light popping off in specks near it and other lights that looked like it was radiating out of the object but dismissed them to my eyes playing tricks. at one point i saw a beam of white light come from the 7:30 position from the object and shoot out approx one inch ( these will all be relative size to the object) this lasted a brief second. a few mins after that happened my friend said \"i swear i saw something shoot out of that thing\" and he recanted the same story as to what i saw. \r\nabout an hour later i saw another beam of light from the object, this time it looked like a harpoon getting shot out, kind of squiggly and again about an inch out but this time from the 5 o'clock position. we both said \"whoa!\" and both described the same thing to my father independently so we wouldn't feed off each others story..\r\nduring this time we saw up wards of 20+ satellites floating by, all stayed on normal path and speed. \r\nat one point toward the end of our event we saw a flash of light approx 2 inches to the 5 o'clock to the object and faded to a dimmer light. this object was round and looked like a satellite in brightness after it dimmed. this new object began to track south but after about 3 inches of travel it made a 90 deg turn and tracked easterly and quickly grew dimmer and smaller as if it was traveling to a higher altitude. we lost it after 7 inches of travel.. we continued our vigil to not loose sight of the original object that stopped moving until we lost sight of it behind a mountain. \r\ni would have not spent one of the few days i get to spend time with my father and my best friend watching something in the sky that wasn't something that needed attention. i wouldn't have reported this and would have just added this to my list of strange stuff ive seen if i hadn't heard i guy on the radio saying almost the exact story of what we saw and around the same date but in the western u.S... this needed to be documented. i know it wasn't a crazy story with an unknown spacecraft but like i said before.... i know what it wasn't, but i have no idea what it was. if someone can explain what i saw please do, its bothering me a bit..","distance":"Unknown","duration":"05:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then
