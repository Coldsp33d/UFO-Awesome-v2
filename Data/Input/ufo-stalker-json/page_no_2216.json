it was close, real close.  it kind of like hovered there for a second.  when it started moving it was kind of like just floating along real slow and completely silent. we just sat there and watched it. i remember when it appeared i hollered out, \"oh my god! a ufo!\" cause i'm a firm believer in them.  we just watched it. then i think that what ever was driving it noticed us cause it started to float away and when it did it actually hit the top of a tree causing the tree to move!  it was floating.  thats the only way to describe its flight.  it was moving side to side like a fighter jet would do to avoid getting a missle lock on it.  kind of like side to side.  while it was doing this, we were able to see the bottom, side and top.  it was completely black, and had no windows.  from the side, there was a \"cockpit\" type bubble similar to that of a b-2 stealth bomber, but not as severe if that makes any sense.  the color was a flat black color, no reflection from the sun.  from the bottom, it had solid white lights at each tip of the triangle, and in the very center it had a single blinking red light. no markings what so ever.  it was kind of surreal. i remember it like it was yesterday.  i thought it was totally awesome, awe inspiring.  the four friends with me didn't seem to impressed, i don't think they understood how special this event actually was to witness. i actually jumped out of the van to watch it. it was just floating around for about 5-8 mins before it just floated away til we lost sight of it. the entire event was probably around 10 minutes.  i totally wish i had had a camera or cam-corder cause this could of been one of the best ufo sightings ever if i could of got it on film. i will try to attach a sketch of it. when this event occured, i had never heard of a triangle ufo before.  a few years ago i went on the internet to research this.  what i found blew me away.  the infamous \"belgium wave\" pics are identical to the craft that i saw. except that i saw mine during the daylight hours, and i saw it from all possible angles due to its flight pattern.  but again, the infamous \"belgium\" pics are identical to what i observed when seeing the bottom of this craft. i will admit that when i saw this and to this day, i have to say that if this craft is not extra terrestrial, it is definately a \"secret\" military aircraft. especially since the brunswick naval air station is less than five miles away from the site. it looked like the same material as the b-2 and f-117 stealth planes, but it was not a stealth plane, it was a triangle.  i recently saw footage of a f-117 taking off at night, and the lights on the bottom of the jet looked like and reminded me of the triangle's lights.  three solid whites and a rotating or blinking red light, but in a different configuration as the f-117 is not a triangle. \r\n\r\nand yes, like i said before, it did hit a tree, i probably could not find the exact tree today, however i do know the general area it was in, however some new houses have gone in the area since then. \r\n\r\nwell, thats about it on this case. iam going to be reporting another sighting from a few weeks ago, i just have to find the date, as i do have the date and time for this other sighting. \r\n\r\nthank you and i wish i would of reported it sooner.  if you have any further questions, feel free to e-mail me at the address given. \r\n\r\nyour further questionaire made me remember that after the sighting, when it was finally dark out; there were alot of planes that i could see in the sky at high altitudes.  there's usually quite a bit of air traffic anyway as the navy air base is in town and portland int. jetport is only about 20-25 miles away, but i had never seen this many planes at one time either before or after this event.  this happened the same day, probably a couple hrs later after it got dark. i found it quite strange like they were looking for the craft or something.

in frisco texas is very light, and believe me this was no plane. it was very faint,  looked like it was 40,000 ft plus easy...About the light value of the dimmest star you could see. thats actually what caught my attention initially. the dimmness and then, the speed. when a plane is at that altitude or higher it takes it awhile to traverse the vision path i have of the sky, and this thing had no problem going from north to southeast at 1/3 of the time a jet would have. i was blown away. i am a 45 year old professional male, i was totally sober and served 6 years in the air force, stationed at

smoking a cigarette and talking. i estimate the time of the event to be around 22:30, though i may have been mistaken since we had just been hanging out all night and not paying attention to time. my friend and i were outside smoking, and she looked up in the sky and pointed out to me what we both thought was a satellite. it was moving south-southeast we watched it briefly (about five seconds), only to see it stop mid-flight, jerk to the northeast (diagonally up and left from its position), and begin flight again. the object continued this pattern of stopping and re-starting for the next thirty to forty seconds. its timing was very sporadic as was the degree to which it adjusted its flight path. when we started losing sight of it, i climbed up on top of my chair, but could not see it anymore due to the light pollution on the horizon. i walked inside and told my boyfriend, who was sitting on the sofa watching tv, exactly what we saw. my friend confirmed everything. my boyfriend told us that he had seen objects like that in the sky over the beach before.\r\nneither my friend nor myself could discern a specific shape or color to the object as it was very high in the atmosphere. the area in which the sighting occurred is close to the canaveral national seashore, so there is a possibility that it was some sort of government intelligence. \r\nmy friend and i are both twenty years old. she and i were room mates at the university of alabama for one semester, after which i moved to the eastern florida coast and she moved to a suburb outside of new york city.

than normal stars, and coming straight at him. it was very far away but it looked like a star, but what caught his attention was that he could hear it. it was very 'loud' and then it turned direction upward then blinked out/disappeared.\r\nhe theorized it to be a military space operation or one of rochester's air crafts, since there is an air base very close by. but he estimated the direction of

i couldn't believe that people didn't come outside to check to see what all the noise was about!  i've also seen multiple white lights high up in the sky that dart around at sharp angles and move very fast, then just stop and look like stars in the sky.  have also seen some strange activities by the military and possibly some alien beings in the woods.\" ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":17649,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.7691755,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06242009-0014","longitude":-94.6563454,"occurred":1245142800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1245142800000,"summary":"Large object with arm followed by military aircraft in area.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Stilwell, Kansas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:217900"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Altha","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While delivering newspapers on cr 274 southwest of altha fl., i stopped at a paper tube near the intersection of cr 274 an hannah tower rd..This location is on top of a hill overlooking the chipola river basin to the southwest.As i looked ahead to the southwest i saw what at first appeared to be stadium lights sitting motionless just above the tree line near the intersection of cr 274 and sr 73. the lights were amber in color and consisted of four separate banks containing eight lights each.I had been at this location every early morning for the previous four years and had never witnessed this before. from my vantage point on top of the hill i could clearly see the security lights at the several homes between my location and the point of interest.I know this area very well, delivering papers as well as visiting the area countless times over the past fourty-odd years. the lights on the object were very large and covered a horizontal distance of several hundred feet, estimated in relation to the the other known area features, (home security lights, tree line). i watched this object for approximately 15 mins. and decided to drive toward it, (sw on cr 274), down into the river basin, accross the chipola river at willis bridge in an attempt to get closer to the object. \r\n           as i arrived at the intersection cr 274 and sr73, (appox.5 min.) i stopped and got out of the truck. i looked intently in every direction but i was unable to locate the object.\r\n            ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":17648,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.5704721,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06242009-0013","longitude":-85.1271442,"occurred":1047303000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1047303000000,"summary":"While delivering newspapers i watched amber colored, stadium size lights  sit  motionless just above the tree line.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Altha, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:217901"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Manhattan Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving along the beach at night and i saw over the ocean what i thought at first was a helicopter, but it made no noise and hovered a couple hundred feet off the water. i saw two lights on the craft. the front had a white light, the rear had a flashing red light. the lights seemed to be twisting around each other as it flew south. \r\n\r\ni got out of my car and ran to the beach and watched as it continued toward palos verdes. it became very small, very quickly and changed to a golden amber color. \r\n\r\ni know it could have been a military aircraft, but it just acted so strangely...","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

and from my viewpoint, appeared to extend around the circumference of a craft.  circular craft, with a diameter of possibly 20-30'.\r\n\r\nimmediately, i heard the roar of a helicopter coming from the east.  it flew overhead of me, with its' spotlight on, traveling directly towards the ufo craft.  the helicopter passed to the right of the ufo, and zoomed on westward.  after that very close call, i began to see a flashing white light on the top/dome of the ufo craft.  the ufo was getting in the distance from me; and going over terrain that was descending to a creek valley with a busy boulevard; perhaps a descent in elevation is why i started seeing the flashing light.  the sighting was approximately ten minutes.  the sky was clear and starry, with plenty of air traffic that evening.  planes and helicopters flying.\r\n\r\ni later mentioned this ufo sighting to someone; and was told someone else had seen a ufo/flying saucer out at one of the lakes just west of austin, a week or so before.\r\n\r\na few days after my sighting; i saw a cartoon on the editorial page of the daily texan (the univ. of texas student newspaper); with the starship enterprise beaming a ray on the u.T. tower (directly east of my residence).  i thought perhaps someone else had seen the ufo craft also.\r\n\r\ni kept thinking incessantly about the beings in the ufo craft.  i knew they were of highly advance intelligence, and from somewhere far away; and what did they look like?\r\n\r\naboout four/five evening later (after my sighting), i had just finished reading some spiritual material; and felt pleasantly uplifted.  the lights were brightly on in my room.  it was late evening.  there was a big flash of light; and there was this creature before me in the air; head and \"shoulders\" view.  my body jerked and i gasped.  the creature was calmly and intently looking direct into my eyes.  i could only stare back.\r\n\r\nthe creature appeared to have tawny color hair/fur (like a bear or lion); and a very large build; maybe 7-8' tall.  i did not see below its' \"shoulders.\"\r\n\r\nthe creature had two pointed ears, somewhat catlike, but seated higher on top of head.  it had two eyes, each positioned where normal human eyes are on a face.  the eyes slanted upward and outwards.  somewhat like a lion's.  the eyes had the look of high intelligence in the gaze.  there was no nose, no snout, no obvious openings in that area of the face.  it looked flat.  what was also very different; there was a substantial black/dark area (perhaps an opening for a mouth) that came down one upper side of the face; down around what would be our chin; then up what would be the other side of our face.  kind of a u shaped face.  the head with the dark \"mouthlike folds\" seem to sit on what appeared to be shoulders.  i did not see a neck.\r\n\r\nthis happened within a few seconds; if that long.  then just like a light switch had been turned off; it was gone.  instantaneous.  no fade out.\r\n\r\nafterwards, i wrote out the sighting of the ufo craft; and drew a primitive sketch of the creature that appeared before my eyes; amd mailed it to the head of mufon in austin at the time; but i never heard back that it had been received.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17644,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.274903,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06242009-0009","longitude":-97.7411008,"occurred":123494400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":123494400000,"summary":"Slow moving/low in altitude ufo flying saucer during 1970's, austin, tx;
