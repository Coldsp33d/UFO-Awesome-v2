passenger side. the time was approximately a little after 2am. i usually take the same route home everytime i go to this particular theater but for some reason i missed (the main road) to take us home and i had to make a uturn to get back on track, thats when i see lights that at first looked like a typical commercial airliner but when it came in closer i clearly seen it was something totally different beyond belief!! the road i needed turn down to go home was about 2 blocks away but my eyes was glued to the object, which i was able to take'em off of it for a few seconds to see did my sudden stop of the vehicle awake my roommate but it did not and a matter-of-fact, i had to nudge him a few times which wasn't very effective either and by no means, i was not gonna miss this!! the object flew down and stopped right over some trees and power towers. as it was coming to a stop, something about it startled me, the shape of it was in a perfect triangle and it shined with a glowy semi-bright orangey light but when it stopped it flipped right side up into a pyramid shape right over the power towers and trees. i was wowwwwd!!! i should mention i heard no sounds of an aircraft engine or any type of engine for that matter just \"airbursts\". what was even more amazing was we was'nt that far away from the airport and macdill airforce base, right in between the two so i just knew it was being detected or radarred or something you would think huh? then it happened, from beneath the power lines what seemed to be below the ground, something that might be described as an orb? it was a ultra-violet/purple looking round transparent sphere with what appeared to be lightning bolts inside it. i immediately took it as some type of power source for fuel because as that was happening a strange sound occurred like a generator it kind of vacuumed the orb up in absorbed it into the object which it brightened up then and it repeated this process three more times before it got as bright as the sun like you can literally see the night turn day then took off like the starship

several other parents and children at first noticed a large orange orb-like structure moving slowly from north to south and was very high up.  after a few minutes this stopped moving and just hovered stationary in the sky.  soon thereafter 4 others followed in the same sequence, height and distance from each other forming a line at a slight 45 degree angle.  these too stopped moving and just hovered in the sky. a few minutes later one by one and in order they moved at a 90 degree angle upwards into the night sky until they disappeared.  this took several minutes.  about l5 minutes later, another 7 followed from the same direction and in exactly the same way.  they too disappeared very slowly upwards until they were out of sight.  this whole process took around a half hour.  during this time a light small plane and helicopter was seen flying well below these orbs, so we could easily see the difference and wondered if these planes had spotted them. everybody on the field was distracted and very excited about what we were seeing.  it was almost surreal to us, as it was a sighting nobody ever thought they would see. \r\n\r\nafter returning home i called the local airports and around town to confirm that nothing out of the ordinary was going on, which wasnt.  i called the radio stations to report this incredible sighting and emailed the local newspaper who did publish an article about this sighting.  in response, other people reported seeing this sighting too in the area that night.  one man confirmed he saw exactly the same kind of sighting 40 years in johannesburg with his wife and daughter and has never forgotten this.  \r\n\r\nall of us were amazed at this unbelievable sighting and were very excited, but confused as to what these could have been.

strange sound came up the canyon from the west that sounded like a loud humming sound, very fast vibration like a humming bird.  i looked to my left and saw two objects moving low across the water. the objects then made a hard left turn and accelerated at a high rate of speed over the mountains.  the objects were hard to make out as they seemed to warp light. the objects looked to be the size of a hot-tub.  they had the appearance of black stars that \"twinkled\" with black rays of distortion.  when they turned they turned in formation and retained  consistent distance form each other the

maneuvering. i would guess that they were moving at 30-50 mph over the lake and over 600 mph as they moved away. my best guess is that these are government vehicles,  but who knows.

(i've attached that video to this report. the camera is a kodak easy share z612. unfortunately, the auto focus motors are audible when viewing the video. sorry about that.) in the video, it appears that the object goes completely dark every second and a half or so... it didn't. it's just that my cam couldn't pick up the \"dim times\". i was watching it the whole time, it would go dim then bright, dim and bright, all the while with the rotating colors.\r\n\r\nthis may sound a little dumb, but i'd heard that there a a few people who can and have contacted visitors vessels psychically. that when this was done, the object would move toward the person... hover, etc. i tried this to no avail. it just hung in the sky like a multi-colored, multi-faceted rotating gem. i was unable to put a \"shape\" to it because it was just too far away.\r\n\r\n\"t\" [cms/tg/pid]","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":17610,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.510108,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06222009-0018","longitude":-97.8135088,"occurred":1245666600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,  Square,  Rectagular,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1245666600000,"summary":"Bright night object rotating colors.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17610_submitter_file1__multu_colored_light_062209.wmv","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17610_submitter_file2__My_location-redacted.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cedar Park, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:217965"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Fremont","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was out in my backyard with my cat and my canon sx10is digital camera snapping photos of mission peak (mountain).  i was trying out the different modes the camera has.  when i was in aquarium mode i decided what the hell snap some photos see what they look like.  in the viewer it looked like the sky was much bluer then in any other mode. it was not until i downloaded the photos to my computer and reviewed them on the larger screen that there was this whitish dot.  after zooming on the picture closer is when i noticed that it was not a bird but a possible ufo.  i have more then 1 photo of this object and it shows up in other parts of the photos.  i know it is not a star since it shows up on other photos in other spots. i know for a fact there is no lint on my lens since i clean it all the time.  i also know for a fact that it is not an airplane cause there was no planes in the sky at the time. i went back out back and started taking more photos and suddenly this black helicopter showed up which unfortunately i was not able to get the entire copter in but you can see the tail section. it was headed towards moffett field. the photos i am including were taken on the same day the helicopter is earlier then the ufo photo that i posted but the ufo was there prior to helicopter showing up.  i only posted the better of the ufo photos that i currently have taken.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17609,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.5527097,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06222009-0017","longitude":-121.9798319,"occurred":1245654000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1245654000000,"summary":"Photo taken of whitish metal looking object in the sky","tags":["photo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17609_submitter_file1__IMG_3911.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17609_submitter_file2__IMG_3825.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17609_submitter_file3__IMG_3761.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Fremont, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:217966"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2217}
