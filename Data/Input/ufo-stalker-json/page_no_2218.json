the allegheny river in harmar, pa across from famous oakmont country club golf course.  we were wiring paddle fans late when i went onto the porch facing the river to get something.  noticed crazy flashing multiple lights over oakmont c.C. that gave me flashback to my sighting in murrysville on 5-22-09. grabbed sony hdr-xr500 with 1.7 tele converter lens and started shooting, first in nightshot, then low-lux.  i've seen a lot of planes & helicopters where i live and this didn't look like anything i've ever seen.  it looked first like a race car or choo-choo at first, then finally a more plane-like appearance.  in review of the video, i could see that it's 'tail' end appears to change position.  the lighting patterns are not consistent, some lights go out, and then towards the end the lights are straight across--flashing again in a non-consistent pattern.  at no time did i see a green right side navigation light which is faa requirement.  at no time during or after did i hear any noise whatsoever from the craft which was about 100.  it cruised above the tree line, then turned downward dipping into the allegheny river basin behind some trees on 12-mile island (in the middle of the river) in the direction of oakmont yacht club.  it was not heading towards any airport around here.  there are no airports anywhere near here.  i'm trying to request a radar report, but the faa sight has a \"page error\", of course (not that they would give me it anyway).\r\n\r\ni've witnessed several different types of ufos, but this one is unique.  it reminded me of the type seen and filmed by john lenard walson in outer space and is posted also on youtube channels:  johnlenardwalson & gridkeeper.  they are too freaky to be seen in daytime, so perhaps that's why we've no daytime footage yet.\r\n\r\nthe size of my really cool hd video is too large to upload here, so please go to my youtube channel name: seeingufospa to see this video and my other sighting videos in hd. if anyone knows exactly what this is and has video proof of night lighting, etc., they can upload it on yt as a video response.  hearsay of \"secret government projects\" will not be accepted.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17608,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.545741,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06222009-0016","longitude":-79.8352767,"occurred":1245141540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1245141540000,"summary":"Low

craft\" just over the trees and houses in the neighborhood.  at first i assumed it was an airplane, but immediately realized it was something else that i have never seen before and cannot identify logically.  it was a bright, yellow-orange light in a somewhat trapeziodal shape, covered with a haze that diffused the edges, making it hard to define the exact shape,  it also seemed to have a brighter spot in the center.  it was slowly heading towards the park, but as the kids started shouting and pointing, it stopped moving forward, hovered for around 5-10 seconds, then began moving away from us (to the west) getting smaller, but then it was just gone!\r\n\r\nit was definitely some sort of \"aircraft\".  it was not a firework, weather balloon, prop plane or even military plane.  we are near the airbase and a small airport, but this was nothing like any of the planes that we see flying overhead.  it was super-bright, entirely lit over the body of the object.  it literally was flying forward, hovered, then flew back in the direction it came from. then in an instant it was gone. i've never known a plane that can do that.\r\n\r\nthe children said that when they noticed it and began pointing and shouting, the craft stopped moving towards us, as if it saw them.\r\n\r\nthe object also changed shape when in began moving backwards, from the hazy trapezoid to an elongated oval.\r\n\r\nit was totally silent, which was strange for how close it was.  we (the two adults) may not have even been aware of it if the children hadn't seen it first, even though it was just above

both sides. the rain had let up some and as i passed a place where the trees opened up, i looked to the left 45 deg., and up 45 deg., and beheld, in the sky, a beautiful group of about four white lights, one above the other of the most pure brilliance i have ever seen. \r\nit, the group, was not bright in that would hurt ones eyes and make them turn away, it was its purity that i marveled at.\r\nmy first thought, and one i held for quite awhile, was that i was looking across a small valley at the top of a hill where someone had several flourescent dusk to dawn lights mounted close together on a pole. it wasn't until some time later that i realized that there is no hill there, because i have traveled that road for years, and also that the lights were not all of the same uniform shape. one of the lights near the top seemed teardrop shaped with the point of the tear drop pointing up toward a 10 o'clock position, the others were of a general square shape with rounded corners and sitting above one another. \r\n\r\nalthough they were not centered perfectly along the same axis, all the lights were touching one another and were nearly centered.\r\nfor some reason i just kept driving like it was something that happens everyday, and that's not my nature, to be so cavalier about anything so  unusual. the google earth co-ordinates of where the lights were located is, to my

bayfront, in waretown (ocean twp.) new jersey. as i approached the bay i could clearly observe a large extremely bright ball of light hovering above the barnegat bay, approximately a quarter mile west of the barnegat inlet. the sky was clear and i would estimate the the \"ball\" to have been approximately 80'- 100' wide. the object was projecting a direct reflection onto the water, and was hovering aproximately 300 to 400 feet above the water. it was the brightest light i had ever observed in the sky(and i have lived here for over 5 years). i entered my home and travelled to the third floor deck where i retrieved a spotting scope. looking through the scope (which was mounted on a tri-pod) i observed no solid structure, blinking lights, or movement. the object was nearly blinding when observed through the scope. the scope remained in a unchanged position for the duration of the observation, during which time the object never moved, dimmed, or made a sound. at approximately 5 am, the object instantly vanished. \r\nit should be noted than on 6/21/2009, i mentioned the event to my neighbor to see if he had observed anything similar on that, or any other evening. it was at that time he informed me that during a summer evening in 2008, he had observed a bright ball of light travelling north across barnegat bay. he stated that the object was being chased or followed by 2 fighter jets. he stated that as the object approached the area of barnegat inlet, it made a 90 degree turn, and \"shot\" west across the sky at a speed that was \"to fast to follow with your eyes\". he states that the jets then turned back out over the ocean towards atlantic city. \r\nand finally, it should also be noted that this area of barnegat bay is less than 1 mile from the oyster creek nuclear facility.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

were driving north on mopac, approaching fm 2222 (near camp mabry). we were talking as we drove and i was looking out the windshield up at the sky absent-mindedly. suddenly i noticed a bright turquoise pellet shaped object traveling erratically at a high rate of speed over the freeway. it looked very high up to me, my first impression was that it was high enough to be a plane or maybe even a comet, but obviously not the right size, shape, color and speed to be either of those.. the color of the object was a very vibrant bright turquoise, and it definitely emitted it's own glow (much like a comet or shooting star). after about five seconds of watching the object travel, it winked out, like a flame dying. the most notable detail in my mind was the color and the shape of the object. neither changed as it moved, and i have never seen anything that looked like this.\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend saw the object a couple of seconds after i did. he saw a second smaller light as well, traveling in the same area. he only saw them for a couple of seconds before the lights winked out, but agrees that it must have been traveling very fast and was maneuvering erratically. \r\n\r\nthis could have been some sort of celestial object. i don't have much knowledge in astronomy so i wouldn't be surprised if it was something explainable that i have just never heard of. all i know is it would have had to have been traveling at the speed of something like a comet, but it didn't look anything like one (at least none that i've ever seen or heard of). i know of nothing man-made that could have looked like this and moved as fast as this object did (especially as high up as it was).\r\n\r\nthe object was many times larger than a shooting star. the bigger object (the one i saw) was one light as high

of the grade i was on and as soon as i reached the top i stopped, set the brakes and shut the engine off and stood on the running board to watch this \"thing\". in about a minute it was passing overhead and never made a sound, but i could tell it was moving along. at night, in the mountains it gets very dark and it's impossible to judge distance. i don't know how high it was, but it was big. off to my left i could make out another mountain ridge line but don't know if it was fifty or a hundred miles away. this thing made it there in just 2 or 3 minutes and as it disappeared behind the mountains, i kept waiting for a big bang, a flash of an explosion or something. i got nothing but the silence i had heard ever since i pulled over and stopped. what ever this thing was it made the hair stand up on the back of my neck like i never felt before or since. needless to say, i was very wide awake for the entire trip to farmington. the next day listened to every news report i could catch and scanned the denver and farmington papers for information on this thing, because as big as it was i new others had to have seen it. i found nothing and never have. about 10 or 15 years ago i heard some reports from colorado about sightings of round orange objects, but because of my job i never had time to investigate the matter. can anyone shed any light on what i saw? this thing just

powerful to take picture even though the object might be 2-5 kms away. \r\nit was hidding behind the mist since there was some radiation mist because of the rain in the afternoon and the heat in the night consequent effect.\r\nwe are very near an airport mroc (costa rica) and we can tell the lights of a plane and its distinctive sound and im 90% sure it was not one. the color of it was a reddish orange blinking light.\r\n\r\n1. we were at a family meeting having some bbq\r\n2.People on th esurroundings started noticing it.\r\n3. we think object was just hovering between fog and clouds\r\n4.Rounded orange like color advancing and then braking the doi9ng it back and forth.\r\n5. everybody was surprised about the event. personally this is my second encounter on my life.\r\n6. object suddenly faded out even though there was not enough clouds and/or mist to make it invisible it just faded out. if u ask me i think it was like similar to a flashlight when its running low 9on

like to star gaze facing directly south. the object i seen was huge!!!! it was a perfect triangle with 3 illuminated white lights to make 3 points as in the shape of a triangle. when i say huge i mean this thing had to be 500ft in every latteral length of the triangle. my reaction was holy crap i think i seen the space station, but up until recently i was at a gathering with friends and we were talking about this object and he mentioned there is no way the space station is that big......I can still see it in my mind like it was yesterday! it came from the north west and cruised overhead an actual 30 seconds plain as day clear sky and eventually headed in a south eastern direction. a visual was lost by eventually being too far away. if i could draw it it would be a perfect triangle with three illuminated dots on either joining latteral of the triangle. i am curious to know if it was the space station or not.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Today at 5:30pm, while swimming at the community pool at my mother in law's condo complex just off the corner of ashdale and burnet rd, my wife, mother-in-law, and my two children witnessed a very loud and unnaturally low-flying military fighter jet formation.  i believe they were f-16's judging by the wing configuration.  they were 4 or 5.  i am not sure because i was caught up trying to get everyone to look, and to try to reason whether or not law prevents low altitude fly overs of residential areas by military aircraft.  i also noted that the speed of the military craft did not seem to be very fast, and based on the absence of a sonic boom, i can only assume they were not on afterburners.  i will look that up after posting this report.  immediately after the military aircraft disappeared from view, i noticed a small, white single engine civilian aircraft at a much higher altitude (above or at least in the cloud deck) traveling in a flight path that was perpindicular to that of the fighter jets.  as i tracked the smaller civilian aircraft, at some point, a small brightly glowing pink orb, sphere, or dot, whichever you prefer passed just \"under\" the civilian aircraft in the visual field.  as my family and i tracked the object, we noted that it appeared to be small, was glowing bright pink, and was rapidly moving in a straight line on a course roughly opposite the course of the civilian aircraft.  as it encountered clouds in the visual field, we noted that it remained visible and therefore must be moving at an altitude below the cloud deck.  the object's speed compared to the military and civilian aircraft gave the impression that although it was obviously at a lower altitude, that it was traveling too quickly to have been a baloon blowing in the wind, which at this time was almost dead calm.  we also noted that due to it's seeming flat, or even slightly ascending flight path, it's lack of a tail or trail, and due to it's speed, it could not be a meteorite or falling space debris.  to comment specifically on the speed, it was moving as quickly at it's altitude as i have seen commercial airliners on a landing approach move at a similar altitude, so i concluded that it was moving so fast that it had to be moving under power or propulsion of some sort, and that it's speed was such that compared to other \"shooting star\" meteorite sightings i've had in the past, it was much too slow, and remained visible too long on a flat or slightly ascending flight path to be a meteorite or shooting star.  perhaps 5 to 7 minutes after the unidentified object left my field of vision, we all witnessed 2 more roughly spherical objects that appeared to be at the same altitude and on the same heading as the previous unidentified object.  these two objects were traveling in a vertically opposed, tandem configuration.  both objects were oscillating colors between bright red and silver (reflective).  the object at the top of the tandem configuration was very steady, but the object at the bottom of the tandem configuration was tumbling erratically, but maintaining same course and speed as the top object, and though it moved  about under the top object erratically, it stayed a constant distance from the top object, roughly the equivalent of the diameter of either object (as they appeard to be roughly the same size).  we watched it for as long as we could, observing it passing rapidly under clouds, and we exited the pool continuing to adjust our position on the ground until we could no longer track it without leaving the pool area.  as the second pair of object left the visual field we observed what appeared to be a red and blue civilian helicopter on a heading to intercept the two objects, though at a much lower altitude.  the helicopter seems to have been on the same basic flight path of the two tandem object, leading me to believe that the helicopter may have been observing and/or pursuing the tandem objects.  the second sighting lasted roughly twice the duration of the first.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
