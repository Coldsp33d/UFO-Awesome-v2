colorado. it was wednesday, june 17th ( i believe ), late morning when this incident occurred. i was indoors at my desk- in the shipping-receiving department. it was around 11 am or so and the sky was clear with few clouds.  one of the steel yard forklift drivers called in on the radio to let us know that he was looking at an object that was hovering above high in the sky. he said that he hadn't seen any kind of plane or balloon shaped like this object and no motor/engine could be heard. my manager and myself walked outside to see what he was watching. it was hard to pinpoint or see due to it's elevation.  you really had to be focusing in that general area of the sky because you could lose sight of it easily but, because it stayed in one spot, we could see it.  it was cigar shaped and black in color. it seemed to bend on one end.  the object was elongated accross the sky but actually turned straight up and down at one point, then flattened out again.  when it did this the sun reflected off one side which gave off a goldy colored sheen.  it stayed in the same spot for about 35 minutes and during this time a plane circled the sky four times at a much lower elevation than the object.  we were all stupified as to what the object was. a couple of our sales people inside had heard that we were watching something in the sky and came out to see for themeselves.  no one could identify the object.  a co-worker grabbed her camera to take pics but the object seemed not to show in any pic and we couldn't get it to come up on our cell phone cameras.  the co-worker did manage to get one pic where the object could be seen but it looked like something you would see on a cellular lever under a microscope because she got the object but it also picked up three other shadow like dots near it in the sky that we did not see with the naked eye.  after hovering the object moved north easterly in the sky until we could no longer see it. one observer called channel nine news to report a strange object spotted in the sky and to ask if the airforce was running a test on a plane or spycam. we thought for sure that other people had to have seen it also. it was talked about around the office for the next couple of days and we all watched the news for some kind of explanation but heard/saw nothing to explain what was in the sky. i decided for ha-ha's to pull up pics of ufo citings. some of those pictures are really rediculous but i did find a picture of a cigar shaped craft taken in 1996 in the uk that looked exactly like the object we observed.","distance":"Over 1

exact time. i presumed it was some kind of advertisement or balloon so drove a little further to try and get a better look.  then it appeared to get thinner and vanished, like a 3x5 card rotating so it disappeared when edge-on, and did not reappear.  then we went on to our destination.  my 6-yr old said she also saw it but is not reliable and i'm not sure she did.  i had attended a talk by dr steven greer thursday in denver, and we were in a peaceful and fun mood at the time, and i was probably thinking about the talk when i looked towards denver and saw the object.  i did not think much of it at the time, i'm not sure i consider any of this stuff really seriously, but do have an open mind and follow news on the subject.  and i would not have bothered to report but saw a report of

direction.I have not seen anything that would remotely come close to what i saw.I havebeen observing aircraft for over 40 years.                                                                     the object had an estimated wingspan of 200 to 250ft..It was black in color with a cresent shaped wing.It appeared to have a fuuselage in the center with a series of concave shapes on the trailing edge of the wing.The object was not moving at a high rate of speed but rather seemed to be motionless for a brief moment. as the clouds passed to the south a break opened and it appeared again only for a quick moment.It was then that it disappeared to the north rapidly above the cloud cover.My friend will not come forward in this matter and i have since moved to spokane,wa.Please feel free to contact me. i have more to teell about other incidences that i have encountered over the years.I manufactured small aircraft for nearly 7 years so i am not a complete nut.","distance":"Over One

around 9:15 p.M. (correct to 20 minutes or so), i saw in the sky, to the northeast, and at about 20,000 ft, two bright white lights.  i had been looking at the sky and the lights just appeared without seeming to come from anywhere.  i immediately directed my friend's attention to the lights in the sky and he confirmed seeing what i was seeing (we also discussed and agreed afterwards on what we had seen).  the lights appeared to belong to the same structure, for they were moving in tandem; but no structure could be seen - there were no clouds nearby.  the two lights were each circular, white, bright, and about 2.5mm in diameter from where we were standing.  at 9:15 p.M. in gainesville during the summer, it is dusk - so it was still sort of light out and the lights still appeared very bright.  they were flashing on and off erratically and seemed to be jumping around in the sky (not all about the sky - from the ground, not more than an inch in any direction).  the way that they were moving (the two lights possibly attached to a structure) looked a lot like typical computerized simulations of how electrons move - awkwardly, erratically, seem to be at more than one place at one time - like second 0:56 of this video  http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=gsf7jhwr6ng     except not as fast and, again, not as many - only two - and together.  we watched for about 7 seconds as the lights moved strangely, while continuing to move in an east, northeast direction.  after about seven seconds, the lights stopped moving erratically and just seemed to fly in a straight line, out of our field of vision (past some trees).  there was no sound we could hear coming from the aircraft.\r\n     the jackson naval air station is located to the northeast of gainesville, and the eglin air force base is to the west, in the panhandle.  i don't think that what we saw belongs to either of the air force bases because what we saw did not come from anywhere.  it just appeared in the sky.  (unless the government was testing a flying object back-engineered from ufos or created with some secret innovation being kept from other american engineers and the u.S. department of transportation, and they'd forgotten to turn their lights on until they had flown about 200 miles).","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":17557,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.6595144,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06192009-0016","longitude":-82.3183362,"occurred":1244088900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1244088900000,"summary":"Two bright, white, erratically flashing lights, seemingly belonging to one structure, jumping around in sky. seen 10 seconds then passes tree line.","tags":["lights","flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Gainesville, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:220062"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Samobor","country":"Croatia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"No sound as two objects pased over head slowly.  red and abmer lighting on underside of both. my stepson, his girl friend and my wife were sitting outside talking.\r\n my stepson saw both objects eather come out of the woods or from over the hill.  at first he through it was a sky rocks but they kept climing and madev no sound.  i saw the objects as theyb passed over head and washed until they disapeared from view.  both kept the same distand and same speed.  both were steady as they moved,both moved from south to south east","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":17556,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.8014227,"location":null,"logNumber":"CZ-06192009-0016","longitude":15.7333222,"occurred":1245477780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"County of Zagreb","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1245477780000,"summary":"Two oval shaped objects came out of the woods or over a hill about half mile from where we were standing.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Samobor, County of Zagreb","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:220063"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Arlington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On this night, it was cold out and i was on my back porch smoking a sigarett. \r\ni was a 22 year preflight and delivery inspector for a large company her on the west coast, wich most of my years were spent on the flight-line.\r\n\r\ni heard a very large helicopter flying over the town of arlinton and coming from what i suspect was the naval antenna aray area; off to the north in the mountains.\r\ni waited to see what kind of helicopter it was, because i knew it sounded larger than the usual chinook. \r\nas it came closer, what i saw next stunned me.\r\nit was two very bright lights about 50 yards apart and about a hundred yards behind came the helicopter.\r\ni have  very good hearing, and with them traveling in a very straight line- i listened for an egine. there was absolutly no sound and no prox lights flashing.\r\nthey traveled in a straight line right to the left of our house about a hundred and fifty feet up and were headed due south.\r\n\r\nafter, i went into the house and told my wife, that something was up, because i had never seen aircraft like that before, in my just short of thirty years working with them.\r\n\r\ni toltally believe that the government either knows about them, or has something to do with them.\r\ni have been watching other stories of people seeing very simular lights, and felt i had to report this.\r\ni am sending a picture of the type of helicopter i believe was chasing them.

liked it would have made contact with the ground.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
