when i go out late at night i look up into the sky and observe the stars or the moon because of my interest in astronomy.  that particular night the cloud cover was minimal and the moon actually highlighted the cloud cover .  as i was looking into the sky i happened to notice not to far off into the distance several perfectly round objects moving at a very slow rate of speed approximately 500 ft in altitude , they were also moving in a perfectly straight line heading north east from my position. they were flying in a horse shoe formation and each sphere was  equa distant from each other which i would say was approximately 50 to 60 feet apart . i also noticed there wasnt any type of sound or lights whatsoever which i thought was also strange .  as it moved closer and i could get a better look i counted  7 large spheres ,  as i was looking at it i was wondering to myself  , what the heck is this ? as it continued to move closer the spheres appeared to get larger . i would say each sphere could hold approximately 20 or more people if not more inside . now .. what actually caught my attention as i was looking at it and wondering what this thing was another sphere  the same size and shape came out of nowhere and placed itself in a perfect position on the right side of the horse shoe formation flying at the same speed , altitude and distance between it and the others which completed a perfect horse shoe formation.  i mean the 8th sphere that came out of nowhere was perfect in joining the rest of the formation .  now the count was 8 spheres instead of 7 which i had noticed only 7 when i first spotted it .  i live near an oil refinery so i was thinking that maybe the 8th sphere was collecting info or data on the refinery .. i normally have a 3 million candle spotlight on the picnic table which is on the deck where i normally stand to spot animals and such which wander around at night just to see what might be making the noises and such . this particular night my spotlight was charging in the basement and i hardly ever at all go out at night without it . this particular night i wasn't lucky enough to have it near by to be able to grab it quickly enough to get a better look at it . the whole ordeal only lasted about a minute or less it was moving slow enough to be able to recognize it wasn't of this world . this wasn't a balloon, airplane , helicopter, or anything which skeptics seem to say when you can't explain something that's unexplainable i know what i saw was real .. i really didn't have any type of feelings other than i wanted to know what it was ,and after the fact i wished i had my spotlight to get a better look at it . i lost sight of the objects because i first sighted it which was from my deck which is located at the back of the house . the deck is 8 feet off the ground and doesn't extend far enough to be able to look completely around the corner to the other side of the house. if i wanted to keep an eye on it i would have to run through the house , open up the front door which is normally locked then unlock the second door to get outside by that time and how fast it was moving i doubt i would have seen it again so i didn't bother to continue with the sighting . i would also like to add that prior to this sighting ( a few days before ) i had a dream of encountering an alien which was slightly taller than i was ( i'm 5'10 ) it had the grey skin color , with the large slanted eyes ,bulbous head at the top with  long thin arms and legs and had a thin midsection area,  we were in a mountainous area , the mountains looked pointed at the peaks with very little vegetation around , we were looking at each eye to eye, i had a feeling it was a female for some reason , i tried talking to her but she never said a thing she put her hand on my shoulder and immediately i felt euphoric it was like everything went away  1000 lbs off my shoulders .. it was an addicting feeling where you didn't want that feeling to go away . after this meeting she took off and ran to another mountainous area not far from where we were standing and started climbing the mountain on all fours using her hands and feet kinda looked like an animal that runs on all fours , as she was climbing the other mountainous area i kept yelling for her to come back several times . she did stop and looked at me but then turned and kept on moving up and over the mountain . that's when i woke up .. strange who knows . i thought it was .. what that feeling was when she touched me was amazing , it was like no cares at all .. sounds weird and it was .. to end that was my ordeal with a ufo and an alien dream .. i will say this everything that happend did happen and i'm hoping it will happen again .. would love to experience more and learn more about what's out there among us  .. jeff ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

22h37 exactement.J'ai regardé l'heure car je discutais au tél sur ma terrasse quand ça s'est produit. pas de vent, ciel étoilé, il faisait nuit.\r\nje n'ai pas eu le réflexe de prendre une photo juste celui d'appeler mon mari, qui lui n'a vu que la dernière sphère lumineuse s'éloigner. pour lui ce qu'il a vu est surement un avion.(pas de bruit, pas de lumière clignotante)\r\ndans les faits, je peux détailler, j’ai bien vu. pour vous montrer, j'ai pris une photo de jour que j'ai travaillée sur paint pour vous donner une idée de la dimension de ces sphères lumineuses.\r\nil était 22h37 samedi soir 20/05/27. j'étais au tél lorsque mon attention a été attirée par 3 sphères - boules, très lumineuses, et même une lumière agitée ou instable, je ne sais pas comment dire, et assez grosses. de l'endroit où je les ai vues, il n'y a rien de spéciale, les lampadaires sont dans la rue, pas entre les maisons.\r\nil faisait bien nuit, les sphères se déplaçaient de la droite vers la gauche, ouest/est. au départ il me semble qu'elles étaient presque alignées, puis celle du milieu s'est démarquée ça faisait comme un triangle. ensuite la sphère du haut a disparu (je ne sais pas trop comment je n'ai pas vu car je regardais les autres : d'un seul coup celle du dessous s'est alignée à celle du milieu et est partie plus vite vers la gauche (est). elles ont pris à ce moment là une couleur orangée. j\"ai traversé mon jardin pour voir si je les voyais passer derrière la maison en face de chez moi mais rien. alors je suis revenue pour voir entre les maisons, et là une sphère était de nouveau visible, très petite, ce qui me laisse supposer qu'elle était très loin, elle se dirigeait vers sud est, tout droit dans mon champ de vision.\r\nca duré plus entre 1.5 mn et 2mn(ce qui me semble énorme). j'avais l'impression qu'elles se déplaçaient lentement, mais après réflexion je n'ai pas idée de la distance qui pouvait être assez éloignée.\r\nje vous montre les photos. si vous avez une idée de ce que cela pourrait être, bien que je n'ai pas de véritables photos ^^ merci d'avance de vos

eyes.\r\n\r\nwe were so awe stricken that we had a slr camera among us but only at the last min someone took a video of it but it was only 1-2 seconds of it. the whole episode took not more than a minute. interestingly in the video you can see the pulsating colors like white red blue green which we could not see otherwise. \r\n\r\nthere was airline pilot among us who verified that it was not an aircraft. no sound, no jet trail, no port starboard or landing lights. ironically the direction of the objects was exactly perpendicular to the airport flight path and there is mo way that mumbai atc would have missed this. the sea shore was a km away. objects may have flown above water at an altitude of about a 500 to 1500 feet.

on a dock at night. in south east missouri. it was a dark night. there was no moon. there were no lights being emitted from anywhere. we were way in the woods. the house lights were off. \r\nwe became aware of a shadow from behind us we looked..(which was strange that there could be more shadow) there was no bat no bird or beast there was what appeared to be a flying dark shadowy thing that flew toward us right over and past our heads changing shape and direction it hovered at shoulder level it seemed to be checking us out it then flew in an arching path and seemed to grow wider directly out from the front of the the dock still seemingly aware or looking at us. we both starred at it until we lost sight of it as it vanished into thin air. \r\n\r\nthen we looked at each other. i didn't say anything at first because i was not sure i really saw what i saw. but my buddy was shook and he was insistent upon me giving an answer to what he just witnessed. i was happy this was a shared experience because well... it was very peculiar and i would have questioned my senses.. my friend was kinda scared. i was shocked by how shook he was. i have lived and worked in nature a lot... this was unlike anything i have seen. we are both pretty pragmatic individuals. \r\n\r\ni was running thru the scenarios none of which came close to explaining this. my friend was still trying to get some explanation out of me.. we were not on drugs by the way... i was trying to stay calm so my buddy would calm down. he kept asking me \"what was that?\" with some genuine fright in him. i was blown away... but not so fearfully as him.. we both know we had seen something that was beyond what we know. this was not mist or a rouge cloud, shadow of a bird, or bug on a light. this was a flying dark energy, entity, spector,  et, inter-dementional something, or flying worm hole ghost...Something!\r\n\r\npeople have seen lights in the woods around those woods for years. people have just kinda chalked it up to people sneaking around the property at night or eyes deceiving the mind. there is some evidence that some hillbillies may have snuck around the property. the lights though were often not consistent with what you expect to see from a flashlight... again without explanation we can only postulate. \r\n\r\nthis experience with the dark flying shadow energy thing was undeniable. my buddy still asks me if i have some explanation...That would make it less strange. and he wonders if i know something he doesn't. ..I don't. .. this was a very impactful experience. i read about mufon in an article last month, i did not know mufon existed. if there is anyone who can give me any information about what it was we witnessed or if other people are seeing or aware of this i would genuinely appreciate speaking with them. what is the significance? \r\n\r\ni know that i saw and experienced something strange. my friend was left quite uneasy about this still. i still wonder if this is somehow connected to some other weird phenomena i have experienced.... i get that sometimes time and place set and setting can play a role in ones perspective like waking up in an empty house hearing your name....... then realizing you just moved next door to a used car-lot with an employee sharing your name being called for over the loud speaker. ....This is not one of those scenarios.  ..This was a close encounter.... with what i do not know?\r\n\r\nthe fact that my friend is uneasy about it still is a concern. again the significance of this encounter was greatly impactful. im not sure where the line is drawn between the \"spirit\" and \"et\" realms but this experience brings to mind to question where others weigh in on this. was this an apparition? alien? an assault? or a means of communication? \r\n\r\nmufon please put someone on this. \r\nit would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks for taking the time to read this. we would appreciate your help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

(did not note exact time) some of my participants and i saw a large amber colored light low to the horizon just behind giant rock from where my whole group of about 50 plus people were gathered and using 15 pair of night vision goggles.  a contigenecy of about 20 of us ran to get a better view of it.  to the naked eye it appeared to be a large orangish (amber) light, that quoting some of the 20 people; \"flew like a bumble bee\".  one guest, tana newberry, came running with a pair of the goggles in hand and got a good look at it.  she said that through the goggles it looked like \"a large diamond shaped ufo.\"  she drew a picture of it attached here.  this object then flew behind a small hill right behind the entire sky watch larger group.  as those of us who ran off walked back to join the others, 3 military jets flew over in the direction of the object now gone from sight behind the hill.  some of us commented that \"if\" \"they\" were following it, meaning the jets, they were a few minutes too late.\r\njust then we heard the sound of a low flying jet from behind the hill, and suddenly clearing the top of the hill and right over our heads, came a very fast military jet chasing a faster large red glowing light.  the military jet had both red and white blinking strobe lights and glowing afterburners and was very loud as it flew directly above our heads.  the large red light had no blinking lights and no sound at all! it became clear to all 50 plus witnesses, this was no jet!!!  those folks present who looked with the aid of the goggles said they were seeing either 2 lights, or one object with 2 light sources on it.  after extensive review of the footage, i am nearly certain it shows 2 ufos (fast moving lights), flying in perfect locked tandem with one another.  it appears you can see stars between them in the background suggesting that these are 2 seperate objects.\r\nas is usually the case, this footage while incredible, does not do the sighting justice.  the video is in black and white night vision, not full-color naked-eye vision, and does not have any sound, so you are unable to hear the palatable excitement of 50 plus witnesses screaming and cheering.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":84123,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.2392518,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06012017-0012","longitude":-116.3933246,"occurred":1495404000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1496345395000,"summary":"Military jet cases 2 ufo flying in tandem immediately following sighting of amber diamond shape craft","tags":["video","sound","ufo","lights","contact"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1496360355891,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/84123_submitter_file1__1876577619598969873695396766482432917726353n.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/84123_submitter_file2__188738102947971009323126207936589947994112n.mp4"],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":37,"maxtempi":98,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":82,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":19,"mintempi":66,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":37,"maxtempi":98,"maxvism":16,"maxvisi":10,"meantempm":28,"meantempi":82,"meanvism":16,"meanvisi":10,"mintempm":19,"mintempi":66,"minvism":14,"minvisi":9,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"98825","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":10,"locationName":"Yucca Valley, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:11819"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Westland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"May 23 rd around 6:30 pm eastern standard time.Westland michigan,wayne county     \r\nweather: overcast low ceilings winds south south west 20 mile gusting.\r\nmy sighting began as i was walking to my car in the parking lot of office max off of wayne rd /central-city. as i walk out of the store i saw coming from due east a dark colored object coming directly to me. thinking it was a  helicopter heading back to canton/plymouth mettetal airport (!D2). i thought it might be news chopper or military chopper because of the darkness of the object. object closed to less then 1/2 mile then object changed heading due south.That is when i notice it was not helicopter.I then took out my google pixel phone and record 2 sets of video.\r\n object made no sound, rotated and shift shaping. had no navigational lights no strobes. object made a direction heading due south just below cloud deck. at first i watched and question rotating is it balloons ? can't be 20 mile winds from the south southwest.Balloons can't hold a direct heading into winds nor keep a direct flight path. drone?? no can't be object was rotating and shift shaping and had no navigational lights/strobes  and was moving in small plane restricted space. object was heading due south into detroit metro airport fly way paths. i saw planes in the area south southeast of object taking off. i watched object form up into a bell shape.You could clear see object disperse the air all around object 360*. like air off a jet at sonic boom. object moved in direct manner at 20 to 30 mph est. no lights- no noise- rotating shift shaping and forming up.Estimated object in bell form 15 to 30 ft high about 20 ft wide.I watched and recorded for about 2 minutes, at one point i thought about chasing object but that would be hazard in traffic. i have 2 videos but i cannot get them to upload off my phone to  my email or  mufon site. they are on facebook though.

ever done this. my wife's first impression was that it was weird. my first impression of it was. i did not know. my description of it would be an extreme pulse of energy which would fade out forward, it would cone forward and then darkness and then another flash farther down, but too far for a passenger airplane to have traveled. and it would be a hard stretch for any fighter jet to of travel that distance. the night was cloudless. the air was completely still, had a jet fighter been travelling at, let us say mock 2+, which it would have had to of been doing, i would have heard it, and so would have everybody else. back to the description, when the pulse of light, that we both observed, did not appear to have any forward movement itself. it did appear though to move about, like a dazzle.On two occasions what looked like a white dot flash out and move about and then the next flash would appeared farther down. it headed out, when we lost sight of it in what appeared to be a north east or north northeast direction, into the province of québec, that direction would leave you up into a lot of wooded area and when i mean a lot. i mean, a canadian forest a lot. the whole siting took approximately 40 seconds to a minute. our feelings were at the beginning were a little confused as to what we were seeing but that turned into this is really cool. in the area in question. there are a

wife and i were standing on our balcony that faces west in guelph, ontario.  we observed a very large cloud cover at approximately 15,000 - 20,000 feet.  sort of a salmon type cloud shape covering the majority of the moon.  the moon was a half moon and more off towards the north-west at approximately 30 degrees to the horizon.  as we stood looking off the balcony we observed these search lights coming from the area of the waterloo airport.  it is very often we observe airplanes coming from the west towards toronto airport for landing however they are typically 5,000 - 10,000 feet setting up for landing.  these search lights were above the cloud cover and we could see them scanning the clouds.  the search lights were not penetrating the cloud cover but lighting up the area in which they were shining.  there were 3 distinct lights starting at a narrow spectrum and widening up to a larger spectrum.  i would suggest they were likely 20,000 + feet above the cloud cover.  the 3 narrow beams were close together but very powerful to be observed through the cloud cover.  noting we could not see the moon light through the cloud cover whatsoever.  the 3 beams then scanned towards the east widening and within 1/2 second altered their direction towards the north. \r\n\r\nnow noting there are typically airplanes landing headed this direction we have observed the headlights of airplanes very often.  they typically can look ominous through the clouds as they decelerate for landing.  the oddity here is airplane lights you can generally see maybe 1-2 kms in front of the plane.  the search lights were extending well above 10 - 20 kms from the source beam above the clouds.  the amount of lumens necessary for projecting a beam would be equivalent to a ground based search light.  however, these lights were originating above the cloud cover.  \r\n\r\nwe noted there was no air traffic in the area; the cloud cover was not covering the entire sky this night; approximately half the sky in our observing zone was covered.\r\n\r\ninclusively, plane head lamps cannot in my experience start with a narrow light spectrum and widen many kms wide and back narrow again; additionally a plane cannot alter its head lamps from west to north within 1/2 second.\r\n\r\nthese beams occurred and then disappeared; followed with another sighting approximately 3-4 minutes later however completely searching north.\r\n\r\nthere was no noise of air craft; and no air craft present in the sky.  i would suggest this to be odd because typically we do see air traffic headed toward toronto airport or air traffic toward waterloo air port.\r\n\r\nit makes me wonder if there was some type of diversion around the air port last night due to a radar signature.\r\n\r\ni consider myself a very reliable witness.  i have investigated a lot of accidents due to my range of employment and would consider myself a trained observer.  additionally, i am a mufon member and supporter thereby looking \"up\" has become my habit.\r\n\r\nmy wife observed the exact same lights that i did this night.\r\n\r\nas we are accustomed to seeing airplane traffic and their head lamps it certainly was not an air plane.  the sheer vast intensity of these search lights were exactly the same as a ground based search light except above 20,000 feet above the cloud cover.\r\n\r\nif i am correct that fixed wing aircraft have only fixed head lamps and cannot be silent this was an anomaly i had to report.  i am certain others within the guelph, kitchener-waterloo area would have seen similar sightings as it seemed to be over the airport.  \r\n\r\nwe did grab our cell phone and tried to take video of the lights but they never re-appeared.  i did attempt to get my small little red laser light we use for the cats and pointed it in the direction to see if i could arouse some sort of repeat search light with the cell phone.  i felt comfortable enough to do this as there was no air traffic or sound of air traffic which we hear all the time. \r\n\r\ni would love to have some feedback on what type of search lights operate at this altitude?  i did check the iss schedule and it was not flying past guelph at this particular time of day.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":84116,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.529665303309486,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-06012017-0005","longitude":-80.221126087923,"occurred":1496274600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1496321827000,"summary":"Searchlights

completely clear sky around 3am when i saw something moving that looked like a star. i called my two friends over to confirm what i was seeing as it was changing direction erratically. we saw another start to move and the two lights approached each other, revolved around one another and then stayed stationary. we then noticed that multiple stars in other areas of the sky were doing the same thing, moving around andd staying put in different places. the paths of the objects would freqently move direction. a couple appeared from out of nothing. the most notable of them was a group of four with one brighter than the rest move from different parts of the sky until the brightest was in a central point and three others surrounded it in a wide triangle before staying fixed and just hanging like stars. this was just to the left of the big dipper constellation. the other notable one was where a star appeared rather suddenly and brightly next to another (close to the triangle formation) and moved west, until it disappeared from view behind the trees on the mountainside. stars were regularly changing position in the sky and revolving around each other, changing direction - they almost looked like they were interacting with one another.\r\n\r\nthe place was entirely silent with no sounds of helicopters, and i don't think they were sattelites or aeroplanes as they were constantly and sharply changing direction. a few hours later, we did see what looked like a military helicopter pass west.\r\n\r\ni have seen this exact same thing three times - the first being on the 28th december 2014 where two \"stars\" did the aformentioned revolving thing and stayed put. the next one around a month ago where my sister was there to comfirm that i was seeing what i was seeing, moving as
