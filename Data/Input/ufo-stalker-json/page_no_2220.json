field exercise in the \"back 40\" of ft. campbell kentucky.  during the evening hours my platoon rotated through a two man guard routine during the evening hours.  one guard was mobile and walking the perimiter of our area, the other was to man the m60 machine gun mounted on top of a 5-ton transport truck.  the truck was positioned as such that it was facing an open area about the size of a football field, but oval in shape. the duty of the gunner was to maintain the security of this open area.  as such, one has to be vigilant of all motion in this area. due to the amount of light and our operating procedure, it was necessary to be wearing our pvs-7b night vision goggles.\r\n  during my shift as gunner i saw a saucer shaped craft emerge from over the tops of the trees at about a 2 o'clock from my position.  it moved in a semicircle until it was hovering over the cleared area to my front. during the time of it's hover, i can only estimate that the craft was no more than 100ft off of the ground. there was no question in my mind that this was a u.F.O.  i have researched since that time and have not found any other situations with the same exact circumstances.  by this i mean that, as usual the craft emitted no sound, but there were also no lights coming from the craft either.  if i had not been wearing my night vision goggles i am sure that i would not have seen the craft at all.  \r\n   the craft was distinctly saucer shaped, but the bottom was concave in it's center, as if hollowed out partially.\r\n   after hovering in dead silence for about 10 seconds it retreated directly away from my position in a seemingly straight line, until it finally was out of site past the tree line to my front.  \r\n   i had always believed that u.F.O.'s existed, and had seen the odd light in the sky, but this was very close and to this day the memory is vivid and i am completely certain of what i saw that evening.","distance":"21-100

in time, either, as there were only a few openings in the clouds to discern it.  my native alaskan wife is always the one who sees notable objects first while we're driving (like deer and other

into the cloud, come out and travel a short distance away, then go back into the cloud.  i watched the circular object disappear behind the cumulus formation, but didn't see it emerge out of the cloud.  i ran back in the house and grabbed my camera binoculars to snap a photo, but never saw the sphere return to view.  i stood there for about 15 minutes waiting, ready to snap a picture, but

perhaps it was an old-fashioned box-kite. it hard an overall dark appearance, but seemed to be tinged with a general kind of rusty-red color as well, but in blobs or spots, not at all uniform. i realized almost instantly that if it were a box-kite it was shaped very oddly, and there was no visible tail or line or any of the things one might normally associate with a kite. it appeared to be roughly one thousand yards away from me and perhaps 500-700 feet in altitude. i squinted, but still couldn't recognize what it was.\r\n\r\ni turned to the passenger in the truck and asked him, \"what the heck is that? do you see that?\"\r\nhe had not been looking in that direction at all, and, as i turned to look back out the window again, i said, \"there, in the sky... what is that?\". as he tried to lean forward to get in position to see past me out the window, i was already looking back at the object and, quite impossibly it just faded into thin air. as if in a film it simply dissolved away. \r\n\r\ni was astonished, and immediately pulled the truck to the shoulder so that i could properly maintain a view of the exact part of the sky where this thing, this solid looking dark, oddly shaped thing had appeared to be only seconds before. there was nothing there.\r\n\r\nthis happened very quickly and i understand that my description is vague at best, but the thing seemed vague

somewhat disappointed) eyes. i wanted to know what it was, i didn't want it to disappear before i could grasp what it was.\r\n\r\nit is my hope that someone else may have observed this and be able to

i watched the spot where i had observed the eyes and was shocked to see a whitish humanoid shape stand up and quickly walk into the neighboring yard across the street.  my heart began to race and i

moonless night, painfully crisp and cold. the sky was not a dark black, but a luminous satiny rich dark royal blue. i walked east on my driveway towards my back yard. a large, dark gray shadowy mass flying north, immediately caught my eyes. i focused on what appeared to be at least nine to twelve fat boomerang shaped objects, more accurately; these were kidney bean shaped objects, closely spaced and asymmetrical in formation. without a sound these objects smoothly glided across the sky. these objects were dark, not a glimmer of light on any of them. i was only able to view them for 15 to 20 seconds, when my neighbor's tree obscured my view. i ran around like a maniac trying to catch an other glimpse, but i did not. they were not flying at a high rate of speed, but in a steady calculated

reddish orange star, and it begin to move towards me. it moved much slower than the white star.I begin to back away from the fence to get closer to my back door.I was between the dog houses and back porch and it seem to slow down more as it got over my back yard. i observe the star trying to see a shape but could not make out one. i then notice a low humming sound coming from the reddish star. at this point i did not know what i should do so i wave to it.I let my arm drop down, and then i waved again and said goodbye and the star took off towards the east into space and disappear just like the white star. my puppy stop barking and my older dog did not bark but he was more hyper then he normally is. before all this happen i was doing dishes i think, i really don't remember what i was doing at the time. i know i needed to check on my puppy and see what had him barking. i did know and don't understand why i knew it was not another animal my dog was barking at.I do know the humming seem to bother me and i feel lost for some reason.I do know that when i moved away from my garden to get a better view i look up, and there was the star in the sky,but i knew it was not a star. i had no fear.Even with my actions of getting closer to my back door ,there was no fear in me.The only wittnesses i had was my 2 dogs and they are not talking.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path then

exaggerating any parts, and i am giving the best record of the incident even though it happened four years ago.\r\n\r\njune 23, 2005\r\nwestern pennsylvania\r\naround midnight, possibly even a little into the next morning\r\n\r\nmy friend k (i will call her k for now, as i am unsure whether or not she would prefer to be named) had a bonfire that night.  it was a summer night before our senior year in highschool, and the skies were clear.  there was no alcohol nor any mind-altering substance at the bonfire.  most everyone had left, and k and i were left to tend to the fire, and we were just star-gazing and relaxing.\r\n\r\nwe both noticed a light in the sky.  it was circular/spherical, high in the air above us, and it was pulsating.  because of how high in the air the object appeared, it was impossible to tell how big it really was.  you could tell that it was not a star, and it was, in fact, within our atmosphere.  it was not stationary like a star, and it did not follow a set trajectory like a shooting/falling star.  i could tell that it was not an airliner because of the way that airliner's light up with three blinks, and this object only had one on-going pulsation.\r\n\r\ninstead, as the object flashed, it moved in an irregular pattern.  i would describe the flight pattern as almost a random zig-zag: not a fixed back-and forth motion.  the angles that this object moved on were too acute to be executed by any aircraft that i have ever seen.\r\n\r\nthis went on for probably two minutes or so, the object pulsating and moving irregularly, before it finally disappeared.\r\n\r\ni considered everything it could be.  yet, i was able to immediately rule out an airliner or shooting star, or even a stationary star.  i also considered it to be a lightning bug, but then again the object was definitely too high up and too large to be an insect.  although before i said it was \"impossible\" to tell how large the ufo was, i know that it was too large to be a lightning bug - the emphasis is that it was a bigger object.\r\n\r\nk and i both witnessed this incident, and every time i ask her if we really saw it, she confirms my second-guessing.  once you see something unbelievable it is natural to question your own credibility.\r\n\r\ni did not feel threatened or intimidated by the object.  it did not seem to be aware of us watching it, as it was high in the sky, and it did not seem to want to use any camoflauge besides the cover of darkness at night.  if anything, i was and still am curious to discover what it was, and if it really was an et craft.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

watching a severe thunderstorm blow through our area. the most recent thunderstorms we've been having this year rekindled this memory.\r\n\r\nit was late in the summer, august from what i can remember. i was looking out my glass doors off the deck watching a strong storm pass through. it was very windy and there was alot of inter cloud lightning. i was amazed while watching this storm, the clouds were moving exceptionally fast and the torrential rain was somewhat subsiding even though the lightning strikes and wind were intensifying.\r\n\r\nthis is when i noticed a blinking white light zooming in and around the clouds. i immediately thought, \"oh my god what is that plane doing in this storm?!\" as the \"blinking light\" got closer i noticed it was round and in between the flashes of lightning and it's blink-glow, the object was silvery and shiney...Almost reflective from the lightning flashes.\r\ni was amazed, a little frightened and a little upset that my husband wasn't home to confirm what i had just seen.\r\n\r\nthe duration of veiwing this object was approximately 5 minutes or so. it followed along with the storm, flying in and out of the cloud cover.I watched it until i could no longer see it.\r\ni can honestly say that i've heard people mention \"ball lightning\"-this certainly was an object, a metallic round object.\r\n\r\ni have recently posted a sighting from the same backyard location in upstate ny where i saw a similiar shaped object, only quite a bit larger, still round and silver. this sighting was not during a storm but seen on a bright cloudless sunny day. same area, but moving in a different
