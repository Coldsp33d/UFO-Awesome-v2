i wanted to check  my vision. i extended my arms placing one hand on top of the other looking at my palms so each finger stacked. just above the twelf finger- was this star- it moved left aproximately the length of my index finger and at 180 degrees it moved back twice that length- the lateral movements were fast- then it moved up like a swimming fish to the center then drifted back down to the original line of sight off the horizon. kind of a triangular pattern or area covered. it did seem to back away from earth or deeper into space for a bit but came right back to this plane. it was colored like a star white with a faint tail that could be eye distortion. it showed more when moving about. it did emit yellow for a moment and at one stop that lazor orange red-it did not change shape- i was hopin it would change into that redball that some of these on film do. not this time.. the clouds started commin in and obscurin the view so i packed up and am extreamly greatful for the glimpse- next nice nite ill spend sometime watchin again.  foot note if some one else saw the same thing- i thought i saw a bar of light to the left of this triangular flight area  two or three times- it looked like a picture of tracer round placed in the sky except white light.  something firing in this things direction?? poor shooting, it appeared the fight pattern distance to the left. also did not continue the trail only  like a picture of one placed in the sky- just a crack of lightbar in the sky. might have been eyeballs playin tricks  as they were workin pretty hard to watch this star move around. would like to have second opinion to verify light bar activity- star movin is factual. ive been watchin a lot of film of ufo activity over the years- im kinda curious if these light balls are life forms themselves or imprints  of activity from another demension touching ours.

","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"What i���m about to tell you has left me wondering what it was i witnessed 17 years ago. the incident took place at my then residence, 981 gill ave, oxford michigan in oakland county, on a sunday evening in june 1992 (not clear as to the exact date). at approximately 9:30 pm, my wife (at that time) and our three small children had been watching television in our living room and were now getting ready for bed. there was a storm brewing to the south of us, which was producing a brilliant light show, as summer storms usually do in michigan, i was intrigued by the storm and watched it while my wife got the kids off to bed. i had been watching the storm now for a few minutes when my wife came back into our living room to kiss me goodnight, she wasn���t interested in the storm and went off to bed, i told her i would come to bed in a few minutes. as i continued to watch the storm, i began to notice a glowing white ball of light to the west of the storm, it didn't blink or flicker and it was hovering just above the tree line approximately 3 to 5 miles from my line of sight. my first thought was it must be an airplane or perhaps a helicopter, but after a minute or two i noticed it didn���t move like airplane, it moved a little bit at a time (unlike an airplane), i was thinking it must be a helicopter. i became more fascinated by the ball of white light then the storm and decided to step outside to see if i could get a better look, this is when everything got very strange. first, you must understand that my house sat on the corner of a very busy road (gill st. & drahner road) you can mapquest it, the speed limit on drahner was 45mph, everyone exceeded that! needless to say i was now standing in the middle of drahner rd. watching something that made no sounds, moved very slowly and had no visible shape, just a bright white ball of light floating directly above the tree line and gradually getting closer to me, keep in mind i was walking down the road in the direction of the ball of light which seemed to be wanting me to come closer to it (i know that sounds strange but i felt as if something wanted to observe me, has much as i want to observe it) the ball of light was directly above me now at a distance of maybe 20��� to 25���, at this time i had also noticed i was clearly farther away from my house a good 35��� to 40��� away, i had walked down the middle of a busy road, didn���t see one car, didn���t hear one sound, not even a breeze, i observed the light for maybe two or three minutes from this position, i was feeling a bit terrified now because i knew this wasn���t a helicopter, and it definitely wasn���t a plane. the light was very bright and it was impossible to make out any kind of shape. it slowly moved up and over the trees and that was the last i saw of it. i then realized i was a good distance from my house, in my pj���s, in the middle of drahner road, and still absolutely silent. i immediately turned around and began to run back to the house, i got back into the house and noticed it was now around 11pm. i ran down the hallway to our bedroom and woke my wife, i tried to explain i just saw something weird in the sky and needed her to witness it. she came reluctantly to the kitchen, where we looked out the back window, there wasn���t anything in the sky for her to see, i told her i had just witnessed something i couldn���t explain, she told me, ���go back to bed you���ve been dreaming���. i didn���t sleep that night, not after that. i don���t know what it was i saw, it wasn���t a plane or a helicopter that much i know. i put this incident behind me, but for whatever reason it���s been in my thoughts for a few months now. i have a new wife and family and reside in arizona, i���m a broadcast engineer for a satellite corporation, my wife is a second grade school teacher, we have two young children together, i don���t use drugs, i don���t drink, and didn���t when i had the sighting, i just have the urge to tell someone about this. i wish i had called the police, fire department or someone official when this happened to me, maybe someone else saw it besides me. this was my experince.","distance":"21-100

perspective of my point of view, as i look at the little dipper, the handel is to my left and the cup is to my right. the first flash i saw was a dime at arms length away to the right of the top edge of the cup. the next flash happened directly next to and underneath the handle but the third flash was a quarter at arms length away and above from where the handle and the cup meet, so basicaly this thing back tracked to form a triangular flight pattern and all three flashes were about 5-6 seconds apart and were \"flashes\" not \"streaks\".\r\n     at this point i got the attention of two of my band mates to watch these flashes of light but we only saw one more that was about 12 inches to the left at arms length away from where i saw the last one. there was no noise and the sky was very clear.

trying to reach glen means to augment his investigation.\r\n\r\non that night i was sitting in my upstairs west-facing den. i heard and felt the boom hit the house. it was much more substantial than any sonic boom i���ve ever experienced. growing up less than 30 miles from a usaf base (grissom), i made it a hobby to learn about military aircraft and i was very much accustomed to sonic booms over the years. this was vastly different than anything i had ever experienced in my 36 years (a feeling apparently shared by hundreds who dialed 911 ��� i being one of them). the best way i can describe the force was to compare it to a giant mattress striking the west-facing side of my house. it was forceful, yet didn���t break windows. there was significant force striking not only the windows, but the west-facing wall as well. it was definitely a shockwave of some sort ��� that i am certain.\r\n\r\nit took probably less than 10 seconds for me to run downstairs and check on my family ��� then i immediately looked out my west-facing sliding glass windows. what i saw took my breath away. \r\n\r\nit was a series of white-orange colored lights in sets of five. similar to what hank bolger described in the documentary and similar to what j.T. puterbaugh caught on film; however, they were distinctly different in that they were arranged in a sloped line of five lights alternating in direction and notably, while mr. puterbaugh���s film showed the lights lasting very briefly, with the first extinguishing before the last, the lights i saw were not flickering and appeared and disappeared at about the same time as all the other lights in the grouping of five. very quickly after the first set, sloped in about -20 degrees from left to right, i saw a mirror image of that in another set of 5 lights sloping the opposite direction in almost the exact same area as the first set. this alternating 5 light sloping repeated for about a total of 4 times before ending completely. firstly, i agree with the investigators that these were likely flairs from military aircraft; however, it must be noted it had to be several criss-crossing aircraft to achieve this appearance. i say this mainly because the intervals at which these appeared going directly opposite one-another meant that an aircraft would have to be pulling g-forces beyond human endurance and the flairs would have radiated outward due to the centrifugal forces involved in maneuvering in an s-pattern. i certainly accept these were flairs, but what i saw was notably different than caught on the puterbaugh film, and i maintain was caused by several military aircraft criss-crossing each other. i���m unaware of such a defensive maneuver in modern military aviation, but would be interested to know if this is common.\r\n\r\nsecondly, as i scanned the night sky i noticed a peculiar ���smoky��� streak coming from the eastern sky going in a straight line westerly terminating just above kokomo. it was much thicker in width than a typical aircraft trail and it was suspended in the air. since the night was very clear i could make out the distinct shape against the night sky. it also very much appeared that the trail originated very high in altitude and ended just above kokomo at a much lower altitude.\r\n\r\nlastly, almost directly above kokomo and slightly north, i saw a whitish-blue flashing light of very high-altitude that appeared not be moving at all. i counted 15 seconds while it flashed on and off about 5 times and then simply disappeared. i scanned the skies that night and saw several commercial passenger aircraft and this light wasn���t in any way similar. for one, it was a single light source as opposed to the typical red/green/white on commercial craft. two, it appeared to be at the limits of our atmosphere ��� if such a thing can be determined. i've witnessed satellites in our orbit before and you can always see them moving against the night stars. this object did not appear to move. oddly, of all the events that night, this particular light struck me as the most strange.\r\n\r\ni should also note there were no sounds accompanying the light show after the initial shockwave. my best guess is it was a meteor exploding just above kokomo, but it doesn���t explain the military aircraft being in the exact area within 10 seconds of the event. nor does it explain why military exercises are occurring over a small city at low altitudes (defensive exercises and evasive maneuvers no less).\r\n\r\ni did not see the strobe lights that dustin cronkhite witnessed, but i did see enough to convince me the ���strings��� of lights were military maneuvers. what i can���t explain (and have yet to hear from other people) is the smoky trail in the night sky and the white/blue pulsating light high in the northern sky.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nrob\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17493,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.493437,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06152009-0002","longitude":-86.1307833,"occurred":1208329200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1208329200000,"summary":"Regarding

see the sun shining that way.  i thought that a plane couldnt stay in the same place and to me it would be too high up to be a helicopter but it didnt look like that, it semed the whole object was spinning not just the blades.  i've watched the space shuttle go over and that really moves throught the sky but this seemed to stay in the same place.  i wanted to call someone out of the house or get a camera but didnt want to loose sight of it and was trying to work out what it could possibly be when cloud came over and it was gone. it probably only lasted for about 3 minutes from when i noticed it to the cloud coming over. went in to get my daughter and we came out to see if we could see it again but couldnt.  the only thing i can think of that hovers is a helicopter but to me this seemed too far up.  just wondered if anyone else reported something.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":17482,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.202352,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-06142009-0008","longitude":-2.883535,"occurred":1245033300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1245033300000,"summary":"Spinning
