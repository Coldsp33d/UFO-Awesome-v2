but none of these questions seemed to have a rational answer as to what we'd witnessed on that night. the entire episode lasted approximately 30 seconds and although i had a digital camera with me, unfortunately i could not retrieve it and power it up quick enough to take pics of the event given how quickly it all happened.\r\n  ","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":17472,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4038655,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06132009-0020","longitude":-104.5149242,"occurred":1244693400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1244693400000,"summary":"Night time sphere like object disappears then reappears within seconds, splitting in two then rejoins again before vanishing near roswell, nm.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/17472_submitter_file1__SketchofnightUFOsightingnearRoswellNMJune10th2009.tif"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Roswell, New Mexico","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:222889"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Morganton","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On june 13, 2009 myself and 3 friends decided to take a trip from boone,nc to brown mountain to see the famous brown mountain lights.  we arrived at brown mountain overlook at approx. 10:30pm. this was the first time any of us had ever been to this site and were immediately taken back by the frequency of the lights and the brightness.  aftert aking a short walk away from the rest of my friends to relieve myself, i turned back to face the group to begin walking back and noticed a very bright light that appeared to be over morganton.  the city is approx. 15miles away from the overlook and only the brightest lights and a few radio tower lights are visible. it was a very clear night with 1 thunderstorm way off in the distance just to the right of brown mountain as you look from the overlook.  at once i started asking my friends what they thought this light was. it was absolutely not a plane as there was heavy airplane traffic that night, and we had already observed numerous airplaines traveling over and across the sky in front and behind  us.  this light was brighter than anything else in the sky and was a white-orange in color. i did not appear to move horizontal or vertical and was well above the  height of any of the towers in the city visible in the distance.  just all all 4 of us were starting to watch it and guess what it was, the light suddenly just went off.  the light did not shoot away, it simply just went off like a light bulb would.  our first reaction was shock, i personally had a cold chill run down my back and had goose bumps on my entire body. we all stood there in disbelief but quickly turned out attention back to the brown mountain lights which were very active. approx. 25mins later the light reappeared over morganton, this time  not quite as bright and a little bit farther to our left and it stayed for approx. 2mins before just disappearing as it did the first time. approx. 30-40mins after this, the light re-appeared in about the same position as it had appeared the 2nd time only this time it moved as we watched it towards our left and seemed to just move away until i could no longer see it. by this time we were all basically in shock at what we were seeing and just stood there unable to really say anything, mouths wide open.  we were just about to leave as it was getting towards midnight and we had a bit of a drive back to boone when the object appeared again this time to the far right of the visable part of the city from where we were on the overlook. this time we all pretty much thought it might be a plane by the way it looked until it just simply went from being the brightest thing in the sky to gone in the blink of an eye. we attempted to get pictures with our cell-phones and with my friends digital camera but with no results.

to a height that was no longer blocked by the tree.  at first glance it appeared that it was multiple bright orbs, but we immediately realized that it was one bright orb that was dropping something else that was very bright as well.  it became apparent that the object was slowly rising from the treeline.  the orb or sphere was a bright white light, and at some moments appeared a red color.  as it slowly rose in elevation, things were either being dropped from the object or falling from it.  the substance that was falling from the orb was just as bright as the object itself, but smaller in size.  it did not look like there were other orbs falling from it, but almost a liquid-like substance falling at free fall speed towards the ground.  we never saw anything touch the ground, the things falling lost their bright light before reaching the ground or trees below it.  i questioned running inside to get a camera but decided not to leave.  the falling substance/objects appeared bright

side of campus.\r\n\r\nthe object slowly rose for about 2 or 3 minutes, then at 1:08 it stopped rising and hovered in one spot.  at this point the object had not moved in a horizontal motion at all, only moving up.  the object hovered and the unknown substance was still falling from it. it hovered in one spot for about two minutes. throughout the encounter the substance seemed to be falling at a constant rate, if i had to guess i would say every 1 to 2 seconds another glowing substance would fall from the orb. the substance continued to fall until about 1:10 am, when the object's bright light faded.  it now appeared to be a much smaller red light, about the size of a very bright star in the distance.  it was hard to see now, and it began moving west from its origional position.  it also appeared to climb in elevation a great amount within seconds, because soon our view was obstructed by clouds.  as it faded away, it was extremely hard to keep your eye on it, it looked like a very distant star, and it was a very small red light.  the light appeared and then became obstructed by the clouds, only to reappear again but a little further westward.  we tried to keep our eyes on it but by 1:15 am we could no longer see anything.  \r\n\r\nwe waited outside and continued to scan the skies for planes or helicopters but did not see or hear anything further.  we drove around town in the area under where we thought the object might have been, trying to see if we could see or hear anything unusual but found nothing.\r\n\r\nit was a very busy friday night and i am sure that we were not the only ones who could have seen this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

had had a similar experience. to date...No response. however, at our last meeting a fellow member brought to our attention that an article was published in march in our local paper concerning several sightings in and around the berks area in the early months of 2009. after reading this account, we decided to report this event. this is what i wrote on the rips myspace blog in february 2009...\r\n\r\n\r\nok guys...This is just amazing. but i do trust my husband and he has never in my 34+ years of being with him has he ever been untruthful...Teasing, sometimes boastful...But never a liar!!!\r\n\r\nthis morning at 5:45 he let the dogs out for their morning 'piss call'. he went back inside to prepare diego's insulin shot. while watching the dogs through the kitchen window 'do their thing' he noticed a single bright light, moving slowly about tree-top height just below and beyond our lower yard. being so near the airport, he thought at first it was a plane in trouble. he went outside to get the dogs and view the light further. it was then that he saw a form....Yes...Saucer shaped with a dome in the upper mid center. he didn't have his glasses on or any appropriate clothing to fully investigate it but he did see enough of it to describe its shape and its path of travel. the light was not a beam shining downward nor did it shine outward but the light did illuminate the saucer's shape from the edges. the form was level and hovering momentarily and silently at tree-top height. it then moved toward and over the neighbor's house when its light went out and disappeared. curiously, diego is forever barking at planes and birds that fly over and near the house, but not this time. in fact, both dogs never even reacted to it. later in the day he walked down to the area but nothing seemed to be 'out of place' or disturbed. he is still shaking his head in disbelief and i only wish i had been awake and downstairs to witness it too!!! \r\n\r\n\r\ni just wonder if others

left who came to see a piece of furniture i was selling being stored in the garage. i noticed a very bright star or planet just a few degrees to the east of the big dipper arm and said to my self that is not in the right place as i am an amateur astronomer. the skies were clear but with summer haze so that i could barely see secondary stars. as my eyes adjusted to it's precise location in relation to known stars i perceived it to be moving at a much slower pace than common aircraft speed but also at altitude equal to common airliners. i did not notice any flashing red wing lights, just a single bright point of light. at that point the object seemed very odd to me although i am located in a high traffic aircraft zone military and commercial. the object then made an abrupt acceleration northbound at tremendous velocity that i perceived supersonic because of my naval aviation experience. i did not see any afterburner or hear any sonic boom. i quickly ran to the south side of my neighbors parking area so that i would not lose sight of the object as it moved towards the tree line on the north side of the property. as i looked up again after moving i could not relocate it.

month.Last time we tried we had my friend bill,me,dave,and billy cox,and it ended up being way to cloudy.So today i took a look at the weather report,and to my surprise the report called for clear skies.I gave dave a call,and asked if he could come down for a sky watch tonight,and he said he could.He was to meet me at my house at 8pm,but at 6:00 it was looking like the weather man was wrong,but around 7:30 the skies started to clear.Before he showed up i took a look online to see what was to fly over,and at what time.The only thing i found was the hubble telescope at 9:41pm.A little after 8 dave showed up,and we got everything set up.He told me he had still been seeing a few in the morning when he gets home from work,but we did not think we would see much.After spaying a bottle of bug spray on each of us we got started.\r\n\r\nit did not take long for things to get started,around 8:30 we seen the first one,and our neighbor happened to be outside at the time,and she watched it with us.From that point forward they never stopped coming,it seemed every 10 mins we would see one.Just a bit after the hubble flew over we seen two nice ones that were following the same path,and same speed.All together we seem around 12 of them,we did not keep track so that a low guess.They all were the same like we always see but one.The one that was different i seen through my binoculars.I was trying to focus my binoculars because i found out it had two focus adjustment's,so i was looking at a bright star,and that when i seen this white circle like a ufo on its side,and this thing was big.I looked without the binoculars to see if i could see it to show dave where it was,but i could only see it through the binoculars.It was going north to south,and i watched it for ten seconds,and it was gone.\r\n\r\nif you live in florida pick a clear night,and sit outside from 8:30 to 10pm,and you'll see them for sure.I just want to know what they are,two of them came so close to each other i thought they were going to hit,and i know we would never put to flying objects that close to each other.I'm not sure if these things are in out atmosphere,or outside it,but i do know they are very high up.Almost everyone we seen tonight changed direction,or speed,something in natural orbit would not do that.I still have to upload my photos,and video to see if any of them showed up,and if i do catch something i'll be sure to post it,i have only check the first few,and the photo at the top of this story is the third we took.If anyone seen the same objects tonight,or would like to talk with me go to my chat site i leave open at http://www.Ufology.Chatango.Com or you can contact at my email worldufospace@gmail.Com\r\n\r\nlike i said i don't have the right cameras to get them on film or tape\r\n\r\nthis is the third report i;ve made i need an investigator with a night vision camcorder,or high power digital camera so we can get these on tape good my camcorder is very old,every night we watch we seen them,the least we ever seen was two the most was close to 15.We had a local journalist came out to see them,and he did,he also did a couple stories on that night call me and i'll link you to the articles he wrote.I just want to know what these are,and for someone to take us seriously and help

canada. on the american side, a few yards north of the power lines, the embankment runs high, blocking the view of the river from the corner where school street starts east from niagra street.\r\non a warm septemeber 1956 afternoon, the northbound niagra street bus dropped me at this corner on my way home from high school. walking the short block east to prospect avenue, i crossed school street to a small triangular park bordered by niagra, school and prospect.  to my right across prospect and four houses down, was my house. but as i started to turn that way, a bright, blinking light caught my attention.\r\nmy first fleeting thought was \"ye;;ow piper cub', then my eyes focused solidly and i was staring at a brass colored disc, the light atop rapidly blinking red, green and white. it hovered silently, completely motionless, and as hard as i tried, i could not discern any windows, markings or seams. and the light made it impossible to see the superstructure.\r\nit was slightly north, and higher than the power lines, perhaps 800 feet above the water. my immediate impulse was to run home to get my father. but i was mesmerized, staring, finally walking slowly back toward it, toward niagra street.\r\ngradually i became aware of the sound of jet aircraft approaching from the north. the roar of their afterburners started to hurt my ears, but they were out of sight, close to the water, then suddenly rocketing up into view toward the disc at a 60 degree climb. two f-86 fighters, close enough that i cold see the piots. and an instant after they flashed into sight the disc took ff so fast it blurred, streaking out over lake erie. any sound it made accelearting was drowned out by the jets.\r\nfor a brief moment that all three aircraft were in view the disc appeared to be about half again as big as the jets.\r\nthe following day a brief article about \"mysterious\" lights over the lake was published on an inside page of the buffalo evening news. a quote from the niagra falls air force base denied both radar contact and scrambled aircraft.\r\nafter watching \"ufo hunters\" air older sightings on the history channel, i decided to finally get this sighting into the record.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17443,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.8942268,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06122009-0017","longitude":-78.8757889,"occurred":-420829200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
