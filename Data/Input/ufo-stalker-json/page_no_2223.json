look outside at the ufo towards parker. \r\n my mom and i went outside and immediately saw the sphere shaped lit up craft stationary over what seemed to be the colorado river, northeast of our property.\r\n it was a good distance away, its hard to give distance in the air or how far away the object was.. it was slowly going in tiny circles it seems, then staying still... changing after about 4 minutes from white light to red... then at the sixth minute i observed it, it slowly dimmed and looked like a distant star, the stars weren't out yet. \r\n it was a wonderful experience, i don't know if it has anything to do with it, but i was really dizzy after watching it, maybe because i was looking up so long..My mom said the same thing.. we feel fine now and felt fine about 30 minutes after that.\r\n\r\ni tried to get my friend to take a pic, but he couldn't he said, however, his cousin said he looked through binoculars and saw what he described as a big balloon...He said it looked round... there is no way a balloon could have been there.... that big..... that high.. that long.... changing colors.... absolutely not.... and if so where did it go? \r\n i'm hoping others have reported this to you and got a good picture or video of it.  i tried to call another friend to video it, but they weren't home..   anyhow it was a cool sight, \r\ni hope they come back tonight... take care , will be happy to talk to you if you like ..\r\n hope all of you are doing well... \r\nthank you,\r\ndeana walker","distance":"Over One

verdad es que despu������s de 30 a������os,a la fecha, y redactando esta historia a diversas instituciones del fen������meno ovni, jam������s he recibido una respuesta y/o asistencia para dilucidar, en parte creo, la experiencia que no s������lo la percib������ personalmente, sino que puedo dar cr������dito de que fue observado por m������s de 100 personas y, que adem������s esta misma historia jam������s la he podido registrar como parte de otros relatos de iguales caracter������sticas, ni experiencias similares en otros pa������ses. tal vez estas dudas son las que me llevan narrarla y saber algo m������s de lo que pudo haber sucedido o si otras personas alguna vez han visto algo igual:\r\n\r\nme encontraba reci������n egresado del curso de instrucci������n para desempe������arme como funcionario de carabineros de chile, en el grupo de instrucci������n de carabineros de chuquicamata, y en esos momentos agregado a la comisar������a de la ciudad; era mi primer turno nocturno y por casualidades del destino es que acompa������aba al jefe del turno, un sargento de igual apellido que yo, aguilera, y fue por esa situaci������n y coincidencia que me hizo que lo acompa������ara. lo primero que este suboficial realiz������ fue dirigirse a la mina de chuquicamata, visitar y mostrarme las faenas internas de extracci������n y proceso del material de cobre, las instalaciones y el trabajo de los obreros del lugar.\r\n\r\nen esas circunstancias y pasados unos minutos es que fue contactado radialmente para que nos devolvieramos a la comisar������a con el objeto de prestar cooperaci������n a un oficial que requer������a concurrir a la ciudad de chuquicamata, toda vez que la comisar������a se hayaba aproximadamente a tres o cuatro kms. de distancia de la ciudad. llegando a la unidad recogimos al oficial, quien se subi������ a la camioneta que manejaba el sargento, de tal modo que posicionalmente quedamos, el sargento conduciendo, el oficial en la parte central y yo al costado de la puerta del lado derecho del m������vil, ya que portaba y ten������a en mi poder un arma autom������tica.\r\n\r\nde esta forma es que nos dirgimos en direcci������n surponiente por la ruta hacia la ciudad, yo miraba otras instalaciones mineras, poblaciones civiles etc., que se hallaban hacia mi lado, mientras que ellos conversaban animadamente; en esos instantes pas������bamos a corta distancia de unas instalaciones del ej������rcito cuando me percat������ de un gran e intenso movimiento de los reclutas, quienes iban y ven������an corriendo en varias direcciones al interior de un patio y saliendo del interior de unas barracas que manten������an sus luces encendidas: esto me hizo recordar mi propia experiencia y los primeros momentos en el grupo de instrucci������n, cuando nos hac������an levantar casi a medianoche para realizar ejercicios de emergencia, por lo que asum������ en primera instancia que les estaban realizando iguales ejercicios.\r\n\r\nmientras recordaba esa situaci������n, escuche al oficial que iba al lado m������o que con voz grave y casi estupefacto dec������a \"mira esa huev������, si no lo estuviera viendo no lo creer������a\", momento en que casi por inercia el conductor detuvo el veh������culo en que viaj������bamos en la misma carretera, al mismo tiempo en que yo redirig������a mi mirada hacia el frente de la camioneta observando hacia el horizonte, vale decir, hacia donde se ve������a un objeto luminoso en el cielo, casi en diagonal hacia donde nos dirg������amos, osea hacia el norponiente.\r\n\r\nacto seguido, y por ������rdenes inmediatas del oficial abr������ la puerta del veh������culo y descend������mos, primero yo y el oficial que segu������a a mis espaldas, mientras que el sargento descend������a por el lado contrario. inmediatamente en la calzada pude observar este objeto, acompa������ado de un sinn������mero de emociones al poder experimentar tal evento.\r\n\r\nprimero: lo que llegu������ a observar era un inmenso aparato, suspendido en el aire, segundo: su forma, la asimil������ de inmediato a un bal������n de rugby, tercero: su color era intenso y ������nico, abarcaba toda su estructura externa e interna y era del color que se ve en las bombillas o ampolletas, cuarto: se reflejaba hacia todos sus contornos, quinto: estaba est������tico en el cielo, no se como apareci������, s������lo lo vi luego de la alarma que dio mi oficial superior, el objeto se manten������a inm������vil, por lo que tuve el tiempo suficiente (lo pensaba en ese momento, antes de que se fuera) de voltearme y mirarlo denuevo, como si creyera que se trataba de una alucinaci������n, camin������ alrededor del veh������culo y completando un c������rculo a trav������s de este, volv������ a mi lugar de observaci������n verificando que este objeto a������n permanec������a en el cielo.\r\n\r\nsexto:en esa situaci������n mi reacci������n ya fue m������s calmada y comenc������ a verificar alg������nos par������metros, claro que lo realizaba sin mayor experiencia, trat������ de gravar en mi mente las dimensiones del objeto y calculaba que a lo menos de largo med������a algo as������ como cuatro a cinco estadios de f������tbol, s������ptimo: de ancho calculaba unos dos o tres estadios, octavo: la distancia desde donde lo observ������bamos, sobre los cerros del lugar la calcul������ en unos treinta kms., y noveno: su altura debi������ promediar unos cinco o m������s kms. desde la cresta de los cerros. estas ������ltimas aprciaciones la calculaba, toda vez que la luminosidad permit������a observar claramente los cerros que circundaban el lugar.\r\n\r\nbien, adem������s de esto, lleg������ el momento de calcular cuanto tiempo llev������bamos ah������ observando el fen������meno, ya que pude y tuve tiempo suficiente de mirar como los soldados y conscriptos de la instalaci������n militar se agolpaban en los deslindes y rejas del recinto para poder ver de mejor manera este evento. los veh������culos que circulaban por la carretera del lugar tanto de ida como de vuelta se deten������an y sus ocupantes miraban y comentaban la situaci������n.\r\n\r\nla situaci������n traspas������ de lo normal, ya que en otros sectores, tales como las unidades policiales de alrededor y accesos a la ciudad, ped������an instrucciones al oficial que se hayaba con nosotros respecto al fen������meno, manifestando la observaci������n desde determinado sector, por los efectivos de guardia y por otras personas curiosas que se acercaban al personal de carabineros, por temor, curiosidad o a modo de consulta, situaci������n ante la cual el oficial, molesto por las insinuaciones dictamin������ diversas ������rdenes al personal de servicio, con el objeto de no dejar ni consignar ninguna constancia u observaci������n al respecto, por carecer de solid������z ante una cuenta o novedad a otros superiores o hacia la comunidad restante que sabr������a lo acontecido al d������a siguiente, determinando que al d������a siguiente tratar������a de realizar una inspecci������n al lugar del descenso.\r\n\r\nse encontraba el oficial impartiendo estas y otras instrucciones, cuando el objeto en forma muy lenta comenzo a moverse y a ponerse en posici������n, como de despegue (posici������n en diagonal con un extremo hacia la tierra y otro hacia el cielo), cuando termin������ de realizar este movimiento y todo el mundo esperaba que se iniciara tal despegue, sorprendi������ a todos el hecho de que al contrario y en esa posici������n comenz������ a descender y se fue perdiendo en lo profundo de la tierra o mejor dicho hacia la base de los cerros o m������s abjao de sus faldeos, ya que as������ se observaba, se fue internando precisamente en un espacio entre los cerros, que s������lo se ve������a al proyectarse la luz del objeto, lo que quiero decir es que jam������s habr������a supuesto que entre tanto cerro que circundan los alrededores de la ciudad existiera o se pudiera observar, justo en el lugar, un espacio tan grande que pod������a albergar tama������o objeto, sin embargo, as������ fue.\r\n\r\nuna vez que del objeto se perdiera toda observaci������n de su estructura, permaneci������ s������lo el reflejo de su intensa luz, un  par de minutos y esta se apag������.\r\n\r\nluego de esta experiencia, qued������ satisfecho el haberla vivido y con los extremos a los que me refer������ en mi narraci������n, es decir, hab������a visto objetos en los cielos de ese sector, durante mis guardias nocturnas durante el a������o que desarroll������ mi instrucci������n, sin embargo dejaban mucho que desear, tanto por sus movimientos, luminosidad, trayectoria, etc., sin embargo este evento super������ todo lo imaginable sobre avistamientos, el aparato era colosal tanto en su estructura como su luminosidad y forma, no se parec������a a nada de lo que yo hasta ese momento hubiese sabido, le������do o experimentado, al igual, creo, de otras personas. esta experiencia fue ������nica y sorprendentemente exclusiva; a trav������s de los a������os y con las opportunidades que se me presentaban ante estos temas, lo pude narrar y tambi������n describir a otros estamentos preocupados de este tema, pero vuelvo a repetir, hasta ahora jam������s he recibido un comentario a favor o en contra, ni siquiera relatos parecidos y es m������s, jam������s he sabido de personas que hayan compartido esta experiencia, existiendo en ese momento tantos testigos.\r\n\r\npor mi calidad de carabinero reci������n egresado, en ese tiempo nunca tuve la oportunidad de poder excursionar hacia el lugar en que avist������ el descenso, ni supe que alguien lo pudiese haber realizado. luego de ese evento y casi en un tiempo inmediato fui trasladado a la ciudad de iquique, lo que me rest������ espectativas para realizar esa tarea. a������os despu������s, durante el a������o 2002 volv������ s������lo a calama y desde esa ciudad intentaba visualizar la zona del avistamiento, sin embargo a esa distancia no reconoc������a el sector, pese a una buena visibilidad.\r\n\r\ns������lo espero tener noticias de que ustedes pudieron leer este reporte, que nadie ha querido responder con anterioridad, y que con sus antecedentes mundiales s������lo me describan un suceso similar, estoy seguro que no puede haber sido ������nico y si es as������, me sentir������ igual de afortunado el haber vvido tal situaci������n, aunque las cosas queden en el misterio absoluto, ser������?

dark it appeared to be moving further west.\r\ni know that last time we sighted this object an operations manager for columbia scientific ballon facility or the dsbf out of palestine texas claimed to the local paper here that  what we all saw was a research ballon but how many times do they have to check the gamma rays around this region?\r\ni am sending you the local newspaper article on the \"so

had gone to my aunt's house to celebrate new year. after the countdown, we said goodbye and were driving to a village near by for a ball (not exactly as you have it in usa, but it's the closest translation i could get). after one or two minutes after leaving the house, we were in the car (me, my sister, my mother and a cousin)driving through the buildings (4 storey high at most) when i noticed a bright red glowing shaped disc hovering over the buildings (about 5 centimeters above, in my sight). it was about 3 centimeters wide and one high. at first i didn't do anything about it. at that time i believed there had to be ufos, but didn't pay that much atention to the subject. i just remeber thinking \"oh, it must be a ufo\". i kept looking a long time - i guess, i wanted to be sure i was really seeing something. that was when i told them what i was seeing. my cousin and sister glued themselves to the window, trying to see it. both os them saw it. my mother kept the eyes on the road (and have to say she doesn't believe it truly, special because she's a devoted christian - altough she has dimed it out over the years).\r\nwe watched it for a few minutes before it was completly blocked by the buildings (remeber we were moving). the object seemed to be just hovering, completly silent and motionless.\r\ni regret every single day we didn't stop to take a closer look at it. it was sooo close!!! we're pretty excited by the sight, but didn't know what to make of it... i even tried to take a picture (i had my camara to take photos of new's years), but i didn't get it out fast enough.\r\ni must say, in this particular case i did not have my glasses on. i don't see very well, but my sister and cousin do and they saw pretty much the same as i - with better quality i imagine!

much lately - we've already seen many.\r\nwell, i just went outside to the balcony with view to the east.  it was around 22pm. the second i steped out, 2 flashes of light in a row near one of the brightest stars (about 3 centimeters from where i was standing). i thought: what a luck, just the minute i get outside i see an airplane. but then nothing more. when i saw it the light was pretty strong and if it was an airplane it would continue to be seen for a while till it had faded into a thin light. so i thought it was a way of them to say \"hello, we're here\" - because i'm pretty annoying, i guess. always calling them. so i guess it was to prevent. lol!\r\nthen, because nothing else ocurred for a while, i went inside. only came out about 20 minutes later. i know i was scaning the skies when i saw a bright and big (i'd say 5 times bigger than the brightest star, around two centimeters wide and half a centimeter high). it was moving from north to south, but i also think it might be slowly turning east because the light seem to grow smaller. \r\nit was orange all around and a white light flashed inside in a constante ritm. i called my sister and we both saw it till it desapeared.\r\nthat was the interesting part. when we were about to lose sight of it (it was going behind the wall of our building), the object slowly faded away like they were saying \"we just came for you and since you can't see us anymore, there is no need to be visible\". of course this is just my subjective interpretation and has nothing to do with the event itself - just with our experience in seeing this things.\r\nafterwards, we ran to the other side (facing west) to see if it appeared on the other side (all airplanes do.. - makes sense, right?), nothing appeared at first. then we noticed (we have binoculars close all the time) a flashing red light just hovering very far away. at this moment it looked more like a star if it wasn't pulsating constantly.\r\nwe saw something else a few minutes later, but i'm convinced it was an airplane. the right size and seemed to flash at the rate airplanes do, so.. about the feelings - always joy, i guess. but after seeing so many we don't get that wow effect (despite this orange glowing one did get us fascinated - we didn't get one so good for a while).","distance":"101-500

occurred august 20, 2002 between 8:30 pm to 9:15 pm in the company of a friend was a clear night sky in my town as it is for this summer season in south america, we were sitting on the third floor my house, on the terrace listening to be more explicit on some music that had brought from a trip at a time when my friend asked me to see a light in front of us wondering if it was a plane, the note immediately when i saw white light that came with a fixed trajectory and then suddenly changed its direction to the contrary which is positioned so that it is in front of us appear at the same moment two other objects forming a triangle fixed in the sky where the two objects perform a complicated maneuver which will better explain how a drawing attached to the document, instantly observe the movement my friend asks me to bring a camera which i found useless by the number of stars in the sky, at a time i go out to my friend and i saw a white light to pass on the ground in what was then an empty lot in a very fast and without making a sound like we never mention anything about this issue because we found something amazing and that happened so fast when i was on camera and the object had disappeared in that time we had between 15 and 16 years both today and i study engineering for 22 years my friend to this complete legislation today to see so much of it on television i found something interesting to share my experience with you, i also found an unusual sighting, so i thought it appropriate to report or mention a few i told them of the sighting which now seems to see things like that but something that is common if you are skeptical as i noted many times i've taken, i did not want to benefit from the story and the truth i always like to be very objective about

hello friends, i first want to congratulate them for their hard work they do on tv i see a lot from my country by the discovery channel like history channel, i've always loved the ufo phenomenon but an objective view of the phenomenon always, my good sighting occurred august 20, 2002 between 8:30 pm to 9:15 pm in the company of a friend was a clear night sky in my town as it is for this summer season in south america, we were sitting on the third floor my house, on the terrace listening to be more explicit on some music that had brought from a trip at a time when my friend asked me to see a light in front of us wondering if it was a plane, the note immediately when i saw white light that came with a fixed trajectory and then suddenly changed its direction to the contrary which is positioned so that it is in front of us appear at the same moment two other objects forming a triangle fixed in the sky where the two objects perform a complicated maneuver which will better explain how a drawing attached to the document, instantly observe the movement my friend asks me to bring a camera which i found useless by the number of stars in the sky, at a time i go out to my friend and i saw a white light to pass on the ground in what was then an empty lot in a very fast and without making a sound like we never mention anything about this issue because we found something amazing and that happened so fast when i was on camera and the object had disappeared in that time we had between 15 and 16 years both today and i study engineering for 22 years my friend to this complete legislation today to see so much of it on television i found something interesting to share my experience with you, i also found an unusual sighting, so i thought it appropriate to report or mention a few i told them of the sighting which now seems to see things like that but something that is common if you are skeptical as i noted many times i've taken, i did not want to benefit from the story and the truth i always like to be very objective about what i see, i hope someday you find the answer to this strange sightings, and we benefit of the doubt to many, also greetings from popay���n-cauca,

dots over my next door neighbor's house, as seen in the \"01\" image. i increased the brightness of that image some to bring out the few raindrops also captured in the image, but no lightening (which i never caught!) i zoomed in on the three lights. the \"03\" image, at 500% in \"original\" brightness, it appears that the three lights were more than that; a white light with two yellow lights emitting \"rainbows,\" all lights possibley within or around a larger red light. at 2000%, in original brightness, image \"05\" is zoomed about as much as possible for the image density. curiously, the enlarged perspective of the lights is different than the original pespective, especially where the \"rainbow\" streaks become more visible and what appeared to be three lights at low resolution looks much different at higher resolution. the rainbow \"rays\" and the \"quantum leap\" perspective of the lights from low to high resolution are unidentified to me. apparently, an object in the sky underneath the clouds, natural or artificial, emitted these lights. in a strange irony, how \"funny\" to see a rainbow in the sky at night!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":17415,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6286325,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06112009-0007","longitude":-90.1915642,"occurred":1244692140000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1244692140000,"summary":"Lights

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was asleep on my living room couch without a/c on and windows open. i awoke completely and suddenly due to a loud, rumbling type sound permeating the house (like a loud train going by-but no train track nearby-didn't sound like a jet engine either). a glance at the kitchen clock showed about 2:30 a.M. i rushed outside through my east facing front door because i though maybe a low flying helicopter or something going on in the street running past my home.  i-95 is also about 1/2-3/4 mile due east and i can see shuttle launches in the distance to the east or northeast. \r\n\r\nthere was something going by overhead, traveling north to south (my left to right), in front of and above me (like from 10 o'clock toward 2 o'clock), clearly paralleling i-95 and just to the west of the highway (between me and the highway). it appeared to be a few hundred feet up in the air (250'-300' or so).\r\n\r\nwhat immediately looked odd to me was the fact that there was a large, concentric circle of rectangular lights and another circle of similar lights inside that under the underneath (ground side) of the craft and toward or at the front.  i did n't have time to count them, but there were about 1 1/2-2 dozen, fairly bright lights (like leds).  toward the rear (north end) was a single, steady red light.  it appeared to be centered on the mass of the craft in front of it.  forward from the red light about maybe a 1/3 of the way towards the light circles there were 2, steady. white lights, one left and one right.  they appeared to be equidistant from each other, the red light, and the circular lights.\r\n\r\nthe sky was hazy because the stars were not visible, but about a one-quarter or crescent moon was visible and i saw one other \"star\" (no doubt a planet) i nth sky to the southeast.  there was no apparent fog or haze between me and the craft.  however, i could not pick up a clear outline of the craft against that dark sky.  my impression was that it was rectangular, oval, or oblong based upon the placement of the lights.  no neighbors appeared to be up-the windows were shut, lights off, a/cs running. it was muggy and temperature maybe mid-70's.\r\n\r\ni sat on my front steps for 5 to 8 minutes and thought about how odd and large the circle light pattern was as i had never seen anything like that on aircraft.  it absolutely was not a standard helicoper or aircraft.  i did wonder if it might be some top secret military craft be shuttled to patrick afb not too far south.\r\n\r\ni went back inside for 2-3 minutes with lights off, when i heard the same time of rumble increasing in loudness.  from the kitchen i grabbed a led flashlight, and went bacl out the front door.  a 2nd craft which appeared exactly like the first one had already gone by and to my right (south).  it appeared to be at virtually the same height, speed (maybe 60-90mph.), and path as the first one and i watched it go out of sight to the south over period of maybe a minute or so.  i did try flashing and pointing my flashlight at it, but there was no reaction.\r\n\r\nthis morning, around 8:30 a.M., i was driving when i saw a brevard county sheriff's dept. car parked near my development.  i stopped, asked whether any strange aircraft sightings had been reported overnight (he said \"no\"), and listened why he explained that i might have seen a helicopter of aircraft spraying for mosquitos over night when they operate.  but, when i showed him a crude drawing and notes i had made (i was going to try to research this experience at the library because i don't have home access), he was puzzled and said it wasn't like such mosquito spraying aircraft.  he suggested that if i had a camera and was lucky enough to have another opportunity and could photograph something, that the dept. would be interested in seeing that.  relative to a sketch, i do not have access to do so.
