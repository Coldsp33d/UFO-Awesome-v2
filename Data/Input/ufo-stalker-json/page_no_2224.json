lot and watched this object in the moonlight move slowly above the treeline. at first, we could only see one light thru the trees but then another appeared as it moved into a clearing between the trees. the object hovered there for about 2 minutes-  no sound!!. we could faintly make out the shape as a triangle, grey color like a shadow, with red/white lights on edges that flickered like a flame or a plasma torch. they weren't solid or predictable like a plane's light, but random. we watched for about 3 minutes until a helo came close, and it stopped and hovered as if watching too! seconds later, the whatever slowly backed up away from the helo and the lights got dimmer until we couldn't see it anymore. the only place that has helo's that is close is the hospital life flight about a mile away. just ironic that it would be in the same place at the same time as this \"whatever\"!! we are all sure of what we saw but can't explain what it would be doing near a strip of land

had the fireworks must have seen it too - i could hear their voices and they weren't lighting any more fireworks. when i first caught sight of it, i thought perhaps it was some type of firework, but it kept moving from the south, i also thought maybe it was an aircraft and thought maybe when my view of it shifted i would see the navigation lights, but when it got more or less overhead, the object was illuminated exactly the same as when i first saw it (only a little bigger). about that time i realized i was seeing something very unusual and i had a quick thought to grab my binoculars and the camera, but i was afraid if i went back inside the house i would miss something. there was absolutely no sound, no aircraft navigation/beacon lights and the object maintained the same orange color and shape regardless of the viewing angle and distance i was seeing it - i was seeing a definite shape, and not merely a blob of light. i kept watching it move almost due north until it was just an orange point of light far off to the north and then it disappeared. i remember thinking - this is unbelievable - i can't believe i'm seeing this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

louisiana area; i am somewhat reluctant to file the attached report which i consider the least of all the aforementioned sightings. however, the sightings around here seem to be tapering off a bit as i have not had any in the months of april or may, so out of boredom from a lack of activity, i submit this report.\r\n\r\non the evening of june 5, 2009 at 9:00 pm, i stepped outside my house to scan the sky before retiring for the evening. the sky was extremely clear and all the stars were visible although somewhat dim due a nearly full moon. \r\n\r\nafter slowly doing a 360 degree scan of the sky three times without seeing anything remarkable, i started walking toward my front door when i noticed an object lit up in the western sky about 45 degrees above the horizon. \r\n\r\nthe object can best be described as appearing somewhat like a very bright planet venus, except it was approximately four times larger. the object appeared to just appear out of nowhere in the middle of the sky as it was headed north. the object was brightly illuminated for two seconds and would then quickly dim completely out of sight for 10-15 seconds and then reappear brightly for two more seconds. this sequence was repeated three times. each time the object traveled approximately 20 degrees across the sky before it lit back up after 10-15 seconds.\r\n\r\nthere was absolutely no noise at all outside during the entire 50 seconds or so of elapsed time of this sighting. \r\n\r\ni do not believe this sighting to be a normal aircraft due to a total silence during the time of the sighting, a lack of strobes and directional markers, and the relative size would be much larger than a jetliner at cruising altitude. also, the speed of the object would have been much faster than a conventional aircraft. i also dismiss the notion of this being a satellite, as it was much larger and brighter than any satellite i have witnessed before. besides, i have never seen satellites turn on and off before either.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17407,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.2485396,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06102009-0008","longitude":-93.2467699,"occurred":1244260980000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1244260980000,"summary":"Large

up at the grand canyon at el tovar. after 10pm all restaurants close and you can only get food from vending machines. i was on my way to get some food from my dorm and this strange glow caught my attention out a ways in the forrest. i went and got my navajo friend ( luke bigman) and we went towards this glow which was about maybe 50 feet or more into the woods. he was talking in navajo and before we got to a hill that came up to a top we saw three small looking things. we were about maybe 15 to 20 feet before we saw these shadowy figures that seemed about 4 to five feet tall doing something on the ground. they seemed to be looking or doing something on the ground. as we got a little closer one of them turned around and you could see its face. honestly it did not look like most aliens you see on t.V. or sketches. they looked very human. it had a slightly big head,bald and in little suits and larger eyes then a man but like i said not like sketches or paintings you would see on t.V. this all happend fast and as soon as it looked our way the other two walked off quickly behind the trees. the one just stood there and looked at us kind of liked an animal looks at you waiting to see who would move first. it then turned around and walked in the same direction as the other two. me and luke took a few steps back and were ready to run and at that time the light went out.We never saw a ship shoot off but we did notice a strange smell in the air kind of like a dry sweet burning smell. we walked backwards untill we got to the edge of the parking lot and told a few people which they thought we were drunk or on drugs.The next day i went out to the spot i thought the light came from and there was four impressions and burst reddish glass beads and the smell of that sweet burnt. i never reported it because of the b.S. those and these days and we (me and luke) spoke about a few times but nobody would believe us. i even told a park ranger and his only comment was to be careful and not venture into the woods late at night for fear of bears or getting lost. i just wanted to share my story if you believe me or not does not matter. but after that i started getting into hubble space pics and re-thinking if we really are the only ones out in this great huge universe. p.S. another reason i contacted you was because in january wheb a supposed ufo was over texas out here it made me think about that night in arizona with the same colors as the constible or some other guy filmed. that light looked the almost exact same.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100

6th, around 2:30am. on the way, i noticed an oddly bright light in the north sky. it appeared about 3-5x bigger than the brightest star in the sky. just a little more than enough to clearly define that it was not a star. when you looked close with a naked eye, it seemed to be strobing through different colors. so i rushed home to get my camera. this was my 3rd time witnessing strange lights in the sky, none caught on camera, so i was very eager to get this one. i live about 45 mins south of wright patterson afb located in dayton, oh. i'm in erlanger, ky. i believe this could explain my multiple sightings.\r\n   when i got home i immediately grabbed the camera, which ironically had no charge, it was left running the last time i used it. so after getting my power cord, finding it was too short to reach, unplugging the fish tank(poor guys), grabbing the extension cord, and plugging everything up, i was finally able to begin rolling around 3:00am. \r\n   everything was recorded from my 2nd floor balcony, with my panosonic sdr-s7 camcorder. i filmed the light for at least an hour, using both manual and auto zoom. zooming in, zooming out. in the zoomed video you can clearly see the strobing plasma lights and its overall, beauty, i guess is the best way to say it. it's really bright and weird aurora's and strobes are visible, clearly. i had no tripod, but i did stablize the camera on my balcony banister with my right hand, and used my left hand to prop it up towards the light. it's pretty good footage, even capturing 700x zoom, while somehow keeping the craft in frame. when zoomed in, the light flattened out durastically. basically, it looked like a dog bowl shaped disc, as it appeared to be circular with depth. also, zooming in revealed the strobing, or pulsing, plasma-like lights were coming from the top of the craft or light. at this point i knew it was a craft of some kind, beaming with light energy, or something!\r\n   after filming the object for over an hour, i was very tired, i had left my friends to go straight to bed, until i saw the light. although i very badly wanted to record all night, into the next day, i had just enough satisfaction from catching it on tape, that i was able to go to sleep. i checked on it for the last time sometime after 4:00am, and it was still there. after that night, it hasn't been there since.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n attatched is about 3 minutes of the best segment of footage i have, using manual zoom. at one point, when the object is out of focus, it appears as a blur, but this blur is perfectly flat on the bottom. i am not sure if this is anomolous, or just a normal thing. definitely adds to the video though. i have 20-30 mins total of unedited footage that i am more than willing to upload all of it if you are interested. \r\n  thanks for your time.  -mark","distance":"Over One

proceeded to do his doggie thing running and playing. i was a very clear night, a lot of stars and warm. i looked up to the north towards the new mexico military academy. i saw somthing that i thought was a dove fluttering as if trying to land on a wire from the telephone poles. as i stared at it i realised that not a dove at all or a bird of anykind, i was a fluttring dim pulsating thing that would hang in one place for about 30 seconds or so then move along to another location in the sky and stop again and flutter and pulsate and move again all in a north to south direction towards the roswell airport. if you were to watch a hummingbird feeding off a bush or a plant its motions were very similar. hover in one spot then move along but not in a stright line but a very deliberate direction.I watched for about 10 minutes and started hollering for my wife to confirm what i was seeing.She came outside and when i pointed it out to her she watched along with me. in about 2 minutes it did a sharp left turn to the east and was gone. she looked at me and said i you say somthing about this people will think your nuts or drunk or trying to gain attention. she said so you saw a ufo just shut up and she went into the house with the dog. i grabbed my cell phone and tryed to call the roswell airport but they would not take any calls for some reason and all i got was first a busy

from fremont to milpitas. with hopes of seeing bobcats or mountain lions, strange owls, etc. last night,june 9, we left at about 11:15pm. we're driving along, pointing out the diffrent lights (planes, since it is in the flight path of most major airports for the area). at approximately the last 2 miles of the drive about 12:15 am june 10th, my boyfriend yells, \"what the f*** is that!?\", i look up and see a huge red and blue light, hovering right above the top of the mountain. (way too close to be an airplane) the lights were flashing in such a way that there was no pattern to them. the craft's outline was hard to make out since the lights were so large on it. my best assumption would be disc or boomerang. we were about 200ft from it at first and at one point it came very close to where we were and i had only caught one side which was white or grey and sort of rectangluar with a round edge looking. made no sound at all. it was just hovering in the same spot, but moving within that spot, sort of in a circular motion. then it zipped over quickly about 100ft to the right, then back to where it was. we stopped the car immediately. i instantly started freaking out. this was like nothing i had ever seen, the movement, the size, and no sound! we decided it was best to not continue going toward it, so we stayed in the same spot for about 10 min, my boyfriend watched in amazment, i opened and closed my eyes, this was way to freaky for me! once it started moving slowly away from our direction and behind the hill out of our sight, we proceeded foward to exit the canyon. with me still crying, we got to the end of the canyon road, where we would make a right turn to go about one mile back into milpitas. then we saw it again! hovering and buzzing over a different hill, but this time a little bit in front of it, more over the city. we sat and watched for about a half hour more, as it stangely flashed and hovered very quickly in about a 100ft area.  my boyfriend was really excited and wanted a closer look, so we started driving toward the city to maybe find a better viewing spot. once we exited we saw no trace of the craft.  we drove around the area for another 45 mins, still baffled and scared, we couldn't locate it

started filming.   at first thought it might be a plane landing but object seemed to stay stationary for the most part and planes would not make there approach that close to the water that far out. as a matter of fact you can hear a jet taking off during the video so it couldn't have been another approaching plane.  object hovered for several more minutes before disappearing.  object seems to jump quite abit on frames time 14-15 sec. done in slow motion and even though camera was a little shaky the object seems to move to the left very fast about 2 inches across the screen.  i was zoomed in as close as i could get with my camera but it was at least several miles out above the ocean.  started talking with my friends again and later looked back and was gone.  p.S.  if you hear my friends talking about a crow on the video there was one on the beach that they were referring to and not what i was filming. just an fyi. \r\n

alcohol in our systems. we were having a conversation as we passed the weigh station right before our exit- woodburn. a bright light caught the corner of our eyes at the same time. all we said was \"whoa, what's that\"? the time around 11:15-11:20 p.M. the sky was nice and clear. had been hot that whole week. this bright circle shaped ball appeared high in the sky to our left. it was a bluish green, almost like teal color. it was traveling at an extremely fast speed and had a tail trailing behind it. there was no sound and it only lasted like 10 seconds as it went from up high to our left then traveled diaganally down to the bottom right. it went a great distance in a matter of seconds and continued flying downward smoothly till it looked like it crashed over the free way out of our sight. hard to say the distance it was from us. it appeared to be huge judged by sight. even if the object was indeed close to us, it would have been atleast 3 airplanes together in size. if it was far away, just means it was even bigger. my husband claimed there was no way it could of been a coment or meterorite or shooting star. it was too close to earths surface, and the color was just out of this world. the color was almost magical, just bright and beautiful. it had an appearance as if the object was on fire. my dream would be to witness a ufo crash, unfortunatly, we did not get to see it hit ground. my husband has always been skeptical and non-believer of ufo's till now. i on the other hand have always been aware of their existence. just a matter of time till everyone is awakened to the truth. untill then, keep looking
