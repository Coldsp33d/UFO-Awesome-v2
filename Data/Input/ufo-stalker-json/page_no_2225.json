that darned pimple hung around for a few more days after the mark was gone. how is that possible???\r\n\r\nok, i will now go back to the summer of 1997. my ex husband and i were having a conversation in our living room when everything came to a stop....He just froze in midsentence and it appeared that time had come to a stop as well. through the front wall of my living room 2 beings came through and then glided over to me. the one standing towards the front was a female (i could sense this) and the other stood just to the left of her and slightly to the back was a male. the female said, \"do not worry about your earth parents for we are your real parents.\" it was not spoken aloud but rather telepathically and in such a beautiful tone. rather sing song.\r\nimmediately i had a recognition and said to myself, \"oh, yes, i remember now\"! this is all that i remember from that particular visit.\r\n\r\nin 1993 i was lying on a very uncomfortable sofa, that was doubling as my bed because i did not have the room for one, studying for a history exam that i was to take the following day. it was about 11:30 or so when i finally found the time to relax and study for this exam because i had to put to bed my four sons. i usually helped them with their nightly routine and read a story to them before they went to sleep.\r\n\r\nas i was studying i began to feel that i was being watched. the sofa was placed right beneath a large picture window so i could see a large portion of the front yard ( and beyond) from this view. it was a very cold but beautifully star studded evening. i lived in the deep woods of tennessee so there was not an empty space in that night sky! so many stars.\r\n\r\ni went back to studying and then began to feel fear rising within me. i felt as though i was being drugged. simultaneously i felt the need to lie prone, go to sleep and scream for help. i looked at the vcr clock and it read 12:15. at this point i could no longer move my head to turn it.I wanted so badly to turn and see who was there and to get up to run to protect my sons but i could not move! i was screaming in my mind with terror....Sheer terror because i could feel someone in the house now and coming over to the sofa. i thought that i was going to die of a heart attack right then and there my heart was beating so wildly. i wanted to scream, to fight, to run to my boys but i could move nothing! just as they came right up on me i must have passed out because the next thing that i knew my eyes shot open in wide eyed terror and i looked at the vcr clock again and the time was 3:30 am.\r\n\r\ni could not move, i dare not move or bat an eyelash just in case they were still there...But at the same time i wanted to run to check on my sons! i could not move for the fear of being noticed and taken again......Although, i could not tell you where this thought came from.\r\ni waited until the sun rose before i moved one muscle then i ran to check on my sons. they were unharmed, sleeping soundly to my relief.\r\n\r\nfrom 1993 to 1996 multiple events such as this happened where beings came into my room to either take me, doctor me or impart knowledge to me.\r\n\r\nin 1993 i was working at a night club in downtown clarksville, tn. my shift was usually from 7pm until 2 am. by the time i cleaned up the dance floor it was around 2:30 to 3 am. the drive home was about a 45 minute drive as i was still living in tennessee ridge in my family's old homestead with my four sons. i was, at that time, dating a young man in the military and he would watch my sons while i worked at night. \r\n\r\nfor some odd reason i decided to take the dover road home instead of the cumberland city hwy which would have been faster and less remote. as i drove along i kept thinking, \" i need to get home. i need to get home!\" because at the same time i also had thoughts of, \"i'm tired. i should pull over.\" it was as if i was arguing with myself but in a frantic frame of mind. i needed to get home to my children and my fiance who always waited up for me, but, instead of driving on i somehow managed to pull over and park my car without even remembering that i did so.\r\n\r\nagain, i suddenly came to holding the steering wheel so tightly that i thought that i would bend it! i awoke in a sitting position with my hands firmly gripping the steering wheel??? again, my eyes were popping out of their sockets in terror. i had no idea how i came to be there (on the side of the road in an empty parking lot) or how it was that i did not even remember falling asleep??\r\nwhen i looked at the clock it was 6am!! my fiance was going to be so worried ithought to myself. i was absolutely frantic. my sons would be wondering where i was and as i always cooked them breakfast early in the morning this was not acceptable! i was really quite angry with myself for not being there at the time they would awaken.\r\n\r\nwhen i did finally make it home ( i had no home phone, there were no phone booths in the middle of nowhere and no cell phones) my finace was equally frantic with worry. i told him that i really did not know what happened but i thought that i had fallen asleep. he looked at me very dissapointed and i thought that our relationship would suffer from this night, but, i said very quietly, \" i really don't know what happened other than i fell asleep on the side of the road.\" he knew this was very uncharacteristic of me but said that he believed me all the same.\r\na few months later we bought a house together and moved to oak grove, ky. \r\n\r\nin the spring of 1994 my ex husband and my children were on the front lawn enjoying the warm evening when i heard my ex call for me in an excited tone. when i came outside i saw what were 4 to 5 lights forming triangles, merging and making other maneuvers that were highly unusual. my ex said that these could not be flares as he was very familiar with their behaviour. we filmed the event for nearly 45 minutes. several years later i contacted ky mufon and they had the tape analyzed and it was determined that they were flares. i just do not see how flares can form triangles and blink in and out repeatedly.\r\n\r\nin 1995 i had another experience with a very tall being with long hair. since 1987 i had been having problems with a cyst on my right ovary but with no insurance at the time i was not able to go to the doctors for medical treatment. i was really having a horrible time with this cyst and was in pain much of the time. one evening i became aware of someone in my bedroom so opened my eyes to see a tall man standing at the end of my bed. the room was dark so i could not make out exactly who was there ( there was a street lamp across the road from our home that afforded some filtered light to come through the blinds) so thought that it was my eldest who needed something. he was quite tall for his age but as i began to adjust to the dimness of the room i immediately saw that it was not my son! this person was nearly 6 and a half to 7 feet tall! i was embarrased by my nakedness and wanted to pull the blankets to cover myself but could not move. before i had adjusted my eyes to the darkness i found myself telepathically asking my son what he was doing in my room. then as the realization came over me that this was not my son i watched the being pull something up from his side and a beam of light began to focus upon my right side. i felt a burning so asked that he please stop! he did not pay any attention to me at all but went about his work. the pain was unbearable so i reiterated to stop. i remembered nothing more of that evening.\r\n\r\nthe one thing that seems to stand out in all of these events is my ability to speak telepathically with these beings. i have never opened my mouth to speak as somehow i knew instinctively to communicate via telepathy.\r\n\r\non another occassion ( sometime in 1995 )it seemed that i had just fallen asleep when i began to feel myself vibrating. the intensity of the vibration was increasing so greatly that i thought that i was going to explode, but, what happened at the height of this vibration was astounding. it appeared that i exited my body and was being taken into a craft hovering above our home. i remember arguing with them that i would not be able to go through the ceiling, as it appeared that this is where they were floating me, but no sooner had i thought this my i found myself in the attic and then through the roof of my home. the craft was absolutely beautiful and i distinctly remember hearing myself say this before i went unconscious. \r\n\r\nthere was another time that i was visited by a very short being wearing a gold toga. (yes....I know how this sounds....And looks. what can i say?) i was reading earlier that evening, and, as a matter of fact, was still reading when this began to take place! it was af if everything was in another dimension taking place....Like in a fog? anyway, this being came over to the bed and began to pull on my left leg. ( i was completely paralyzed at this point so could not move of my own volition).\r\n\r\ni said to this being telepathically, \"if you continue to pull me by my leg you will cause me to hit my head on the night stand!\" i was really terrified that i was going to be injured so panic was beginning to rise within me. this is the last that i remembered of that event.\r\n\r\ni have to say that there were more but what stood out about all these incedents was the fact that, 1) i experienced a paralysis before the event unfolded, 2) i could only speak telepathically and 3) i always awakend crying, panic stricken and begging my husband to help me. i would ask him why he never woke up when i screamed for him to help me and he would answer that he never heard me.\r\n\r\ni have seen them take a baby from  my womb and hold it in their hand ooohing and awwwing over how perfect the specimen was just before they placed it in a tube of liquid. i would beg them to give me my baby back but they never paid any attention to my pleas.\r\n\r\ni have even had the horror of witnessing a mass extinction of mankind.\r\n\r\ni was standing on a balcony looking below at earth and i saw people begging for their lives. i began to sob and pleaded, \"why won't you help them? help them!\" they simply answered, \"this is how it must be\".\r\nat that momnet i recogized that i already knew this but had just forgotten. i never turned to look at these beings but had the feeling that there were 3 to the side of me and directly in back of me. i do not remember anything other than i was still crying when i woke up.\r\n\r\nthey have given me so much information of why this event will take place and i am sure that i also came with this knowledge prior to this incarnation. even though all of this feels real to me i need to have some other form of confirmation that does not rely just on intuition for my personal sanity and peace of mind.\r\n\r\nthank you for reading this as i do not like to type and i am sure that this is evident.\r\n\r\nwith kind regards,\r\n\r\njamie

it got light all around us, you could see the plants and rocks like it was daylight. the pickup died and then my next memorie is that i was so afraid that i was in the floorboard of the pickup. it got really light again and then dark and the pickup started. we didn't recoginize anything around us. when we finally got home i was grounded for being out so late, although to us,we had only been out for and hour or so. years later one of my brothers passed away, while talking to my other brother,and my ex, we started talking about it and found that all three of us had to have a piece of metal removed from our legs, we also tried to figure out why we never discussed it. we all mostly remember being very frightened. i don't even know if i would want to remember what happened but in the back of my

reporting site but never heard from them about it. i suppose they get hundreds of sightings every day. but here is what i and several others saw:\r\n\r\na seemingly cloaked or disguised craft\r\n\r\n4/23/07 elmore, alabama \r\n\r\n\r\ndear sir,\r\n\r\ni am a correctional officer with the alabama department of corrections and work at one of the prisons in elmore county, alabama. \r\n\r\nthis morning several other officers and myself observed an odd phenomenon. what we saw appeared to us to be some sort of cloud which upon closer examination appeared to be some sort of flying craft hidden or, to use a term from star trek, \"cloaked,\" so as to be unseen.\r\n\r\nbefore we are laughed off as nuts, let me explain the whole story as it happened: it was around 8:00 am and was the morning count time and i was a dorm officer. my dorm partner and myself counted \"a\" side of the dorm. then as she went through the \"cube\" in the middle of the dorm to go through to the other side i went outside to go along the sidewalk to the other side to count. as i was walking along i felt a sudden blast of wind or breeze and felt sand stinging my face. i thought; what in the world? it is a nice day, where did that come from? i looked in the direction of \"b\" dorm and saw a low wall of dust coming towards me as if propelled by some unseen force and when it hit me i had to shield my face and eyes. it was not really a high wind, but just propelled along by some force other than high wind if that makes any sense and when it hit me it felt very cold or extremely cool.\r\n\r\ni looked up to check the sky wondering if some storm was blowing in out of nowhere. but to my amazement the sky was mostly clear, but something immediately caught my eye when i looked up. a dark sort of a dirty grey cloud tinged in pink was going over at a good clip. but what struck me as odd was not only the fact that it was close to the ground, maybe a couple of hundred yards, but that it was going along at a fast pace, much faster than a normal cloud, even in a storm, but also that it was shaped so funny. i wondered about such a strange looking, lonely storm cloud to be skipping across the country side at such a good speed all by itself in an otherwise clear sky?!? as i stood and stared at it for a moment as it flew along over the \"camp\" (slang name for a prison) it i noticed a group of officers, \"yard rovers,\" standing in the prison yard a hundred yards away watching it intently also. i then turned and went on into the dorm to continue our count. but others watched it until it was out of site (see below).\r\n\r\nbut it was shaped so funny that it stuck in my mind for the next few hours and sort of worried me like something nagging at the back of your mind. it was as i said a dirty, very dark grey like a storm cloud and had a pinkish tint in places, especially along the underside. it was not shaped like any cloud that i have ever seen. it was almost like a big wedge the size of two or three houses end to end, the pointed or narrow end to the front, the aft end sort of flat or squared. and above this aft end was a section of it, of \"cloud \", that was sort of like a diamond or triangular shape, almost reminding one of the tail section of a rocket or plane. all along it and especially the aft end of it were sort of like tendrils hanging along being tugged at by the air as it went along, as if the vapors were being sucked off by the passing air or wind and being constantly rejuvenated. sort of like, if one can imagine it, a block of dry ice flying along with its vapors enfolding around it and flitting around and from it with the wind. that stuck in the back of my mind about how it looked to me. then a bit later a single word came to me, \"artificial!\" that was what i was trying to think of , what was nagging at me! it had almost an artificial look to it!! maybe i have been a \"trekky\" too many years, studying space travel, reading up on and being a fan of things like \"star wars\" and \"star trek.\" but the terminology on star trek used for the technology for a space ship to able to hide from radar and from visionary detection, basically being able to become invisible at will, is called a \"cloaking device!\" something similar is what the united states was trying to perfect with the \"philadelphia experiment\" during wwii. that experiment failed as far as i know and cost the military some lives.\r\n\r\nbut not wanting to be laughed at i kept all these thoughts, uneasy feelings, and observations to my self for fear of being ridiculed. but as it turns out i was not the only one who had witnessed it! later, as the day was winding down, and i having forgotten it, three of the yard rovers stopped in our dorm on their rounds and sat down to take a slight pause, or break, to rest their feet and began going on about something.. it dawned on me that they were chattering about the same thing i had seen! but they had more to tell; one commented on the coldness that hit them, and how without any real high wind a wall of slight debris and sand came at them also, sort of along of and in front of this so called \"cloud.\" they agreed that it was sort of like the \"fore blast\" in front of a helicopter or hover craft of some sort, but not as violently thrown as a helicopter does. someone else asked if anyone else noticed the orange plastic barrier to the construction area sort of just wrinkle up and roll up and over into a ditch, but with no real high wind to make it do so, just that sort of uncanny cold air and slight breeze that went along in front of the \"cloud.\"\r\n\r\none officer was asking did the rest of us notice how the so called cloud, or cloudlike substance around it, kept folding in on itself, sort of like renewing itself or something. another officer said that she thought from the beginning that it was some sort of secret, or even alien, craft in some sort of disguise and that when it went on over them she intently tried to look at the back of it to see if there was the \"back\" or aft end of some sort of craft visible. she said that the cloud, or vapors, just boiled down and over the back of it hiding the rear end, with the same tendrils of vapor or cloud that i had seen trailing behind it. and then they all agreed very excitedly that when it went over and across the open area of the prison that the \"fore blast\" of breezy dust and all preceded it and when it crossed over a tree line of tall trees the tops of those trees went crazy jiggling and swaying very fast back and forth, and as soon as it passed this movement ceased. that last bit of info sort of puts me in mind of the reports that at so called ufo landing sites it has been found that the molecular structure of plant material in the area had been changed or altered! one of the rovers said that he had been going to the back-gate at the time to let in the \"farm squad\" inmates. he chimed in and said that he had seen the same thing and now that he thought of it he agreed with all that they said. and he said that when he let the farm squad inmates in the farm boss asked him did he see that odd looking cloud flying fast across the camp? this farm boss more or less saw and felt the same things too. of course by then i had chimed in with what i saw, my observations, and my feelings.\r\n\r\none of the officers, who is very interested in science, space travel, etc, as i am asked,\"officer edelen, did you get the definite feeling that it was a craft of some kind, somehow \"cloaked\" or in some kind of disguise? i readily agreed and we all more or less agreed that whether it was an alien ufo of some sort of a top secret craft of the united states, it gave us all the impression that it was a craft of some sort in some sort of disguise. i of course even commented that i had read reports of alien craft that were not of solid material atoll but were known as some sort of plasma craft, possibly craft capable of traveling inter-dimensionally.\r\n\r\nit does indeed appear to have been just that; some sort of artificial anomaly, or some sort of craft: one; it was flying too fast, two; it kept a set course until out of site, and three; it retained it shape until it was out of site. and four; one officer commented that she had studied its shadow for a moment. she said the shape she had seen was not the obscured shape of an edgeless or uneven edged cloud but the definite shape of a hard craft of some sort.\r\n\r\nand then they all agreed that they had seen three air force jets, one behind the other, flying way up above the \"cloud\" but along the exact same course as if they were following it, hunting it, or possibly monitoring it. at that time we called channel 12 news and asked if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the skies over elmore, autauga counties. the guy i spoke to said that at that time they had received no such reports.\r\n\r\nnow these officers that saw this: i have right at14 years in with the alabama department of corrections, and the others on up to near 20 yrs and over. they all three are mature men and women and very serious, professional correctional officers, not given to flights of fancy and delusion and are trained both by not only apost certified correctional training but also by the training and intuition that years of service gives you to spot anything unusual and out of the ordinary and keep a level head while doing so, and to be able to mentally keep notes while doing so.\r\n\r\nand to top it all off this evening a 2nd shift supervisor called me at my home asking about the \"sighting,\" that some of our 1st shift officers that were working overtime on his shift had commented on seeing what we saw along with several inmates. i told him what we saw and he concurred saying that is what others there had told him.\r\n\r\nso i am tendering this report in the hopes that perhaps someone might find it interesting, might even already know about it, or to see if others have reported any thing similar..\r\n\r\nsincerely yours, \r\ndavid edelen\r\nelmore.,

my cell phone with a friend when i witnessed traveling what i had originally believed was a blimp flying across the western sky from north to south.  however, within moments i realized something unusual about the crafts overall shaped.  i quickly excused myself off the phone and ran inside my house to call my girlfriend to the back of the house to also observe and further confirm what i was witnessing.\r\n\r\nupon our arrival to the back of the house, just moments later, the craft was still in the sky and still traveling across the western sky moving from north to south through the constellation of leo, from above the 40 degree azimuthal grid line to below it.\r\n\r\nthe craft can best be described as a triangular shaped craft with three white lights appearing to be located on the vertices of the crafts underbelly and one red flashing light appearing to be located upon the center of the crafts underbelly (ventral).  in addition i was also able to hear what i believe to be engine noise emanating from the craft.  the sound was similar to that of a low steady rumble of a jet engine at high altitude traveling at cruising speed.\r\n\r\nthe craft was also not traveling at any unusual speed or pattern and appeared to be moving across the sky at, would appear to be, a comparatively reasonable speed for any aircraft. in fact, if it was not for it's close proximity to my

last part of my drive. it is about a 10 to 12 min. drive from that caution light on hwy. 71 to hwy. 98. going south. it was about 4:30 a.M. just a minute or so later i saw these bright lights up in the sky. it seemed like 2 rows of lights very wide in width hovering way up in the sky. at this time it seemed a long ways off and i thought it was maybe a road block way up ahead of me, so i slowed down. this particular road for most of its distance has no houses, only trees on both sides of the road. it was very dark except for the bright lights in the distance. as i got closer, i kept looking over to my right to see if i could tell what it was. all of a sudden i saw this very bright sparkling silver ball with closed flaps all over it. i could see the flaps very clearly because it was so bright and shinny, sparkling like a diamond ring and the ball was spinning around very fast and staying still at the same time. the lights were coming off of the ball hovering back and forth in a slow rocking motion. the two rows of lights had no colors to it, only the color of light you would see from a big flashlight.  when i saw this 'ball' it was only for a few brief seconds and it didn't come back up above the trees again. but, the whole 10 minutes i could see the light from it and when i past by and looked into my rear view mirror, i could still see the lights in the sky. well, i was really afraid at this point, and i drove real fast to get into port. st. joe thinking it was going to come and swoop me up. now, i am a very sane person, worked for 30 yrs before i retired from state government five yrs. ago and i am 58 yrs. old. i have never seen anything like this before and i do believe it was a ufo. i was too afraid to stop and try to figure out how to take pictures with my son's cell phone that i had borrowed for the trip. i did have my little jack russell terrier in the back seat and he barked at the object. i stopped at the exxon gas station on hwy. 98 for a few minutes and when i arrived at my daughter's house it was 5:02 a.M. i told her and my son-in-law about my experience and they both believed me. my son-in-law said there is a lake there behind the
