adjusting my telescope, when i happened to spot something moving away from the moon.  it appeared as a dim pinpoint of light, much like a star at tremendous distance but stars do not move in that fashion. this object moved out from the right lower quadrant of the moon at what must have been several thousand mph, then the object abruptly stopped, became static for a few moments, then proceeded on it's course.  i remotely tracked the object for only a few seconds before it vanished abruptly.\r\ni then re-adjusted the telescope and viewed the moon.  it was so clear and without distortions, that i stepped in to have my husband come take a look.\r\nit was a clear night and i had just remarked that there were a lot of commercial jets flying overhead, when suddenly a bright pulsing white light appeared to my left (wsw at roughly 60 degrees). the time was now 10:05 p.M.. as it passed overhead the object stayed completely lit, pulsing, not blinking.  i also had a commercial jet in sight, moving in the same direction and both objects very near to each other.  they appeared nothing alike and the object was moving at least 3 times faster than the jet, quickly out-distancing it.  also, the object had changed to from a white to a pulsing red light.  \r\nthe commercial jet kept a heading towards the west, while the object in question veered more to the south and disappeared.  i stepped into the house, grabbed my binoculars, stepped back out and located the object which was now ssw.\r\ni stood as still as possible, even holding my breath as i watched it.  the object began to move in a zig-zag pattern, then began to ascend until i was no longer able to see it.\r\nsighting lasted possibly 2 minutes.\r\ni would like to have seen it through the telescope but my mate was using the telescope to view the moon. this was also not the only recent sighting under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n(note: telescope is an electronic digital meade ds-114, d=114mm f=910mm f/8 with 25mm scope and 2x barlow doubler.)\r\n\r\n\r\nprevious sighting:\r\ndate: may 20, 2009\r\nexact time: 10:12 p.M. cdst\r\nmy location at time of sighting: 32.751286,-98.872635\r\ni had just stepped out to set up my telescope, when i noticed a commercial jetliner to my south, heading west at cruising altitude. suddenly a bright light appeared 10 to 12 degrees above the southern horizon, heading west below the passenger jet. \r\ni saw the object for about 2 seconds and then it was gone, having traveled approximately 45 degrees southeast to southwest.  it could have traveled farther but when i first observed it, the object was temporarily blocked from view by an outbuilding.\r\nduring the sighting, the object changed from red, to green, to white. when it turned white it expanded and disappeared. i could not determine size but a grain of rice at arms length might have just covered it.\r\nthe object radiated a constant light (did not blink, flash or strobe).\r\ni've ruled out meteor due to the low, straight trajectory, nor have i ever witnessed one that changed colors like that.  there was nothing being ejected and there was no tail on the object.  it left no trail.  i've ruled out any conventional aircraft as no terrestrial craft (that i know of) can fly that fast, nor was it swamp gas, weather balloon, etc.\r\nnote of possible interest: the object appeared to be over, or near the county airport (4 miles ssw of my location), which has recently been quite active and hosts an aviation museum. the object could have been closer, or farther away but i had no sure way to gauge the distance.\r\nthe sighting happened so quickly, that i did not have time to observe the object in greater detail, or with the telescope. it is possible that someone in the jet, or someone traveling north/south on hwy 183 witnessed the brightly lit object before it disappeared. \r\n\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?\r\nsetting up my telescope in my back yard.\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?\r\ni saw a light(s) that did not fit the norm.\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\nunsure.  began to rule out

and after sighting the object.\r\ncuriosity.  i knew that i was seeing something quite unusual to our airspace.  as for the object near the moon, i've witnessed before, objects moving over/above the surface of the moon.\r\n6. how did you lose sight of the object? \r\nobjects vanished, i.E., not there any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

light in the front and one smaller one on the fin came darting across the sky, heading towards the point i lost site of the object.. it was moving fast. i told my friend to get outside because now i was freaking out. but that is not where the story ends. i ran to my back yard and in the next 20 minutes 5 more helicopter flew over head. each having different lights. the strangest one resembled a police helicopter with a large spotlight. but the spotlight was aiming behind it and started to scan where it has been not where it was going. my town isn't very large but at one time i had felt like there were copters circling the city. after everything died down i sat in my back yard and was on the phone with my friend when i saw a low flying jet scream across the light of the moon dispensing a 3 tiered chem trail, that seemed to disperse faster than any trail i have seen before.\r\n\r\nthe whole experience was quite alarming. i can't get my self to believe it was nothing. in a small town around 50k in the middle of minnesota what are the chances of there being 6 helicopters and a jet on the same night that i see something in the sky.\r\n\r\nit was nerve-racking but now the next day, i

started seeing the objects that look like stars but move in all sorts of directions we look out the window alot at night. my mother got up around 4am when she seen the circle of lights. eventually my mother stopped watching the circle of light because she was a little scared so she didnt see where it went it what it did. also aroung 4am i seen what looked like a giant star real low and kinda pulsating . i have a video camera but honestly am scared to go outside and record them.","distance":"Over One

when we saw a ufo (i'll also register that one). but then, a few months passed by when we actually went and try to call them after i saw on youtube that you could.\r\ni tried for several weeks, but i think, at that time i wasn't quite ready. then, at night, i guess it was around 11pm, i was in the veranda of my apartment, and saw a bright light, more like a star - but brighter. nothing special at first till i noticed it was moving rapidly.\r\ni imediatly called my sister (she was in the living room, on the computer). she didnt hear me. i looked again, it kept moving. called her again and again and looked again. \r\nit passed in the middle of two of the stars in the \"tail\" of the ursa minor. she finally heard me and came, just to see it fade away. it went from south to north.\r\nlater that night, we were preparing to go to sleep but my sister was really enthusiastic and kept looking out the window (we share the bedroom). then, when i was almost a sleep, she yelled. look! i jumped out of bed and looked where she was ponting. there were three lights. two red on each side and one white in the middle. it was a few metes above the apartment building in front of ours but i don't know how far. it hovered about 30 seconds there. we was stunned. amazed. the bright light was a classic, but that was so much clearer. as we saw it in the sky, it had about 4 centimeters, imagine it real size!\r\nthen we called our brother so he could see as well, and maybe to prove that we weren't imagining things. but, when he came, the object started to move, slowly but continuosly from west to north-east. it slowly got out of sight. we guesses it was because my bother did not want to see it, from what we have learned from the \"law of one\", they can only appear to those who whish it.\r\n\r\ni call also tell you that, in those weeks i had been trying to see something i earn some knowlegde to how the lights and shapes of an common airplane is and their rotes (from south to north), i started to identify some of the constellations, so i'm pretty sure that, what i have seen is not an airplane.\r\n\r\ni'm sorry for the typing errors, but it's not my native tongue. i'll fill in for other sightings as well as best as i can because since those first, we have seen more than twenty.\r\n\r\ni hope to have contributed.

disappointed as i wanted to go out early before sunrise and get some photographs.\r\n\r\ni looked in the location where i sometimes see an object that should not be there and noticed an object wass there but higher up in the clouds. i determined a cloudy picture of a ufo is better than no pictures at all so i got ready for work. \r\n\r\nby the time i got downstairs, setup the camera and tripod and got outside i found the object was very bright and not in the clouds at all. either the clouds had risen or this object had dropped in elevation. i came to the conclusion that it had dropped in elevation when i compared the first sighting at 4:21am when it was much higher in the sky.\r\ni took a total of 30 pictures using different settings and the first picture was taken at 4:48am and the last picture taken at 4:56am. the first setting was night landscape, then night portrait and finally i used auto which turned out the best for the photographs and this object.\r\n\r\nthe object was pulsating with an even pattern to it. the timing of the pulsation was about 1 second between high and low.\r\ni got photographs of the object at its lowest level of pulsation and then at its brightest level of pulsation. while pulsating the object would grow faint and then get very bright. in comparing the brightness level it would be much brighter than any planet or star in the night sky should the night sky have been visible. \r\n\r\nthis bright star like object is just slightly east of south, mostly south. i have taken pictures of objects in this same location four other times in the early morning hours before sunrise.\r\ni pulled a weather report and conditions that were current as of 3am on the morning of june 4, 2009 and it shows the following:\r\n\r\ntemperature: 50.7 degrees\r\nhumidity: 95%\r\ndew point: 49 degrees\r\nwind: 0.0 mph\r\nwind gust: 0.0 mph\r\npressure: 24.66 rising\r\nvisibility: 5.0 miles\r\nuv: 0 out of 16\r\nclouds: overcast 1200 feet above ground level, scattered clouds 400 feet\r\nelevation: 5462 feet\r\n\r\nthis object was well below the cloud level but i cannot say for certain how far below the clouds it was. if i had to estimate the elevation of this object i would say between 800-1000���������. \r\nsome of the pictures taken of this object show a pattern that almost appears to be square shaped and off center. this pattern is of a different color than the object itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nafter taking my last photo at 4:56am while looking at the camera to ensure i had the object fairly well centered i noticed it was not as bright as it was. \r\ni quickly looked up and saw the object getting fainter and fainter and within 3 seconds it was completely gone and not visible.\r\n apparently this object was moving away from me at a very high rate of speed.\r\nthis object resembles one i took on may 28, 2009 at approximately 5:10am and approximately in the same location.

down on gas. a buddy, a guy named ssgt. mike bugno lived around the corner from me was also working at the maintenance operations center.  he was a weapons loader who was on the same shift as me so it only made sense to ride together when we could. he drove this old vw bus that got great gas mileage but was slow.  one evening mike and i witnessed something very strange on the way home (base housing area) to raf wethersfield. i still can���t believe this myself, but we believe we saw an unidentified flying object, a ���ufo���. \r\n\r\ni wish i could remember the exact date now but i can���t. what i do remember was that it was a thursday (i remember the next day was friday) in april. mike and i had gotten off work at midnight, and we had just traveled past the town of braintree. it was the last largest town in this area before we got close to raf wethersfield base housing. we were about three quarters of the way home when a very bright shiny light caught my attention off in the distance.\r\n\r\nwe had just driven past a little english pub that was closed; it was just at the crest of a hill before we would travel down toward the last set of windy roads to the base. i saw a very bright light, i mentioned to mike how bright it was. he looked and agreed it was one of the brightest landing lights (or so we thought) he had ever seen. we thought it was an aircraft landing light because the american airfield raf mildenhall, the military air command was close and in the direction of the light. it looked like something was making an approach to land off in the distance. suddenly, it turned and the light seemed to go in a different direction, then it seemed to get brighter and larger.\r\n\r\n i said to mike that it was headed our way and i wondered what it was. i had never seen lights that bright before.  it lit up a whole portion of the sky! within a few seconds the light was coming toward us, in the wink of an eye it appeared right over us!  i asked mike to stop the van, and he could not believe it either.  whatever this was, it was directly over our heads and it was not making any noise.  it was dead quiet! we both looked at each other as if to say ���what the hell is this���?  i tried to look up at it, but i could not focus on it, it was too bright, it actually hurt my eyes.  mike could not look at it either, we tried again but nothing could be seen for shape or size. he tried to start his van but it would not start, and he kept trying but there was nothing.  no noise, no key sound like the starter trying to turn over ��� nothing, the van was dead.\r\n\r\ni tried again and again to look up at this bright light but i couldn���t, it was everywhere now. i looked to the side of me and all i saw was a bright shiny white light, it was so strange! a few seconds later i heard a noise behind me, i turned fast and i could see the night sky and i also heard engines. i looked up and saw two british reconnaissance f-4 phantoms racing towards us in full afterburner. they began to shoot out photoflash cartridges into the night sky, and i remember thinking, why are they doing this; the sky is very well lit up here. i assume they wanted to take pictures of whatever this thing above us was. the light beam started to get smaller rapidly, and within a fraction of a second, it disappeared. mike and i watched the craft (light whatever it was) shoot across the night sky like a laser beam. \r\n\r\nwe watched as in the wink of an eye the craft (?) was gone. we could follow its path because of the light trail it left behind it. it was actually like a very thin beam of light traveling across the night sky. london was about sixty miles to the west of us. you could see the dimly lighted sky above london on any given night from this location. london was lit up now too (as usual). but this ���thing��� was now over london; i could not even count as fast as it appeared there. \r\n\r\nthe british aircraft (f-4���s ��� two of them) followed chase after it, we could see the union jack flag panel on its (f-4) tail. they were in full afterburner now producing the maximum amount of power and speed to try and keep up with it. there was no way in hell that was happening, they were still traveling in that same direction when the craft came right back to our spot within an instant. no kidding, it was like winking your eye, it was that fast. we got hit with another blast of light, i looked off to the side to see the british aircraft turning around to try and take more pictures as it headed our way, photoflash cartridges were still being fired into the night sky. but it wasn���t necessary, this thing was so bright you could not even see it shape, it was so odd and wonderful at the same time. i had no idea what the hell this was but i knew it was nothing like we had. i knew we had no aircraft that flew like this or maneuvered like this, this was something from out of this world, i knew it.\r\n\r\na moment later the bright light shot straight up, we watched it as long as we could. it got smaller and smaller and it got further and further away from our location. we watched it go as far as the eye could see straight up before it vanished into the high atmosphere.  the two aircraft were climbing (attempting) too but this thing was gone before they could even point their aircraft in the same direction. it was amazing; mike and i said out loud...We just saw a ufo!\r\n\r\nwe waited for a few minutes to see if anything came back, it didn���t nor did the british aircraft. mike tried to start his car; it fired right up like nothing had ever happened.  it was so strange, we were very excited, and it was about 0150 hours now, almost two o���clock in the morning. we drove back to the base and at the main gate we asked the security policemen there if he saw anything really bright a few minutes ago towards braintree. he could not wait to tell us he had seen something. he was still freaked out by it too, he said he was very bright and he could not get a good look at it, he said he was on the hill a mile or so away. we told him we saw it too and it stopped directly above us, he could believe it. he turned on his radio; the nightly news was just about to broadcast. london radio was announcing that over two hundred witnesses called in a ufo sighting.\r\n\r\naccording to the news, some people tried to take pictures of it over london too but all they got was a very bright light. they too saw the british f-4���s chasing this thing; london was buzzing with ufo sightings. i listened to that radio and then went home, i woke my wife to tell her what i just saw and she told me to go to bed. i guess she did not believe me. the next day mike and i watched the news, and it was reported everywhere from the night before. it was a ufo and we saw it too. we decided to tell the usaf office of special investigations (osi) about our sighting. they took our statement and that was that; nothing ever happened about it. i could not believe nothing was being done; at least nothing i knew about was being done!\r\n\r\ntwo years later (two months after i left bentwaters) one of the most publicized ufo landings and sighting occurred right at the back gate to raf bentwaters. even the security police commander witnessed it; many reports and documentaries have been filmed about it since. i guess england was (is) a hot spot for alien visitors. i still can���t believe i witnessed something so marvelous and strange, i am very glad i had someone with me. i never saw anything like that again, i sure wish i could, it was amazing.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

were stargazing when i noticed what i thought were two shooting stars.  the 2 objects shot through the sky in parallel about a pencil length apart and appeared simply as flying dots of light in the sky no bigger than a large star before changing shape into a sort of bird like object.\r\n\r\nthere is a crop circle formation that bears a striking resemblance to the shape of what we saw at the following website:\r\n\r\n http://shrey27.Wordpress.Com/2008/05/24/crop-circles-art-on-crop-fields/crop-circles-014/\r\n\r\nduring the transition of shape the color began to look more like a glowing tan or yellow hazy, misty color\r\n\r\nthey were so synchronized in their movements and transitions that i wondered if one wasnt a reflection of the other.  \r\n\r\nfrom my location they originated at a nearly 60 degree + angle and towards the northwest.  they moved in a sort of elongated v or sharp hook pattern and disappeared to the northeast.  they appeared to get larger until they were finally out of sight.  \r\n\r\nall in all this sighting lasted maybe 5 or 6 seconds and was fast enough that my girlfriend completely missed it as she was staring a different direction and couldn't catch the glimpse.\r\n\r\nmy reaction was literally \"what the [cms/tg/pd] was that! seriously, what the [cms/tg/pd] was that? what was that...\" i stood there in shook as i was dumbfounded how my girlfriend could have missed something that obvious.\r\n\r\nwhile she watched the sky i ran inside to see what time it was and my pc said 11:28.\r\n\r\nso we stared at the sky thinking about how great it would be if we could both see it together and after about 15 minutes something appeared again.\r\n\r\nthis time we both saw it.  2 \"dove\" shaped objects flying from the northwest toward the southwest.  these 2 objects were much closer together, approximately the length of an eraser tip on a pencil, and flew in a very strange pattern:  first they were side by side, then the synchronistically flew away from each other and back toward each other as if to draw out a vase sort of shape in the sky. \r\n\r\nbefore flying out of sight i could see them veer a sharp \"left\" as if they were right on top of each other and i was able to follow these for a much greater distance than the previous sighting.\r\n\r\nmy girlfriend and i were absolutely amazed and talked about how these objects had a very strange \"bird like\" appearance and almost glowed.\r\n\r\ni ran inside immediately after i lost sight of them to check the time and it was 11:43.  i grabbed a pen and paper and recorded a couple notes and the time and went back to watching the sky.\r\n\r\n7 minutes later at 11:50 we witnessed a mass formation of 5 to 6 objects flying in single file order but making snake like movements across the sky while maintaining a very tight, smooth, formation.  this was by far the most exciting and heart racing sighting.\r\n\r\nthese objects seemed to appear out of no where and were spotted slightly lower in the sky than the previous 2 sightings.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

returning home.  after turning on the light i saw an object crossing over the house from the east traveling west.  the object was about as large as a 747 and showed an odd lighting configuration.  there were three bright lights in a triangle and there were lights moving from left to right flashing white, red, green and blue. i was hoping that this object would stay in the air so i could run down to the basement and grab my video camera.  i telepathically asked this vehicle to please stay long enough so i could catch it on camera.  i ran downstairs and got my camera and when i returned to the patio door i could still see the object although further west.  i captured about 4-6 seconds of this object moving and several seconds of it at a distance.  on the video you can only see a green strobe light flashing on the left and then the right side of the triangle object.  this is the first time i���ve had two sightings in two days.  this object was about 1-3 thousand feet in the air.  very low in the sky.  it was about 45���-50���.  i also had a sighting of an object on saturday may 30, 2009 of an object up about 40-50 thousand feet of a single object swaying in the blue sky for about 10 seconds. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

of noise.I took videos of them the first 2 nites but we had no electric for 16 days and my battery died.Watching them i got the feeling as if they were 'playing'.We were pretty far away but they didnt

then stop completely and reverse direction two to three times before continuing back in a northward direction. they would also tend to get fainter as they slowed down or stopped. one light even appeared to travel below a cloud when we thought that it would have traveled above the cloud out of our view. there was no sound and speed would change as they crossed the sky. we went to bed at 11:15

march 09, and it had just gotten dark, when i saw a very unusual luminous object coming from the sw, kind of floating towards my direction with absolutly so sound, i watch the skys all the time so i know when i see something that isnt normal i.E not an airplane, sattelite, meteor, flare, helicopter, planet, weather ballon, star etc..So i instantly stood up and my heart started beating really fast, i have a powerful pair of binoculars, 20x-108x70, that i watch the skys with and i instantly pointed them at this object and to my amazement it was a single luminous solid shape, with a strange haze coming off it, it was a sphere to the naked eye  but when i looked with my binoculars it was thinner at the edges and thicker in the middle, sort of like a fat disk. i coudnt believe what i was seeing, i have seen unusaul points of light moving very high in the sky many times before, but never so close, clear and obvious.\r\ni was so exited i ran straight into my kitchen, which leads to my garden, and shouted for my mom and brother to come out, they came instantly and i showed them this object which was about a hundred meters from being directly above us, they are a bit skeptical about this kind of thing but they had no idea what it was, so we all were standing there watching this thing, i kept repeating \"what the f*** is that !\" over and over. and then as it slowly moved away from us about 2-300 meters away it slowly started to get smaller and smaller and then it just dematerialised, at this point i was almost hysterical saying \" it just dissapeard!\" my brother confirmed that he saw it dissapear too, and we all looked at eachother with wide eyes in shock at what we had just seen, my mom was really surprised at what she had seen . now im not sure wether it dematerialed or just flew away at high speed, its impossiple to tell. but what i do know is that iv never seen anything like that before and i dont know if i will again, it was not a conventional aircraft or a flare, star, planet etc... trust me it was way too low to be in space and was clearly not a plane or helicopter, and we dont have an active military here in ireland so flares dont exsist here and besides a flare would look and behave completely different . i knew the second i saw this object that it was something really special, my first real ufo sighting, i think i was lucky to see this ufo because i havent seen anything like it since, i would love to see it again some day, and i need to discover more and find out what is going on in our skies . thank you, flynn\r\n\r\n\r\n

over ramsey and, east bethel, mn.  the first night we saw a very very bright light at around 10:15pm on 5-22-09.  the light was brighter than any other in the sky and it was moving very slow, at first we thought it might be a satalite but then it stopped moving and hovered for about 10seconds before slowly fading out in the same place as if it took off into space.  two days later my friend \"c\" and i were on our way to linwood lake to go fishing at around 6:30pm on 5-24-09 when we looked up in the sky and there was a very shiny object that was hovering in place over a field in east bethel,mn.  it was so shiny it looked like someone was using a giant mirror in the sky and flashing us with sun light. we observed this for about 4minutes until it looked like it took off  straight out into space.  within 1 minute of it disapearing we watch 2 fighter jets come screaming in right where the object we saw was. and about 1-2 mins after that another fighter jet came screaming in with after burners on circleing the area.  \"c\" and i could not believe what we were seeing specially since it was only 2 days after we saw the first object in the sky.  then on 5-26-09 at around 10:30pm my friend \"r\" and i were standing on his back patio and we saw a strange light start to hover in between a few trees. as we watched this light another light seemed to come in and hover with it, then another and then another so that there was a total of 4 lights hovering in almost a triangle shape. as we watched the lights for for about 5mins. they all of the sudden started to flash at the same time as one another. they did this for about 2mins then one by one each light turned off until they all disapeared in place.  and the last incident was tonight 6-2-09 at 10:20pm this time the object was exactly like the very first one we saw on 5-22-09 only this time it was gowing the opposite direction in the sky. and as i watched this time the object did a almost u-turn in the sky then took off and disapeared right above me there were no flashing lights and there were other airplanes in the sky so i could deffinatly tell the difference between the two.  i didnt  think of reporting these objects my friends and i have been seeing until tonight because we keep seeing them over and over.  i swear i am not crazy and i dont know who else to report these objects in the sky to.  if you might have any explanation to any of these objects please let me know.  i now believe we are not alone in the universe.\r\n \r\nthanks and please let me know what you think.\r\n
