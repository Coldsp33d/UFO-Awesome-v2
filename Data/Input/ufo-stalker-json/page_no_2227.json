or perhaps just that i give them the attention they want. \r\n\r\nmy first sighting of this type of object was may 8th i saw one pulsing brightly over the city...But that is a different even may 9th the object was back...Ma 10th it was back the 11th it was back all the way through to the 17th...The skys where stormy and overcast for 2 days...I saw no ufos ...No brightly pulsing lights...May 17th 18th and 19th i thaught what i had filmed and doccumented for 10days was just stars in space...Outside our atmosphere...I had lost hope and felt depressed.\r\nbut then may 20th...There it was low over the city - the skys where still overcast and it was raining no stars where visible and this object was glowing like the fricken moon throwing off colors in a mist like aura around it. i told you this to somewhat bring you up to speed on whats happened since my may 9th report.\r\n\r\nthe other most signifigant and doccumented sighting happened not to long ago on may 25th 2am - 4am{could have been longer i fell asleep} at 2 am i observed a bright shining object on the eastern horizon it was low on the horizon and moving tremendously slowly. i watched it through my camera and binoculars and noticed it had no blinking lights ...And to me seemed like  an immensley bright star...I dismised it as being nothing...But subconsiouslly some part of me knew it was no star it was far to bright and it didnt register on my skymap program...I went about my bussines for about 45 minutes to an hour at 245 - 3 am i looked back at it what was before a bright yellow/white light was now the same exact object i had been filming for weeks...This made me pretty excited i grabed my camera to zoom in on it - sure enough it was just like the other objects bright colorful and pulsing red blue green i watched it for some time filming and after a few short minutes i noticed a bright red pulse - {the light itself probably doubled in size and turned solidly red} i zoomed in more intensly and watched somthing i had never seen before - unlike all the other times ive withnessed these colored flashes this pulse kept going!\r\ni would see it pulse bright blue and then bright red i would count and every 15-20 secconds it would pulse blue than red...In that order ...Every time.... these lights have intelligent pattern...And i filmed it for 2 minutes...\r\n\r\n\r\nbut that isnt the amazing thing about my may 25th sighting. after filming for a while i noticed i only had about 10 minutes left to film...The object seemed like it was getting closer slowly and i wanted to save room.\r\nin case i was lucky enough to have it pass right over me...I smoked a cigarrete and just watched it for a while...I felt myself conected to this light...I had been up all night the previous night and i was exausted but i could not sleep...Not while this lights in the sky...I felted tied to it for as long as i could see it . after about an hour of smoking cigarettes and wondering what this light was i decided to zoom back in on it { it seemed to be getting closer } what i saw when i filmed this object took my breath away...Well not really it made me gasp and say oh my god...In a good way...When i zoom in to about 20x optical zoom it appear as not a solid sphere of light but a broken sphere the top 1/3 of the object was not glowing it was solid...The bottom orb was glowing immensely ...When i zoomed in to 30x or even further to 60x what i saw was amazing the top solid part of the orb vanished..The orb was still cut off,missing its top...But there was no longer a visible solid object - it just dimmed out of focus...The more amazing thing is what was going on in the bottom glowing orb i could clearly see in my viewfinder a glowing core of light with red and blue lines of light swimming around it ...It was amazing looking into it i felt the most overwhelming feeling of serene calmness , connectedness , spiritualness , i believe the reason it appeared as 3 different objects at 3 different times was because its\r\nlights appearance changes deppending on the distance... i had observed 2 of this lights stages before just not in one instance...The latest stage when the object seemed its brightest and biggest was at about 3 - 4 am.\r\n\r\nhere is my exact log entry\r\n(i keep a journal to doccument these events)\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"may 25th,2009 aprox. 2am yellow orb observed and filmed .\r\n     on eastern horizon - noticed pulsating light on western horizon\r\n     same as previous ufos.Noted siris's speed relative to western ufo\"\r\n     {siris is a major star constilation}\r\n     \"aprox. 2 30am yellow orb began to pulse \r\n    similiar to the other ufos and for the first time\r\n    i filmed 20+ red and blue pulses and with intelligent pattern\r\n    there would be a blue and then a red pulse every 15-20secconds\r\n      this object is amazing to me may25th a day i will never forget\"\r\n      \"aprox 3-4am - the object now appears as the 2 toned upside down\r\n      saucer with an orb coming out the bottom side, the bottom orb has\r\n     a bright glowing core with red blue lights dancing around it.\r\n     filmed object in all 3 stages and or distances went from yellow orb\r\n    to pulsating orb to 2toned laser show like orb\"\r\n   also noted after rewatching my footage there is a moment right before i adjust my cameras view, immediatly after i had been thinking god i wish i could communicate {thaughts along those lines} well right after those thaughts right before i adjust my camera there is an unexplainable noise i did not hear it with my ears it is a quiet sound but my camera does not capture sound very well...It wouldnt hear anything i cant, it barely picks up my voice from 1 foot away this noise is earie and otherworldly to say the least im including a short clip of my footage...The same clip i posted on the internet ...There is only one point where my footage is edited i used my camera software to sharpen the image and turned contrast down to eliminate glare - now those settings would not create any kind of illusion i editted it in such a way because the lines of light are to fine to appear on a computer screen {thats what i think at least} \r\nyou will see in my footage this object is real and i edited it so that you could see what my eyes saw from the luxery of your own home...The noise is in this clip twords the end i suggest getting really close to your speakers or turning the volume up it is a faint noise...I hope dominique gets to read and see this i talked to him about it briefly on the phone plz assign this report to him or somthing =}...

the driver's seat with my mother beside him.\r\n\r\nmy step-dad noticed 4 large discs in the distance, heading our way.  they were yellow/orange in color and glowed as if lit from within.  the discs approached from our left front, continued almost directly overhead, and disappeared into the distance behind our right rear.  as they neared our loation, we all exited the car and watched them pass overhead.  they were moving slowly and skittered about erratically, though staying in a rough formation and moving along a straight route.  they made no sound.  they were headed toward the general direction of ft. wayne's airport, baer field.  everyone at the movie was standing outside their cars watching.\r\n\r\nwhen they were overhead, they appeared to be no more than 200 feet above us, and perhaps 100 feet in diameter, although it was impossible to really know one measurement without knowing the other.  they were about the size of a basketball held at arm's length.  they were symetrically shaped, thin at the circumference, tapering more thickly toward the middle, slightly rounded at the top and bottom points.  i could see a line along the circumference, as if the tops and bottoms had been two pieces joined together.  also, there were dark lines forming radii from the edges of the rounded bottom points and extending nearly to the outer edges.  between each radial pair of lines, there was a dark square, almost like port windows.  the dark lines and squares were indistinct, but clearly visible.  the next morning the journal gazette reported the speed and direction of the objects as they passed over the city as determined by call-ins to the night editor's desk during the sighting.","distance":"101-500

this was a process were the light slowly reduced in size over about 3-5 seconds. once the \"main\" light was out, i was able to track the object across the sky for a few more moments, but it was very

miles\r\ncloud cover: none\r\nsky: dark\r\nstars visible: yes\r\n\r\ni went out on the back deck of my home for a cigarette and i always spend some time looking straight up at the stars. after a minute or so and out the peripheral vision of my right eye, i noticed a fast moving star like object. object was very similar in size to the background stars (only slightly bigger) but moving in a straight line sw to ne. object was brighter than the stars of the big dipper, but not as bright as the brightest star in the sky at the time. altitude (i would guess) approximately 40-60,000 ft. +. object crossed approx 12 inches of sky (from my standing viewpoint at arms length)in about 10 seconds. i turned and took my eyes off the object as i thought about running in to get my video camera. i then realized that the object would be gone before i made it back, but by the time i looked back up the object had disappeared. no engine sounds were heard.\r\n\r\nthis was a fast mover. it wasn't a meteor or a shooting star as the object was much too slow for either. i was pretty perplexed by what i had seen. i tried a time / distance exercise on a high flying (30-35,000 ft) 747 the next day and that took approximately 50+ seconds to cross the same amount of sky. a 747 flies at approx 525-550 kts. i guesstimate that this would make the unknown object's speed somewhere around 2,700 kts.\r\n\r\ni have a commercial pilot's license and can pretty much name any aircraft - civil or military - under the sun. this didn't look like a known a/c to me (it was spherical / star). not wanting to speculate too much, but it quite possibly could have been a black project a/c (hypersonic). i have seen one \"doughnuts on a rope\" contrail before (again viewed at night from the same spot and headed in almost the same direction about 1 year ago). the residual contrail was only visible due to an extremely bright full moon - but i had heard of these over california before. the black project a/c theory my be part of the reason for my 5 day hesitation in posting. \r\n\r\nwhatever it was - it was fast and definitely unidentified.\r\n\r\nwould be interested to hear if there were any

 there it was just hovering above us.  an orange glowing sphere.  the time was 9:39pmest.  it was difficult to determine its altitude and relative size.  she thinks it was ���too high for a helicopter���, but i think it was only about 5000'-10,000���.  it was the size of a (small) dime.  of course you need to know the altitude to determine its actual size.  it did not have any other colored lights on it.  just an orange glowing \"sphere\".  i should caution in calling it a sphere as we were unable to determine if it was disc/egg shaped due to the glowing light.  sphere matches the best visual description.  the light did change in intensity but it was a very small fluctuation and could have been our eyes playing tricks on us.  my wife and i were going through a detailed q&a trying to discern what it was.  it was not moving, on any plane (x,y, or z). there were no conventional nav lights or beacons, there was no noise except for the highway, and my wife complaining to get us out of there because i woke my son up and they did not share the same enthusiasm and excitement.  i did not want to leave because i wanted to wait and see it move.  i wanted to see its propulsion.  was it conventional or something unexplainable by our current understanding of technology?  this would have filled in a great piece of the puzzle and possibly answered the question.  very frustrated, i decided to heed the wife���s advice and get off the shoulder because we were not in a safe place on the road with traffic whizzing by us.\r\n\r\nafter safely merging back on i-275, i immediately called my mother's house to tell them to run out front and look to the north a few miles and up (they are on the highest development around and would have a perfect view).  my stepfather answered my call and ran to the front to take a look.  he saw nothing.  we reached exit 59 within a minute (milford parkway) and looked to our right (north).  you could see a great amount of the horizon and we saw nothing.  we arrived home about 5 minutes later, then i made calls to friends and family and now i���m typing this report.\r\n\r\nthe credibility of the witnesses (my wife and i) are impeccable, as well as the intelligence and scientific backgrounds to make an unbiased observation.  we are also well known and respected in the community.  in addition i am an amateur astronomer and private pilot (not current) with exceptional knowledge of all active military aircraft in service (except of course current black projects).  if it warrants an investigation, you have all of my contact information and can google and contact me.  thank you.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":17281,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1082182,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-06012009-0001","longitude":-84.5066196,"occurred":1243831140000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1243831140000,"summary":"Wife and i pulled off i-275 (on shoulder) to watch orange glowing sphere hover for 2 minutes. please see detailed description.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cincinnati, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:226559"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2227}
