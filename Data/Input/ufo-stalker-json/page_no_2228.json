\"hey whats that?\" \r\nwe were in the great lawn on the louisville side of the event, perched in between the 2nd street bridge and the kennedy bridge. well my girlfriend looked over towards the kennedy bridge and then we seen it. it shaped like nothing else i have ever seen before. i wish i could draw it on here for you. ill try my best to describe what it looked like and what its flight characteristics were like. ok, imagine a big balloon, with several smaller balloons wrapped around it in a circular manner. kind like saturns rings. it was not of metallic nature, its color was more organic, just like the color of white human skin. when i first seen it, it was hovering over the kennedy bridge. it hovered for a few seconds, the entire time it was spinning, but not in a defined circular manner. imagine one of those tops you spin on a table. well you know when it slows down and starts to wobble, very unstable, or imagine if you threw a frisbee the wrong way and it wobbles. thats how it was spinning. we'll it was during an intermission time of the event and there were several airplanes flying over the entire area with these banners hanging off the back of the airplane, for the sponsors of the event, the horseshoe casino, kroger, blah blah blah. well this craft hovered up to one of these airplanes altitude and appeared to be checking this airplane out. by this time i was starting to get a little scared, wondering if this thing has bad intentions. i looked around to see if anyone else was witnessing what we were seeing and to my surprise no one else of out of the hundreds of thousands of people who were there saw this thing, its almost like it wanted us and let only us see it! anyways i have over 6 material witnesses that was with my party that seen it. ok so let me get back to the story. it was wobbling right around the airplane with the banners, it proceeded to lose altitude, fly under this airplane and then it took off into the general direction of jeffersonville indiana at an incredible speed. nothing dramatic like sharp turns, very organic in its flight pattern. very circular flight path. nothing angular, very organic in nature, it was not lit up with lights, it made no noise that i could hear. this was during broad daylight when we seen it. it was so real, i know it was and i dont deny what i saw that day and neither do anyone in my party that was with us. it was very emotional for me personally. i felt scared, privileged to see it, but scared none the less. i felt like this thing had channeled into our minds and it knew that we could see it and it didnt want to be seen by anyone else but us. i dont know what its intentions were but i dont think it had any plans other than to see the show, fireworks, airplanes. i have a theory that it was there to see some of earths technology at work, there were several highly advanced aircraft in attendance that day including the f22 raptor. there were supposed to be several skunk works craft flying in the airshow that day, including the b2 stealth bomber, the f117 nighthawk, but to our surprise none of those planes made an appearance that day like planned. i dont know why. we recorded part of this experience on our digital cameras, both in pictures and in video. this craft made our camera very fuzzy, and no defined pics could be had although we took several seconds of footage. i think it didnt want to be seen, it seemed to be very shy in nature. to my surprise no one has made any reports of this craft, and i think that we were the only people that seen it that night. i believe, and now my friends do as well.  once again it appeared to be very organic in appearance, very unstable in flight, almost seemed to defy physics in its flight pattern. these pics and video arent very good because i believe the craft had the ability to scramble the digital camera. all of the rest of the pics that day were crystal clear, but once we tried to tape and snap pics of this craft it scrambled and highly pixelated the camera.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with

going to school at the university in las cruces and went star gazing one night. the nights were still rather warm because the city is located so far south. as i was staring at the moon i noticed that in one section of the sky stars suddenly blacked out and as i focused my vision i witnessed the outline of what appeared to be a b-2 stealth bomber, only this aircraft was a bit more slender in the middle yet still retaining the boomerang shape.\r\n      i stared waiting to hear some sort of sound as aircraft make. i heard none. it was dark and i was trying to obtain some sort of judgement as to the altitude of the craft and try to establish a size. i concluded that it was too high to bee some sort of stunt kite or something (why anyone would be flying one at that time wouldn't make sense. it definately wasn't flyig at the height of a commercial airliner. i concluded it was simply somewhere in between. the object did not maneuver like any aircraft i have seen. it turned on its wingtip abruptly and dipped into figure eight like patterns very erradically. it did not move like a bomber though holloman airforce base has been known to harbor them. i have also concluded that if it were a bomber flying from one air base to another why did it linger for the duration (approx. 5 min.) that it did? after watching it for a while it picked up speed very abnormally and zoomed off to the east (towards holloman perhaps?). no noise, no lights, exceptional maneuverability...\r\n     i can't remember if it was a few days before or after the event, there was increased air activity. i noticed low level jets flying in fomation from the east and west. i concluded possibly a training exercise, a simple trip to and from bases in arizona and new mexico or perhaps they were alert to something more and on patrol. these are all simply ideas. all i had with me was my cell phone with a very weak camera and even if i had a camera the clarity of the recording would be extremely low-grade. i was alone and there were no other witnesses to back me up but that is what i observed. perhaps it was a new military craft that was being tested but why test an experimental craft over a civilian population? sounds hazardous to me.\r\n     if there were a craft that resembled a modern day stealth bomber but didn't quite fit the design profile and certainly didn't fly as a modern day aircraft, reverse engineering definately came to mind...These are just my thoughts and personal observations. i wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

about 79. i was finishing setup when my better-half stepped out and was saying something, then she said \"look...A light just came on near that plane.\" i looked and saw a commercial airliner had decended it's approach from the west and was some 30 miles out from nashville international airport at an altitude of maybe 2500-feet. the light that she refered to was almost suspended in mid-air as the plane continued past it. i then saw this light slowly accelerate into an arc until it was now flying directly behind the airliner at 1/4 mile...At nearly the same altitude, and following at a slightly slower speed.\r\n\r\ni quickly turned my scope on the plane to check the focus, which was dead on, and then back to the light which was following. i could clearly see that the object was grey/black, 20'-25'long est., maybe 1/3 airliner cabin depth, and had a bright duffused light underneath it. the light did not appear to be a projecting light, but an energy source light and very brilliant-white. another peculiar oddity is that the object appeared to have a clear jellatin-like shroud or watery cloud around it. it almost appeared to have an excitatory-static appearance as it flew thru the air.\r\n\r\ni have seen this light several times this month in the same area of sky at night, but never this early in the evening. there were only a couple of bright stars out with the moon, and there was enough sunset light for me to recognize the plane as an inbound delta flight.\r\n\r\nthis ojbect that i witnessed @ 35x at a distance of 1-1/4 miles was not an airplane. it was

i was the son of a military man, and quite interested myself in aircraft and the young space program, as with science in general.\r\n\r\nit was broad daylight. \r\n\r\ni was musing aimlessly in the southwest corner of our large front yard, near the road (a tar and gravel unmarked 2-lane affair with about four houses in our mile stretch of it). suddenly, something made me look up above the phone wires and poles.\r\n\r\nthere was a large box-like impossibly-heavy-looking grey object behind, with a significantly-slimmer fuselage sticking out towards the front coming up the road towards me, seeming to float above the road at a height just above the telephone wires; this fuselage had an almost-aircraft-normal looking canopy in the leading 'nose' of the vessel, with indistinct bodies visibly moving about inside.\r\n\r\ni had just learned the alphabet and numerals, and was sure that the characters on the fuselage must have been some sort of 'letters' and yet, though some of them seemed vaguely familiar, others were definitely not -- which confused me.\r\n\r\nas the vessel continued to move towards the west (into the prevailing wind) the rear box-like portion (which i immediately thought of as its motive force or engine) came abreast of me; it thrummed with a deep pulsating, yet nearly inaudible sound that was like nothing i'd ever experienced. again, the closest approximation i've ever come across, was the deep thrumming of a deisel train engine idling.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound of rotors or of thrusters, no dust kicked up. just a sort of stillness, barely penetrated by that pulsating thrumming sound.\r\n\r\ni did not move a muscle, and continued to watch until it disappeared behind the tree-line, when complete quiet once again took hold. the whole thing had taken less than two minutes. \r\n\r\nthe local authorities were quick to acknowledge this event, as evidently many reports of it came in; i was naturally quite interested to find out what it had all been about. the official statement was that it had been a \"weather balloon.\" i didn't yet know how hackneid that term was or was yet to become, but even a first grader knew that balloons didn't 'thrum' and, they don't float into the wind.\r\n\r\nthough i don't try to dwell on the experience, when i have thought about it at any time during the nearly fifty years since, it has caused me some nervous agitation. i've only mentioned this to perhaps five or six people, in all the time since, and i'm not real thrilled to bring it up now. yet mufon seems to be seriously seeking answers, and perhaps the time is right.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned Surface,  Insignia","flightPath":"Straight-line
