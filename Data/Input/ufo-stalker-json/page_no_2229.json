sparkling lights on the edges.   i didn't think initially that it was a ufo because i'm not the type to look for them.  i figured it was something affixed to the top of a far off building that was illuminated for the night, maybe for a party... but while looking and thinking i realized it was too large and too odd for that.  still, i didn't think it would move because it just was there for so long and not moving and not making any sound.  it was north of tarzana, where i was located.\r\n\r\nso, i bent down to get the baby monitor and my iphone so i could take a picture, and when i looked up it was gone.  i never saw it fly or move, just saw that the sky was once again clear.\r\n\r\nthis happened between 10 and 10:30 at night.  i told my mother and mother in law when i went in the house.  they were inside playing cards.  we went back outside to look but it didn't come back, the sky was dark.\r\n\r\nso, i'm not really sure what it was but all i can say is it was very large, bright and shaped like a triangle.  we watched the eleven o'clock news hoping to see some report on it but there was nothing.  it was too large and obvious not to be seen by many people so i'm wondering why i'm not reading of any other sitings?\r\n\r\ncoincidentally, the next night we found my little cat dead.  she had survived fine as an indoor outdoor cat for the last 15 years.  we are certain she was killed friday night, the 22nd.  the same time i saw the big triangle.  our little cat was decapitated.  her head cleanly sitting on the lawn.  there was no blood.  next to her, just a leg (partially eaten) just bone left and part of a foot.  again, no blood.  there was also her fur.  we are assuming an animal consumed most of her, we just found it odd that her head was so cleanly cut from her body... and because of that wondered if it was possible it was done by people.  but because so much of her body was missing we figured she was probably eaten.\r\n\r\nanyhow, summing it up as one weird night, but that's what happened","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":17248,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1494848,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05302009-0008","longitude":-118.5506158,"occurred":1243056000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1243056000000,"summary":"Big

this as fast as possible, so as to not forget anything. i was in middle of taking my dog out to relieve herself tonight after dark, and during a commercial break, and was standing outside of my front door. from where i live, we do see planes from an airport nearby. we have airplanes fly over often and i am very familiar with what they look like, sound like and how they act. unfortunately, the very fact of living anywhere near an airport may call credibility of what was witnessed into question. this experience defied any normal plane encounter and i do my best in this testimony to make the needed distinctions between what a normal plane would do compared to what actually happened tonight. most normal people could tell the difference between a plane if they���ve ever seen few and what happened tonight. it was one of the most bizarre things i have ever witnessed. we don���t typically say that with planes and there were no reports of any odd plane problems tonight on the news nor any technological leaps of planes hovering now. also most of us are very aware of the regular light patterns of planes and how they take off and land, and this was nothing like anything we see all the time. exact time of this event may be give or take 45 min, as i hadn���t looked at clock and the show was prerecorded. until tonight i could honestly say i've never actually seen a ufo. we're all accustomed to things flying overhead and lights in sky, but one usually hears it too. especially as low in the sky as these lights were. also, i don���t use drugs, and only drink occasionally but had nothing to drink tonight when this happened or at all in past several days, so given that my neighbors also saw it briefly right at the end, i can honestly say, i didn���t hallucinate this or make this up.\r\n\r\ni saw these lights in the sky which behaved in a very bizarre way from any planes or crafts we are accustomed to. they were also totally silent and 1 was there for the entire time and did not leave the spot in front of my door, which totaled about 3-4 minutes at least total and these lights were mostly in the same spot unless otherwise noted. i was outside and afraid to run back in and grab my camera because i knew it'd be gone when i got back so i have no pictures. i would've missed the best part too if i had. \r\n\r\nthere was this blinking light in the sky in a place i hadn���t seen any stationary blinking lights before, and was in the air path of take-off/landings for the airport, but not behaving in the customary way we���re used to seeing with planes moving in a straight line in 1 direction. this orb-like light was blinking kind of like when you see a planet appear to blink while the stars around it are stationary. its blinking was similar to that. but it was much too low in the sky, and way too large and near to be either planet or star, and neither move. and usually planes don���t do any of the following: as this single light was blinking, it was also hovering stationary and seemed to be busy doing something but it was dark and so i could not see what the light was doing. i don���t know if it was just a light orb or if it was affixed to a craft. it was changing colors as it blinked, and with each blink became a different color: white, pinkish-white, red, pinkish-yellow, blue, green and they all kind of blended into each other making a very pretty display of rainbow colors. i was perplexed. i don���t know anyone who has seen a plane or craft with color changing lights especially not in a rainbow array of colors. the blinking/flashing effect was very subtle (if compared to something like a strobe light which has a very strong effect) and just beautiful and felt slightly hypnotized by the display. the blinking and color changing was fast and constant, and at 1st i asked myself ���am i really seeing this?��� and blinked my eyes but it was still there. it was there the whole time from beginning to end and the 1st thing i noticed in this sequence of events which caught my attention. \r\n\r\nthen after about a minute of blinking and color changing i was even more startled when 3 lights that appeared to be a triangular-shaped craft come out of the blinking light! i was really wishing i���d had my camera for this because i love to do photography and videos and it figures the 1 time i get to see something ufo-like i didn���t have it with me. never in my life did i expect to see color-changing orbs in the sky seeming to give birth to another set of lights! this triangular-shaped set of 3 lights were all the same distance apart from each other and moved together like affixed to a craft, one amber steady (non-blinking) light at each point, however it was too dark to see what this craft looked liked. to me it was like seeing lights on an airplane at night, except airplanes don���t hover in 1 spot and rotate mid-air in that spot like this thing did.\r\n\r\nso after the triangular light thing came out of the blinking light i noticed it���s lights did not change color and were not blinking at all, and were a steady amber. it appeared to come out of the blinking light almost backwards from what i could tell, and hovered in the same spot facing the blinking orb-light like a child looking at its mother. it was the weirdest thing i���d ever seen. they seemed to move like they had a mind of their own or were conscious or something. i don���t know how else to describe it. \r\n\r\ni���ve heard of people thinking they���ve seen ufos and such, but having never seen one myself, i would need hard evidence to believe any story like this from someone. especially if it were this out of the ordinary, so this notion of being skeptical and even second guessing yourself if witnessing 1st hand, i can understand completely. but if the evidence was there, i am not above admitting that these things may be possible. after the 3 light triangular thingy was in the sky for minute facing it���s mama blinking orb (which was on the right of the 3 light triangular thing), it rotated in mid air turning from right to left and so was facing away from me as it turned. i was still at my front door and my dog was barking at something but i was too busy watching these lights to notice what she was barking at, because she barks at everything! the rotation was a full ��� turn to face my left but still in same spot next to the blinking light which was still blinking and changing colors exactly the same as it had been. \r\n\r\nafter the 3 light triangular thing was facing left and away from the blinking orb-light it left, but seemed to go much faster than the normal planes do and at closer range would have most definitely appeared totally hyper speed. it was gone in a few seconds but it didn���t just disappear in a flash, it gradually left my view toward the left and behind some trees obscuring my view. now the blinking light was still there just blinking away and changing color and was truly mesmerizing, but was it me or was this thing getting smaller and smaller and harder to see? yes it was. this was sooo weird! it was either moving further away or shrinking and now the color changing though i could tell it was still changing, was a bit harder to notice. \r\n\r\nabout then, my neighbors pulled up, a nice couple next door, and parked in their normal spot and began walking to their door. they would pass me on the sidewalk and while i was starring up and my dog was still throwing a fit, but now over the approaching neighbors, i was trying to figure out how to ask them if they too had seen, or could see the light so as to not appear weird like a total freak. i reigned my dog in on her leash, and briefly scolded her for barking at the nice neighbors, and reminded her that it was the ���share area,��� as she had been used to having her own yard and now had to share a courtyard with other pesky people and dogs. as the neighbors passed me i asked ���do you guys see that light up there?��� they looked up and saw it immediately as this was the only light now in the sky and even stars were not out and it was still quite a bit bigger than any stars. it was still there just blinking away. i said ���yeah, it���s been there for a couple minutes now and changing all sorts of pretty colors. i���ve never seen anything like it.��� the light appeared to be smaller now, and had already gotten much smaller by the time the neighbors looked up. ���hmm.��� they said and starred for approx 15-20 secs, maybe a bit less. ���cool.��� and after the brief exchange they went inside, and i was kind of amazed they didn���t seem to care more. but it was late, and i���m sure they were tired, and as we live by an airport they may have totally just thought it thought it was another plane at night that was especially pretty as i didn���t mention the words ���do you think this is a ufo?��� to them, and except for the fact it was blinking and only had 1 color changing light, and was totally silent. \r\n\r\nthen i realized it had indeed been totally silent this whole time and there was no normal ear-deafening jet noise, not even off in the distance. from where the light was it appeared to be fairly close to the flight path of planes as they take off or land, but a bit higher, but way too low, large and color-changing to be a star, planet, or other astronomical phenomenon. usually those planes in the take-off/landing path we can hear. also of note is that the direction the 3 light triangular thingy took off in was not consistent with the normal flight path we are used to. being much further to the left and though hard to describe, out towards another direction and went behind some trees eventually out of view. but the simple fact that it could hover was not consistent with any planes we know of! planes appear to move steady and the higher they are the slower they seem to go. so this 3 light thing would have been moving very fast for where it was in the sky. so now the blinking light was getting smaller it seemed with every several blinks. this is where it gets tricky to explain. if it were moving away it would have literally jumped a great distance, like teleporting, every time it blinked off, appearing again in another spot just a bit above and away from where it had previously been. as i began to ponder this i thought, it looks like about a centimeter to me if i held a ruler to the sky (and this is approx as i didn���t have a ruler and i would be cautious in my estimation bordering on just less than a cm rather than over a cm with each blink). but it didn���t move on every blink, just periodically every few seconds, and just continued blinking and changing color the whole time. those 2 things about it never stopped. finally after a couple more min (= about 4 minutes total but i could be a bit under and it may have been longer than 4 min) it was almost too small to detect at all, and i���m sure it was much further away, unless it was getting smaller in size. since it was dark i cannot be sure of which but our eyes and minds assume getting smaller equals further away. \r\n\r\nother than my neighbors briefly walking by, i noticed no other people who may have seen the whole thing as it was late so most were probably in bed. i hope someone else in town saw this too, as i can���t be the only nutty-sounding person tonight who saw this. i would like to remain anonymous, because i don���t want anyone to think i���m crazy for what i know i witnessed tonight. however, i wouldn���t mind if anyone at mufon had any questions about this event and they should know how to contact me. if anyone else in my area saw this, please speak up and report it, so i don���t look like a fool. normally i���d blow off something odd in my day, but this was just too odd to not do anything about, and if it can be helpful to anyone studying ufos or unknown things in the sky scientifically, then i offer my story for that purpose. i know i���m not nuts and even questioned myself as this was happening, like we as human are accustomed to doing in a bizarre event. but every time i blinked, it was still there and i know my neighbors saw a small piece of it toward the end, even though by then it was so small and easy to pass off as something coming from our local airport. \r\n\r\nthis was not a plane! i didn���t see any aliens or anything like that and i wasn���t abducted, it was just a random sighting that was a bit too close for comfort, and too real to pass of as nothing. i pride myself on trying to be an honest person, and have no investments one way or another, nor any reason to put myself out there to share this story. i am a very private person, and am not one trying to be famous or wanting my picture everywhere. i like my privacy, but i would be willing to answer any questions by the people who are investigating these things running this site. i didn���t get any pics and will make some sketches as soon as i���m done reporting this and will hang onto them, but i���m not uploading those sketches here as i don���t have the means to because like i said, i value my privacy and i���m no artist. i am much better with words than a sketch pad, so i hope this helps, and many blessings to those who spent countless hours investigating this stuff. everything is as accurate and detailed as i can be. i will continue to make notes and do some digging to see if anyone else in town saw this oddity. i don���t know if it was just some government craft we���ve never heard of but i sure as heck couldn���t identify what these lights were, and that makes them ���unidentified��� in my normal, sane mind. i debated reporting this, but my hope is that it is helpful to the study. my head is just spinning trying to process this whole thing, so i���m glad that���s all i witnessed, but i guess i have a story for my grandkids, because i don���t think i can tell most people about this or they���ll think its nuts. its nuts to me and i was there.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

first i thought it was a plane or something but i couldn`t hear anything when in the corner of my eye i saw the light stop in mid air behind all the trees but there were gaps in the tree so i watched it for a second when a big white light the same size of the normal object went up from it and stood there above it. i was so excited i was videoing it when i called my sister and dad out my my dad came out and the objects were gone but my dad came in and i was out there looking around where it happenened when i saw a light like a star dissapear and went to take a video but my camera died and

south from albany avenue in between ashley street and collins street \r\ni looked up into the night sky. i noticed a solid light \r\n from a close distance i immediately thought it was a helicopter. \r\nso i listen for the noise of the motor but the object made no noise. \r\n i tried to alert my friends of this strange object with no sound\r\nbut i could not because i felt in a trance or mesmerized by the sight.\r\nso i thought to myself it was heading in the south direction so\r\nit should pass over the collin-bennet building and the reflection of the light\r\nshould illuminate the building and the object because it was passing at a \r\nlow altitude so i stared. continuing to walk down the sidewalk my friends \r\nwas talking. i was so amazed with what i was seeing i did not hear a word they \r\nwere saying. with anticipation the object finally proceeded to pass over the building\r\nand truthfully what i saw next is indescribable but i will try my best. the light hit the building at a very close proximity and it looked very dim and controlled.                                  the light illuminated a very small portion of the building unlike nothing i have ever seen before. \r\ni believed the object was no more than 10 feet from the top of the building.\r\nso the light should have been more visible. the light from the object was only \r\nvisible within a diameter of no more than 5-10 feet. i never seen that in a beam of light.\r\nafter the object passed out of sight range i immediately turned to my \r\nfriends and said\" did you see that \"?. they looked at me with such confusion it still effects me to this day. its been seventeen years and i still think about that day. \r\ni cant get it out of my head so i decided to write you. \r\nthis date has an emotional connection because a week later my uncle eric anderson\r\ndied of cancer so that���s why i am sure that it was in april of 1992.\r\nno later than the last week of march 1992 for any skeptics. the object moved slow, steady, and balanced about 5 mph when it passed over the\r\nbuilding there was no type of vibration or movement. i also remember that night the news had reported a

witness was on his break outside in the parking lot while working when he had his sighting.  there was a loose group formation of seven orb-like objects coming from the southern sky and moving north.  the formation was not of any particular style.  (see attached sketch drawn by the witness.)  the objects traveled at a speed moderate enough to be seen and able to be identified as something that was not man-made, but they did travel at a fairly high-speed in comparison to conventional aircraft.  the formation was completely silent and left no vapor trail.  the objects did not waver or wobble while moving and stayed together in a straight line path during the entire time that the witness observed them.  the objects were very bright and shiny to give the appearance to the witness of a new headlight being caught in direct sunlight while turned off.  the objects maintained equal brightness and shape during the entire time that the witness observed them.  the witness stated that the color of the objects appeared to be similar to that of a bright white flare when lit.  the witness estimated that the objects were at between 6,000 and 10,000 feet in altitude.  the entire formation of the objects gave the appearance that they were about four to five times the size of an airliner at the same altitude.  there was an airliner present at the time of the sighting and was traveling from south to northeast.  the witness stated that the aircraft could have possibly seen or picked up the objects on radar.  also, the witness stated that the objects passed over the ocean naval air station as they went out of view from him and no doubt there might have been witnesses on base and possibly tracking of the objects by radar.

facing south in a parking lot out side my girl friends house . a storm had just , just passed over head the sky became clear and i could see the stars . this ocured in johnston rhode island right over the town , i was on mill street off of plainfeild pike a main road near the house ! i look up for a split second and bam ! there it is , it originated from with in the big dipper , i clearly looked at the big dipper wich is right over head in the sky at this time of year and at this time of night 930 10 pm . this realy bright craft illuminated as if it was coming directly down from with in the big dipper . it looked like a star at first but then it obviously got coser to earth , it entered the atmosphere actualy that is how bright this craft got . after diving in it slowly traveled south heading for providence the main city in ri . it was a brief encounter only a couple of minutes long , after it reached over head the city it gradually inclined back upward into space. i followed it the whole way, how could anyone miss this thing. the glow of the craft slowly faded as it returned into space and it dissapeared into the blackness of space. this isnt the only encounter that has ocured in my town and state i have witnessed countless craft in the sky some more amazing then others but still as exciting , you just have to take the time to look up !! \r\n\r\nmy belief is that the craft showed up a little bit to late , it missed the electrical storm that just passed over rhode island . it makes alot of sense lightning is an extreme power source , and that craft definatly needs an extreme fuel to travel across the galaxy or further . so i beileve he was going to stop in quick to catch a quick recharge in the lightning storm , but just missed the storm and headed back out to find fuel else where . \r\n\r\nplease contact me as soon as possible i have other sightings from the past i would love to discus with someone . i witnessed on 8/8/04 a craft that originated from almost the same location as this one . it entered earths atmosphere and hovered there for a good 5 minutes , then i witnessed somthing i will never forget for the rest of my life , this craft took off at the speed of light , it left a huge blue arch in the sky i followed the arch until it dissapeared into a pin prick . this craft type is very common around here most that i have seen have originated from the same location and most of them where white hot and circular in shape . what i dont understand is how do they pin point earth , or not even earth they can pin point citys and towns , what makes them travel so far to earth or rhode island for that mater . this sighting was a group sighting with my brother and 2 of his freinds so other people have seen them and do beileve you just have

not remember the exact date but in the second week of may 2009 a co-worker and myself were dumping trash in a dumpster out behind the building we work at.  the area is poorly lighted and is located near the city limits of stephenville.  the time was around 12:30am and the sky was overcast as we were heading back toward the building my co-worker pointed to the sky and exclaimed \"what the hell is that?\".  what i saw appeared to be a very large triangle shaped craft, kind of a mix between a boomerang and triangle shape.  if i had to be more exact, i would say it looked like a hang glider.  i only saw it for a couple of seconds, it appeared to be a gray color and seemed to have a dim glow to it with no external lighting visable.  it was traveling very fast and disappeared into the overcast.\r\n\r\nsecond sighting:\r\n\r\non may 28th 2009 at around 1am, the same co-worker and myself again were in the same area dumping trash.  the weather was clear, no wind and quiet.  i happen to look to the west and saw something dimly lit and coming towards our position, the track of the object was from west to east and i estimate it's altitude to be approxamatly one to two thousand feet.  as it passed, it had a dim gray glow and made no sound.  i could see what appeared to the the lights of the city reflecting off of it as it passed over them.  i estimate the size to be roughly the size of a boeing 737 commercial airliner.  after it passed our position, it appeared to bank sharply and that is when we saw the same triangle or hang glider shape we had seen three weeks earlier.  there were no external lights but was easy to see because of the dim glow it seemed to have.  i am a poor judge of speed, but it was moving very fast.  my co-worker estimated it was traveling at least 400 to 500 mph.  the one thing that stands out about the whole incident, is how there seemed to be electricity in the air, like static electricity, like your hair was standing on end.  it took several minutes to get over that feeling.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line
