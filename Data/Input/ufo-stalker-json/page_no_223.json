were very pensive and still. staring into the night sky. i stared to head back in and noticed what i thought was an unusually bright, never seen before constellation. it had been a totally cloudless day and the night sky wasn't really dark enough to see stars. i realised i was observing a planet. later identified as jupiter, and three similar sized star like stars moving in a triangle formation. really high up and far apart. the triangle was leading with the front two lights and the third \"point\" behind, which struck me as odd because (pardon the pun) it flew in the face of conventional aerodynamics. the front two lights reached a certain point in the sky and began to become transparent and eventually disappear totally, leaving the third \"point\" light playing catch up. when it arrived at the same point, it too became transparent and disappeared. i knew deep down that the object was still there flying through the night sky. i could almost sense it. i've waited all my life

report what my son and i saw....I'm in nashville, tennessee. the belle meade percy warner park to be specific... i'm 63 and take care of my dad stage 4 lung and brain cancer....Born and raised here.  retired from car business..... aprox 2 years ago ( need to check date ) my son in his early 30's and after eating at a nearby restaurant were riding together on hwy 100 going towards town.  we both watch ancient aliens and similar shows and frequently joke with each other about seeing a ufo. anything from plane lights to city lights, just a silly running joke between father and son. while driving and seeing lights from the field of a school shining thru the tree tops i said look ufo, ha ha....A couple of minutes later as we approached the intersection of old hickory blvd and hwy 100 ( percy warne park is no to my right) i saw lights and said look it's another ufo, but this time we both got a very clear look at a hovering triangle shaped craft with lights on all 3 corners and kinda looked florence on the sides...It slowly began to move angled where we could clearly see the bottom as it wen forward and myself still driving the park hills and trees, we lost it....Here is the thing on the other side of the hill is the steeplechase and harpeth hills golf course...It was not quite dark and a lot of rush hour traffic headed home.....My son grabbed his phone to take a picture but the flash went off and reflected into the glass so no picture. i was doing about 45 mph in the center lane and couldn't stop or pull over because of traffic.   i never heard a report or anything about it anywhere. i went into a ufo sightings website and reported what we saw hoping to fix no someone else that witnessed it....Didn't happen. he and i speak of it frequently just to keep the memory fresh.....We both believe we just didn't expect to see ....As to the size. very large. filled a chunk of the sky, could have been anywhere from 1/4 mile up to a mile away....Hard to say but my guess possibly several football fields in size.....Thanks watching the show and read about you figured you were the one if anybody would be interested....Oh yea this area is the nicest part of nashville, lot of traffic, not quite dark, clearly visible....Somebody else had to see this other than myself and my son....At last he was with me so i have a witness....Thanks for your time..","distance":"501

wife.. i am not certain on the month only it was cold. when i was 18 i just pulled into my driveway after coming home from work around 1 am. as i got out of car i heard a deep rumbling sound almost a hum. looked around then up and saw a huge round object slowly moving over a big willow tree in neighbor's yard. it was moving so slow my first thought was maybe a blimp for i lived fairly close to parks college which had a small airport for local planes. it was not. it slowly flew or hovered like directly over me only say 50 to 100 feet above. i actually walked exactly under this as it moved toward the west and route 3. seemed like i walked under this for over 20 minutes but there is only 3 yards of smaller size between my house and the highway. in detail i remember it seemed to have a strange outline. even though it was a sphere it seemed to have rectangular beams connecting all around it as much as i could see of it. like that was a structure holding it together. as it approached the highway there was a gas station, closed but an all night truck stop called royal treat. so as we ( object and i ) approached the back of the gas station it changed direction towards the north parallel along route 3  and got a bit higher.Then i stopped to see this all in an extreme short time make a swishing sound as it just speed away in a curving direction then gone in a blink. i ran back to my house and called lambert airport outside of st. louis and asked to speak to someone to report something in the sky. i was connected to a female. i remember asking if something was spotted on radar in my area about 10 minutes ago. she did not laugh but only said no. then i called my soon to be wife. her father answered but i did not tell him. told my fiance remembering i did not want to hang up or be alone that night. never told anyone else. but about 25 years ago we were watching tv when a special on ufo's came on and sure enough it showed this exact object during that time and place with a policeman reporting from the higher levy close to dupo illinois. several police from cahokia and dupo did see this and reported it. i wish i would had reported it to them but was afraid to for obvious reasons. i do not remember how there was a recording of this but it showed this object exactly doing as i explained in the exact location. my wife and i watched this. she said omg ben this is what you described to me a long time ago. she never said but i saw in her eyes that evening she finally did believe it. yes it was that object but we just let it go for we were both managers for major stores and did not need the talk of a small town. i have tried so hard to find the origin of that video but to no avail. i just found your site today by accident. i wish so much i had known of you way long ago. this is only making me shake with chills again not releasing this burden i have felt for so so long. i am now 62. but believe me i have wished for so long for this to happen again so i could hopefully have a witness with me. i have only seen a couple strange things since in the distance but not looking for it. i have told my wife if only i could be hypnotized to remember more detail or see it again mentally. i know in my heart this happened. i will not believe this was man made. if so governments sure are good at hiding technology. last thing..I really don't care about being anonymous on this for i am retired without a fear of damage to my credibility. it was so long ago i do not figure anyone cares now. if i was younger be certain my involvement would be great for i believe people have the right to know even if they are skeptics.
