backyard at 19:30 on may 27, 2009 when i noticed what looked like a black baloon at about 30 degrees in the northern sky.  i stood up and focused on the object and asked my daughter to run inside and get my binoculars. i wanted to confirm that the object was just a balloon. a few minutes later when i looked at the object thru the binoculars i could tell that this wasn't a balloon. the object appeared to have a body and wings, but not like any aircraft i've ever seen.  the edges of the object were fuzzy and appeared to be changing shape.  even when viewed through the binoculars, the object appeared small, and therefor, was very high up in the sky.\r\n\r\ni asked my wife to get my digital camera, a cannon 7.1 mega pixel power shot.  i handed the binoculars to my daughter and quickly framed the object and started snapping photos.  i used two settings, auto and landscape, and zoomed to the max 4x on the landscape setting.\r\n\r\nwhile i continued to snap pictures, my daughter kept an eye on the object through the binoculars.  she described what she was seeing as an object that was constantly changing shape and color.  the sun was low in the western sky, and the typical sunset / smog effect in the la area was causing the object to change colors from black to orange-red to silver.\r\n\r\nwithin a few minutes, three other object appeared in the same area of the sky. the objects appeared to be slowly rising higher and moving towards the north, away from us.  the wind on the ground was maybe 5 mph blowing towards the south.  there were a few cirrostratus clouds and the objects appeared to be at about the same height.  our best guess was that the objects were at 20,000 to 30,000 feet.\r\n\r\nour best guess was that the objects were about 15 miles to the north of us over the oak mountains, just to the east of rocketdyne which is located on the simi hills.\r\n\r\nthe objects appeared to be hovering in place for about twenty minutes with only minor movement.  based on the photos and the observations through the binoculars, we all thought the objects were rising and moving slowly to the north.\r\n\r\nat 19:50 the objects just disappeared from our view.  we continued to watch for another 15 minutes, but didn't see anything else.\r\n\r\non a normal evening, we see commercial aircraft approaching the burbank airport.  the commercial aircraft are usually flying at 3,000 feet as they pass our vantage point, moving west to east.\r\n\r\ni'm attaching three of the thirty photos i took to this report.  the first photo shows one dark object in the center of the frame and a commercial plane in the lower left.  the second shows three unidentified objects in the same frame.  the third shows two objects and a powerline in the foreground.\r\n\r\nwe are all certain that this was not a standard aircraft, neither private, military nor commercial.  this was not a balloon, star or planet.  there was no sound coming from the objects.  we had no sense that the objects were attached to each other or flying in a formation.\r\n\r\nbecause of the height, it is impossible to say how large the objects were, but our best guess would be that they were larger than any standard commercial aircraft.  their movement, or lack of movement, indicates again that this was not a standard aircraft.\r\n ","distance":"Over One

friends and were driving late one evening near the area of higginsville nova scotia. it was approximately 4am. there were four of us in the vehicle, i was in the passengers seat. the sky was very clear and crisp with no moon and i remember the start very bright.\r\nas we neared a friends house where we were dropping them off, the driver was straining to look up over the stearing wheel into the sky. i first noticed the object as it was reflecting a very bright blue-green color off the hood of the car. as the driver instantly slowed the vehicle i looked out the window and up and saw directly over our vehicle a very bright blue green rectangle moving very slowly over our vehicle.\r\ni would like to note at this point that the only way i can truly describe the color was that it had the same quality of something with a lot of electricity going through it, alternatingt in patches of blue green. i could also see that the blue green was only coming from the bottom surface of the object as i could make out against the blueish sky a jet black thickness above the object perhaps 10 feet high. like it was a flattened cube shape.\r\nwe stopped the vehicle and all jumped out of the car shocked. \r\ni can only estimate the size of the object. it appeared to pass over our vehicle at a height of only 100 feet or so and gave off a slight, almost inaudible, humming sound. i approximate the length at about 100-150 feet and the width approx 75-100 feet.\r\nthe object continued to \"drift\" slowly in a straight direction north and settled only about 1000 feet away from us before it came to a stop.\r\nthe object stayed exactly in that position for what seemed to be a long time but actually only approx 10 minutes.\r\nduring this time the object sat silently 100 feet or so above a farmhouse.\r\nwithout warning, the blue-green bottom surface started to get brighter and then with a flash like a firework (i remember thinking) the object made a 2 point zigzag and moved at impossible speed over the horizon and dissappeared.\r\nthey were definately observing us for sure! something we all felt/knew.\r\n\r\ni would like to note at this point a very odd coincidence. my older brother had a very similar sighting when he was quite young. his was a broad daylight sighting of a rectangular object over our family home. apparently i was there also but did not see it and do not have any recollection of this. i didnt really believe him for many years and wasnt really interested in the subject.\r\nalso, with no prior knowledge of this or my sighting, one of my friends confided with me years later that he and his girlfriend at the time had a nearly identicle sighting of a rectangular object in the same approximate area as mine and my brothers sighting.\r\nsince this sighting i have been actively researching any/all sightings that i can. for some time after my sighting my brin had a lot of difficulty processing what i had seen. if it wasnt for the three other individuals who all saw this object and the fact that it was so close i might have thought i was seeing things. but i know what i saw.\r\ni has taken me some time get the nerve up to report this, but its as clear in my mind as if it happened yesterday.\r\ni am an artist and have attached a rough digital sketch of the object.","distance":"21-100

orange cigar shaped object rapidly traveled across the sky from west to east.  the object was moving at an incredible speed- faster than anything i have ever seen, including satellites in orbit.  the object was a perfectly shaped ellipse with sharp well defined edges.  there was no contrail, nor any other visible disturbance in the sky.  there was no sound i could detect.  it was a very calm and quiet summer evening.  the object passed from horizon to horizon in about 5 seconds.  i neither saw nor heard any other aircraft before or after the event.  i had the impression the object was very large and traveling at a very high altitude- 15,000 to 20,000 feet or more.  i am an aircraft buff and routinely observe aircraft whenever they are overhead.  there is no possibility that this object was any conventional craft, at least one i am familiar with.  after the object passed from view i continued to watch the sky and wrap my brain around what i had just witnessed.  i finished watering the garden and went inside to tell every one what i had seen.  i said i had seen a ufo and the family thought that was neat.  the kids went outside hoping to see something too.  we did not witness any

strange lights. now, working in aviation the last 8 years (i am not a pilot, but i have flown alot), i knew it didn't look like an aircraft, for some reason i thought it was a cell tower light. but then it hit me, there is only one light at the very top of those cell towers where i live. i have lived there my whole life. these lights were 2 very bright red blinking lights with a blueish faint light in the middle that just stayed on and didn't blink. at first, the 2 red lights were vertical of each other, then they kind moved aprt slightly horizontily. at this point, i knew i was seeing something very strange. thats when it hit me, this thing was right over genoa, like it was hovering, and i noticed the red strobe light on top of the water tower in genoa at the park. at this point, i was about 2 miles out from town still in the country. what i noticed, was that these lights were in between the water tower light and sr163. well, rushed into town and home and parked my truck. mind you, once in town you don't have a good view of anything in the sky do to the trees in town. so i rushed up on the roof to see if i could get a better look at this whatever it was. i got all the way up to the peak of the second story (very steep and painfull i might add)and i could see the lights which looked like they were just over the top of the north side of town. now, the red lights were now vertical again, and blinking very slowly and very brightly. the blueish whit light now turned into 2 lights of the same color very faint and very close together, with the trailing one being slightly lower than than the lead one. this is where things really got strange for me, the lights were moving at a snails pace, i was on that roof for 2 minutes, here's another kicker, no noise, none whatsoever, no prop noise, no jet noise no chopper noise, nothing, dead silence. i then imediatly jumped off the roof while it looked like it was still due north of me and jumped in my truck with my brother (he came out do to the noise of someone running around on the roof) and immediatly headed west out of town. i only live 4 blocks from the western edge of town, and one block north of sr163, it only took me 30 seconds to get back out in the open country fields. by the time i got out there, these lights were already miles away, but still very bright. maybe you guys can come up with an explanation.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

but later on, it became clear that i had not been.  \r\nit started out that my husband and i were sitting on our bed, noticing this light flashing on and off.  during the \"dream\", we were trying not to notice it, but it was so bright, it was like all of the lights in the house had been turned on, and it was noon outside, even though it was actually well after sunset.  suddenly that scence disappeared, and i was laying on my right side, and my eyes were open, but i couldn't see anything except pure blackness and these 3 white lights that looked like stars, that were in the shape of an inverted triangle.  normally at night i can see a little bit in my bedroom, since our next door neighbor has a bug light.  i was not feeling frightened, just confused, until something moved in front of my face, and i couldn't see the lights anymore.  then i would start to hyperventilate because i was so afraid.  of what, i don't know, just being engulfed in blackness, with something i couldn't see.  this happened 3 or 4 more times, where i could see the lights, and then i couldn't.  by the last time, i think i might have passed out with fear.  \r\nthen i wake up, but not feeling like i was in a normal state of mind.  this time i could see around my bedroom.  i looked to my right, and i could see 2 people standing right next to my bed, who were definitely different from me.  they looked like lizard people.  immediately my first thought was that i was dreaming, so i wasn't at all frightened.  i decided to try to reach my arm up to the lamp next to the bed, and turn the light on, so i could wake up and then it would all go away.  i did raise my arm about half way to the light, and then my arm just went back down, without my control.  i was very confused by this, and not sure what to think.  they were looking very intently at me.  i got a very good look at them too.  they had these thin green masks on, that looked like they were made of green leather, that covered their noses and mouths.  they had 2 raised ridges on each side of the top of their heads.  their eyes were about the same size as ours, except they protruded farther out from their face than ours do.  their pupils were shaped like a cat's pupil. it was a gold color, the iris was black, and the rest of the eye beyond the iris was gold.  they had dark green, somewhat shiny skin, but kind of roughish in a way too, hard to describe.  there was a black emblem or ensignia of some kind on the right side of the chest on their clothing.  it was also a dark green color, tight fitting, looked like some kind of spandex material or something.  the one standing on the left, reached his right arm toward me and slid his index finger down the top of my left forearm.  i could feel this sensation physically.  his nail was like a short, pointed thick claw, of a grayish color.  after that, i blacked out, woke up hours later, and could smell a burning sulfur odor for about 15 seconds, and then it was gone.  i got up, just assuming it was a very strange dream, but then a few days later, the children mentioned seeing \"green ghosts\" in our room at night, touching our heads.  i hadn't mentioned the dream to anyone.  it was at that point that i started to question what might really be happening.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":17189,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.81881,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05272009-0009","longitude":-73.15011,"occurred":796302000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":796302000000,"summary":"Bright,

(later he said it sounded like kids giggling but very sinister) i said no (i didn't hear that part)and stood waiting for the baby to say something.  still no sound so i went another 50 yards to another creek all the while scanning the area with the rechargable spot light. i turned off the light to see if the baby would call out again but heard nothing.  still no sound so i turned the light on again which then rapidly faded out and was useless with no warning.  i could just make out the house lights through the trees but otherwise it was completely pitch black around me.  i gave up the search and was just starting to head back when i hear what sounded like a human pretending to whine like a puppy just inches from my right foot.  i could hear it rustle the leaves so i called out \"come here boy, it's alright\" but then it occurred to me that it did not sound like a real dog so i hurried to exit as quick as i could fighting through bushes and small trees dense enough to warrant breaking and plowing and i could hear the sound of the rustling leaves right behind me.  the two whines occurred again and this time it sounded like it was giggling as it made the sound.  right on my heels and keeping up with my speed.  i finally got back to the muddy creek bank and slid down it on my butt to the bottom (15 feet) and the whining sound happened again right from the edge i just slid down .  doug said, \"i sounds like it's right behind you \".  i ran through the creek this time looking for the best slope to get me out the gully.  i took the lowest part (about 8 feet) and scrambled and clawed my way up the muddy bank and as i neared the top something flew right by my right ear making a strange whirling/giggling sound.  doug saw me come out of the gully and had full view of me while this happened.  he heard it but could see nothing. \r\nwe both went up to the house, i breathing like i'd run a marathon.  the unmistakable feeling that this thing was \"harassing\" me was felt strongly by both of us.  it had chased me out of the woods and now on retrospect have to wonder if this wasn't a trap, make a sound like a baby deer, lure  the person into the woods and .....\r\nit had 3 distinct and different vocalizations.  though it rustled the leaves was apparently invisible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\ni've spent most of my adult life studying all aspects of scientific inquiry and my gut feeling was that was not normal.  doug is a well known wildlife veterinarian who could offer no reasonable explanation. it wasn't an animal.

i then noticed that these objects were not flying like a regular aircraft -they seemed to be gliding with the 1 object leading and the other following close behind by  maybe a few hundred feet. then i thought maybe it was the space shuttle. it almost reminded me of that when we were able to see that a couple years ago from the ground. then i thought that theses objects were way to low to the ground to be the space shuttle. thats when i got alittle shaky in the knees and stood up.\r\n\r\nwhen i stood up these 2 objects slowed down and stopped briefly over the lake . the 1st object flashed a white light to the other and they continued to glide on. as this happened. i saw a light just above me. i was the same type of object as over the lake but it was following over the trees on the bank of the lake. again, no noise.  this object was following in line is what it looked like with the two objects on the lake.\r\n\r\nso now there were 3 identical objects i was following.  i made my way to the pier and went out and watched the objects. the two were still following eachother with the other object off the the side in tandem flying over the tree line. then i observed the two objects following  eachother stop as they got over the other side of the lake and stop dead. then the 1st lead object started going down. as it went down it turned into a single ball of orange light. then the second object that was following the first did the same. they became smaller and smaller in the sky to 2 points of faint orange pinpoints of light . i lost sight of the other 3rd object and can only say i saw it go in that direction over the tree line also. \r\n\r\ni keep watching as the pinpoints just stayed in the sky. i then kept looking around. i then saw a small ball of orange light come out of the sky over the farmers field from where the original two objects came from. this object was very tiny like a porch light. it did not have any other colors of light, strobes or anything. no noise and low. it just buzzed over the lake and went to meet the other 2 pinpoints of orange light.

phoenix, arizona.\r\nat approximately 7:30pm, i left a retail store, as i was walking to my car, i casually looked up to the sky to a location that was northwest of my vehicle.\r\n(to possibly make this explanation easier, phoenix metro area is geographically arranged using a grid pattern., where all measurements and streets are laid out using north, south, east and west  as points of reference.)\r\nthe object i observe was again, northwest of my original position.\r\nit first came to my attention because of it���s brightness. it was right at dusk and the sky was clear where i first observed it. there were small patches clouds  northeast of  the objects location..\r\nthis patch of clouds represented the leading edge of an emerging thunderstorm that was traveling, as a whole, in a southwesterly direction.\r\nthis made the object very easy to track because it was especially bright and it had a very definite diamond shape.\r\nthe storm cell was absolutely black in comparison to the area immediately behind the object.\r\ni need to say that there is extensive aircraft traffic under the command of three faa controlled airspaces in this area, comprised of phoenix sky harbor international airport, scottsdale airport and deer valley airport, as well as, luke air force base, almost directly to the west\r\ni���ve lived in metropolitan areas most of my life. \r\nin phoenix for nine years.\r\ni���m very familiar with seeing all types of aircraft by sight,by sight,by movement, by location and by movement of safety equipment used by each, \r\n(such as takeoff and landing lights and safety strobes)\r\ni did notice about three to five other groups of lights, but i quickly discounted them as conventional aircraft.\r\nthis object displayed none of those characteristics.\r\nit did not move during the approx. twenty minutes of my observation.\r\nit was a very bright single light, diamond shaped in it���s configuration. \r\nthe light did not pulse, it did not vary in it���s brightness, it did not move, i could not hear any type of mechanical or electronic noises.\r\ni had my cell phone with me that does have a camera feature. unfortunately, i could not capture an image, because it���s low pixel capability.\r\ni drove further north to see if i could get in a better position to attempt to capture a digital image.\r\nduring this time i thought several times that i had lost observation of the object.\r\nbut i quickly realized that it was starting to be covered up by the thunderstorm that was continuing to move in a southwesterly direction. \r\nthe clouds were actually passing in front of the diamond shaped object .\r\nthe object itself continued to remain stationary in it���s originally observed location. \r\nat one point, i pulled into a restaurant parking lot to make a final attempt at capturing an image with my cell phone.\r\nthere were three employees of the restaurant taking a��� smoke break.���\r\ni walked over to them and asked if they could see the object i was tracking.\r\ni pointed to it���s position in the sky and asked if they could see it.\r\nall three immediately said that they could see the object and describe it���s shape, but could not offer an opinion as to what the object was.\r\ni continued north and the object remained northwest and static in it���s position.\r\nstill wanting to capture some kind image, i pulled into another shopping plaza.\r\ni went into a walgreen���s drug store at the southeast corner of e. tatum & e. thunderbird in scottsdale and asked for a one use digital camera. they were $20 for one with a good pixel density.\r\ni wanted to warrant the expense so i went back outside to see if i could still see it.\r\nunfortunately, in the interim, it had been completely covered by the storm cell that was continuing to the southwest.\r\nthis was approximately 7:50pm\r\ni also noticed that the storm had started to show lightning flashes, as it intensified in strength.\r\nafter giving up the search, i continued traveling north towards my home and the storm started to sprinkle rain, strong enough to have to turn on my car rain wipers to the lowest intermittent setting for about 10 minutes..\r\ni am sorry that i can only offer this as anecdotal evidence without an image to verify this sighting.\r\ni do however state that this was a real event that was seen by me on the date and time i have indicated in this report.","distance":"Over One
