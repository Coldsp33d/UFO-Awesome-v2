being the skeptic i am ( and always identifying his \"ufos\" to just be airplanes, stars, or satellites) completely ignored him for about twenty minutes. \r\n finally (and only to appease him)i went outside i looked at what he was talking about. i saw what at first looked like a plane, but the lights were flashing to quickly. and i couldn't see the distinct red light flashing. then i realized it was way to low to be a plane. the object began moving vertically and back and forth.\r\n i watched the yellow and white lights for about a long time before i realized i needed a picture of this- it was just too weird the flashing and way it was moving. i took about three or four and review them, and i thought them to be garbage. \r\n we discussed all the possibles of what we just could have seen in the sky. there was no conclusion. the next morning we told my parents, and they seemed to get a kick out of it, so we didn't say anything to anyone else.\r\n\r\nthe real story here is when i came home to nc, and was looking back over the other pictures i started deleting the ones of the lights on the horizon and i saw one and thought, maybe if i zoom times 8x i'll see, just something... and

morning, and i couldn't sleep.. went outside to have a smoke.. just sitting there staring up at the sky, not totally paying attention and then a very dim twinkling star caught my attention, and it was wavey-looking as if i was witnessing it through a hot-air distortion, but then i discovered it was moving (or began to move), and then it got crisp and clear.. i thought at that point, ok, it's must be a satellite.. but it had another light following along very closely, and i thought i saw a shadow of under belly of a craft or something geometrical (if i had to pick i'd say triangular-ish looking shape).. and the second diagonally trailing light was dimmer slightly.. and more orange-ish in color.. i would have guessed this was very high up.. it was tiny looking.. i would never had seen it if i had not been gazing out at that exact spot where i first found it. the first light didn't have much color, but it wasn't stark white either.. just very dim.. and then i thought, ok, that's a big satellite probably. and in the process of watching it, it did a graceful but nice 25 degree arc to the west. then i sat straight up, practically fell out of my chair.. got up..  and lost sight of it. it was so dim folks.. it was originally cruising south-south west..  now it would be south-west and westerly in direction..  hope that helps anyone who might have seen something like this around these parts lately..  it was exciting to see that, and i have been watching the skies around here for a quite a while and haven't seen anything remotely like that.. it was the turn it made.. completely unpredictable..  birds don't catch reflections like that at night..  we do have fruit bats, but i know what those look like.. this was slow, not quick, and there was no noise.  i would say it was half the speed (or less) of anything else i have seen cruise around in the sky day or night.. almost a nice fluid like motion to it. i haven't seen anything like it before, that's for sure. looked controlled, and no winds tonight.. great viability.. lots of stars..  had a nice meteor sighting last night as well, was going to report it, but someone else did.. the meteor last night was located in

Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First, an observation made by my brother and his wife, six months ago. around midnight, above the hill behind their house. seven orange lights in a rough circle, presumed to be chinese fire lanterns. that is until, all converged to a central point. then went straight up and disappeared.\r\nnow my sighting on 10:15pm 23/5/09. weather: cloudless sky, numerous stars visible. no wind whatever detectable at ground level. confirmed by the bbc cfax forecast, as 2 mph sse. a possibility of frost overnight due to the stillness and cloudlessness. with the wind at 9:00am 24/5/09, anticipated to be nne at 4 mph.\r\nwent outside to place rubbish in the bin. turned, to see what i can best describe as a very bright but tremulous, ragged sheriff���s star of orange light. with the hint of a smaller red light somewhere within it. bearing 225 degrees at 50 degrees elevation. this light moved at a rapid and steady speed in a very slight arc toward a bearing of 65 degrees. while maintaining the existing angle of elevation relative to me. as it passed, at it���s nearest point to my position, the orange light faded (as i would expect the main white landing headlights on an aircraft to do).\r\nwhile i stood there, a second light repeated the display. and within a few moments of that disappearing, a third light did the same. i obtained the interactive tv weather reports mentioned above. still curious, i returned outside at about 10:30pm, to see a pair of these lights pass over while perfectly maintaining a set separation line astern formation. i would assume that all these items were chinese fire lanterns/some type of aircraft, except for the following. if launched at the nearest non-visible point to me, at an absolute minimum, they would have had to travel a quarter of a mile (measured at ground level), in thirty seconds. that equates to a speed of 30 mph or more (depending on actual height). yet there was absolutely no evidence of any wind. their passing was silent, monitored in a period of perfect silence, with hands cupped behind the ears. although, interspersed with these two sets of events i did experience the standard illumination pattern of a couple of aircraft, passing in an almost opposite direction at a similar apparent speed. these were airliners cleared off the bovingdon stack into heathrow. on route to woodley vor, before turning left onto heathrow ils runway 09. these exhibited the usual distinctive distant rumbling roar, which lags behind them. if chinese fire lanterns, i would not have expected these other items to all fade in exactly the same spot, directly in front of me. but rather some to fade as they approached, with others fading some moments after they had passed. if launched close at hand, wouldn���t they have burnt for more that thirty seconds to a minute? in addition, and strangest of all. with the last two, and because i was staring more intently with hand-shielded eyes. i could still follow their trajectory after the orange light was obscured. they were visible as two feint pale blue/white star-like dots. apparently continuing at the same speed, height, and direction. if this was a reflection off some metal surface, it was not caused by the street lighting hereabouts. as this is orange sodium, and not white son.  furthermore, on going to the rear of the house, i saw what appeared to be one of these same dim ���star-lights��� travelling from se to nnw at 80 degrees elevation on a meandering path.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":17161,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.632781,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-05262009-0008","longitude":-0.739529,"occurred":1243142100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1243142100000,"summary":"Six

there was a \"star\" that was twinkling.  i remarked that i thought that was odd, because none of the other visible stare were twinkling.\r\n\r\ni told my friends i would take a look with my

object was slowly drifting to the horizon.\r\n\r\nmy telescope is a questar 3.5 and i used a 16mm occular which provided 81 power magnification and about  a 1 arc second resolution.  i found the

up at the stars.  the night was quite cool and crisp, but the sky was very clear with many stars.  as we were looking up, we noticed a fairly bright object making its way across the sky in an arc-type path.\r\n\r\nthe object moved steadily and consistently in a soft arc from the northwestern part of the sky to the southeastern part of the sky.  it did not move exceptionally fast, but moved at a quicker pace than that of most planes we see.  we assumed it was a plane, but continued to watch it as we could not see any blinking lights and it was extremely bright for the planes we normally see.  i did not take my eyes off of the object because i was sure i would see blinking lights at any moment.  as we both watched it move across the sky, the object appeared to get brighter and brighter - almost growing in size.  the light that was coming from the object was similar to the very bright white light you see coming from the solor-powered lights that people often put around their gardens.  i kept watching the object and convinced myself that i would see blinking lights at any moment, but there were none.  as we watched the object, it continued to get brighter and brighter and then suddenly, it dimmed and completely disappeared.  i double-checked to see if it could have suddenly gone behind some clouds, but there were absolutely no clouds in the sky.  there were stars all around the area where it disappeared, so we know that there were no clouds present.\r\n\r\nwhen i realized that i had seen something that we could not explain, i was excited, yet my mind still tried to rationalize and create some logical explanation for what the object was.  i knew the object was unusual when it went from emitting extremely bright light to dimming and disappearing in a matter of approximately 4-5 seconds.  i would be very curious to know if others have seen something similar.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":17152,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.1787428,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05252009-0026","longitude":-78.6857698,"occurred":1243314600000,"potentialRelations":[17150],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
