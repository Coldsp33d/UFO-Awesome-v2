usually leave for work every night. i work third shift as a police officer and as i do every night while walking to my garage, in uniform, i looked up at the sky to check the weather and gaze at the stars and constellations. it was a clear night and i did not observe any clouds in the sky. it had been a cooler day and i estimate that the temperature was around 55 degrees at the time of this incident. i opened my garage door and stood in my driveway facing westbound. as i looked up in the night sky, almost directly above me, i observed a very bright white spot. it appeared to be about the size of the biggest star that was in the sky, possibly slightly larger. it also appeared to be as bright as one of the brighter stars, say for instance the north star. the object was traveling southbound, very smoothly, not losing or gaining altitude, and not traveling very fast. when i first observed it, like i always do with any object in the night sky, i tried to identify it in my mind. i thought to myself it seems to be moving at the speed of a typical passenger jet, but there were no blinking colored lights and it was far too bright. then i thought, maybe the jet is coming right towards me and the spotlights in front of it are hitting my line of sight just right. but that didn���t seem to make sense as the object was moving southbound, causing me to begin to turn my head to the left to keep it centered in my line of sight. it was far too large to be a satellite and moved too fast. i then thought, maybe our (nasa) space shuttle, but no, that had landed a day before. so here i stood looking at this object, thinking to myself, is this really what i think it might be.., an actual unidentified flying object. i would estimate that i was watching this object for 20 to 30 seconds at most, and then the part i just can���t explain happened. within 2 seconds it dimmed from a bright star like object to absolutely nothing, gone, vanished, while it was still in motion. it almost appeared like someone took a dimmer switch on a light and very steadily, but quickly turned it off. i stood there for a few seconds thinking did that really just happen? so i snap out of it.., wipe the grin off my face, and think, oh it probably just went behind a cloud. no, no clouds in sight, in fact it disappeared very close to a few stars. to convince myself even further i took my high powered flashlight off my duty belt and shined it up into the night sky. no clouds to be seen. so there i stood in my driveway, running late to work as usual, just witnessing this. i felt amazed. if i had the time i would have stood there for a while to see if it would reappear in another location in the night sky, but duty called. \r\n     while driving to work all i could think about was how i had never seen anything like this before. being close to 30 years old i���ve been looking at the night sky for quite some time. never have i seen something disappear in the manner that this object did. did this object suddenly shoot out into outer space and disappear from my vision? i don���t know. \r\n     thank you for listening to my story and i urge anyone in the area of my sighting to come forward if you have experienced something similar to what i saw. i would really like to hear from others who may have seen this and submit possible additional information.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:25","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

low flying lights caught my eye. i first noticed that the lights were flying very low, and then that they were going way to slow to be an airplane. ���there was a blue, red, and white strobing light and they appeared to have just flown over buffalo. the lights were large and inline with each other, with quite a bit of distance in between all three. the middle light was white and strobed very slowly, and the red/blue lights were on the ends. the lights turned and were coming directly towards me at a diagnal angle.��� the white light was covered with a round, concave, clear, glass-type covering which appeared to be very thick glass, and had some type of circular design on it. the red and blue lights were different than the center light. they were tall and cylinder shaped, more like beacons, and they appeared to be sitting on top of something. they appeared to be covered by a different type of material, it looked more like some type of colored plastic, but transparent enough that the lights underneath could shine through.��� i never saw a shape or even any type of structure behind the lights. within 10-15 seconds the lights had reached the dirt road in front of me, and where crossing over the top of the power lines. it became apparent that the lights were slowing down as they got closer, and were now nearly at a complete stop.��� i turned and ran from the corral to my pickup and jumped inside, which took about 15 seconds, because i was wearing flip flops. once in the pick up i was now facing north, and the lights had moved just behind the corral and had turned south, facing me again. the lights were sitting completely still, hovering, absolutely no movement, other than the strobing white light. the distance between me and the lights at this point was probably around 150'.��� i felt it was a single craft, and judging by the distance of the lights from end to end, would have been anywhere from 25' to 50', i cannot judge distance very well, plus i was busy running to my vehicle.��� i lean more toward��� 40-50'. for about another 5 seconds i fumbled trying to find my cellphone, and staring at the lights in disbelief. this was the most terrifying moment i have experienced, i threw the pick up in reverse, then drove forward, and when i got to the gate leading out of the pasture, i stopped looked over my shoulder, the lights were still sitting in the same place, not moving. i couldn't go towards town without passing close by the lights, so i turned south and laid the pedal down. about a 1/4 mile down the road, i turned and looked over my shoulder, and the lights were no where there, or anywhere in sight. since the incident i have driven behind the corral and a large portion of the grass is laid down, which maybe due to wind current, i took some picturess of that area. i have been fascinated by the ufo phenomenon since the massive sightings in tx/pa in 2008, and thought if i ever saw one, that i would be brave and take pictures and size it up.��� i was so scared and i had an innate feeling that if i didn't leave fast, something bad was going to happen. this is a very small town and i do not want any notoriety,��� if you wish to do an investigation or speak to anybody from this area about this incident, please contact me first. thank you.

the tree line. i would say it was visible for a good 10 seconds.  one person was able to see it split into two parts. we also noticed helicopters flying towards it and heard lots of unusual air traffic about 20 min. after it happened (so much so it prompted a drive out in that direction which yielded no further information)we thought it might have been a plane wreck.  i came home tonight and watched the local news and was interested to see a report of a ufo last night in the same general area (this one was 3 white lights in a triangle shape, covered by channel 12 news and shot with a cell

parte de atr���s de mi casa, en compa������a de mi hijo y de su novia, miro hacia el cielo y veo una luz brillante y m���s grande que cualquier estrella, que se desplazaba en direcci���n noreste a una velocidad promedio.  de inmediato le aviso a mi hijo y su novia y nos sorprendi��� el tama���o del mismo y lo redondo que era lo cual nos hizo pensar que no era un avi���n.  cuando miro hacia la izquierda y en la misma trayectoria que el primero viene un segundo objeto exactamente igual que el primero. en ese momento le digo a mi hijo que les tome una foto. en lo que prepar��� la c���mara, el primer objeto fue bajando su intensidad de la luz hasta desaparecer, pero tuvimos la suerte de fotografiar el segundo objeto antes que desapareciera de igual forma que el primero.  la noche estaba completamente despejada por lo que no era posible que desaparecieran detr���s de alguna nubosidad.  le indico entonces a mi hijo que le tome una foto a una estrella que estaba cerca con el prop���sito de tener una referencia para comparar las im���genes.  todo el evento tuvo una duraci���n de no m���s de 30 segundos y la distancia entre los dos objetos desde el punto de vista de nosotros era de aproximadamente dos pies.  no s��� cuantas millas sean entre ellos en el aire.  \r\nle envi��� las fotos a mi hermana que trabaja con programas de computadora ya que es artista gr���fico, para que las ampliara y ver si pod���amos determinar que hab���a sido lo que vimos y la sorpresa fue grande.  el objeto no era blanco sino verde, redondo casi perfecto y dentro tiene algo que parece como un trompo gigante.  pero mayor fue nuestra sorpresa cuando en la foto de la estrella, cuando ya los objetos hab���an aparentemente desaparecido, hab���a un tercer objeto el cual nunca nos percatamos que estaba all���, pues no se ve���a a simple vista.\r\nyo tengo las fotos y me gustar���a que pudieran analizarlas porque me interesa mucho saber exactamente lo que es.  las fotos originales est���n guardadas en la c���mara para que puedan tener la certeza de que son fieles y no hay ning���n tipo de manipulaci���n en las mismas.  solo se ampliaron y se le aplicaron unos filtros para poder distinguir lo que

12 of june of 2008, exactly at 8:00 p.M., being in the part of back of my house, in company of my son and his fianc���e, i watch towards the sky and i see a light shining and greater than any star, that moved in northeast direction of a speed average.  i warning to my son and his fianc���e and immediately surprised the size of the himself and the round thing to us who was which made us think that it was not an airplane.  when i watch towards the left and in the same trajectory that first a second object comes exactly just as first. then i say to  my son who takes a photo them. in which it prepared the camera, the first object was lowering its intensity of the light until disappearing, but we had the luck to photograph the second object before it disappeared similarly that first.  the night was completely cleared reason why it was not possible that they disappeared behind some cloudiness.  i indicate then my son to takes a photo to a star that was close in order having a reference to compare the images.  all the event lasted of not more than 30 second and the distance between both objects from the point of view of us was of approximately two feet.  i do not know whichever miles are among them in the air.   i sent the photos to my sister who works with computer programs since she is graphical artist, so that she extended them and to see if we could determine that  what we saw and the surprise was great.  the object was not white but green, round almost perfect and inside it has something seems as i spin a top giant.  but greater it was our surprise when in the photo of the star, when already the objects were apparently disappear, there was a third object which never we noticed that it was there, because it was not seen at first. i have the photos and i would like that you could analyze them because we are interests  knowledge exactly to me what is.  the original photos are kept in the camera so that they can have the certainty that they are faithful and there is no type of manipulation in the same ones.  single they were extended and filters were applied to be able to distinguish what was. all those that we were surrounded in this event we are in the best disposition to collaborate with you. thank you very much \r\naurea alicea negr���n\r\npd i have more pictures than the ones that i put here.

sticks, the middle of nowhere. on a clear night we can see the city lights of the small neighboring cities and the lights of the prison which is 7 miles due south of us and 5 miles due east. on this night the three of them were looking out our living room window which is facing south. my wife called out for me to come look at something that they had seen in the sky. now my wife and kids all knew about my story that i just submitted about my ufo sighting when i lived in detroit, and they thought that they too were witnessing something much like what i saw. when i first came to the window and saw what they were seeing i wasn't too sure what it was. however what we all saw was a large cigar shape object with a glowing greeninsh outline slowly moving through the sky. it almost seemed like i could see right through the object, however the outline of the greenish lights was quite clear. what impressed me about the sighting was how the object moved. on first witness the object was moving slowly due east, then it made a 90 degree turn and headed due south. what impressed me was how it made the turn. i'll try to describe. while the leading edge of the object made a 90 degree turn, the \"lagging\" part of the object continued on it's due east course until it hit the point of the original turn, in which case it too made a 90 degree turn to follow the leading end. it ploated like an ameboa. i thought that maybe i was seeing things, but then the object again changed course. instead of heading due south, it made a 90 degree turn to go due east, and again the \"lagging\" end continues due south until it reached the point of the turn and then headed due east. it did this type of turn a few times before we could no longer see the object. afterwards i was being pressed by my wife and family to claim that they too have see a ufo, however i remained uncommital, since i'm not sure what i saw, and it certainly was not like the \"classical\" version of my first ufo sighting.\r\n\r\nwhat i thought was interesting was that the following day on the radio morning show the meteorologist (weatherman) reported that there were many calls the previosly evening from people seeing something in the sky they all thought or presumed to be a ufo. according to the meteorologist what people were reporting was in \"fact\" \"space debri\" floating out over another state (kentucky?), and that calls came in from all over the country reporting this event. however this was the last i heard of it.\r\n\r\nto this day i'm still unsure what it was i saw, however the unusual movement still sticks out in my memory, and even though my kids were young and are now both in college haven't forgotton the event's of that night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

upstairs in my bedroom watching tv. (my bedroom is in the back of my townhouse.)  i heard some really loud helicopters in the distance, they were so loud i figured they were military choppers.  i occasionally see/hear military helicopters because of dobbins afb.  i have a habit of running to look at them when i hear them.  on sunday night the sound of the helicopters appeared to be louder than the other times.  for some reason they were taking a longer time to get to my general area.  i decided to go and open the blinds to my window and wait for them to pass over my home.  \r\n \r\ni have a limited view of the sky due to tall pine trees.  i scanned the sky and trees to my right and left waiting to see how many choppers were passing me.  as i looked to my left i noticed a bright white light that was blinking on and off.  i then noticed a red light blinking on my left, i couldn't understand because i waiting for these helicopter to show up.  i turned and looked on my right (a good distance) and i see another red light!  at that point the white light and both red lights stayed on, and the complete shape of a triangle was in my view!  (it was going very, very very slow!!).  i realized that i was viewing this thing from underneath it as it passed over my house, the bottom was just above tree level (very low)!\r\n \r\nonce it passed (very slow pace) i was able to see the whole back side of it.  it appeared light in color maybe light gray, i couldn't tell the height of it but the distant between the back corner red lights gave me the sense that this thing was beyond big!  \r\n \r\nthere were a total of 3 helicopters, one flanked on each side of the triangle and one behind it.  the helicopters didn't appear to be chasing this triangle but more like pacing it.  i heard no sound coming from this triangle, no interference with my tv.  also, the flight pattern was odd because planes don't fly over my house at all. i don't see any planes traveling parallel with holcomb bridge rd. heading toward ga 400/roswell area!\r\n \r\ni can understand why it took a longer time for the helicopter to fly over me, because of slow the speed they were going.  slow, slow, slow!!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":17108,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9487127,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05242009-0011","longitude":-84.2106709,"occurred":1239598200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1239598200000,"summary":"After loud helicopters passed, huge, dark triangle hovered very low over mine & adjoining townhouses, hard to see, finally saw 2 red and 1 white lights, moved off very slowly.","tags":["lights","triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Norcross, Georgia","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:231575"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82759,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2232}
