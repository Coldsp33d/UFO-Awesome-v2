and non-believers), and to this day the event remains very accountable to the events of what we saw. i always wondered if anyone else saw what we saw. i do not know where the other eye witness is these days, but i'm sure he would tell the story the same as i would. so here goes.\r\n\r\nare you familiar with detroit? we lived in what is known as \"new center\", which is an area about 2 miles north of downtown detroit and just west of woodward avenue on bethune street. our house was right next and east of   the john lodge expressway. this neighborhood (street) no longer exists anymore. at somepoint gm bought out the complete neighborhood and renovated every home and put up high priced condo's, complete with security walls and private security. the \"new center\" area is the home to the fisher building, a beautifull skyscaper complete with a lit up golden top and was thus nicknamed \"the golden tower of the fisher building\". at one time this buliding housed the detroit am radio station wjr. also in new center was the home head quarters of gm, before they moved to the ren cen. it was an area of homes, a few skyscrapers, restaurants and hotels, not far away one would find the home of mowtown, the henry ford hospital, and wayne state university.\r\n\r\nit was summer, could of been june, july or even august, all i remember about that, was that it was hot. the year i believe to be is 1975. my room mate jeff fields was standing on the front porch. our front porch faced south. if you were standing on this porch, the golden tower of the fisher building would have been on your left, 3 blocks east and two blocks south. to the right of the porch would have been the john lodge expressway and the service drive for the expressway. myself i was sitting in the living room of the house reading a science fiction novel (please don't hold that against me) when considering weather my accountability is authenic or not. it was dark outside, approximatly 9 or 10pm when my friend jeff yelled out, \"john, come here\"! i admit i was really enthralled into my novel and ignored jeff. jeff yelled out again, \" john you got to come here, quick\". i again ignored his request, but when jeff sounded frantic and yelled out, \"john come here, you ain't going to believe this\", i slowly got off the couch and walked out onto the porch and said, \"okay, what?\" jeff who was standing on my lefy pointed to the sky and said, \"do you see that?\" at the time i didn't see anything so i said, \"see what?\" jeff said, \"you don't see that?\" \"see what\", i again exclaimed. at this point jeff's finger was shaking as he was pointing to the sky and his voice was rather loud when he said, \"you don't see that?\" and well so i did, and at this point neither one of us said a word until what we saw was gone from out view.\r\n\r\nwhat we saw was a classical flying saucer, right out of the movies if you will. it was hovering above the new center area south of the howard johnsons but only maybe a few hundred feet above the entire new center landscape area. if it had been daylight you could have told what type of plane it might have been, it was flying that low. there wasn't any noticable sound coming from the craft. even though it was dark you could still make out the outline of the object. my guess is that if it would have landed it would taken up the entire footprint of the howard johnsons restaurant and hotel. it had what looked like large rectangular lights on the side that were moving counter clockwise. it hovered here for a while sometimes moving up and slightly west. we had what seemed like quite a few moments to witness this. slowly the saucer shaped object continued to move due west. after is had past over the john lodge expressway the lights seemed to rotate a bit faster, and then a bit faster yet, when all of a sudden the lights blurred together and headed in a south west direction toward old tiger stadium and within seconds the speed of this craft was gone from our sight. i had this feeling over me that i had just witnessed a once in a lifetime event, it left me in awe, but gratefull to now truly be able to say that, \"yes, i belive that there is life on other planets\". i am not embarrased to tell this story, or afraid that people might think i am \"nuts\".\r\n\r\noverall we estimated we had at least 3 minutes to witness this craft, and we talked about it often. we looked the next day to see if there were any reports in the paper, but this was in the \"old days\" before the internet and found no other reports of this sighting. i found this amazing that we could never find any other eye witness's. my dad, although retired at the time worked for the faa at metropolitan airport, and was always getting called on planes out and about over detroit that were not supossed to be there, and yet this object to my knowledge was never picked up on a radar.\r\n\r\nwell i know what we (i) saw, and it was classic. i have always believed that there was or is life outside of this planet, but after seeing this i became a true believer.My wife and i both intend to become members of mimufon and mufon soon. contact me if you wish. thank you.\r\n\r\nplease note that there was another time i witnessed something unidentifiable in the sky. this time it was not the classic saucer shape i witnessed in this report, but something more bizarre, and i still am not sure what it was that i saw. i will make those claims in another report due to the nature of the time and people involved. \r\n\r\nsincerely, \r\njohn

one may be military but it certainly felt other worldly if that's possible.\r\n\r\nagain i had a witness with me and it was the  same person who saw the last sighting with me this time however we were speechless and did not talk to one another till after the sighting because we were taken by surprise to see something so big. i mean when we noticed and looked at the lights we swore a plane was about to fly in to your apartment! it took a really long time to glide across the sky however it seems as if we were looking at it for almost 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nwhen it first appeared there was a helicopter hovering around it but it seemed to fly away very fast for some reason then the craft which when all electronics in the house were turned off and the windows open we could not hear anything but oddly enough we could feel a vibration i can't really put it in to words. what really got me and my friend however is that it looked like a giant boomerang, it was really big i don't know how to really explain it only that we both agree it was the biggest craft we had ever seen. i wish i could show you how big it was it was easily 2-300 feet wide, unfortunately though this time we weren't equipped with the tools needed for evidence...We just didn't think we would see something again and especially like this. but then to top it all off the craft began to suddenly fly vertically and it looked like a giant vertical boomerang in the sky.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:19:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path

the orange ufo we saw on 5/18/09 and 5/13/09.. was ready with my new, 2- day-old $1200 sony hdr-xr500v hd camcorder, celestron skymaster giant binoculars 20x80.......(still waiting for the tripod and telephoto lens).\r\ni thought, i may as well take another bathroom trip before turning in... when i came out, i thought, \"why not take one last look?\" saw a flashing something craft going kinda slow and low (only about an 1 inch over the treeline in front of my house).\r\n\r\ni thought... \"what the hell is that?\"  opened the window to get a better look because i didn't have my glasses on... and\r\n\r\nno sound!   i ran to the bar in living room to grab the new camcorder.. i wrestled frantically at the patio door lock, ran out onto the deck and filmed this thing!  it was heading west approx., and was lost behind some large trees... ran to the bedroom at the west end of my house to see if it would come out of trees, but it didn't.  you can hear on the video only some ambient highway noise and crickets, followed by me whispering \"where'd it go?\".\r\n\r\nbefore you think it's just a helicopter or plane, look how the torpedo thing on right side changes--the porthole/exhaust hole-looking things changes, doo-dads are seen on top in one photo.. and, look closely at ufoprobe39big.Jpg... there's square windows lit up by the flashing light!..... oh  yeah, and let's not forget about the little probe.  didn't notice it too much at playback until i did the frame-by-frame... whizzes past the craft from the right to the left!  in one blow up, it looks bullet shaped with 2 holes. \r\n\r\nthese things have been seen by paul and i moving silently overhead for a couple of months now (the 5th one we noticed--wonder how many we didn't)... thought it was weird, but thought because of the flashing lights they were just some sort of plane... we're not plane buffs, but we'd never seen planes with 3 white lights on the back with a big red light underneath....The flashing lights where the wing tips should be are what throws you off.  i think they've figured out how to pretend to be our planes so they can travel without hassle.  except the no noise part...\r\n\r\ni had seen it earlier in the night with my giant binoculars, but it was too far away to see anything but the 2 lights on back and flashing (going at an angle, only 2 show).\r\n\r\nby the time i got a decent look and was heading right towards down the street thru the woods... only 35 seconds of video--but it is in blu-ray format! 1440 x 1080.  (i'm a little bummed to realize today that i could've had a 12.1mp photo during recording if i had pressed the photo button....Sigh).\r\n\r\ni'm soooooo excited!!!!!!  we've seen many different kinds of unidentified flying objects (vertical rod, neon green & orange fireballs, red pulsating disk, star-like bright round ones, comet type horizontal flying one, huge cigar with probes, a neon green light orb in iowa, a v-shaped one, a smaller oblong silver one, and a small, softball-to-soccer ball-sized silver orb, but this one takes the cake!)\r\n\r\ngo ahead, look at the video and blow ups and say it with me....\"what the hell is it???!!\"\r\n\r\nupdate:  video presentation done with blown-up stills in slow-motion playback.  video is untouched, stills only had 'sharpen' and/or brightness/contrast adjusted to see detail.  posted on my youtube channel (plus enjoy my pre-screened \"favorites\" videos--all are impressive non-fake ones),

i were driving to visit his aunt and uncle when i noticed a light behaving oddly (starting and stopping) in the sky. upon arriving at his aunt's home (an apartment complex), my boyfriend suggested they come look at the light. the aunt, uncle, their three children (aged from about 9 to 15), the boyfriend and i all went out to look a for the light. we were in an newly developed area and surrounded by low woods. at first i was looking in the sky and did not spot it. in a hushed voice the aunt said \"i see it!\" and i looked at her. her eyes were huge and she looked stunned. i said \"where?\", and she pointed at ground level. i then saw not a light but an object not in the sky, as i expected, but rising from some nearby trees. it was about the size of two or three of the treetops, and it was shaped like two shallow bowls placed together at their edges. there was a row of lights around the center (at the junction of the rims of the two bowls). the lights were orange and the entire object glowed orange, although the lights were so bright that i could not tell if the object was orange or if it was metallic and reflecting the orange of the surrounding band of lights. this was clearly an object, not a light or a reflection. it rose slowly (straight up) until it was well into the sky (i will guess 500 to 800 feet, though i am not a very good judge of altitude).\r\nit remained stationary, and after a few minutes the lights changed color and started flashing in a sequence of red, white and orange. the different lights were different colors at any given time and i could not discern a pattern to the color changes. the object remained still for several minutes, flashing the red, white and orange lights. the lights were again too bright for me to be sure of the color of the object, but it either glowed or was highly reflective. after several minutes, it took off at a 45 degree angle and vanished in seconds. it did not simply disappear, it grew smaller with distance as it left, so i knew it was flying away, but it flew so rapidly as to be gone from sight in seconds.\r\nour little group returned to the house and after briefly reassuring one another that we had all seen it, we sat in absolute silence for a while. my feeling was that i had seen something that was impossible, and i sat in silence trying to reconcile what i had seen with what i believed to be possible. i guess we sat there for 30 min. to 1 hour, because then it was time for me to get home (i had to be home by 10:00pm). i suppose we were all too stunned to talk about it. what was there to say? even the children were silent. i reported it to carswell air force base in fort worth, but they did not seem interested and may have thought it was a prank. it wasn't. i have tried to find other people who saw it or something like it. i met a man (we became friends) who saw an identical object on a rural road near hallsville, texas (at night that same summer) and followed it in his car until it took off over trees where he could not follow. he was closer to the object than my group, and he said it made a humming sound (i heard no noise). there were absolutely no drugs or alcohol involved in our sighting. my now ex-husband will not discuss it other than to say he saw something because he says people will think he's crazy if he describes what he saw. i am not crazy. i did dream once about it several years later. i dreamed that i awoke to find that my room was filled with brilliant orange light. i don't remember the middle of the dream, but at the end i felt contaminated with the light, as if i were glowing orange. i only mention this as a reaction to seeing the object. i read of your site when i saw mention of a woman in texas who had seen something similar to this in 1967. i have always wondered how many people saw what i saw, and if they have any explanation for it.","distance":"101-500

bright satellite (moving at a similiar speed to a satellite from south to north). i said wow, that cant be one, its too bright, maybe its the space station or the space shuttle. then the light dimmed as i said that and disappeared entirely. from the beginning to end the diameter was as large as vega in the beginning and as small as a pin prick when it vanished.\r\n\r\n15 minutes later i was in my backyard with a friend, and as i remembered the sighting. i told him emphatically how weird it was to see something so bright and know it was not a plane. at that moment, he said \"like that?\" i turned around (facing west towards lake washington) and a very bright oval/sphere object about the size of a dime in the sky moved from behind and a above a row of trees about 100 to 125 yards from our position. he then said \"thats not a plane\" i agreed and proceeded to become nervous because i had the  feeling that it knew we knew about it and once i said something it had appeared. it stayed in plain sight above the tree line at 500 to 1500 feet up. i have lots of aircraft fly over from large airliners to small float planes and traffic cessna's so determining the height was very easy. it moved west to east in a slow up and down undulating motion that almost seemed to be playing with my line of sight as i ran to the corner of my yard to keep it in sight.\r\nas i took up another clear view it suddenly dimmed itself out into an ever smaller ring that went from the brightest white light i have ever seen to an orangish brown ring the size of what i can only describe as  a needle

july/august of last summer around 9-10pm.  my wife and i were driving home to vail eastbound on i-70 from edwards, with the arrowhead development on our right off the highway, when we both saw a large triangular array of slowly blinking red lights, in what looked to be a formation, moving initially approximately 150mph come from behind off our right hand side, moving over the valley (again the arrowhead area) at an altitude, approximately, of about 200 feet above ground level moving eastward parallel to i-70 and in an upwards trajectory of about 10-15 degrees.  it wasn't what looked like a craft but rather a triangular array of red lights, and what looked to be about 100 yards between the points.  in a matter of a 2-3 seconds later, the lights accelerated at an exponential rate, zooming off to the east and turning slightly towards the northeast before disappearing over the mountainous horizon.  the rate of acceleration was much greater than any normal jet or even rocket is capable of, in my estimation.  there were no other cars next to us at the time so i doubt we could be mistaking a light reflection on our windshields for this phenomenon, and my wife and i compared notes and saw what we believe to be the same thing.  at first i thought the object was an aircraft, but again i didn't see any craft, just blinking red lights, and the lights were so far apart that it would be too big for any aircraft i am aware of, and i have a good knowledge of aircraft.  also, it would be highly unusual for any aircraft or formation of aircraft to be flying in this airspace at this rate of speed, and in my estimation impossible for any normal aircraft to accelerate like this and dissapear over a horizon tens of miles away in a matter of a couple of seconds.  both of us were speechless for a few moments and literally coundn't believe what we saw.

seen that a flashing red light was blinking on top of the mountain for airplanes just in case they fly too low. the lights at that time were hardly ever on and for them to just start blinking for no reason was weird. so my friend and i were looking for a plane and all of a sudden we seen a purple and blue light blinking above the clouds. we kept watching and the sky actually opened up and a ufo came out of the opening and flew around the area it came out of and stopped. it shined a beam of light straight down and was moving the light around almost like shining a spotlight around looking around for something. \r\n\r\nthen a few minutes later three more came out of the same hole in the sky and split up and went separate ways almost like looking for something. it didn't last long and the three smaller ones went back up in the hole in the sky and the bigger ufo before following back in the sky pulled its beam back up and shot something toward my back yard. my friend and i were scared because we didn't know what to think but for some reason i couldn't stop watching the ufo and it then went back in the hole in the sky and the lights faded and had gone. \r\n\r\nthat morning we went and looked in the back yard and field and could not find anything. i am telling you this because i seen your show last night when you were in bucks county, pa. it struck me just then that the

10:30 p.M. est.. went back out at 11:33 p.M. approx., suddenly there. first exact words i spoke were \"they shouldn' be there\". 3 stars/lights/objects, looked at first equidistant. 2 bottom lights spread apart, with 3rd light slightly elevated (dead center) above bottom 2 lights/objects. quickly bottom right light moved quickly to right of sky, very quickly disappeared. ran in to get bi-noculars. past experience has proven scope observation was too interfered with by close proximity to streetlamp. bi-noculars were bushnell 7 x 35, 420' @ 1000 yd.S., 140m @ 1000m, field 8 degrees. small upper circle to right of 8 i assume denoted degrees. then focuses directly on both lights separately. had definite point of reference to distinguish individual object movement by treelines (treetops)above neighbor's houses directly across street from my location (51 n. fawn dr., newark, de.). both lights/objects moved independently of each other, different altitudes and movement left and right. know i was seeing what i was seeing by fact that either one or both were moving above and below tree-lines (tops) at some times leaving line of sight. focused with bi-noculars as best poss., until very clear, but quit small orbs sighted. both objects/lights exhibited very, very rapid strobed light emissions with no apparrent paterns such as commercial aircraft. far left light/object faded, disappeared quickly. only left object was center one. faded in and out of visibility. as throughout event changing course up/down, left/right. at event end object faded, disappeared and event over. can't think of any more details.As stated in prior repot, have no idea my longitute, latitude,ascention. declination, azimuth, etc. but if you want an approx. trajectory of where they were in relation to my specific ground location, i'm at 51 n. fawn dr., i saw objects directly above middle of 43 & 41 n. fawn dr., if you want to get satelite photo of my exact line of

inspection it looked like a disk or oval shaped object with an orange fireball around its' mid-section.  it wasn't the typical flame that trails an object losing altitude, rather this object gained altitude fairly quickly and the fireball seemed to surround the object in a huge spike-like fashion. my wife believes she saw a pulsating white light, however i did not witness this.  there was absolutely no noise involved.  the object over the course of the next minute or so continued to gain altitude until we lost sight of it behind the clouds.  we wondered if this could possibly be some type of missle but quickly dismissed that idea.  all we know is this was not any type of aircraft we're familiar with.  we're still completely in awe of the whole event.

(it was kind of like the \"trail\" a sparkler leaves when quickly run across your field of vision, but thin, like a laser is thin.) i also would mention, that during the 2-3 minutes of this observation, there were aircraft approaching the nearby portland international airport and in holding patters with external lights and landing lights on. this object was clearly not an approaching nor a landing aircraft. and, i have also watched head-on-approaching, landing approach, landing-lights-on,  aircraft, many times, and this object was not one of those. and, also during the time this object was visible, there was an intercontinental jet at cruise altitude directly above us, and this object was certainly not one of those either. there were no visible lights (or anything similar to aircraft lights) on this aircraft. in addition to me, my friend saw the object in the sky (i summoned him from inside the restaurant), however, he did not see the actual \"disappearance\" occur, but did confirm he didn't see it after i watched it \"blink out\". i swear this report is accurate and true.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":17079,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.6449181,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05232009-0004","longitude":-122.6566861,"occurred":1243056600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Egg,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1243056600000,"summary":"Silent brilliant-matte-white light silently moves east-west, then disappears","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Vancouver, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:231632"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Butler","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on my route today when i passed with in 1000-1500 feet of the old allegeny axel building, when there was a small rumbleing coming from the plant and since the plant had been closed for a few months i had figured it was just some of the local goth scene doing one of their larp games in the plant when the rumbleing increased to a ear paining level. then sections of the old bay door had opened and judgeing by the size of the bay door i would belive the object was at least 8 and 1/2 feet wide and 10 feet long. hovering about 3-4 feet off the ground it came out of the bay horizontal before it made a lazy 90 degree turn to the sky and lifted about 20-30 feet high and then paused flashed a 15 second series of red, gold and blue lights before it turned 90 degrees again to become horizonal with the ground and then slowly turned towards the south west and started to slowly move forward before it shot off.\r\n\r\n one neighbor hood homless person approached me and asked if i just saw the tear of god leave. this was roughly 10 minutes later\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
