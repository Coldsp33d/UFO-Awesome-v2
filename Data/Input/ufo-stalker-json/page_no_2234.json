immediately speed for a place to park and film. i was extremely excited to be able to film this event. i was in horn lake filming in the shnucks parking lot. i got out the car and quickly began filming. it started off with 5 lights in a formation and as i began filming there were four but one was leaving. when i first noticed these objects i knew that these were not planes. planes dont sit in the same spot for an hour. but as i filmed helicopters began to head for the lights. as i filmed the helicopters as they multiplied i film back at the ufo lights and bam one was missing. but how can it just vanish and not be seen? an airplane would still be seen if it was leaving but this light was gone completely leaving only 3 lights left. the formation then began to shift. then two smaller lights appear below the big 3 lights and they all sit in the same spot and then another small light appears out of nowhere and sits there. the lights then all seem to be coming towards each other. we then decide to head closer to the object as we thought we could get a better view but we didnt. the video i filmed lasts 5 minutes. its good quality and our reactions are just shocked i guess. i mean what else would you do if you love to read and hear about ufo's and you finally get to film one. i am extremely happy to have caught this footage. i have always believed in ufo's and that the government is indeed hiding something from us. i hope this video attracts many people into believing that there is something going on in our skies, and that i was very lucky to capture this footage. i

submit.\r\n\r\ni have always believed in the existence of ufos, but never saw anything i could categorize as such until my freshman year of college.  my best friend at the time, raymond, accompanied me on a long day trip from odessa to san antonio.  we wre freshmen in college, and didn't have enough money to spend the night in a hotel.  we took just enough money for eating and drinking.  around 10 p.M., we headed back to odessa, about a 5 hour drive.  we were on the last leg of the trip where we had to pass threw some of the small towns on the way north from i10 to odessa.  these are towns where the population is generally under 1,000.  at night, you're the only one driving down main street.  \r\n\r\nas we started to approach rankin, we noticed that on the open highway behind us, there appeared to be a motorcycle behind us.  we were doing about 65 mph.  i owned a dodge 4 cylindar that wouldn't do much more than 80 mph.  the strange thing is, the light came right up on us, and then stayed right off our rear bumper.  with no one else in the road for miles in either direction, we didn't know why the vehicle wouldn't just pass.  over the next few minutes, it would drift back maybe 100 yards, then close the distance again.  it did this repeatedly, for miles.  what happened next is we started seeing two lights, in different configurations, that is... one on top of the other, or two side by side.  we were already concerned, it was clear we were being \"messed with\" by something.  \r\n\r\nrankin was approaching on the horizon.  as we came in town, the main road lead right to a convenience store.  we pulled in the lot and turned the car back in the direction we had just came from.  we wanted to see what had been behind us.  the light had drifted back as we approached town.  we sat there, pretty scared at this point, waiting... for about 10 minutes.  nothing ever came.  we slowly drove through the small town, looking for the state highway on the outskirts.  the entire way, there were street lights.  nothing ever came through that town behind us, we watched carefully.  we got back on the road, this time headed toward iraan.  we drove a solid 10 minutes past rankin with nothing in the rear view mirror.  then, off in the distance, we saw a single light, again closing the distance.  we really became concerned at this point.  i tried driving faster, but it made no difference to the light, the same pattern of behavior continued.  \r\n\r\ni asked raymond to climb into the back seat and look closely through the hatch window.  even though the light was right on us, it appeared just to be a light.  we couldn't see the outline of a vehicle, person, motorcycle, anything.  it just appeared to be a light.  i have had people ask me why i didn't just tap the breaks or stop the car.  i don't think it really seriously ever occurred to us.  raymond and i just wanted to keep going... to get home.  we were in the middle of nowhere, and if we could just keep going, that was the best thing.  \r\n\r\nwe came into iraan, and did the same thing.  we sat in the lighted parking lot of the first convenience store we saw, and waited.  nothing.  this time, we even waited longer.  but sure enough, once we were a good distance outside of town, the light appeared.  the light followed us until we were only about 40 miles outside of odessa.  as the lights loomed on the horizon, the light just faded off into the distance, and left us alone.  \r\n\r\ncould it have been a person somehow doing this and we just couldn't see them?  sure.  but why?  we're talking about a great distance this light followed us, and for over two hours.  i have no logical explanation for this.  i lived in a house alone back then.  i do know that it was one of the most terrifying nights of my life.  even when i got home, i laid in the darkness of my bedroom feeling the strongest sensation of being watched all night.  when sunrise came the next day, it was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen.  \r\n\r\ni took my wife to meet raymond in san antonio after we got married (raymond lives there now).  the two couples were having dinner, and raymond brought it up.  it is something that has never left the minds of either of us.

year was 1981, and i was in 8th grade at st.Georges homes, ketti, nilgiris dist., india. three or four friends and me were waiting outside the school dining hall one evening at around 6.30pm or 7.00pm for a movie to begin in the dining hall which doubled as a movie theater once a month, when one of us, pointed towards the sky and started watching a star that was moving, slowly like a satellite would.It looked just like any other medium sized star, but dont remember if it twinkled. at first we thought that we were looking at a satellite, however we realised it couldnt be a satellite because sometimes it stopped, sometimes it went backwards and also sideways in fact we realised it did not seem to have a fixed path, to us, the kids observing the star, it just seemed to move from one star to another randomly. we watched this star for a few minutes and then what happened next was so strange that it will be hard to believe. the star stopped moving when it was near the first star in the constellation big dipper. one of my friends casually remarked \"what if it moved to the next star in the same constellation?\" and to our surprise the wandering star appeared to do just that, it moved next to the next star in the constellation. since what just happened excited us, we again tried our luck and said \"what if the star went back to the first star?\" lo and behold it did just that, as if it was understanding or listening what we were saying. in this way, i think we spent nearly quarter or half an hour ordering the star about in the sky and everytime, it moved exactly to all the stars we asked it to move to.\r\nas a graduate in science, i know that as per the laws of physics it is impossible for any object to move so fast from one star to another and also that the stars in a

we asked it to go to...Have no clue how it did that or how it made us believe it was doing that or how on earth it heard what three or four small kids were talking between themselves.\r\nthere were other students near us when all this was happening, but for some reason we did not alert the other kids nor did we talk about the incident till i met one of my friends twenty three years later...Very

high rate of speed; not quite as fast as a shooting star might move but it appeared many times faster than a satellite might seem to move. i did not notice any light as you would see with a star or satellite.  there was absolutely no sound and just before i lost sight of it to the north it appeared to slightly angle to the east. the best way i can explain it is it appeared as if something was cutting through the sky.  this is why i marked the shape as a cigar.  i can not tell if the object was shaped like a cigar or what but it was almost like watching a jet boat on the water from a high mountain top where there was a sort of wave or ripple left behind although there was no noticeable length of tail and i could not distinguish between the object and the sky. it took approximately 3 seconds to go from one side of my view to the other.\r\n\r\ni watched this object move across the whole of my horizon and thought to myself: \"no way, what the hell was that?  seriously, what the hell

went outside to see who it was. i went down stairs and into my back garden where i saw my dogs jumping up, upon going outside and looking around and up to see what the dogs here barking at.  i saw a massive triangle object, moving slowly, i would say in a north west direction. i could see the 3 corners of the object as each corner had a light on it, this light was a soft white light, and i could see the dark outline of the triangle itself. and as it moved slowly i was blocking out the stars. \r\n\r\nat this time my husband had come down to see what was going on when i pointed it out to him and he claimed it was just a plane going over head. he went back to bed while i watched this object slowly moving over some fields. the craft was very high up in the sky. i really could not say how high it was. \r\n\r\nthe craft itself started to move away from my sight, so i quickly got some jeans and top on, and took my dogs into the back fields. (a note for where i live, it is very flat and newly built, so very open).\r\n\r\nthe craft at this time, i would say about 5:25 started to get smaller and go faster, i can only guess it was moving up in height and in speed. i noticed that a small orb of light seemed to appear from the middle of the craft and float down and vanish. i say float down as i would have though it would have dropped quicker if it was not under control. after this the craft quickly moved away and vanished into the distance over the next 30 mins. \r\n\r\nthe craft made almost no sound, there was alittle humming sound, but it seemed more like a humming feeling than a sound itself. as i said before there was soft light on the 3 parts of it and you could make out the black body part that formed the rest between. i could not make out any more about it.\r\n\r\nthe orb that came out from it seemed to appear from the middle of the craft and floated down. i am not sure what it was, it was just a orb(sphere of light) that floated down.\r\n\r\nwhile seeing the craft, it made me feel very relaxed and peaceful.

witnessed last night. my wife and i saw something in the sky's over lake elsinore ca that appeared to be a satellite moving in orbit coming out of the north east at extreme altitude or space. the object appeared to be traveling a little faster than a typical satellite moves which got my attention.\r\nwe were out on our deck  observing the lake and the stars when it appeared. i had my binoculars with me which i use to observe air traffic witch is a hobby of mine being a helicopter pilot. when i saw the object i decided to look at it with my binoculars. i was able to follow it and trying to make out its shape. thats when it started to slow down then circle around and stop. in a panic i told my wife to look at it. it then appeared circle around it' position a couple times and then hover again. we then saw another light that seemed to be turned on and thats when i was able to make out its shape. as i looked at it with the binoculars i could see that there were 3 lights in triangle formation. in the center was a dark shadow. so it was definitely triangular shape. suddenly it emitted a blue flash of light almost looked like when you look directly at a laser beam head on but with a rapid flashing. about 2 mins later it light up and shot out about a 30 degree angle up and upon doing so it almost resembled the opposite of a shooting star but at a upwards vertical rather than down. this scared us quite a bit and we were both panicking.  i don't have pictures or video because it all happened in about 8 to 11 mns and i was glued as well as my wife. we just recently moved here and my recorder is still boxed up in the garage.  i have already ruled out the space shuttle for we wouldn't need it if we had a craft like this. my wife and i are shaken up about this and i am questioning the reason for all this.\r\n\r\ni can talk in more detail about this verbally if you like.\r\n\r\nlucius luciano","distance":"Over One
