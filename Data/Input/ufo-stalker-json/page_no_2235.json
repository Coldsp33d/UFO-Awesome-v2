travel this route at least once weekly at various times of day and are very familiar with both the route and terrain.I first noticed the object in the northwest sky(the sky was very clear that night)while traveling north on highway 25. we had just crossed the 301 bypass and were heading toward the hopeulikit community that is at the intersection of us 25 and us 80. initially, i thought it was a cell tower that was being obscured at times by the tall pine trees that line the west side of hwy 25 because the light red orange light appeared to blink out at times.(also, there is a cell tower in the area that we also were able to see in the distance.) i brought the light to my friends attention and were both intrigued. as we got closer to the hopeulikit community the light changed from reddish orange to a bright white light and grew much larger and suddenly became 3 lights and blinked out. we stopped our vehicle and got out to see it we could locate and spot it again. we could not see or hear anything. we continued to travel north on highway 25 for a few miles hoping to see it again but saw nothing. we turned around to continue our drive back to swainsboro thinking that what we saw had vanished and that the excitement had ended. upon leaving the hopeulikit community the object re-appeared on the north side of hwy 80. the object appeared to now be red and was flying below the top of the pine trees. the object paralleled our vehicle and appeared to be flying at the same speed 30-35 mph. this took place for a distance of approximately 5 miles.As we entered the portal city limits at the fire dept the object crossed atop hwy 80 and again expanded to 6+ white lights however they appeared much smaller this time.My partner was able to take a picture with a cell phone.(attached) the lights blinked out and the object disappeared. we again pulled over and got out the car but could not see or hear anything. i agree to be interviewed by mufon staff but wish to remain anonymous and do not consent to be contacted by third parties. i do reserve the right to consent to be interviewed at a later date by third parties.","distance":"101-500

the path of the ufo came into view as i cleared an area of trees (where there is about an acre of open land by the road on the left). the event lasted about 5 seconds. it moved across my field of view faster than a plane, but about a quarter the speed of a shooting star, and toward the end, because of the brightness and relative motion, seemed more like a flare just above the house about 1,000 ft away. unlike a flare, there was no smoke trail, and no \"sparks.\" the glow and brightness was constant. the size was about that of a traffic light if stopped at an intersection, but at least double

same to me as they all describe.  around sunset, my wife and i and a few other people noticed it in the sky after a church meeting.  extremely bright and very stationary.  \r\n\r\ni watched it all the way home; as the sky darkened, the object stayed lit up.  but i also noticed that the clouds were still lit up as well, which is, of course, because the sun was still shining at that altitude.  also on the way home, i noticed a tiny object dangling from the bottom of the large lit-up one, which was shaped like an upside-down tear drop.  pretty convinced at this point that it was a weather balloon, but the fact that it wasn't moving seemed very strange.\r\n\r\nwhen i got home, i grabbed my digital camera and binoculars, and looked first through the binoculars.  the object looked very extraordinary and impressive, but absolutely a weather balloon.  i took some film footage of it just for fun (see attached).\r\n\r\nthe object stayed in the same position for well over an hour (still seemed strange), and then faded to orange, then black, as the evening sky darkened.  i was confused by the stationary aspect of the balloon, but read today on the web that balloons are sometimes floated to fairly high altitudes (1,500 feet or higher) while tethered to the ground.  obviously the case here...\r\n\r\nadmittedly, i do believe in \"ufo's\", though i don't believe they're visitors from other planets...  in the case of this particular sighting, it simply wasn't a \"ufo\" at all...  sorry...   :)","distance":"Over One

Unknown","city":"Beverly Hills","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving no. on l a cienaga blvd. in los angles, and stopped at a red light. i always look up, and do not think every flash, cloud etc. is a ufo. as i looked in the sky ahead of me i noticed a long white , tube like thing flying across the sky.( i thought it was a plane , but something about it  made me question myself. i noticed i didn't see the wing span like on a plane. it also seemed longer then a plane.) the light changed , i looked down for about 2 sec. and then looked back up again, and it was gone. the sky was clear, there were no clouds and my visual scope was clear from left to right.  there also were no buildings or trees etc. to block my sight. even if it were a plane , i would've been able to see it further-away in the sky. this really got my attention. i nearly drove into the next car ,cause i was so puzzled, fyi there was alot of traffic, we were moving very slowly, about 1 car length. i did keep looking for this object, i even thought during my first initial sight \" that looks strange take a picture, even with my phone\" but again it was not visible anymore. the main reason i am reporting this is  cause i am alittle confused as to what i saw, and if  anyone else in my area reported anything? i also like to mention i drive a convertible so my visual span was very wide.   had this thing not disappeared, i might have shrugged it off , but it clearly was not  anywhere around my airspace. i also live near lax and don't cry wolf everytime i see a light in the sky. i would also like to say my reason for looking up all the time is because in 1984(apprx ) in yonkers, ny on the toconic pkwy, cross county pkwy at around 1:30-am i did witness a  black square-edged  boomerang object , had 5 white lights, no nose, no tail, was very low , gliding slowly, floating, i literally  stopped my car on the 4 lane highway, got out and just stared at this huge , soundless thing, floating...... thinking how can it float so slow and not fall down? i flashed my  lights high-beam,  and i swear it started to turn and head towards  the pkwy. as a couple of cars passed, i was pointing up, and they also stopped , but we did not speak, they stopped up the road , ahead of where i was. as it came over the pkwy, is when i was thinking what is this, i crossed out all logical answers, and then noticed it had no nose , and no tail, like planes do, no red or grn lights, made no noise, and was so big i could not see the stars (sky )  while it was over me.. then it just turned back towards the direction it came from. i saw the underneath of it, it looked like the ceiling of an industrial plant.. pipes, crevices, tubing.. etc.. this is the moment in my life when the word ufo had a new meaning, and i no longer think ufo is a saucer, and unidentified flying object (ufo) means exactly what it stands for. as i stood out my car i got a rush of panic , i got very afraid suddenly and jumped in my car , and started to leave, i kept looking back as it floated away, again turning my head back  to look, and forward , acouple of times, but the last time i looked back it was gone. i dont think it disappeared, i think due to the shape , at a certain angle it blends with the sky. hence only a certain radius see the objects ... anyway thank-you for this opportunity to tell you my story. p.S. when i got home it was 1.5 hrs later then it should have been...??? i think i have lost time, people think im crazy when i tell'em my story, but no gain has come from my experience except my friends think im crazy.. and i lost a couple of dates  ...
