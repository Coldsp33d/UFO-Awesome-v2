got back on rt. 22 towards delmont.  object was seen at that time by 3 people total in car.  no other stars were out yet. no blinking light, it was steady glow--the only light in the sky. not chinese lanterns.  \r\n\r\nher story: decided to try and drive over towards it south off of rt. 22.  it was no longer visible.  took 2nd kid home in delmont, was returning to home in murrysville on rt. 22, heading west past rick's sports bar, saw it again in western sky to the left of the large radio tower w/3 or 4 red lights (daughter said it is by cochran car dealership up on hill in monroeville.  as we watched it, it got substantially brighter and bigger (like 4 times bigger)... enough that we said, \"whoa, whoa!  look what it's doing!  it can't be a plane!\"  it was moving right, towards the tower while it did it's thing several times--getter brighter, then dimming.  we were going to drive to the hill in monroeville by the tower to check it out, when it dimmed to nothing...Gone.  we turned left onto our road, school rd. south.  coming up to top of hill we decided to turn onto farmland that has a 360 view of surrounding area and look for it again.  we saw overhead a small star-like object moving in wiggling s-pattern towards south--same pattern as on the 13th!  daughter (with much better eyes) saw a total of 5 objects moving within 15-20 minutes, most straight overhead by the big dipper.  one i couldn't see until it slowed down  then 'flashed' white then moved faster (note: we've seen weird small 'flashes' in the sky--looked and saw nothing... wondering what caused it--perhaps this is the cause!)  another craft moving s to n with crazy flashing lights she said moved in arching pattern, back and forth--no sound.  she called me on phone about 10:30pm, told me to grab canon camera and go shoot pictures of amber 'thing' that was back in southern sky.  at first i couldn't see it because of the trees (she saw it from top of hill clearly--she flashed her headlights at it several times and it scared them by getting brighter like it was coming closer to them).  it made erratic 'jump' up above the sky, flashed brighter, moved down, then, up-down, brighter, bigger, more to the right, etc.  not knowing how to use a rebel camera, took pics on auto, but flash kept flashing.  got one good pic i'm uploading with blowups.  the other night it didn't look exactly round and perhaps this is the shape?  the light under it was not visible while taking the pics--perhaps a probe?  it dimmed to nothing before she came back home and could try and get better pics.  she saw 2 other dim objects high up with binoculars shortly afterward we both saw what appeared to be a triangle, rounded edges, with 2 white lights on back, red on bottom, one flashing white light flying e silently...  all between 9:30 to 11:00pm!  weather clear & cold, no wind.  similar orange ufos on youtube video in scotland on may 11, 2009 around 10:30pm with link to tv report:

the sky got darker the object seemed both too bright and too large to be venus.  at this point i assumed it was one of the many airplanes in the phoenix sky, but quickly realized that it wasn't moving and was not in any of the usual flight paths (my apartment has a view of the south mountains and estrella range to the west and often airplane lights can be seen to the untrained eye as an arc of lights in the sky).  but this object was much different and i went to get my binoculars.  the object in the binoculars appeared to be a milky white color, luminescent, and seemed to be an upside down triangle or diamond shape.  at times there was sparkling or blinking white light on the left side of (and within) the object and then dark areas on the right center.  from my vantage point the object remained completely motionless for nearly 30 minutes and then completely disappeared when a fairly small string of clouds drifted in front of it.  two minutes later, the clouds drifted and the object was completely gone.  i had been tracking the position of the object in relation to the corner of a building in my line of vision and it did not move as a planet would.  about 15 minutes after it disappeared, a lightning stormfront rolled in from the southwest.\r\nlocal news report mentioned that 1000s of people witnessed this as far away as sedona (which would be in the correct direction from my postion).  possibly a nasa weather balloon headed to new mexico, according to the news report.  i've never seen anything like this before and i cannot explain it well enough to do it any accurate

shaped like a halloween acorn candy (yellow orange ones).\r\nit was as if it was emiting a bright white light from what i felt may have been the bottom of the craft.\r\n\r\nafter discussing the object for a moment or two she decided we needed more witnesses as noone else that we could see on the block was witnessing this.\r\nshe ran in to call her husband (a real skeptic as i found out), when he came out he immediately dismissed it as a star and we both noticed it had suddenly diminished in size, and as he walked away and laughed it off, it completely disappeared.  it did momentarily come back as a small object and then a mass of cloud covering moved in.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":16992,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.193913,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05182009-0022","longitude":-114.0438665,"occurred":1242702600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1242702600000,"summary":"Bright

arizona more towards the eastern horizon line.\r\nhe summoned me to wittness the object which appeared to be either a weather ballon or hot air ballon.\r\nthe problem with either of the obvious conclusions is that it was transparent and glowing brightly white.\r\nwhile observing the object through a pair of field binoculars we both noticed a long rope, cord or (other) hanging from beneath the object and at the very tip another object appearing to be a globe of some sort hung and glowed brightly as well.\r\ntrying to be objective, we looked for signs of a basket or holder for people if it was an air ballon but there did not appear to be any, however we did notice that there was movement in the bottom of the ballon shaped object, (inside of it in fact).\r\nwe could not determine with our glasses if it was humans or not.\r\nwhat made this sighting intresting is that there is presently a build up to the west of us, of storm clouds, this object was not drifting, not rising or descending, just hanging still in the air, we would have assumed that (if) it was an air ballon that it would have moved, but it did not.\r\nthe next assumtion, that it was a hot air ballon had already been dispelled by nothing to hold travelers beneath a flame fueled craft, if what we saw inside of the object was human air travelers then we have no idea how they fueled the craft.\r\nthe object is still in the sky at 8:26 p.M. but now only appears intermittentedly and is not visible constantly as it was before sunset.\r\nwhat it is we can not say, i have seen many u.F.O.S but nothing like this.\r\nattached is two camera phone photographs of the object which has limited blow up capabilities but when i blew them up on my computer the object actually appears to be a globe shaped object.  in fact a luminescent globe shaped object was sighted over arizona yesterday, so we don't honestly know what the dickens it was.\r\nthanks\r\nshaba","distance":"101-500

porch my wife looked towards the south west and noticed a strange color in the sky.\r\n\r\nwe thought it might be a small plane in jeopardy, mostly due to the color. we do see patterns of small planes in flight around here with the red and green lights. but this one was larger and the orange looked exactly like a flame in a campfire.\r\n\r\nas it travelled what really caused us to notice was it broke apart and a piece of the fire swung out and under, like tethered to it like in a \"c\" motion. and the smaller piece tracked with the larger. all we saw was light, no structures. the larger piece that fell under seemed to fade.\r\n\r\nas the main fireball tracked north, tiny pieces of light seemed to fall off it. like a spark or ember dropping straight down. these were extremely small, had to squint to notice. this happened at least 4 times at fairly regular intervals as it made it course.\r\n\r\nwe assumed it was a meteor or something burning up as it went across, but travelled alot slower then a shooting star. about as fast as typical plane traffic around here.\r\n\r\nwe lost sight of it as its arc in the horizon was obscured by trees. if i were to look directly south at 0' and north at 180', the course it took this is what happened. if i was to guess, looking off deck we noticed it at a 15' and then around 30' the \"c\" dropped off, 60' a ember, same at 90' 100' and lost it due to trees at 120'. the whole thing was about a minute.\r\n\r\nmy feelings were a plane in trouble. as it continued more or less straight with no dropping i thought it could be a meteor and got concerned due to imagining what size it might have been if it made impact around here. with the embers i wondered if they woudl light anything on fire, but seemed to fade out as there dropped.\r\n\r\ni don't know what it was. course was straight so maybe meterological or a plane in trouble. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
