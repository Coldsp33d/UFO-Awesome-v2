2004-2007. i live in a townhome community, and around 6pm, i walked out to the parking lot area of my home, which is approximately 25 feet from my front door. \r\n\r\ni can't explain why i looked up, but i did, and hovering what would have been very high up in the stratosphere was what appeared to be what had to be an absolutely enormous grey oval, which, from my perspective, looked to be the size of my pinkie fingernail.\r\n\r\nit was broad daylight, and the oval was illuminated on one side with the setting sun, creating what looked like a reflective stripe around the one side facing the sun. this oval was simply standing still, high above even the thin scalloped stratus clouds. even though the clouds were traveling south with the wind, the object remained perfectly stationary. this was my first clue that it wasn't some sort of weather balloon, as it would have been traveling with the clouds.\r\n\r\ni pointed the object out to my partner, who acknowledged it, and that it was unusual, and she promptly went into the house. i remained observing it.\r\n\r\ni knew it was not a weather baloon, and no idea what it was. it was clearly not an airplane, or a blimp -- if it was a blimp, it would have to be an herculean size, to be that large and above the status clouds.\r\n\r\ni remained staring at this object for at least fifteen minutes. i did not change it's movement, simply hovered while the clouds traveled beneath with the wind currents. \r\n\r\nmy then-neightbor came out of his townhome, and asked me what i was looking at, after having standing in the parking lot for so many minutes, staring at the sky. i pointed to the object, and responded that i was looking at what i thought was a ufo. \r\n\r\nhe looked up, clearly saw what i was looking at, and at first said nothing, but then said it was nothing but a weather balloon. he seemed very uneasy. i told him it could not be a weather balloon, otherwise, it would be moving with the wind currents, not standing perfectly still. he became very uncomfortable, and ran into the house. i heard his deadbolt lock. he and his family were very devout fundamentalist christians, so perhaps there was content in the discussion he was uncomfortable with.\r\n\r\nthe large dark grey oval simply stayed up there for a very ling time, around twenty minutes, until it began getting smaller, and more faint, as if it were moving upward through the atmosphere. i was finally unable to see it, as it slowly continued to retreat upward, like riding up an elevator. it never made an radical movements, nor did it move forward or backwards -- only hovered.\r\n\r\ni noted several other curious phenomenon with the same exact movements as the mysterious grey floating oval, from 2004-2007, in broad daylight, usually in evening and night times. the stationary hovering for long periods of time, and then the fading up and getting smaller, through the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nthe oval was the most pronounced shape of all, although at one other time i noticed what appeared to be a hovering cigar-shape made up of several spheres, length-wise. other times, it simply looked like a point of white light that would fade to a more red color, and fade out, as it appeared to up and through the atmopshere over a period of several minutes.\r\n\r\ni am from montana origianlly, and have seen unusual activity in the sky. however,i have never witnessed more \"obvious\" activity in the sky as to when i moved to the urban area of la. this surprises me, but perhaps, because of all the air traffic here, anything in the sky would not be so easily noticed.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

abingdon, virginia. so far, i have been unable to find these witnesses. however, several complaints were called into the local sheriff's office of a low flying jet going very fast over abingdon. this jet actually was so loud that it frightened my daughter who was outside playing at the time. i have confirmed that the jet did in fact fly over by talking to several witnesses, including my own wife. \r\n\r\nlangley afb in northern virginia directed me to mcghee tyson in tennessee. attempts to file an foia electronically have failed (email is invalid and bounced back). i will be submitting the foia via snail mail today. \r\n\r\naccording to langley and the sheriff's office in abingdon, military exercises were being conducted. i find this suspicious as i have lived in abingdon for about three years now and have never seen a military jet fly over that low. furthermore, since there is rumor of a ufo over the highlands airport, i feel this incident is worthy of further investigation. \r\n\r\nthis incident has also been picked up by jerry pippen and included on one of his recent shows - on saturday.\r\n\r\nit's worth noting that last year in abingdon there was a very significant sighting of two rectangular objects, among others, and is listed in mufon's database. this sighting took place around the same location - very close to the highland's airport.

over there behind that tree you can see something glowing. he is much taller than i am so he was able to see it, when i could not. i went out towards the alley behind my house and could see it clearer. i was not sure what it was i was seeing all i knew was that it was not a star, or a plane, or anything i have ever seen before. i then went inside my house to get my camera which is a nikon d40. i went to take pictures then i discovered i did not have my sd card in my camera so i had to go back inside and get it. i then ran back outside toward the vacant lot behind the alley. i took numerous pictures, the object in the pictures does not fully show what i saw. it was hanging in the sky to the west, it looked like a big bright ball of fire or a bright orange ball not sure which. the object seemed to stay and hover in the same spot. i was scared, and kind of excited i couldn't believe it. i continued to take pictures until the light started to fade out then fully disappeared leaving no trace behind. when i looked at the pictures on my computer i noticed when i blew them up 100% that in some of the pictures it looked like an orange cigar shaped object.

flying across the sky at super speed, but very low to the ground. it wasn't lights but more of a luminescent glow that was very dim. there was nothing flashing, no blinking lights, just the 2 glows. i couldn't really tell any shapes of a spacecraft, only the glow. they were going very close to the ground, maybe 30-50 feet up. as they passed above me, they crossed each other like they were swapping places...Right glow to the left, left glow to the right, and just speed off across the sky. they were absolutly silent as i remember hearing nothing but the grass crunching under my feet as i stared at them in awe. i've seen hundreds of airplanes cross the sky where i was, and have never seen anything that you couldn't tell was a plane by the blinking colored lights and visual shape of the plane. not to mention it was far to close to the ground.  i was very scared, heart pounding at what i was actually witnessing, but i had watch it and follow it until i could not see them any longer because i knew it was such an extraordinary event.  after they flew so far away i could no longer see them, i got very paranoid and started looking at the clock to make sure no odd/missing time had passed.  i

the afternoon. i do local freight deliveries for a living.\r\n\r\nthe weather was 72 degrees, road was dry, sky was bright nearly cloudless with clear blue sky, no haze. \r\n\r\njust past state rt 18 is the state rt 21 split where i-77 curves to the left [mileage marker 136] after which i-77 travels for a straight section about two miles long.  \r\n\r\ni had just completed the curve and was beginning this straight section eastward. naturally my point of focus is on the road and my mirrors. but in my peripheral field of view i noticed up ahead and slightly to the left of the freeway a bright spot low in the sky. it was either directly above or beyond a wooded area adjacent to i-77 known as fort island park in fairlawn.  \r\n\r\nlooking directly at it i saw the bright light to be what seemed to be shiny silver sphere.  i would say it was about one mile ahead and a hundred yards to the left of the freeway. it wasn't real large [huge] but wasn't tiny either. it was about the size of a quarter held at arm���s length.  \r\n\r\ni often drive this road between cleveland and akron. at first i thought ���that���s curious, wtf?��� my first thought was it seemed similar to and was positioned relative to the freeway to one of those aviation warning devices suspended along high tension lines seen near airport runways but those are normally bright orange. i dismissed this possibility as i knew there weren't any airports over in that area. i continued observing it noticing its reflective qualities strugling to justify what i am seeing.  \r\n\r\n then for some reason i decided what i was seeing was a blimp that just happened to be pointing directly head-on and so it would appear spherical and that any moment the blimp would deviate and i would see the normal side length appear. keep in mind that akron is home base for goodyear's blimp and it's not uncommon to see it flying up to cleveland for indian's game coverage so seeing a blimp is not unusual around here.  i stared at it for a good fifteen seconds or so. i remember saying to myself 'what is that??? what is it? it was a good distance away so detail wasn't clear but it seemed as if it was a mirror like reflective quality. i remember thinking i'll get a better idea what it is when i pass it up ahead.\r\n\r\ni looked away because i needed to checked my mirrors prior to changing lanes from center to the slower right hand lane.  after successfully changing lanes i tried to relocate the sphere it was gone.  i thought it must have moved momentarily out of sight behind an approaching tree line and i would see it in a moment passing by but it never did reappear. \r\n\r\nthe object appeared relativly stationary. i did not see it move from it's original point.  \r\n\r\n coincidentally a few minutes later when i was in central akron area there in the sky was the real blimp which is painted primarily dark blue with the word goodyear down the side. nothing close to what i saw up the road.  i realized this blimp [the real one] is much smaller than the object i���d seen earlier particularly because this blimp was closer than the object i saw previously. i knew it couldn���t have been the same object because i was going a lot faster that the blimp normally travels.  it was only when i saw the real goodyear blimp that i couldn't explain what i'd seen earlier.  \r\n\r\n

sky from my yard.  from my view the two contrails appeared to be only about 5\" long.  while i was looking at the plane and the contrails, suddenly there just appeared in mid air coming from the north a white ball traveling pretty fast.  the white ball crossed behind the plane's path about an inch (in my view) from the end of the 2 contrails from the plane. the ball was traveling in a straight line from north to south and was visible for only about 6 to 7 seconds before suddenly just vanishing.  it probably traveled about 10\" to 12\" (in my view of the sky) before disappearing.  there were a few fluffy white clouds in a different part of the sky, but none were anywhere near where i saw the ball or the plane.  the ball appeared larger than the plane.  it was cloud-colored white and was slightly smaller than an aspirin held at arm's length.  it was moving fast--much faster than the plane.  because of the height of the plane, it barely appeared to be moving at all as the ball crossed its path.\r\n\r\ni don't know what i saw, but it was round and was the color of a white cloud.  it just appeared in the sky, was traveling fast, and then just disappeared. the event lasted only seconds and it startled me to see something out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:08","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

north of moses lake, washington. we noticed an orange, circular ring making strange movements in the sky approximately two miles away at an altitude of 2 to 3 miles. the object was moving relatively fast in a zig zag at what i concidered imposible angles (some greater than 90 degrees); then the object hovered and seemed to wobble,then it moved very quickly to directly over us. looking straight up at it looked about the size of nickle held at arms length and we cound see the orange ring and three lights at the center of the circular ring that continually changed colors from red to greenish blue and a violet. we had no idea what the object was and did not become alarmed until it hovered over us. we then paniced and got on our bikes and headed back to town. the most frightening thing to me was that there was absolutely no sound.\r\nas we were leaving the area we heard the roar of the two f-86's heading straight for the object and we stopped to see what would happen. when the jets approached the object it lit up in extreme brilliance like looking at a welders torch, then it just shot of at incredible speed and left the two jets like they were standing still. the oject was over the horizon in a blinding flash. simply gone. the jets circled and returned to larson afb, i have always assumed the afb picked up the object on radar and scrambled the jets to investigate. my friend and i were shaken and afraid. i told my father (he was chief flightline inspector for the boing plant there in moses lake)and he laughed at me, i did'nt mention the event for many years for fear of ridicule (particularily back in the fifties).\r\np.S.\r\ni had a second sighting of an pulsating egg shaped object on the ground in the rolling hills of missouri at approximately 2 am while driving. it was on the other side if the freeway about 200 feet away and i could see it plainly. i stopped my car, turned out the lights to observe it and thought of going across to look closer then i became frightened and drove away. i swear the sun came up about 20 minutes later, i don,t know what happened to the time and all i remember was driving away. this was in 1974 and i was driving from new jersey to texas after my discharge from the army. i was then 33 years old. the hills there in missouri go up and down like a roller coaster; i had just topped a hill when a blinding light from the next hilltop hit me and an 18 wheeler right behind me. the light completely blinded me but it only lasted perhaps a second then switched off. the 18 wheeler did not stop and he damned near ran over me when a pulled off the interstate. if you are interested i can submit a separate report on this incident.I really want to know what really happened and what happened to the approximately 4 hours in time.\r\nsincerely,\r\n \r\npatrick d. mccabe ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then

camera. it is one of many sightings this week, here near rogers city. i have a hunting camp outside of town and have been observing ufo's for over five years here. i consider it a hot spot. the ufo in the picture was traveling east and is the brightest spot to the right in the picture. there are two other orbs of light to the left, that were not seen when i snapped the photo, only the one to the right was vilible.\r\nit flew in, powered up and continued crusing until it was out of sight. this is common here, i see them almost every night. after viewing it for maybe two minutes, we saw, what i presume was an f-16 heading toward the object. this is also very frequent. the f-16's kinda patrol a permimiter around the area of my camp all day and night. i would like to have someone with the right equipment film the sky around my camp for a few nights, if the sky is clear, i promise you will see exactly what i have been wathcing for years. please feel free to call or email me. i kinda wanna keep this under wraps until we can say for sure what's going on. because i think the airfore is involved. hope we can work together soon. the activity has really ramped up in the last week.

       i live in port melbourne. on thursday at about 0615 i saw a very strange light rather close to the earth... closer than a star but it looked like a very bright large star, more like a large light. it drew my attention as i sit outside to have my morning coffee & i had nver seen anything in that part of the sky before at that time in the morning.It was more like a  light from a helicopter but no sound & not moving (well to the naked eye that is)\r\n            i decided to try and take a photo of it, using my phone camera ( 5.1 megapixels) when i zoomed in on it was so shocked the object was multicoloured lights, oscillating, & \"morphing\" it's shape from a circle to sphere to a cylinder changing colour all the time & moving very  fast darting in & out of the camera frame. i managed to take a picture and also video it. i was recording it for over 15 minutes and was amazed at the way it was moving & the colours. the sun started to rise & the light/object seemed to move away back into the sky then suddenly disappeard very quickly as the sun was rising.\r\n                i ran back in to  the house to show my son the picture and video, the picture was there but the video would only play for acouple of seconds & then stop i had taken many clips & each clip did the same thing even though i was continuing video for many minutes at a time.\r\n                 now the really freaky part about this is later that evening i found a strange message on my phone when i picked it up saying \"remove memory card & press o.K.\" i don't have a memory card in my phone, i just pressed cancel.I contiued on keeping the kids etertained but noticed that there was a lot of static in the air i kept getting a shock from touching objects and touching the kids. i never thought anything about it at the time until the next morning when i was going to transfer the footage & pics acrosss to the pc & found that all my media photo's, video's & music had been deleted from the phone! \r\n                i tried using the camera & video player that worked fine, but when i connnected the phoneto my pc i have found that  the e drive memory is now existent now! \r\n                    i strongly feel that the sighting is connected to what happened to my phone & without wanting to sound weird it's alsmost like they didn't want me to show any anybody else although my son did see the picture initially & thought it was very \"cool\".\r\nare you able to tell me if there were any sightings at this time reported? also can you recommend someone who may be able to examine my phone. i am also hesitant to say but feel it's worth mentioning that i had a very strange dream a week earler which left me emotionally drained for days, it was very real... i was flying through the air on a triangular shaped \"surfboard\" object. however i was pulled into the air on it by a very strong force that seemed to draw me up from my abdomen area... i couldn't move or stop it. i'm not saying i was  abducted  but if was an extremely strange experience one that was so real & is vivid in my mind.\r\n                             i hopte you don't think i am strange for what i have said, but felt i needed to tell someone. thanking you. \r\n                                      your's sincerely,\r\n

kept watchinh it ,it glinted again.I assume this was because of the sun reflecting off it.It was shaped like a rugby ball.Not sharp egdes.Very smooth.It was high up ,but i couls still make out the shape easily enough.It did not make any erratic moves.Just kept goong on it way.I was buzzing at this time and was looking around for people to shput at them to watch this.My wife was in the house and she came running out and saw the object aswel.The forst thinh she said was \"is that a ufo\" i sais it sure as hell looks like one.And it was moving much to fast to be a blimp or anything like that.No way.This was an egg shaped.Rigby ball shaped craft.That was going at some very fast speedy.Its hard for me to gauge the speed but if i had to guess o would say 250 yo 300 miles an hour.That is my

it was approximately 2245, the night sky was very clear. i was facing west and scanning the sky from the south back to the west.  i watched some planes in the final approach to buffalo international airport and i was star-gazing towards the ssw-sw. when i dropped my gaze back to the horizon, i noticed a very bright red and white light. i immediately pasted it off as a plane.  it's position was approximately 200 to 240 degrees at about 10-15 degrees off the horizon.  just about the same as the planes making the final into the airport. from where i was, i figured it was over lake erie at about port colborne.\r\ni watched for movement, expecting it to continue eastward, but it didn't. it made some quick movements, like short spurts, horizontally and vertically. it remained in approximately the same general area within a degree. that's when i realized it wasn't a plane and the hair on the back of my neck rose. i kept trying to orientate the object to a stationary one on the ground (a spruce tree), but the light was very bright (in relation to the night sky) making it difficult to maintain a good point of reference.  it wasn't illuminating, just a very bright pinpoint.  i went inside to wake my brother-in-law, but i didn't, i wish now i had.  i returned outside to see if it was still there, and it was. i went back inside to get my phone to call my wife, i opened it to check the time (2254), watched about a minute of csi:ny, then returned to the porch to call her. it was gone by the time i had returned to the porch. i called my wife and told her about it. she joked they were going to come and get me. i'm fifty years old and i sort of had the heebie-geebies.\r\n\r\ni had seen another object when i was about 8 or 9 at my grandparents house in athens,texas. it was
