(by the way, we live very close to rickenbacker airport base, and there are flight pathes directly over our house, we get atleast 2-3 life flight helicopters a day, and a few fighter jets.) \r\n\r\nso, completely stunned, the first thing i want to do is tell someone what i just saw, and almost natrually i called my buddy who lives in tarlton, because he lives withen walking distance of me, so maybe he saw something too. i called him and told him what happened, then i drove to his house, and we sat outside in is backyard. we started to discuss possible explenations when the same type of triangle suddenly apperared from the east, doing the same random flashing thing the last object had done, except it seemed to slow down a couple of times and then started moving at a much faster pace. we watched it until we couldnt see it anymore as it was out of sight headed north west. we smoked a couple of cigarettes and started speculating as of what the hell we had just seen. 20 minutes passed when my friend got up to get us a couple of sodas when he blurted \"holy [cms/tg/pd]! do you see that!?\" and to the east there was a cigar shaped object slowly cruising with 3 red lights on the bottom, and 2 white lights on each end which looked to be from inside the object, sort of like observation ports that poured out light. then it zipped away at a much faster rate, atleas 4 times what it was originally going.\r\n\r\nafter a little more time had passed (this happened in less than 2 hours) we saw what looked like a blinking red light, like the kind that are on top of tall antenneaes moving from east to west slowly. it passed over us, and as it pulsed every second or so, there was a dim reflection of the object it was connected to, but it was... transparent i guess is the right word. it moved out on to the horizion to the west and started to blink more rapidly, then seemed to go down, then in a diaganial line then up and slowly faded from red to black. then 10 minutes after that there was a silver flash from the west behind some trees, and the light popped out then slowly dimmed like the red light.\r\n\r\nwe were awe struck. after it cooled down for 15 min. my friend got up and went to the bathroom, and right as he walked in a helicopter zoomed over heading south from north, flying quite low.

we've seen thousands of satelights, meteors, even a few comets, and can pick out planets, we are not mistaking these, they are some type of space crafts flying in space. we saw one, it looked just like a star, they all did, different sized stars kinda. it was moving away from us and my little brother spotted another. then we saw another on comming in, and it was moving faster, then slower (there was no wind blowing, and again, they were in space as high as the stars are), not only faster and slower, but side to side, and stoping for extended periods. we counted about 16 and they were moving all around, everywhere. then we started noticing helicopters circling the bottoms and one came around and was circling us you could see his rutter kind've turning, so i took off to leave, and when i got back to my house 3 of 4 miles back, i noticed the same helicopter was going on ahead of my house, and my little brother told me the whole time he was following us. there is crazy things

tulsa international (rwy. 18l and 18r).  i am use to seeing planes approaching to land at the airport in tulsa, but this was not an airplane about to land at the airport.  it appeared (as best i can tell) to be about 1/4 mile to my east (no way to reference this distance, just a best guess).  it had a dark outline i could not identify well, but then lit up with a very bright strip of white light on it's bottom.  the light looked a bit like the expensive xenon headlights used by teenagers in the import cars, as it was almost blue tinted a bit.  maybe like a mercury vapor light, but much brighter.  it stayed on for about 3/4 of a second and went out, then back on for about 1/4 second.  then, as it was going dark, it started moving away (appeared to be eastbound, but was hard to tell).  as soon as the lights went out, i lost sight of it's dark outline and the sighting was over.  if i were to guess, i would say this strip of light was at least 100 feet long, but i could see no real shape except that the strip of light was a straight line below a darker craft.  when i saw it i immediately got a \"fight or flight\" feeling as adrenaline surged through me and i was awestruck and scared at the same time.  i continued the drive to work (no missing time on my commute) and sent this report.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

noticed a small dark object slowly moving in the sky. we were traveling south, and the object was in the southwestern sky. at first i thought it was a single small balloon filled with helium. stopped at a light, i could see a dark object seeming to rise and move to the front right of us, between a row a trees along the road. between 30 and 45 degrees in the sky from the ground, it appeared small, only the \"diameter\" of an 1/8th of inch. it seemed to be getting closer, but there was little wind, and what wind there was was moving in the opposite direction than the object was, which kept my attention on it. it then appeared to stop and hover or stay in place, clearly a perfect circle, but completely black with no lighting to it at all, reflected or otherwise. the sky was partly cloudy, the clouds high and thin, the object definitely beneath them. the object seemed to then \"wiggle\" back and forth, at least 3 times its diameter size to either side of its \"hovering\" position, then it started moving in a completely straight line to the west, not changing in \"size\" during it's move to the west-northwest location. sometimes the object would be blocked by trees or building as we drove or stopped at lights, but a vast majority of the time the object stayed in view. it seemed to stop once or twice along its southwest to north-northwest location, again \"wiggling\" each time. it \"wiggled\" again when it finally \"stopped\" in the west-northwest location. it seemed to \"stay\" in that location, but slowly grew smaller until i lost sight of it. even though it was a small size in significance to what is usually reported, its perfectly circular black shape made it seem more like a small moving black hole in the sky, and also going against the wind, and its very strange \"wiggling\" behavior - i don't know what can can travel \"against\" wind without sound and wiggle and have no reflected nor illuminated

south on the left side of my street. \r\n\r\ni have a tendency to look up at the stars on clear nights to see if i can make out any constellations.  the skies were clear this evening.  i look up to the right and saw three stars, but then strangely, i noticed that one of the \"stars\" was moving.   the star-like object was moving east in a slow but constant speed and no sound.  slow enough for me to follow it as i walked to my house from my car.  \r\n\r\ni don't live too far from o'hare airport so i see a lot of planes come and go all the time.  so when i saw this object moving slowly across the sky with no flashing lights like commercial airlines do...Then i knew this was not something normal.  in fact, as i was walking a plane happened to fly accross (going east)and that confirmed my suspicions.  the glowing star-like object seemed to be higher and moving slower than the plane. \r\n\r\nas i was getting closer to my house i was loosing sight of it because by this time it was over my head and descending east...So i was able to catch a glimpse through the spaces between houses.  by the time i got the alley next to my house i turned around and looked east and saw that the object curved and continued going in a northeast direction.  after that i lost sight of the object.  \r\n\r\ni was in awe of what i was seeing that it didn't dawn on me to record it.  all i had with me was my phone, but even then i don't think my camera phone would have picked up something so high up in the dark sky.\r\n\r\ni didn't what to make of what i saw.  i didn't say anything and thought maybe it's just my imagination, but it's been eating at me ever since just because i've never seen anything like it in my life.  i just don't know how one would explain what i saw especially when it was moving slower than a plane in a slow and steady pace.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was visiting kennedy space center as a chaperone helping with a group of school kids on a field trip.  this was 2 days after the recent launch of the space shuttle.  after visiting kennedy space center we had taken the kids to the beach at a state park in the city of cape canaveral. we arrived at the beach at around 2:20-2:30pm or so.  i had taken my binoculars so i could keep a eye on the kids on the beach.  i had also taken a digital camera to take pictures on the trip.  while sitting in a chair on the beach watching the kids in the water at about 2:50pm i looked up in the sky and noticed a small shining object that appeared to be very, very high up. the object was straight up over me at about 11:15-11:30 o'clock position as i faced east toward the beach.  i first thought it was a jet flying very high, but after a few moments i realized the object was not moving, or if moving, moving very, very slow.  i looked at it through my binoculars and the object was still very small even when looking at through the binoculars. even though small, i could make out a shape.  the object was whitish in color and was circle shaped.  there appeared to be a very,very thin faint layer of a dark color around the outer edges of the circle.  it appeared a little thicker on the side away from the sun, but this dark layer may have been as a result of a visual illusion.  also it  appeared that on the top there was a faint image of something protruding up away from the main body of the object, however, i can't be sure here.  it was too hard to see any specifics other than the obvious circle shape and whitish color. i looked at it for a minute or so trying to see if i could make out what it was.  it just sat there.  i then set my binoculars down and picked up my digital camera to try and take pictures of it. the object was so tiny in the sky it took me a moment or two to find it again.  this happened each time i took my eyes off it. once i found it again, i tried to get it in my view finder of the camera, but it was so small i could not make it out through the camera.  so i started taking pictures blind just guessing when to take the picture. i would take a couple of pictures then put the camera down and look at it again through the binoculars.  it stayed the same shape, color and size.  for about 10 minutes i would take a couple of pictures then look at it through the binoculars, take more pictures and look through the binoculars again.  i then alerted the teacher and a couple of the other parents about the object.  they each saw it and wondered what it was.  i asked the teacher, who had a 35mm camera with a telephoto lenses, to see if she could find it in her view finder and take some shots of it.  i then sat back down in my chair and continued to look at it with my binoculars. i knew the resolution of my digital camera was set on the lowest resolution and i wanted to set it on the highest resolution for a better image.  i did not know how to change the resolution on my camera so i called a friend who owned a similar camera and asked how to change the resolution.  my phone records indicated that i made this call at 3pm.  he told me how to changed the resolution and i did it while on the phone with him.  after changing the resolution i took a few more pictures.  since i could not tell if i was getting the object in the picture or not i zoomed in and out taking pictures hoping i would get lucky and get a clear close-up shot while shooting blind, but zoomed out so to make sure i covered a large area to make sure it was in a shot.  while i was taking pictures with the higher resolution, an elderly lady came up to me and said she had been watching me and wanted to know what i was looking at and taking pictures of.  i told her it was a very small object that looked similar to the size of a large star.  i tried to show her, but she gave up quickly and said \"if you say so, i can't see it\" and left. i then looked at the teacher to see what she was doing and she had sat her camera down and was looking at the kids in the water.  i asked her if she had taken photos of it and she said she could not find it in her camera.  i asked her if i could try and she said \"sure, but the camera does not focus on its own\".  i got her camera and sat back down and tried to find the object in the view finder of her camera. it was at this moment that i noticed that the object had been moving.  it was now at about a 11:45 position.  i had a point of reference because i had been laying me head back on the back rest of the chair each time i took a picture or look at the object with binoculars. now as i laid my head on the back of the chair i had noticed i had to look more straight up.  the object had been moving to the west inland and a little south, but mostly west.  there were several thunderstorms around on the north and south of me and they all were moving to the east.  this made me decide that the object was not a weather balloon for if it was it would also have been be moving east. after working with the 35mm camera for a minute or so, i was able to find the object for a second in the view finder, but it was blurry and moving around a lot in the view finder and hard to hold within the view finder.  i then decided to pre-focuse the camera so all i had to worry about was finding the object in the view finder and taking the picture without having to worry about focusing.  i decided to focus on a boat way off in the distance which best represented the size of the object. this took only 10-15 seconds to do.  i then looked back up and tried to find the object again, but it was gone.  while looking around to find it again, after a few seconds a commercial jet appeared from behind my left shoulder going east in the direction of and nearing where the object had been. however, the path of the jet took it a little to the left(north) of where the object was.  after looking for the object for a few more moments and not being able to see it i then tried to take pictures of the commerical jet for a reference point in case i did get pictures of the object and for and additional proof.  i put down the 35mm camera and tried to take pictures of the jet with my digital camera, but like the object, i unable to find the jet in my view finder. i took a couple of photos anyway again guessing where to shoot.  the jet did not appear to be at a high cruise altitude, in fact, i thought it may be still climbing. it was not leaving a trail.  i actually thought the object was much higher than this jet, but can't say for sure.  the smallness of the object may have played tricks on me. shortly after trying to take pictures of the jet i looked at the cell phone clock and it was 3:19pm.  the object did not re-appear.  i kept looking until we left the beach and the park at 3:39pm.\r\n\r\nthe day was partly cloudy with scattered thunderstorms around. in the area of the object the sky was 95% blue with a very small amount of very thin clouds.\r\n\r\nafter uploading the digital pictures i was disappointed to see that i had only one image showing the object.  amazingly it was the very first picture i took.  i missed the jet all together.\r\n\r\nat some point, but i can't tell you precisely when in this outline, i looked at my cell phone to record a time as to when i was seeing the object and it was 3:11.\r\n\r\nwhile typing this i had the thought that this object may indeed be a weather balloon that nasa sets lose prior to a launch to check the weather. however, two things cause me to cancel this thought. 1) the object moved west when thunderstorms were moving east. 2) after my looking at the object for over 25 minutes, the object disappeared in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\ni wish i had been looking at the object when it disappeared to see if it zipped off or just vanished in thin air.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

the object came within 1 ft of me.  my eyes only gazed at the closed door for a second and since there was nothing to see, my eyes returned to the center (normal position).  then, to my surprise, the orange ball streaked back in the opposite direction (to my left going west to east) toward the bathroom window.  again it went so fast that my eyes couldn���t follow it.  i looked to my left and it was gone. \r\nthe incident shook me up. i have to admit that i was frightened and shaking for a few minutes. i immediately went to the bathroom window and looked down and up.  there was no one down below, all the surrounding buildings were only one story, (so no one from another building could be playing a prank on me with a laser pointer), and there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky above. i left the bathroom and looked around the apartment and noticed that all the the windows had the drapes closed. i immediately ran outside the building and looked around.  no one was there.  i wanted to knock on doors and ask neighbors if they saw anything, but i stopped myself.  i would have made a fool out of myself.  \r\ni calmed myself down, i had a busy day of work ahead of me.  i tried to convince myself that i was just seeing things that weren���t really there (an optical illusion or a malfunction of my optic nerve, or brain).  but, the fact that the object came back and went the other way made me think it was real.  still, to this very day i refuse to speculate on what it could have been.  the only thing i know for sure,is it did occur, and i try not to think about it.  i am only writing this down for my own notes about life.  about how things happen to people that can���t be explained.\r\ni had this same bazaar experience a few weeks later, while i was walking out of my bedroom  in the hall between the bathroom, bedrooms and living room.  the orange ball flashed by me at about shoulder height. i can���t remember the exact direction it came from, but i do remember it was a different direction than the event in the bathroom.  i don���t remember if it went in front of me and then came back the other way as it did in the bathroom.  it occurred at about the same time (around 10:00 am).  the hall was dimly lit as all the drapes were closed.  i was the only one home.  i was startled but not as scared as the previous time.  i looked around inside and outside the apartment as and found no one or nothing out there.  \r\ni even went to get my eyes checked after these experiences.  the doctor told me that a detached retina would be a blinding flash of white light over my entire visual field.  so this anomaly was not caused by a detached retina.  i don���t fantasize or make up stories to entertain myself so this was not the result of that.  in fact, i wish i had not experienced these events. nevertheless, it did open my mind to the possibility that there are things going on around us that we may not be totally aware of.\r\nnothing like this ever happened to me before or since then.  it has been more than ten years since i observed this anomaly.  i was too busy to write down what happened at that time and i really shouldn���t be taking the time to write about it now.  i didn���t want to scare my wife, so i didn���t tell her what happened until a month later.  i just wanted to know if she had encountered anything like this.  she told me she had not seen or heard anything unusual.  at first she thought i was joking, but when she realized i was serious, she became frightened.  i calmed her down by telling her since nothing bad had happened to us, there was nothing to worry about.  this experience, changed the way i look at the real world.  it made me ask myself many questions:\r\n���\twhat if the orange ball that flashed past me would have me hit me?  would it have damaged my body?  what if it had already hit me on another occasion and i didn���t know it?\r\n���\twhy did i see it?  (i do not believe i was chosen to see it, or there was a message to me in seeing it, i think it was just a random event) why did it flash by and then come back the way it came?  why did i experience this anomaly twice?  it is pointless to speculate on the causes of this anomaly, so i try to put it out of my mind, but something tells me i should record these events.\r\n���\thave other people encountered anything like this?\r\n���\twhat other things are going on that people observe, but dismiss them as illusions, or say to themselves, ���what i just saw couldn���t have happened, so i must be seeing things.��� or people might think to themselves, ��� it didn���t really happen, so i should just forget about it.  i better not tell anybody else about it, because they will think i am weird or crazy.���\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

up in the sky. it was just past dusk so it was what i consider dark outside and there were a few low clouds above me at that time. i gazed to the wsw and noticed an unusually bright white-bluish light traveling eastward. it was not a plane of any kind, or a helicopter or blimp. it was not a balloon, it was its own light source. it made no noise. i followed it as it skimmed a cloud, it was very slightly obscured but it did not have any directional beam of light. what i mean is when airline lights hit clouds or fog, you can see the beam of the light. with this object there was no beam visible. there were no other visible lights and no blinking lights. the object did not change shape as it passed over. it was simply a very very bright whitish blue light flying below the cloud ceiling silently from west to east and i watched it until it went behind the tree line out of my line of vision. i do live in flight paths of commercial , oregon air guard, and private small aircraft. i live east of the portland international airport (pdx) and east of the troutdale airport for many years and i am very familiar with the aircraft and air traffic patterns in my area and this was out of the norm of anything i am used to hearing or seeing. i have never seen anything like it in my life. it was not a celestial event or anomaly either. the speed was fairly slow i cannot even guess how fast it was flying, and i do not know if anyone else witnessed either. from when i first saw the object it was the same and did not change, the light remained constant. i could not distinguish any shape. this object was brighter than anything else i have ever seen in the sky. it was not a flare of any kind. it was its brightness and the color of the light that made me notice it, it stuck out and immediately i knew it was something unusual that i had never seen before. my feelings and thoughts were,\"[cms/tg/pd], what is that?! figure's no one is here to examine it with me and my camera is
