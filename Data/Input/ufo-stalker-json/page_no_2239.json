approximately 7:30 pm.  the flight was not consistent with any aircraft i'm familiar with.  it was slow and methodical, and in the distance.  it appeared to be 2000-4000 feet in altitude, approximately as large as a 2 story house, and appeared to change shape either by rotating or turning over somehow.  i also caught about 4 minutes of video tape; of which about 10-15 seconds are pretty compelling that what i saw is simply unexplained.  here is a brief description of the events:\r\n\r\n\tat about 7:30 pm on 5/10/09 i had just finished cleaning up from a massive mother's day feast that i had prepared.  i stepped outside on my back porch for some fresh air, when i noticed a very small object in the sky.  i first thought it was a high flying plane at 50,000 feet which sometimes fly overhead.  then i realized that it was overcast, and that i couldn't possibly see that high.  after reasoning about the cloud cover i thought the object to be around 2000-3000 feet high.  since then i have learned that the cloud cover was at 7000-8000 that night, so the object was definitely under that ceiling.  my initial thoughts of 2000-3000 feet may be correct, but not for certain.    \r\n\r\n\tright after i realized that is was moving too slow for a normal aircraft at that altitude so i called for my girlfriend to come and take a look.  she thought it was odd as well, and i asked her to rush to get the video recorder.  we started shooting the object, and was initially very hard to get into focus as our zoom was at 35 xs and was in auto focus mode.  so if we moved just slightly, or caught the top of a tree, or had a bird fly right by it would keep auto focusing and then blur out the object.  \r\n\r\n\tonce we fiddled through it for a minute or two, we got the hang of it, and were able to capture several distinctly different shapes not visible with the naked eye.  one was a diamond, one looked like a slightly elongated football, and one like a top with some sort of antennae protruding from the top half of the shape.  there was only one object, but was either turning or rotating to create these different shapes.  the video we have is shaky, showing the object to dart around, but in reality it was moving in a straight line, and our zoom at 35 xs and our shaky hand is the cause for the appeared erratic motion of flight.  \r\n\r\n\tthe flight of the object was in the southern sky headed due north.  as it came north, it seemed to drop in altitude.  then it went 45 degrees ne, and then headed due east.  as it headed east it appeared to ascend. at various times it appeared to have some sort of halo or ring around the entire object; either from air displacement or something else.  it made no noise, and there were other aircraft in the sky that were farther away and closer that were making noise.  the whole event from start to finish lasted roughly 7-10 minutes, and we have roughly 4-5 minutes of video.  there are about 15 seconds of very compelling shots of an object that i've never seen before.  \r\n\r\n\ti'm about as well versed in military aviation as a private citizen can be, as i'm fascinated with the military channel, the discovery channel, and the history channel.  this was not a b2, a f117, f22, or an f35.  i have seen all of them on numerous shows, and i can't see how any of the shapes i saw on the video could be one of those aircraft. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tlastly, after my story aired on some local news stations here in town, a gentleman contacted me via fax with some sketches he drew after a sighting with him and his girlfriend on june 20th 2007 at approximately at 7:50 pm.  when i saw the fax it was clear that the images were very similar though he didn���t have a video or a picture.  i contacted him and he came to my office to hear my story.  when he showed up, we talked for a bit.  he seamed genuine in nature, and as he was telling me his story, i quickly realized the similarities to my event.  the object seemed to change shape on an axis, there were at times a blur or a ring around the object obscuring the air around the object, that it moved slowly and deliberately across the sky changing altitude, and that it matched no aircraft he had ever seen either in shape or flight characteristics.  he explained that when he called his girlfriend into the room to see the story on tv she immediately said, ���that���s it������  although he saw most of the object with the naked eye, it was closer to him than for me, as i wouldn���t have been able to decipher the shapes with my naked eye.  only with the use of my camera with the zoom all the way at 35 xs was i able to clearly see the shape of the object.  in telling me his story, i could see he felt vindicated of sorts, and was very interested in seeing where this went.  he said with almost 99% certainty that we saw the same object...\r\n\r\n\ti can send a still picture, and i'm truly writing to see if we can get any type of explanation of what we saw, or if you could shed some light into where we could go for help.  \r\n\r\nthanks for your time, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16906,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6350825,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05132009-0006","longitude":-90.1963742,"occurred":1242009000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,

amber/orange, size of a big pea at arms length, kinda round , \"light\" caught our eyes in patio window on left of tv.  as we ran out patio door onto deck, (grabbing the camcorder and waiting for the dang thing to boot up) we could see was headed ene in silent, constant speed, no flashing lights.  in fact, the light it was emitting was constant, glowing--not super bright, not exactly round, blurry like.  i noticed that it did not move in a straight line, more of a slight snake-like wiggle as it moved.  as it continued on it's path, it dropped down behind the trees at edge of the yard--fiancee said he thought he saw a smaller one with it (behind the trees by now and falling) said, \"it's gonna crash, it looks like\", as he supposed it would come in contact with the ground at that point, but i think perhaps it was an illusion caused by the arc-like trajectory.  tried to video it, but even on 'nightshot' the cheap sony camcorder only has a black screen--so all you'll get from it is me

and its moving really fast. so i stare at it neglecting my dog and i see this streak of light come off of it, then im like \"alright what am i looking at?\" so the thing that came off of it disappeared, and i continued looking at the fast moving light. and im like \"no this has to be a plane, and the setting sun is reflecting light off of it\". ya know? trying to be rational =p. and as it passes over head, i listen close and i hear no sound at all. then i see something else in the sky (the sun is still making a small amount of light on the horizon) and i quickly realize \"oh its just a plane.\"....\"oh its a plane!!\" because there was no light \"reflecting\" off of it. so i look back at this bright [cms/tg/pd] light and its been about 30 seconds since it had passed over head and seemed to be quite a distance away from where i was standing. and still i head no sound other than the plane that had also just passed over.(( the distance and angle between the two objects allowed me to discern which sound would have come from which object. its kind of hard to explain due to \"no pictures\".)) but taking into consideration that planes usually fly about 40000ft, the object i was looking at was well over 60000. i came to this conclusion because i compared their overall size to the size of the stars as they passed. its a rough guess, but its as good as i could do.

\r\nexcept the lights never got bigger as if it were getting closer. it just stayed in the same place for about 30 seconds or so. i don't know how long it was there to begin with but i felt like it knew i was watching it. very quickly the bright lights seemed to dim into much smaller ones with soft blue lights in between and a bright almost neon green aura around it( it maybe 1 craft or two and one just turned off it's lights.They were so bright i could not tell if the smaller one was there before.) it was circular with one large middle light that was white, and two smaller lights on either side of it that had a bluish tint then two more smaller white lights on the outer edge. the green aura looked like it just outlined the craft and was pulsating or glowing. the rest was black. it looked like the lights were rotating(i drew pictures hopefully i can upload by the end of the week) it moved at a snails pace toward the river to the west. i watched it for at least a full minute before it just seemed to disappear. i looked around for it because i know that planes can't do that, so it had to go somewhere. as i looked around i saw a single tiny red dot hovering at least 75ft over the river behind my apartment directly under the moon. it stayed there motionless so i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but there was no reflections of anything red coming from inside my apartment. anyway i watched it for maybe 15-20 seconds then all of a sudden it went straight up in the air! slowly at first then faster. it stopped right dead center of the moon then came flying right over my apartment. these objects made no sound! it was early in the evening so the moon was still pretty low, it was also a very clear night no clouds in the sky at all.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":16893,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3061725,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05122009-0010","longitude":-71.7700885,"occurred":1241669700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Hampshire","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Flash,  Star-like,  Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1241669700000,"summary":"Three bright lights just above the tree line and smaller object with lights and green halo.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Littleton, New Hampshire","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:231985"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Sedona","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Hi,\r\n\r\n the photo was taken a couple of weeks ago from the breakfast area of the king's ransom hotel in sedona, az at 9:11am on 5/1/09.  i have to say that it was taken through a window(dark spots, most visible in the sky area, are dirt from window), but there were no lights on inside the room to cause a reflection that results in the bright \"objects\" seen in the sky area of the photo.\r\nadditional things to take note of when viewing this photo are:\r\n \r\n-slight cloud cover that day/overcast\r\n \r\n-taken with an iphone, which is only 2 mega pixels(but almost 200 additional pictures were taken with the same phone on this trip and none resulted in any light objects/artifacts that are seen in the sky on this photo) **also, one of the benefits of the phone is that it captures crucial meta data(i.E. date, time, location etc..) within the file, which can be viewed by right-clicking(on pc) properties/summary.\r\n \r\n-also important to note that i did not see these objects with the naked eye at the time the photo was taken.  i was only when i looked at them a couple of days later that i noticed them.  obviously had i seen them, i would have more to share because i would keep clicking until i ran out of storage.\r\n \r\nlet me just say that i am still not sure what they are, and am a bit of a skeptic, but this definitely got me thinking and i would be interested to see other people's take on it.  if they are ufos, they seem to be in a similar formation/pattern as many of the other pictures taken in the arizona skies and all over the world.  this seems like a very good forum on this and would like to see if there was anyone else in the sedona area that day that witnessed, or have pictures, of this as well.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16891,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.8751395,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05122009-0008","longitude":-111.7597096,"occurred":1241194260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1241194260000,"summary":"Picture taken of mulitple objects in sky over sedona 5/1/09.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16891_submitter_file1__UFOsPicAZ.TRIP.SEDONA.2009146.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Sedona, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:231986"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Rochester","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving a client home at 7:48pm tonight. (monday, may 11, 2009.)we were about to stop for a red light when i looked at my dashboard clock. it was 7:48pm.I was early getting this client home. i'm always checking out the skies whenever i stop the car. we had beautiful skies all day long and i took notice of it. at the time of this event, the sky had several flat, wispy clouds in the south western sky. as we stopped for the red light, i had a clear view of the sky and looked up. we were stoped at the traffic light at the corner of browncroft blvd and winton road, rochester, ny,  we both saw a plane in the distance taking off from the rochester airport, low in the sky, ascending upward and flying slightly south-easterly, turning more easterly and starting to climb to cruising altitude. i said to arlene, my passenger, \"i wonder where they're going at 8 o'clock at night?\"  i then felt the \"need\" (urge) to look above and to the right of that airplane, where i saw a large bright round ball of light come right out of the clouds very abruptly, heading north-easterly and moving fast. it was moving about one and half times faster then the airplane. it was heading to what looked like the same direction of the airplane, but a bit more south-easterly. (if the ball of light had continued in that direction, in a very short time it would have been parallel to the plane, but at a higher altitude. at first i thought it was another airplane coming in for a landing from the south, and that the setting sun was hitting it and lighting it up to look like a ball of light. it didn't act like a regular airplane though, so i held my hands up to it and closed both thumbs and both index fingers together to form a circle, and it was about that size and round, like a bright ball. i asked arlene if she could see it and she said no, because there was a tree across the street in her sight of vision. just as i asked her that question, the ball stopped dead and turned sharply at a right angle to its left, my right(westerly). i watched it head west for several seconds at a very high rate of speed, and then it just blinked out against a clear blue sky. it did not go into any clouds, as there were no clouds in that area of the sky, just blue and clear as it just blinked out.  it just disappeared. the traffic light changed and i drove forward about 2 blocks and pulled into a driveway on my right. i looked up, but could not see anything in the sky.  had it been another airplane it would still be in the clear sky and visible by then on a sideways angle without sunlight on it. it would have been visible in the shape of a regular airplane. i have witnessed airplanes do this many times over monroe county during a setting sun. (a bright light, which turns back into the shape of the airplane after the airplane turns to head to the airport.) i scanned the south-westerly sky all around the area of the first sighting and to the right and nothing was visible except the original plane, on my left, still heading easterly and climbing slightly. this whole event probably took one and a half minutes. by it's actions and speed, i feel this could have been a ufo. i sent a personal email and copy of this report to mr. james bouck, jr., new york state director of mufon and he asked that i send it to you, also.  you may contact me, however, i will be away may 15-22. end of report. \r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":16890,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.16293,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05122009-0007","longitude":-77.6035719,"occurred":1242096480000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1242096480000,"summary":"Large, bright ball, appeared at high speed from sm. cloud, shot off and blinked out.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Rochester, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:231987"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Highland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Object viewed on tv:\r\nurl removed to investigators field cms flg 08/07/2011 18:55 cst\r\n\r\nwanted only to bring this to mufon's attn. i am not a witness. this happened in west-central, il. which, as i'm sure mufon knows, is a hotbed.
