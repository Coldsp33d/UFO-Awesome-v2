halfway dosing off laying on a bench and stuff for 2~3hours.    opening and closing my eyes  probably was looking up for least 1 hour.  loosey hoping and expecting to see a star ship at some point.    then i saw a orb that looked like a yellowish organe like a incadencent lightbulb.    slowly turn on in the sky over about 4 seconds then about 5x faster fade away. it slowly dirfted to the north and then vanished left 2 right in my vision perspective.  i think around 5,000 feet above me .  could be abit off didn't really have much reference points but thats what i think it was.  \r\nthe orb wasn't that large just i think around the size of a small private jet but course there muti-dimensional so the light  might not even be coming from a craft with any physciality at all.\r\nbasically it looked like a varying brightness mini similar verison of the sun but more oragney. like 2x more\r\n\r\n\r\nwas pretty cool but was so brief and not all that remarkable i didn't really feel much sides oh thats pretty cool.  yawn   \r\ndidn't mention it to anyone for couple days at least then told my friend i went there with jaye who's seen stuff like that b4 who thought it was cool.\r\ni lost sight of it because it dimmed it's light competly and im not sure how to remote view yet and also didn't understand telepathy then either so.  \r\n\r\nlooked  like some super dark orb craft ,barely visible if it all  or similar shape created the light around itself probably some qunatum technology.  \r\nalso the light grew with the intensity and then shrank with it turning back off.  to  probably 8x~10x size of orginal object or craft then back into nothing may have seen some sort of super dark orb like craft  for split second b4 that faded after light was almost off or off.\r\n\r\nalso i know a guy

to where they were i couldn’t see them anymore. \r\n\r\nthe cloud seem to stay there for a while which i found strange and maybe even thought something was behind the cloud like a mother ship using a

1960’s. i was probably about 15 or 16 years old at the time. i don’t remember wearing a heavy winter coat so i believe this happened during a fair weather month. probably autumn.\r\n\r\ni lived on richmond avenue in colonial heights, virginia, about half a block east of the boulevard. \r\n\r\nwhen i saw the object in the sky i called two neighbor kids out to watch it with me. the sighting was in early evening probably around 7 or 8 o’clock. in any event it was not long after dark.\r\n\r\nthe entire time period of the sighting lasted for about 20 to 30 minutes. the object appeared to be a very bright star approximately east northeast of the intersection of richmond avenue and the boulevard. at the time i believed the bright light to be over the fort lee airstrip. however, there was no way of knowing just how far or near the object was. also, there was no sound.\r\n\r\nthis is an account of what we saw:\r\n\r\nthere was a very bright light that looked exactly like a star in the sky. as time passed a small light slowly left the bright light and appeared to come forward and to the right side of the main light. after a minute or two, another small light slowly left the object and came forward and to the left side of the main object. this continued until there were about 11 objects in the sky. when each light left the main light, the main light lost some of its brightness. at the point where all the small lights were in the sky, the main light was no brighter than the smaller objects. after a minute or two, the small lights slowly went back and joined the main object. it was almost as if they went back exactly in reverse of how they came away from the main object. eventually all the small lights rejoined the main light and as each one rejoined the main light, the main light became brighter until it was very bright again. then the object moved away in an easterly direction until it became so dim that it disappeared from sight. \r\n\r\nthe only way i can imagine anyone duplicating what we saw would be if they lined up eleven helicopters in a line east to west. then turned on their searchlights. then kept the front of each helicopter facing west, then left the line one at a time and moved away from the line. then hovered for about a minute after all the other helicopters moved out to take similar positions. then moved back into formation without turning around. then backed away until they went out of sight.\r\n\r\nlikely? i think not.\r\n\r\nwas this a ufo? i don’t know, but i cannot explain what we saw in any logical way. as far as i’m concerned, it was a ufo and because of it i find it easy to believe others when they say they have seen a ufo.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,
