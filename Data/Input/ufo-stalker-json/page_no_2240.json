room, which is in the attic. i have some sky light windows, and one of the blinds was open. i normally look out the window, and i literally looked up and there were at least 10 bright orange/white lights..Moving in the same direction (from west to east) coming over my house. i'd never seen anything like this and it really did quite frighten me. straight away i knew this was definitely not right or normal. i knew they were not aircraft (well at least not conventional aircraft). i just quickly  grabbed my camera phone in an attempt to prove to people what i was witnessing. i then opened my window and proceeded to record the lights. i could see more of them coming up from behind the trees in the distance, and all following the same path. i noticed other people walking on the street, who were also witnessing what i was seeing. i started to shout across the street to them and they were as confused and amazed as i was. the lights just kept coming from over the distance and i was pretty concerned as to when or if they were going to stop. as soon as some disappeared, more would re-appear and keep coming over in the same direction. it looked as if they were following one another. they were making no noise, i could hear no aircraft noise and they were moving at a constant speed, but not too fast. i live on a busy main road, and people in their cars were stopping and pulling over to get out and watch them too. about 4 cars stopped along with some other pedestrians and people from the pub across the street. we all witnessed them for about 10 minutes, and more just kept coming. as i saw them heading over the top of my house, i rushed to the back window, which looks out over the city centre. i saw some of the lights moving into each other and then they would just disappear slowly. this happened for at least 15 minutes. the sky was pretty clear, i could see the moon in the south and i could also see stars, but these were definitely not stars. a couple of minutes after all of them had gone, i saw an airplane of some sort flying over in a non conventional flight plan in the direction of the city centre. as i am aware of where the flight paths are for commercial airlines and this plane was pretty low, my thought is maybe it was military. i'm have never seen lights like these, but they did seem to be glowing exceptionally bright and i noticed they were kind of flashing in an orbital fashion. we are quite near the peak district, and i thought maybe it was military, but i don't understand why they would do such an exercise over such a big city, quite early at night when people are bound to see. i'm not sure if they were alien, but at first it certainly scared me, as this wasn't your average light in the sky.\r\n\r\non another note, i have witnessed similar bright white orange lights from my window in the attic that seemed to move across, hover, then just simply disappear. this was about a few months prior to the sighting i had on the 9th of may. another person i know has also witnessed strange glowing hovering lights in the same area.\r\n\r\nit's all very strange.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

the object retained its spherical appearance. then i thought it was either a child's balloon, or maybe a plastic bag, but then i noticed it was moving in a random fashion *against* the prevailing winds. the clouds above it (i would estimate at 6000 feet) were moving from the ne to the sw, but this object was moving in a generalne direction.\r\n\r\ni called my partner who spotted it after a few seconds.\r\n\r\ni was still trying to make out if it was in fact a weather balloon (i've seen those before, i know what they look like), when i noticed a 2nd, identical white spherical opject, moving a dead-straight line from the sw to the ne. this object had the identical appearance to the first, but it was moving like a satellite - like it was on rails. it too was beneath the clouds, and moving in the opposite direction to that which the clouds were blowing.\r\n\r\nfor a moment i wondered if i was possible seeing the iss or something like that, but i immediately dismissed that as the object wasn't reflecting light or giving off any light of its own, and besides it was beneath the clouds too.\r\n\r\ni was excited, and torn between going inside to get my camera, or staying and watching. i regret that i decided to stay and watch.\r\n\r\nthe second, straight-moving object continued on its ne track and was soon obscured by the roof of the building, and i didn't see it again. in all, it was visible for about 15-20 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe first object continued on its slightly random, bobbing course, but definitely moving to the ne too. it bobbed and floated against the clouds, and eventually it too was gone over the roof of the building in the same direction as the 2nd object, and i didn't see it again either.\r\n\r\ni talked to my partner about this sighting, and he also said that he was very puzzled by it; he too didn't think it was a bird, or a balloon. he really thought it was man-made, but he couldn't explain why there were no wings or blades or any feature at all on the objects - he agreed with me that they appeared perfectly spherical.\r\n\r\ni estimate the clouds were at about 6000 feet, and the objects were beneath the clouds, perhaps at 5000 feet. from their apparent size, i would guess that on the ground they might be the size of a small car, no bigger.\r\n\r\nthe objects appeared completely featureless; no marks, no lights, no appendages of any kind that i could see. if i didn't know the were moving against the wind, i would immediately surmise they were white balloons, like weather ballons.\r\n\r\ni know that there are different wind directions at different altitudes, but i'm sure these 2 objects were at the same altitude, and yet their movements were so different; one bobbing and floating, and the other absolutely dead-straight, steady speed.\r\n\r\nalthough puerto del carmen is quite close to ariciefe international airport, and there was constant air-traffic througout our stay, i didn't see any other aircraft in the sky at the time of the sighting.\r\n\r\ni ocaisionally do some backyard astronomy from my home in ireland, and i've seen satellites, i've seen weather balloons, and once before, in the early 1990s i watched what i thought was a satellite moving in a slow track over my house; abruptly stop; describe a neat circle anti-clockwise, then extremely rapidly shoot off in the opposite direction from which it came, clearing the horizon in about 20 seconds.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":16869,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-13.88904,"location":null,"logNumber":"ES-05112009-0004","longitude":-63.876949,"occurred":1240872600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Beni","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240872600000,"summary":"2 small white spheres travelling in the same direction, against prevailing winds.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/Dublin","timeZoneName":"Europe/Dublin","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Puerto del Carmen, Beni","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:232038"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Jacksonville Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We had just finished having dinner and went to this out door bar to enjoy the ocean air.  we had just found a table to sit at, and at exactly 11:29pm (may 11th, 2009i noticed a eraser sized, white/yellowish object moving in the sky.  my seat was facing west, my back against the beach. \r\n\r\nmy friend brent and robert were also at the table...Robert didn't see the object, but brent did (he was facing in a general sw direction).  my first reaction, i looked at robert...Brent's reaction was the same....Then we looked at each other and saw the look on each others face.  then we looked around, and it was as if no one saw anything.\r\n\r\nit was quite the experience....And we were just amazed that we saw it.  also, it was as if we were the only ones to see it.  and, to guess at how the object moved, i would have to use the coast line as a reference.  with this, it made a \"less than symbol\" zag and then changed direction again, and shot off in a general nw or wnw direction, and then was instantly gone.  \r\n\r\nto answer another question...In terms of what we thought when we saw it, we were both very amazed.  in my own mind, i've never really seen any evidence first hand....So now that i've seen it, i'm sure its a technology that isn't of this world, and/or that hasn't yet been released. \r\n\r\nalso in regards to my first reaction to this light was it's size and brightness.  it was very much larger than any stars, and very much brighter than anything, but the moon.  its speed amazed me very much.  its agility surpasses anything i could even imagine we (as a world community) has ever developed.\r\n\r\nand lastly, 'how we lost the object' was after it changed direction (the last time)....It seemed to just to accelerate and fade away.  \r\n\r\nunfortunately we have no pictures, it happened way too fast for us to react other than just seeing it.

tail so it wasnt stuff burning in the atmosphere and there was no apparent structure to it at all if you would like the video just email me and also it seemed rely high in the air like it was a satellite thats the only thing i havent rulled out but satellites dont change direction ass much as this thing did or make s shape patterns in the sky at least i dont think they do but i dont have the direction change in the video a just have it heading of into the distance and u cant rely see that \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

have a clear view of the city lights of phoenix).What actually drew me to the object is because i had seen it in roughly the same part of the sky the previous night,\r\non that night,(may 8th)i watched it hover and pulse vibrantly on the horizon for about an hour or two. in that time frame i saw 20+ planes(mostly non comercial or helicopters)  fly past it, near it, or circle it,\r\ni watched it for what seemed like ages and it progressively got dimmer as if it was flying away tremendously slow and eventually dissapeared...Thats how my may 8th sighting ended...,also i want to include a strange phenomenon i experience...When i tried to take a picture of it,first i was struck with its appearence what to me looked like one ball of light pulsing green and blue and red appeared in my cameras viewfinder as a string of 5-6 seperate lights that would flicker on and off dimming out and back on in seperate seemingly undetermined intervals with very little color (occasional pulsations of vibrant blues greens and red)i could not photograph this object,i took pictures of my house and the sky elsewhere to verify my camera was working and still could not get a picture of it.But anyways,today i was watching the same light as it hovered there barely moving just like before,pulsing vibrantly just like before, but this time i ran and grabbed my binoculars,\r\nwhen i looked at it in focus it looked like a saucer or slightly cone like object, with a red light floating above a florecent,\r\nblue-green ring of light.I watched it for about 45minutes and then it dissapeared in a quick burst of light...{hard to describe it was like nothing i have ever seen}i went inside and after 2minutes of siting felt compelled to continue wathching the sky. i decided to climb through my window and stand on a flat section of roof for a better view,and not 1minute after i got out there i saw an orange ball of light come shooting accross the horizon, (by far the fastests thing i have ever witnessed in motion) as i watched in awe it screamed across the sky from out by red mountain to south mountain in less than 1 seccond flat , as it neared the center of my view of the city (near the airport i believe) i saw another light come shooting out of the sky at an even faster speed it is so hard...To find words to do it justice but it appeared out of nowhere, higher in the sky than i have ever seen a plane and in a split seccond and with a streak of  light it shot down to where the other orange light had just abbrupltey stopped and started hovering,the two lights hovered there for about 2 minutes before they started dimming out slowly like they where getting farther away.After about 5minutes of them dimming i could not get a glimpse of the objects at all and came inside to look for a phone number or place i could report my sightings. ive been a very avid persuer of answers in regards to ufos and the phoenix lights. i would very much appreciate it if you could contact me back at my email or cell phone with information on how to get involved in the tracking in study of ufo's i hope my information is of use to you","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,
