i was looking at zubeneschamali, which is the beta star in libra, when the cube just came out of nowhere! speechless, i quickly spotted it with the binoculars, through which i saw a brilliant perfect cube with an illuminated border. it was moving too quickly, so i knew i could not track it with my telescope. i just watched it with my binoculars. it changed colour from blue to aqua-green and stopped cold. i ran inside to grab my digital camera and managed to take one picture as it moved away and as soon as i took one picture it accelerated backwards to the point it appeared and it was gone. i waited for an hour just incase it came back, but it didn't.\r\n\r\ni have zoomed into image progressively, the camera resolution does not match the human eye but you can see the outline and shape.\r\n\r\nit is at the top of the tree moving from right to left, the libra star is on the top right of the tree. the cube was much sharper and brighter than this image, i have no idea how large it was or how fast it was moving, it was a brilliant experience.\r\n\r\npeople have told me it was a satellite but know satellites have a very smooth consistent speed and direction, satellite do not just appear in the sky at a single spot, then progressively drift, speed up, slow down and stop, they definitely do not change colour and noway can they change direction, if anything in the sky can reverse directing at sharp angles \"instantly\" its a fair to say its not man made, the force on the object would rip it apart. watching this ufo was akin to the ball in the computer game pong, but it was square. i have a decent pair of binoculars, (helios am6) these are not astronomy models but they have very good optics for the money, i could see the back ground of space around the outside of the square, the inside of the square was pure blackness compared to the illuminated boarder so it seemed to be a solid object.\r\n\r\ni could not use the telephoto on my camera for a few reasons, the main one is blur as most camera uses know about. the second one is light, the further out you zoom the less light enters the lens, if i had zoomed out i would have ended up with a very dim streak of light because of hand shake. thirdly my zoom is motorized and uses a spot meter to focus, the chances of zooming out into a dark infinity and having the camera pull focus on a faint distant object are very very bad, plus i only managed single picture before it decided to bounced backwards and vanish. i just had a feeling it could go at any moment and it did, typical! i never use the lcd for taking pictures, only the optical view finder. i only use the lcd screen for checking the exposure and iris and general camera settings, so i actual saw it in the small view finder on the camera as well, thankfully the camera has a fast start up time or i would have taken a picture of an almost empty sky.\r\n\r\ni searched online for pictures of any square ufo but found nothing similar to what i saw, but i found a story in the highlands news paper about a woman who saw a square ufo in her back garden, this story is only a month or so old, i have no idea if its related to what i saw.\r\n\r\nhere is the link\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Highland-news.Co.Uk/news/fullstory.Php/aid/5508/widow_s_ufo_shock.Html\r\n\r\ni don't know what else i can add but i hope its of some use to somebody.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time.\r\n\r\nali","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:40","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":16840,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":55.869237,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-05082009-0008","longitude":-4.248606,"occurred":1241346600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Scotland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1241346600000,"summary":"An illuminated square with picture.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16840_submitter_file1__DSC07809.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16840_submitter_file2__OriginalJPEGcrop.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16840_submitter_file3__maxzoom.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Glasgow, Scotland","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:232096"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Pittsgrove","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":null,"distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":16839,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5402333,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05082009-0007","longitude":-75.12139,"occurred":1241676000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1241676000000,"summary":"Orange light hovered for 10 minutes approx. a half mile away.

was still very bright with some high level haze or thin cloud cover. as usual i was watching the sky just looking for birds, airplanes, etc. we live under one of the approach paths for sat airport and we have a lot of civilian and military traffic.I saw what at first i thought was a buzzard but then i noticed i couldn't see any wings and it was not circling as they usually do. the object was totally black with no reflection from the sun and was moving in a straight line to the northwest at a steady pace. it was moving at about the speed of a normal civilian airliner as viewed at normal flight altitude. it did not deviate at all in altitude or direction. all of a sudden it occurred to me that this thing was not normal. i thought about grabbing my camera, but i realized that by the time it powered up the object would be gone over the horizon so i grabbed my binoculars instead. i got them focused on the object just before it disappeared over the horizon.The object was solid black with no light reflection and did not appear to be below the haze or cloud cover. it looked like a cube made up of large black balls. i would have thought it might be some kind of balloon except that it was a perfect cube and the surface looked more like just half of balls arranged to form a cube. i really can't judge the sized due nothing else being close to it in the sky. i've never seen anything like this before. maybe it was some type of balloon but due to it's constant speed, direction, and altitude i doubt it. right now i consider it to be a true unidentified flying object. the

the garden for a smoke, looking up i saw what i thought was a satellite passing over head, i ran inside and got my laser pointer to point it out to my girlfriend. we followed it as it traversed the sky south north it then seemed to fade away, only to reappear but this time it would pulse (maybe 20 times brighter) then disappear, reappear again, pulse and disappear again. this continued maybe 8 or 9 times. as strange as this was it is not why i felt the need tell someone. just as it disappeared i looked up and saw something moving across the sky east/west, i still can't comprehend what i saw or what it was i think my brain is finding it hard to process it. the best way to describe it is to say that a part of the sky was moving, or at the very least something that blended in to the sky was, i know that doesn't make sense but my girlfriend was also was there and we are still trying to accept and comprehend what we saw. i then pointed the laser pointer so that i could keep track/focus on it as it was hard to follow, i was completely shocked when right off the bat the laser hit it or i should say it dispersed across its surface spreading out and very bright. the next shock was the realization that it was a lot closer than i had originally thought and absolutely dead silent. the only way for me to describe it would be to say i could not see a definitive shape because it was, to use a sci-fi term, cloaked! do we have this type of technology? i'm still trying to grasp what happened and still feel the shock from the laser hitting it and how bright it became. it was like sensing

about the size of an apartment building. it seemed to be so close to us yet it didn't make even the slightest noise. we watched it fly slowly into the distance until we lost site of it. i know all the flight patterns of commercial airlines around here and this object was on a course of its own. it was also ten times bigger than any jet i've ever seen. i was stunned by this experience and also very happy that i got to witness something so rare. after i got home, i did a bit of research and found a video on youtube of the same thing that i saw. http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=n99dmrmrc-8&feature=channel_page. i had a much better view than what is seen in this person's video. i am kicking myself for not recording it on my phone but i was way too caught up in the moment to even think about it.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":16828,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0772192,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05072009-0014","longitude":-82.5129937,"occurred":1241589600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1241589600000,"summary":"Very large flashing object.","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Granville, Ohio","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:232108"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Grand Rapids","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"What really made me sit up and look at the sky was the blazing speed of what could have been a silvery pointed vehicle--if it was a plane, it was faster than any normal planes.  the \"con\" trail was also unusual. this vehicle would \"spurt\" pieces of con trail....Then no con trail would appear for 3/4 seconds.  again, a con trail would appear, just one power source from what i could see, more con-trail and then nothing again.  this happened across the horizon in a matter of seconds.  not a commercial plane for sure.  as the vehicle was zipping by across lake michigan, it just blanked out--no more con-trail--no more pointed type vehicle.\r\n\r\ni'd guess the compass course would have been about 220 degrees, not quite straight west--a notch to the south.\r\n\r\namazing speed could have been some type of ram-jet, \"if it was a military vehicle.\r\n\r\nben mocini\r\ngrandville, mich.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16827,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.9733099,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05072009-0013","longitude":-85.6650363,"occurred":1241737380000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1241737380000,"summary":"A \"very\" fast  \"puffy bursts from i could see @ 40k feet--moving from east to west--20 degrees south.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Grand Rapids, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:232109"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Barranquilla","country":"Colombia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I were going to sleep and i saw through the window was something like a flying cigar , 2 times in the building garden was illuminate with light a that came from the cigar  that only was there 1 second and the cigar go up and dissapear and the airplane that followed them take another rute .","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16826,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":10.9861096,"location":null,"logNumber":"CO-05072009-0012","longitude":-74.7702801,"occurred":1240032180000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Atlantico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240032180000,"summary":"I feel when it pass near by i fall and some airplane start to followed an the cigar dissapeared in only seconds.

up the television station. i asked if there was any special searchlights or advertising targeting the area. they said, none that they knew of, and would not go out and look, as they were deep in preparation for the 10 pm newcast. i called other stations and no one knew of any promotions that would explain this display. the display continued, endlessly, as i had to leave the area for a work

parrallel to the truck i was going 35mph and so was the craft i sped up to 50mph and so did the craft it shadowed me untill i drove to a dead end in an attempt to follow the other one when i reached the dead end the craft that had been parrallel to us flew over the top of us twice then sort of drifted back the way it came then hovered maybe 200-300 yards away my girlfriend plug in my 3 million

that the light reflected off of it so we put the spotlight away the craft swooped in like an airplane would banking untill it was facing us with five super bright white-orange lights it stayed and hovered at less than 100 yards away for about ten minutes this is when we first heard the craft it was so quiet almost silent there was only a slight hum then it flew off and back going over us twice then hovering again it seemed as if it was playing with us which pretty much rules out the millitary in my opinion it hovered for maybe another ten min as the other circled behind us almost like back up to make sure we werent hostile then the first craft turned hard to the left makin the crafts light shift from five lights to 1 light then as it turned it became completely invisible only to reappear over highway 50 revealing many little yellow lights then shifted back to five lights in stayed parrallel with me on the highway untill i got closer to the lights of town when it pulled up

dark. we were driving back on our way home, when we both saw 3 objects in the distance, with lights we had never seen before, and flying in a unusual way, in a group. we got very excited while watching, and suddenly they started breaking away from eachother. one started going down towards the ground and dissapeared like it had crashed. the other two continued to fly, almost towards us.\r\nwe decided to chase them! we started after them, and they flew right by us many times. one specifically seemed to keep coming back to us. we tried to comfirm it as a military aircraft, but it was nothing either of us had seen before. we thought maybe it could be a drone, but the more we looked we knew it wasnt. at first there was 3 flying objects, but by this time there was only 2. but only one seemed to awknowlage us. we parked the truck after watching it fly by us and over us several times. it was completely silent. and hovered slowly, although in the distance it went faster. i decided to plug the spotlight in and try and get its attention. it worked! we were parked on a dirt road, next to a water canel. across from the canel was a small passture, the hovering craft flew directly at us, and stopped facing us. we shined the light at it, and put our hand over the light to make it strobe. the craft sat there for a good 5 mins, and seemed like it was getting closer, so close it was alomst as if we could throw something at it. and there was no sound. i tried to get pictures but, the pixel rate on my cam phone was too low and came up as all black on the screen. we started to get scared and jumped back in the truck, as soon as we did the craft moved and went behind us as if it was following us. the other craft was in the distance as if it was watching, sort of like back up.\r\nmy boyfriend and i both called our parents freaking out, and not knowing how to explain the events that were going on. we watched them fly around us consistantly. but when we reached the highway, and back on our way into town, they dissapeared. when we made it back into town to my house, i was stadning outside, and seen a c 130 fly over our heads. i knew this wasnt the craft i seen because it was too large, was too high up, and wasnt silent. i could also see the shape of it and it was obviously a plane.\r\nbut these hovering crafts we seen were black, almost invisable except for the lights. when they turned you couldnt see them. the only time they were all visible was when they were facing you, and that because of the 5 alined lights.\r\ni went inside my house and drew a picture for my father, he called the naval base here in fallon. they told us they had no reports of any aircraft besides the c 130. but i knew it wasnt a c 130!\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend and his father went back out to where we were. when they got there, there were helicopters with spotlights on the ground, several trucks with spotlights driving through the desert. a black suv with very dark tented windows driving towards the area we seen the crafts. men walking around with spot lights in the desert. as if they were all looking for someting.\r\nbut if they were looking for the craft that we thought we seen crash, they were in the wrong area, they were looking where we had first seen the crafts from a distance. miles off.\r\n\r\nim not sure what i saw tonight, but ive always been a believer of other life forms. and tonight was proof for me. i was scared..And excited. i hope i find out more about what i saw.  \r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100 Feet, 101-500

i said to myself, \"oh, it was just an airplane.\" a few moments later, i noticed it come back into view, from the right to the left. i sat up and said, \"what the hell, airplanes dont change their directions like that\" and went to the window. i watched it wobble in the air in the same place for a few minutes then decided to go outside for a better view.\r\n\r\nonce outside, i witnessed the object move left then right and up and down at various speeds. i felt dumbstruck. i didn't know if i was just crazy or this was really happening, so i decide to wake someone in the house for backup.\r\n\r\nmy first choice was to alert my friend alex, but i noticed his twin sister averil had her door open and the tv was on. i checked if she was awake and luckily she was. i convinced her to come outside with me to witness the event. she and i both watch the object move erratically for around an hour. the only thing i could possibly think it was would be a balloon, because most of the time it just stayed stationary, but the brightness of the object and the at random times very rapid movement ruled that out, we was slightly frightened but very intrigued. this was something neither of us had ever seen. we then decided to wake alex and averil's boyfriend jeff. by the time everyone as assembled outside, it had stopped moving rapidly, and pretty much settled where it was going to be. it only moving slightly up down left and right. after a few minutes we all went inside to search for binoculars. when we went outside the object was gone.\r\n\r\nit's important to say that this took place from 3am to a little after 5am and during that time, the object trekked from slightly below the treeline while laying down inside to very high in the sky that could only be viewed while outside. it was much brighter than any star and moved like no man made object. and this was a clear night. we do live near keesler air force base, but it was not near it.\r\n\r\nalex and averil said they could both see pulsating lights under the main bright light, but i could not.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

lowering sun reflecting off of a much bigger object, as if i was just seeing a small corner of a stealth hidden blimp or other plane. \r\n\r\ni called my brother, who lives a little further south and he went outside to look. his view was blocked, so he went inside and up stairs and confirmed that he, too saw something strange. he asked me to go get my camera, and i did. when i back came outside, the object had \"shortened\" in length and was now moving north. i was able to get some pretty bad footage of this. right then, my brother said he saw something else in the north west sky. sure enough, there was an orange ball with a vapor trail that seemed to be hanging in the air. i was able to get some bad footage of this too before the sky cleared.\r\n\r\nthis could just be a plane and a

frankenstein movies..But a much lower frequency) i got out of bed and looked through my blinds and seen a globe of light across the water at least half a mile away. a beam of light then focused on us,so it seemed  so i closed my blinds and the blanket the covers them, and the light just went right through.(this was weird because the blanket is there to block out all light and had no effect)the light was bright and lit up the entire room unlike any light i have ever seen before, it was brighter than daytime.We then got very scared and turned on the tv and internet to see if it was like an emergency or something.Nothing  abnormal  was on. we went  back to bed and didn't talk about the event much  and i tried to reassure  my girlfriend  that everything was all right. i was very scared and had many thoughts on what it was. i didn't write down the date or time...I searched the internet and newspaper sure it was going to be flooded by reports but never seen any matching my encounter. i let time get away from me and lost the time in witch it happened . i asked some  friends and they  made me feel crazy. this was very real and i am surprised i have never seen a similar report. i don't want fame  or money i just want to know if anyone else  reported this. this event kind of  eats away at me  because i know it was real. was it a government  thing or alien i don't know that. i sometime lay awake in bed waiting for it to happen again..And  i will take  action this time. there are so many things i wanted to do but was too scared at the time. i tried to find other sites to report to but i  wanted to find a creditable one first. i am almost scared that i missed my only oppurtunity to see such a thing. then again,maybe getting out of the light was the best thing to do ..Who knows?
