very strange dim incandescent beacon light approached at night from the right-hand side of the aircraft and passes across the path and then underneath the left wing in a matter of 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe beacon light was strange in that it was unilluminated (off) more than it was on. the interval was like one second-on and five seconds off, and we saw the light 4 times. we did not see any other running lights.\r\n\r\nfrom the perspective of the path, i.E. relative motion, and the closing speed and angle, this light passed across the aircraft path at almost the same level and in very close proximity. ground-based lighting would take minutes to pass an aircraft travelling at 2.5 miles a minute, this light was not on the ground.\r\n\r\nthe first thought was that the light was attached to a military jet, but this has been dispelled by discussions with military aircrew after an unofficial enquiry two weeks later when i described the beacon. \r\n\r\n\r\nan aircraft does not normally sport a white running light, nor a single white beacon in the forward direction. a white light, except for landing lights, is reserved for the rear of an aircraft. when the beacon is unlight, it should be relatively easy to see one or more red or green navigation running lights when the aircraft is heading towards your own aircraft.\r\n\r\nthis sighting occured in the same designated remote area as a previous sighting.\r\n\r\nthe light was seen by the pilot and co-pilot almost simultaneously, and they both queried each other, \"what is that?\". unfortunately the corroborating witness is since deceased.\r\n\r\nalong with other unusual night time sightings, it is difficult to associate this white light with a known aircraft when none of the other expected tell-tale lights are present.\r\n\r\nthis is yet another unexplained night time sighting by two pilots, and easily dismissed as fleeting incident.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16798,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-35.9966502,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-05052009-0004","longitude":148.7739683,"occurred":1205049600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

(i am used to watching planes at night so i wasn't expecting to see what i saw, i expected nothing more then just another plane.)  but when it came out from behind the trees i thought to myself, \"is that a triangle?\".  so i looked at it more carefully.  that is when i noticed that there were four white lights on it.  i could only see the bottom and there was a light on each corner and one in the very center.  only the center light flased (pulsed) on & off.  at this point i was kinda thrown off because i didn't recall ever seeing a plane with lights that don't blink on the wings and i started freaking out a little (in my mind).  i told myself to calm down and look at it again before it moved over the car and out of my line of sight.  and this time i told myself to look for the wings (thinking that would be the end of it) but that is when i realized that i couldn't see the  outline/shape of wings and that the shape really was a triangle because i could clearly see the shape of the craft because of the light colored clouds in the sky that night (it was a really cloudy night and the clouds were kinda lit up from the city lights if you understand what i mean.)  it was flying under the clouds deck and i could clearly see that it was black and to my utter amasement it was shaped like a triangle.  there were no wings, only a perfect triangle.  the strangest part is that right as i noticed that it was actually a triangle i noticed that is wasn't flying straight but rather from right to left going over the highway.  i have never seen anything fly like that except for helicopters and helicopters never look like that object did (day or night).  \r\n\r\nthe craft moved over the car and i couldn't see it anymore because we were still moving down the highway going away from it.  when i tried to look back and see it again i could only see light, not shape or anything else.  i continued to watch the sky to see if i could see a plane or anything flying under the clouds like that craft was and i didn't see anything for hours after my sighting.  and not only that, there wasn't anymore lightning for at least two hours or so after we got home.  my boyfriend was driving the car at the time and i was so freaked out at what i'd seen that i didn't mention it to him.  along with the fact that i thought he would make fun of my for thinking that i saw something considering how much i am into ufo's and aliens.  i did build up the courage to tell him later that night but when i told him he said that he didn't believe me because i didn't tell him as soon as i saw it.\r\n\r\ni really saw something that night.  i wish i'd told him to look so i wouldn't be alone on this but like they say \"hind sight is 20/20\".  now i am alone with my thoughts and questions.  and the worst part is who knows if i will ever see something like that again.  flying low and clearly visible.  wow, i finally saw one!  weird weird weird","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

home and saw one bright non-blinking star-like light.  the sky was clear and there was no other moving lights in the sky at that time.  i can see planes on final approach to lax in that same direction, but this light was much higher on the horizon and not moving e to w as the planes do.  at first i thought it was a helicopter approaching from the n toward the s, but the object moved slowly and erratically, forward and back unlike any aircraft of any kind.  the object was as bright in the sky as the lights on an aircraft might be if it were in the area.  it odd direction it moved and its brightness made it quite noticeable in a dark and quiet sky. there was no color, only white light like a star.  the object moved around the ne sky for several minutes and then dove to the s suddenly and was lost on the horizon.  in a few minutes the light appeared again, but with a companion light about 10 degrees to the nw of the original object.  the lights moved in perfect tandem around in the nw sky, again much higher than the planes which i could still track low in the sky on their approach to lax.  i got a second witness to physically observe with me and she saw the same thing.  we both also thought that someone on the planes, a passenger or even a pilot, must have seen them unless they were too far n in the sky for them to be seen from the windows on the planes. the tandem lights moved, slowly at first, erratically, but still in tandem.  at one point the original object brightened and dimmed and the companion light did the same thing about five seconds later.  they moved quickly around the n sky for a couple of minutes, brightening and dimming and moving erratically, then pausing and hanging motionless in the sky.  they were stationary for several minutes and then finally dove quickly and brightly directly down to the horizon in the n sky.  there was no sound that accompanied the lights.  i remember thinking that i could not believe what i was seeing.  i was transfixed, tracking the movement and i knew i needed to get someone to see it with me and i did.  i called two friends but no one answered the phone at that hour. i'd wished that i had a camcorder available, but i did not.  after the event, no other activity was noted.  i remained at watch alone for another hour, but no

us 93 leaving las vegas, nv towards kingman, az. my husband was telling me about lights that he sees in the sky in this area often and about a diff encounter he had a month ago (will file a seperate report). he was explaining to me what the craft looked like when he pointed ahead towards the left of the highway above white hills town and said 'there it is!'\r\n   i saw a very bright object in the sky hovering (not moving) in the same spot. i immdiately thought it was probably just a plane but the white light was way too bright and big. it was large and watching it i realized it was not moving. we watched it for a minute then pulled over into the middle of both sides of the highway (it is a good sized dirt/brush area in middle) and we watched it. you could barly see small lights lined up on it (about 4 or so when you squinted, it was far away/small but could still make out) it appeared to be more boomerang shaped by the way the lights were lined on it but it was so far away i cant be exactly sure but to offer these observations. \r\n   soon after we stopped on side to watch the bright light turned off and a small red blinking light on the bottom turned on and it began to move towards las vegas. it appeared to 'transform' into a plane (moving and light looking like a plane). my husband told me that is what they do transform to be like planes if you stop to watch (it happened the last time he saw it). \r\n   we got back in the truck and a couple minutes later we saw another bright stationary light just a little farther where the first one appeared. it looked the same as the first hovering and stationary. we didnt stop immediately until a couple minutes later another bright light appeared near this one but alittle higher in the sky. we  pulled over again and watched them both. the one we saw before the other still appeared to be stationary but it made a weird loop circular motion (to the right, up, left and back where it was-in a circle) quickly. it did that a couple of times. after watching for a few minutes the 'first' one turned the bright white light off and turned the red blinking light on as well, like the very first one that had already flown away. it started moving in the same direction as the other one, moving exactly like a plane and blinking similar to one. we watched the last one (3rd) one for a bit more and got back on the road and started driving again. \r\n   the 3rd bright white light started moving in our direction for a a little while then it turned off its bright white lighting and the red light like the others blinked on and it started traveling toward vegas like the other 2 did before it. once thier red lights kick in the look like a plane, you wouldnt think twice about it unless you saw its bright white light and it hovering stationary, or moving weirdly, or simply appearing but again the red lights seems brighter or bigger then the average blinking airplane light. my husband said they looked exactly like the one he previously saw a month ago except that one had blue lights blinking as well as the red when it turned the bright white off and it was a more detailed sighting then these (craft wise). also the lights seemed to be flying lower than a regular airplane.\r\n   after we saw these things we were scanning the sky for more but found none. we got home and looked up sightings in white hills but didnt find too much, then looked up dolan springs and found someone asking 'anyone know of any vortexes,cold plasma shields,u.F.O���s or any other oddities in or near dolan springs,az?' asked on february '09 so others must be seeing these things. searching triangle shaped crafts there seems quite a few seen in az. we plan to be well equiped camera wise next time we are in the area and we are confident we may see these lights again since they seem to frequent that area.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional

is located maybe two hundred yards east of perdido pass on hwy 182 near the al/fl border. the balcony faces the ne. \r\n\r\nas we were talking, i noticed what looked like a very bright, \r\nwhite star low in the sky to the nne. it caught my eye a few times because it was so bright, but otherwise it didn't seem too unusual. we could see the sky very well that night/morning and it just looked like a really bright star amongst many other stars. \r\n\r\nmaybe the fourth time i noticed it (over about 30 minutes) i saw it descend rapidly for a pretty good distance.(maybe from about 50 to 30 degrees in just a blink) \r\n\r\nit looked like a shooting star, except it just stopped on a dime and hung there unchanging for at least a couple of minutes before fading into a reddish color and \"blinking out\" (see below). \r\n\r\nwhen i saw it \"fall\", i told my friend and ran inside to grab a camera. then we both watched it sit in the sky and disappear. the video camera is new and i didn't know how to operate it very well, so i was unable to document the first sighting. \r\n\r\nover the next half hour or so we saw it appear and reappear in the sky 10-12 times. the first 8-10 times we saw it, the object would usually initially appear to be a bright star moving slowly in the sky. most of the time it was moving very slowly from e to w or was stationary then it would change colors and then just disappear or dissolve. \r\n\r\nwe saw it turn blue, white, green, red, orange, and yellow (at least). \r\nsometimes it would change colors instantly, other times it would sort of rapidly blink different colors. when the object disappeared, it would turn a dull red color and sort of dissolve.(see the video)\r\nwe heard no noise, but it appeared to be very far away. \r\n\r\nthe object would appear for 30-60 seconds each time before disappearing. \r\n(*note - the first time i saw it before it \"fell\" it was sitting in one place for about 30 minutes) \r\n\r\nthe last two times we saw it, the object initially appeared as just the dull red color. it behaved the same as before except that it appeared to be moving up in the sky. \r\n\r\nwhen we saw the object we didn't know what it was but figured (or at least hoped) it had a us military origin. at the beach there is a lot of air traffic in general and we are very close to pensacola naval air station also, hours earlier on the 27th we saw a number of military aircraft flying over towards pensacola nas. \r\n\r\neven so, what we saw is certainly not something either of us had ever seen before and we both spend a lot of time in orange beach. \r\n\r\nthe video is very, very shaky because it is hand held and super zoomed in. the object is only moving slightly west to east or stationary...Not jerking all over the place. you can see the object \"blink out\" two or three separate times. the last one is the easiest to see. \r\n\r\nthe video is in two parts that were recorded about ten minutes apart. other than trimming out parts, nothing has been done to alter the video. it has sound, but only of us talking, so i took that out. \r\n\r\ni was able to capture the object only three times as i was new to the camera and i was having trouble getting it to focus on the object because it was so far away. i was unable to record the last sightings because the red was too dull for the camera to pick up/focus on. \r\n\r\nthe camera used to capture the video is a sony handycam dcr-sx40 with a 60x optical zoom. all of the video is zoomed in all the way. all of the settings are factory...I assume. \r\n\r\nso to recap, it first appeared to be in the sky beyond bayou saint john in the general direction of arnica bay / josephine, al. it stayed in approximately the same 1/8 of the sky, but appeared/reappeared seemingly at random in all different parts of that 1/8th. it stayed in a range of approx. 60 to 20 degrees. \r\n\r\nthe ufo hung around in one general area for about 30 minutes, then fell rapidly for some distance, then just randomly disappeared and reappeared in different parts of the sky for about 30 minutes until finally reappearing as just a red dull color and moving slowly from n to ne for about 10 minutes until blinking out for good.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then

should report this sighting. my friend and i had this sighting several years ago in a town called sanger. i don't remember the exact date but it was between 1996 and 1997. it was a friday night and we were at my cousins house getting ready to go out to a casino. it was 10:00 p.M. and my friend and i were waiting outside for my cousin, we were talking and i noticed something in the night sky. i looked up and i saw this black object floating slowly across the sky. i told my friend to look up where she saw the object and she freaked out and ran inside. i, on the other hand kept looking at the object as it floated from north-west to south-east. the object was not making any noise. i really don't remember the size or the shape but it was sort of long and retangular in shape. this was a long time ago and it is hard to remember the specifics. i saw the object for about 10 seconds until i ran inside. we told my cousin but he did not believe us. we did not go back outside until my cousin was ready to go. by that time the object was gone and we went to the casino.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

outhouse that was a good walk from the house.  one spring night, sometime between 2:00 & 3:00am, i woke up with a great need to go to the bathroom.  i drug myself out of bed, through the house & into the dark.  as i went around the coal shed toward the outhouse, i realized that it was perfectly quiet, no cricket or frog sounds.  i had the impluse to look up.  when i did, i saw an object that was right over the coal shed. it was round & was about 30 ft across.  it was about 40 ft. above me.  the object did not move or make a sound.  there were lights around the bottom.  there was a red light that held my attention.  i couldn't stop looking at it.  i can remember wondering it the object was a helicopter.  i had heard that copters could hover without falling, but i'd never seen one. staring at the red light was the last thing that i remember about it.  the next thing i remember is that i woke up in bed.  this happened for ten nights in a row.  the only difference was that when i'd go off the back porch, i would hear the old screen door slap, then i'd wake up in bed the next morning.  this was happening back in 1955.  i tried to tell my parents about it, but of course they convinced me that i was just dreaming.  even though i don't remember the details, i know that i had a real experience.\r\n\r\ni've had other things happen to me that i realize must be connected to my childhood experience.  but of course i don't remember the details.  i must have had the fear of god put into me for me not to remember. \r\n\r\ni know you can't do anything with this, but it sure has made me feel better to share it with folks that might understand it.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"21-100
