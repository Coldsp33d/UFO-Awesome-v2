south to north (curving to the east) at slightly below tree level. initially, i thought it was a small plane trying to land at pease afb, but, on reflection there are too many discrepancies:\r\n\r\n   1) there was no sound.(windows slightly open)\r\n   2) the plane was moving very fast and erractically.\r\n   3) it seemed to bounce (mostly downward) fast.\r\n\r\ni lifted my head up up to follow the path, which, if graphed, would have shown a gently sloping, gliding arc to the north, which then curved to the east towards pease afb, but: it slowed, dropped and sped up during it trajectory. i could even even see the glow behind the trees often. it's speed was variable.\r\n\r\ni came home this afternoon and got back into bed to check the visual sightline in daylight hours and realized that it was not as far away as i originally thought, but instead smaller than a cessna single prop plane. apparently, it flew up the squamscott river, down great bay and approached pease afb from the east.\r\n\r\ni checked to see if there were any other reports of this object in the local news, but it's low flight path, time of night and lack of population in this area, as well as it's apparent speed cuased me to be the only observer.\r\n\r\nhalf asleep, it registered as odd, but, i did not get up to follow it's path through the windows at the foot of my bed, as the trees are closer and higher there.\r\n\r\nif you would like to discuss this further, there are good google maps around my address which to re-create the flight path and apparent distance away. second floor bedroom, with an apparent 8 degrees above the horizon with a river created tree line for distance calculation may help detail this brief sighting.\r\n\r\ni have no desire to file a police report or report this to

california traveling on interstate 40. on sunday the 19th i left oklahoma late in the afternoon and drove to somewhere within the borders of new mexico that evening. found a small motel checked in went to sleep. the next morning i woke up, gassed up, cleaned my windows and continued on toward my destination at approx. 7am. i was still on the far eastern side of nm and was had a long day of travel ahead of me so i found what i thought was the best coffee in town and hit the road. \r\ni had been on the road for probably three to four hours and was getting close to the western borders of new mexico; in fact, i was at mile marker 62 or 63, just enjoying the ride and the scenery when i happened to look toward the northwest. i noticed a bright object in the direction i was looking and focused my vision on it. at first i thought it might be a hot air balloon, having just watched a documentary on them on pbs just a few days before, but the object wasn���t shaped like a balloon. the object was shaped like a dome that was slightly short of a half circle. it had a flat bottom to it that was shaped like a tear drop on its side, with the pointy end facing toward my right. i approximate that i was looking up at a 20 to 30 degree angle, through my windshield. \r\nthere was a plane in the far distance coming toward me from the area of nw arizona that was within my field of vision as well, evidenced by the con trail it left in its wake and a large mesa off to the right that was parallel to the highway. the craft was slightly above the mesa in clear blue sky.\r\nthe object was bright metallic silver, as pure a color silver as i���ve ever seen. there were no other distinguishing marks other than the bottom which appeared white and which for the briefest of moment seemed to phase out of distinct characteristic form and then back in. \r\ni had been looking at the object for a matter of probably six seconds and had to turn my attention back to the road to make sure i was still traveling in my lane. convinced i was ok i looked back to where the object had been and it was gone��� completely.\r\nwithin a couple miles of the sighting was an exit off the highway. i took it and got out of my car to investigate further. i couldn���t see anything but several airplanes with the con trails left in their wake. \r\ni later exited at another off ramp to ask if there was any historical significance to the area and i found out that right there was the entrance to chaco canyon, the residence of the now extinct anastasi indians. i thought that was interesting\r\n","distance":"Over One

already set a while beforehand. it followed an odd path about the southwestern sky, sometimes moving faster than others, before it faded away. it was soon replaced by another closer one (or perhaps the same one?) which moved in a similar manner through the sky and was soon joined by another. after a few minutes they both faded. i watched for more but saw none, however, a few minutes after the

hot sunny day and the sky was a deep blue with a few sparse wispy white clouds. i looked to my left, out the driver side window and saw a very distinct symmetrical, shiny, silvery metallic object hovering motionlessly in the western sky. my first thought was that maybe it was a helicopter because it was just hovering there and not moving, although its perfect symmetry and chrome-like appearance did not make that seem likely. the only way i could describe it would be that it was shaped like an acorn or upside down bell with the wider end up. i looked later on the internet for photos of ���acorn shaped ufo���s��� and was surprised to find that they were not that uncommon. the only difference was that the pictures that i found showed the object inverted, with the wider end facing down. i continued to watch the object for about 15 or 20 seconds and then to my amazement, it just faded away into the blue sky over the course of 4 or 5 seconds. that���s when i was convinced that i had seen a ufo. weather balloons or helicopters don���t just disappear right before your eyes.

was approximately 8pm and i was walking up the back stairs of the house which faces an easterly direction over the ocean.As i got to the top of the steps i noticed a very bright blinking star which at first glance i thought it was a areoplane coming in of the sea to land at brisbane airport. it then seemed strange to me as i have lived on this island all my life and i have never seen a aeroplane come in from that direction so i stood at the top of the steps for about 10 mins and noticed that the lights were blinking brighter than a usual plane, in this time the lights did not seem to get any closer so i walked inside to put the washing down i had just got off the clothes line. i went out side again as the lights had me interested for some reason and when i went back outside the light was still in the same position so i called to my wife to bring the binoculers out so i could have a better look as this thing was about 20 to 30 km away. when i ajusted the binoculers i was stunned to see that there was like a disc shapped object with the most beautiful coloured lights that i have ever seen which comprised of a blue intermintent light flashing light on top of this thing and the middle of was bright red like a tail light of a motor car, at the bottom it was changing colours in a swirling fashion from orange to a light blue to a green sort of colour at that point i thought i was going nuts so called to my wife and adult son to come and have a look at this thing. my wife was the first out of the pair to look at it and was very supprised and started to get very worried and wanted to call someone about it as by this time it had come a little closer and had now tilted on its side at about 45 degrees at this point we knew it was not an aeroplane. my son all this time was taking the mickey out of me saying that the little green men are comeing to get me but once he looked at it through the binoculers he went real quiet and turned around and went back inside as my wife and i continued to watch. in all we watched it for about 50 minutes and started to get attacked by mossy's so we went inside to get some insect reppellant which only took about 40 to50 seconds as it was on top of the fridge near the door but when i turned around to look at it again it was gone and as it was a very clear night we could not see it any where only an aeroplane landing at brisbane

midway between deming, nm and the border with mexico. this is fairly remote desert land about 18 miles out of deming. the sky above the desert was very clear giving me excellent visibility. i saw this object on four seperate occasions over a period of about three months. three of the sightings were of short duration, one was possibly three minutes. as i was getting ready to enter my dwelling, a bright white light directly overhead caught my attention. my reflexes are very fast and i was able to look up quickly enough to catch it in mid-pulse. it appeared as a pulsating, egg-shaped light. there were no external lights or strobes, it appeared to be much like a rigid eggshell with a bright light shining within. it pulsated light on about a one or two second interval. between pulses it disappeared, reappearing a considerable distance from the previous pulsation. on this occasion it looked to be at least ten miles high and perhaps much further. i have no doubt that it was intelligent directed, it was obviously not any sort of natural object. my first thought was \"man, this is weird!\". i had never seen anything like it before and knew immediately that it was an ufo. whatever height it actually was, it appeared to be the same approximate length as the large passenger airliners that i saw frequently going to and from albuquerque. it was about half as wide as it was long, the taper from mid-point appeared identical both front and back. it pulsated twice in a straight line and then pulsated once at 45 degrees from the line with an identical distance between pulsations and then disappeared. the entire occurance lasted maybe five seconds. two other seperate sightings within the same three month period were only a single pulsation. the last time i saw it, it was low to the ground near the tres hermanas mountains, which were about ten miles away. at first it moved very slowly and a bit erratically. at that distance, it may have been 300' long. as it shifted  gradually toward me, it slowly dimmed from a bright white to pale yellow on thru orange and red to a dusky reddish brown reminescient of a lunar eclipse. it finally blinked out while moving slowly to the west parallel to me and disappeared. when i asked nieghbors about it, some said they had seen a similiar object before but didn't know what it was. during and after sightings i experienced an uncomfortable, somewhat elated awe. at about the same time period i observed two cold meteorites (non-glowing), one traveling horizontally at about one hundred and fifty miles per hour so close i thought i heard a swishing sound. i was living in a remote area of the desert, the closest nieghbors being about a mile away.\r\ni have spent many years studying the ufo phenomenen and even wrote a short book on the subject (the truth, if you dare). i have had three other encounters since about 1969. after abundant research in the ufo and many relevent fields, i firmly believe that i understand what they are and why they are here, tho' i doubt that everyone would agree with me. i tried many times to shoot holes in my theories but was unable to do so, in fact, my theories began to speak to and answer questions relating to other remarkable phenomenen. i employed converging lines of evidence to reach my conclusions. i am very bright, testing in the top one percent nationally and am not a crank of any sort. thank you for allowing me to give this testimony.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering

live in an area of san jose where i can observe the landing patterns of commercial flights coming into san jose from both the north and south. the aircraft coming in from the north (seattle, portland) sometime fly very close to my home so am very familiar with their altitude and speed both day and night. although i am not as close to arriving aircraft coming in from the south (about 5 miles)i am also familiar with their appearance. aircraft departing from san jose to the south make a 180 degree turn to the right before continuing south. aircraft departing to the north (seattle, portland) have to make a 360 degree turn to the right in order to gain enough altitude before crossing over the san francisco area and pass almost directly over my home. i believe at least 10,000 feet. although my hearing has suffered over the years i am able to hear these aircraft very easily. \r\n\r\nlast night at approximately 11:20 pm i stepped out on my deck for a smoke and observed a very bright light to the east about 1/3 of the distance between myself and the landing pattern of the flights arriving from the south. it was traveling in a straight line to the ssw at what appeared to be 1000-2000 feet at a speed of between 350-450 knots. if it were higher it would have to have been traveling much faster. there were no flashing red lights or strobes in evidence and made no sound whatsoever. it was completely silent. the observation lasted approximately 20-25 seconds before disappearing to the south. i consider myself an objective person and not prone to jumping to conclusions but i have never observed anything like this before in this area. i have lived at this location for about 5 years.\r\n","distance":"Over One

yukon,the sun roof was open so we saw it good.I got on the gas and rounded a bend in the road and observed it up ahead over a big steel power line carrier and a field.\r\n i stoped my truck and got out to see if it was a conventianal craft,i.E engine noise etc..But there was nothing.Just 3 red lights that stoped pulsating as it sat there. my sons friend had a cell phone so i told him to get the camera on and give it to me,he did but as i pointed the phone toward the object shaped as a giant v the phone went black.I hollerd and cursed because i thought he had handed it to me off,but he said he turned the camera on himself..So..I got back in my truck and just as i did that it turned 180 deg. and zoomed off the direction it came,and kinda shuffled to the left.  all 3 of us saw this thing.It was about 150 feet or so across and hooverd about 500-700 feet of the ground.So we saw it pretty good. no way man made that thing with the technology we have now!\r\n   i reported it to the
