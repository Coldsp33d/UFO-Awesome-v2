around 8:30 pm and asked her to recall the events of 4/25/2009. she stated at the outset that she is a psychotherapist and that she wanted me to know that she suffers from chronic pain due to degenerative joint disease for which she takes daily medication, which she stated is morphine. she has taken this medication for several years and so it is not a newly prescribed medication. \r\n\r\nshe went on to say that on the morning of saturday, april 25, at close to 4:15 am mdt, she was experiencing pain and was in bed accompanied by her dog trying to sleep. at that point her eyes were closed and she was embracing her dog when she felt a strong wind in her room that moved her hair and left some papers on the floor. she stated that she is a christian and that the papers contained prayers she'd been reading. she described the wind as strong and stated the nature reminded her of a 30-40 mph wind. she reported no open windows or doors to the outside were open at the time. she described the experience as terrifying and that she heard a voice in her head she associated with having a telepathic source. she stated that the voice instructed her not be afraid. she also reported sensing a presence that she felt was physically close to her face and that she did not want to open her eyes due to fear but not due to any physical effect. she also reported being unable to talk. her next memory is of the wind returning and with it her impression is that she was returned to her bed. she noted the time to be 5:30 am. she and the dog did not go back to sleep afterward and remained upset for some period of time afterward. i was unable to explore what happened next as the witness changed the subject and reported briefly some other events that she recalled having happened to her and to other members of her family in years past. she reported a daytime sighting from the summer of 2007 where she and some friends had observed a jet contrail and high in the sky noticed what she estimated to be roughly 20 small circular silver objects that would group and ungroup at high altitude. she considered that they might be birds but questioned the altitude thinking it was too high for birds. she noted that the objects suddenly disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nwe ended the call shortly after 9:00 pm, at which time she said she'd like not to talk about what happened any furhter this evening since she wanted to think about other things so close to bedtime. \r\n\r\nmy impression is that sherry sounded coherent throughout the phone call and that she did her best to describe the events of early saturday morning as she recalls them to be. i find no reason to doubt her sincerity or veracity at this time. i asked if it would be ok to follow up with her at another time and she agreed without hesitation.\r\n\r\nethan rich 4/27/2009

glare. once the window was opened i could hear noises that seemed as though they were coming from the ufo. it was like a humming swirling buzz sound that would get louder then quiet like it was going fast & slowing down. the neighbors dogs were also barking and an airplane was flying right over the ufo. i couldn���������t guess how far away ������it was because it was too dark outside for me to tell. the moon was to the right of the ufo and was easily triple the size of the ufo. i caught several 30 second videos with my phone until the object got too far away to video with my cell phone. the

sarasota, florida, i got home around 9:30 p.M. i wish to declare that i did not consume any alcohol beverage at any time during the night.  i want to get that out of the way, so doubters cannot use that excuse as an influential substance to enhance what was about to happen next.\r\n\r\ni watched tv for a half an hour, and then decided to go to bed.  while shutting things down in my condo, i walked over to the slider that leads onto my lanai, when a very bright strobing light caught my eye and i stood there mesmerized.\r\n\r\ni went out onto the lanai to get a better glimpse of this amazing sight and noticed the colors of the strobes, which were blinking white, blue, green and red, extremely fast. i���d seen this strange phenomenon many times before, but never could determine what it was, but this was different, as it was so intense.\r\n\r\nback to last night���s sighting, i immediately put on my ���healthy skeptic���s hat��� and watched closely to see if there was any movement to this object. i also tried to discern if it was a conventional aircraft or other logical airborne vehicle, as they can appear to not move if they���re headed toward or away from you.  there was no indication of movement in any direction.\r\n\r\ni then ran to get my binoculars and focused them on this strange strobing light of many colors. again, no movement. it was quite large in size and appeared to be elongated and somewhat flat from the angle i observed it from.  more and more, i began to believe i was viewing a ufo.\r\n\r\ni ran to get my portable phone and called a friend in my condo complex to calmly tell her what i was seeing. all of a sudden, during my conversation with my friend, it blacked out and was gone!\r\n\r\ni thought it might be due to cloud cover, but i am not sure.\r\n\r\ni do wish to state that just prior to this ���black out��� i did witness some slight movement to the south before it disappeared entirely. i stayed up until 1:05 a.M. to keep watch, but the object never returned to this position, at least.\r\n\r\ni have seen these colored strobing lights before in the night sky when i lived in arizona and performed an experiment. as the earth turns, any visible stars or constellations will change position in time, but not these lights. they remain fixed in their position always.\r\n\r\nso, there you have it. while it may not be classified as an unidentified flying object, i will state that it is an unidentified stationary object. another twist to the uso controversy.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16701,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.956385,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04272009-0010","longitude":-82.4490476,"occurred":1240635600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240635600000,"summary":"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Tampa,

window i noticed a slow-moving object coming toward the car from the south. it seemed unusual because of it's sort-of-triangular shape, the unconventional lights, and it's perception of slowness. i rolled down the window for a better view. after a few seconds it made a sharp right turn displaying a line of lights in the direction of flight and secondary lines of lights to the sides, forming a sort of triangle with lights longitudinally fore and aft. it was traveling apparently slowly for it's size, but because it was dark it was hard to tell how big it was or how far away. i could hear no noise from it, but there was engine and wind noise from my car so i can't say it was 'noiseless'. it traveled eastbound for less than a minute and then made an abrupt turn toward the south and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nupon reaching home the next day i did some research. there is a small, old airport with a very long runway at burns flat, oklahoma. that would have been about 6 or 7 miles south of where i saw the object. further research shows that airport to be the home of rocketship global, a company that is developing a 'space tourist' craft. depictions of the \"rocketship xp\" online show it to be roughly the size and shape of a bizjet.\r\n\r\nwhat i believe i witnessed was a night-time test flight of the rocketship xp, with the plane landing at burns flat. it must have lights along

             \r\n\r\nit was a mild autumn evening and there was a football game going on over at the taft high school football field. the sun had gone down and i was sitting and having a beer with my dear friend and land lady at the time 'pearl c.'  as we were playing a game of cards and snacking in her living room. pearl's husband had passed away recently and i was now living in the rental house at the back of her property located on the last block of lucard st. i would often stop by her place first after i got off from work with my job at taft city school's to visit with pearl and her adult son 'ronnie' whom she cared for. i would sometimes visit with pearl and ronnie, enjoying a meal together with them, or a game or two of cards before heading to my place in the back for the evening. she told me that her son \"ronnie\" had contracted \"scarlet fever\" when he was a young boy causing permanent brain damage.\r\nas we played cards, we usually played some low music on her record player and i really wasn't paying any attention to the background noise of the airplane buzzing over the high school football field filled with spectators at a game- so, i don't know how she heard the announcement over the school's pa system that the local sky diving team was about to land on the football field during the halftime rah rah. the high school was a block and a half from our residence, with two rows of mostly modest single story clapboard bungalow houses that are between us and taft union high school campus. upon hearing the announcement pearl said \"let's go out and see the skydivers' show during halftime!\", though i could have probably cared less, really. not much of a fan of contact sports or anything related to football we went out to the front yard and we both watched as the airplane circled over the taft high football field, when pearl remarked to me \" did you see something fly by?\"  i remember responding with something like \"a flock of birds, maybe?\" while shrugging. i was thinking that i had caught something just out of the corner of my eye, but i wasn't sure. \"flocks of birds will sometimes fly in a v formation\" was my reasoning. we continued to watch as the plane circled above the field with the stadium lights on, the sounds of a high school marching band an outdoor audience; i was thinking it was taking quite a while for this show to start when we both suddenly caught sight of an extraordinary v shaped object consisting of 5 round neon green circles flying silently (west to east). it's size was about 100 feet across and about was gliding about 100 feet (or less) above the rooftops of the houses directly across the street from where we were standing and facing. \r\nour jaws literally dropped, pearl immediately grabbed for my arm in disbelief as we watched this object return gliding silently away towards the haze in the west. it returned before we could even compose our thoughts, now flying silently and banking slightly towards bakersfield as it traveled east again. \r\nit was unconventional in that when viewed from the side it looked to be only several inches in it's thickness if even that, incredibly thin in fact, not having any kind of fuselage or capsule present that could contain even the smallest human being; appearing similar to a long green neon tube in the sky from our perspective.\r\n as it banked slightly northeast it appeared as a thin slit of luminescent chartreuse, similar to a green traffic light in color and certainly as vibrant in effect as a traffic light. we watched as it flew away disappearing into a mostly clear sky. we looked at each other shaking our heads and said \"what the hell was that?!\"  only a quick moment had passed when this same formation returned again, flying at about the same altitude. heading in the opposite direction now towards the west. this time with it's flight path having moved again (south) and much closer to us spanning the width as it flew over lucard street in front of pearl's house. \r\nin hindsight, it might have been conducting a scanning the area, the way that it appeared to be methodically panning back and forth ( from east to west / west to east) while moving itself slightly more than it's own width with each passing a little further towards the south.\r\nby now the parachutists had started their descent onto the football field, we could hear the crowds in the stands cheering them on as the red smoke flares left their trails behind them in the dusk of the early evening sky. \r\nthe last time we watched as it silently flew directly over our heads and from underneath this craft  i observed what i would call a transparent molecular structure within these five precise lime green circles, the insides of which appeared to be of a kinetic nature, even electrical perhaps. to use a descriptive analogy, it's observable structure reminding me of looking into active cellular structures when viewed through a microscope.\r\nat this, my land lady in a state of panic, ran into the house and immediately called the local police station, after which she then contacted the local airport to make a report over the phone. needless to say that the response from both parties she contacted were quick if not ridiculing, to dismiss her concern about the incident. i responded to her attempts to explain to authorities with a smug \"pearl, they don't care and i wouldn't have bothered with that process myself\". i was personally offended at how she was regarded by the authorities and didn't care if anyone ever knew or heard about it. i knew that we had witnessed something extremely unique and completely unnerving. we were both really startled by what we had witnessed over the course of about 7 minutes, perhaps 10 at most.\r\nduring pearl's conversation with the local authorities and by her reaction from the attitudes given her about her report, i could see that they had made her appear psychologically questionable, perhaps drunk or demented and insecure about what she witnessed. we sure weren't any of those things.  i wouldn't have bothered with reporting anything to anyone and i told her that i was not surprised by their attitude. the airport ended the conversation with pearl by telling her that they would contact us should there be any further eyewitness reports or after conferring with the pilots in the air, i believe. \"right\" i thought. interesting however, that this object was actually flying somewhere between the ground and the airplane above that  was carrying these parachutist's whom you would have thought might have possibly seen something during their descent towards the field. was it also observed by anyone attending the high school football stadium or field that night? i don't know. in an unfortunate coincidence regarding the same aircraft that was carrying the parachutist's observed performing on that october evening in taft, california, an unfortunate disaster was also to occur a week or so after our ufo sighting:\r\n(taken from a report about findings urging ntsb/faa regulations regarding sport parachuting and flying safety)\r\n\r\non october 17, 1982, a military version of a beech d-18 crashed during takeoff near taft, california. the aircraft had 12 sport parachutists on board; none survived. the safety board determined that the airplane had been overloaded with a center of gravity that was well in excess of the aft limit. the board was concerned that the faa was not sufficiently attentive to sport parachuting operations and that the safety of parachutists was jeopardized by companies that didn't operate their airplanes safely. the safety board urged the faa to do a better job of defining its oversight responsibilities for sport parachute aircraft.\r\n\r\nindeed, this was also the same parachute team that performed the night of our ufo sighting, not to mention that my concepts about what is possible in our reality has been radically transformed ever since this sighting.  i believe that the location was a \"hotspot\" for sightings by locals at this time. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

flash paulse change color.It it just flu  stright at me. just a dull ruby light.I coul't figure out what it was.It was moving slowly toward untill it got over head them stopped .Now i/2 miles from houses.The light stayed over head for maybe 2 minutes hovering. the road was shaped like 1/4 moon lay it on its side and i was at bottom end on left.There was house 1/2 mile away at top end of moon.Half way between and top of moon there was another house.Thats the lay out.This stayed over me for bit then slowly started to move toward the house at top of moon.Whenit got there it stopped and stayed a few minutes.Then moved down to middle of moon and stayed there.While.All the time no sound so it could't have been a copter.The light never changer color just stayed the same.Now this thing started back toward me.No i was getting spooked. i came back over my head and stopped.I don't know the size with no clouds it might have been in space or maybe i could have reached up and touched it.Nothing about it changed the whole time i watched it. it stayed over head for a couple of minutes then started to move away.I was on a mountain top and behind me was town lights about 12 to 20

i was examining a vehicle outside the shop on the n. side of the building. there is a constant inbound and outbound flow of light,commercial and military aircraft, including vintage aircraft, due to our proximity to dfw, love field,addison airport and dallas naval air station as well as other municipal airports. i am also a private pilot.\r\n when this event occured, the prevailing wind was from the south, about 20mph, the temperature was approximately 58 degrees f., and there was about 20% cloud obscuration primarily to the north and northwest from my location. at this time, i heard the roar of a turbojet engine from the south of my location, but my sight line was blocked by the shop building.\r\n in a matter of several seconds i saw a military fighter climbing to the north at a high rate of speed,and the pilot may have been using afterburner thrust as it was much louder than the usual jet noises.The jet crossed over at an estimated altitude of 8000 feet. i've seen many training scenarios, mainly radio intercept operations like this all around this area, and i assumed this was simply another one.\r\n i then looked to the east, and saw another aircraft heading westbound as if on an intercept course with the jet from the south. i then noticed a third jet to the north on a southern course.The aircraft from the east and north were both generating exhaust contrails as they were higher and in colder air. after i'd noticed the jet to the north, i saw other motion to the left, or west, of my field of vision.\r\n i saw what at first appeared to be 2 jet aircraft in \"wingman\" formation, but as i focused my attention on them it became apparent they were not aircraft,at least not aircraft in the conventional sense.Both appeared to be 6 to 8 times larger than the military jets, but from the distance i was observing all this, i can't be certain.\r\n both were triangular shaped, but all 3 ends were spheres joined by what looked to be black tube or beam structures that formed the triangle shape. the spheres were silver irridescent,and at first appeared to translucent, until i realized they were reflecting the blue of the sky and sunlight.\r\n both maintained an east direction of flight at approximately 100 knots air speed at a right angle to the prevailing wind.It did'nt make any change in attitude, direction or altitude, or any unusaul manuvers.\r\n my immediate thought was that this was all a prank or hoax, and i reasoned that someone had built these \"machines\" from balloons and pvc tubing, but balloons would tend to fly with the wind, not across or into it.\r\n  i went inside the shop to obtain a pair of binoculars from our front office in an attempt to get a better look. i was back outside the shop in less than 20 seconds, but both \"machines\" had simply vanished and the 3 jets had all turned 180 degrees relative to their flightpaths and were all converging on the location where i'd last seen the \"machines\".\r\n i've related what i've experienced to 1 family member and 1 very close friend today, and now to mufon.I don't have any fear or dread of what i witnessed, and i don't have any worry of being ridiculed.\r\n i consider myself detail oriented and analytical both in my profession and hobbies. i try to maintain an open mind to any and all possibilities.\r\n \r\n ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

wanted to ask about something i have been trying to make sense of. i was living on guam, i was about 15.5 years old. i was sleeping at my sister's house because i used to babysit for her. i was born and lived on guam and in those days on the island the windows usually does not have screen over it, windows are just open with curtains to cover it. i guess because the wind comes through and cools the house off. this particular home, it was high enough off the ground that my 4 and 5 year old nephews that lives there can run under the house without hitting their heads. so at night i feel secure enough that i never felt afraid of anyone coming in the windows since it was too high off the ground. but on this one night, i was awaken by the rustling or something \r\nbrushing against the wall of the house right under the window in the bedroom i was sleeping in by myself. since the house was made of wood, the rustling was loud and was noisy so i woke up and when i looked towards the window i saw a figure with one leg in and was trying to bring the other in and then i gasped real loud that it popped its head in and seems shocked or startle when it looked my way. it finally was able to bring its whole body in and stood on the floor. my light in my room was on so i was able to see it. it was very long and skinny and had like a long oval head. it was so tall it had to hunch over. it came towards me, i was frozen and even though i wanted to move, i could not move even my fingers. i think i was either frozen in fear or just felt paralyzed. it had long fingers and it was wearing something like green. being from the islands i could not then compare it to anything i ever saw in my life. it head came so close to me i could feel its breath, it looked at me and moved its head like a preying mantis. it was looking at me in the eyes and then looked me up and down to towards my toes. it did that several times. i was there but i was so confused inside my head because what my eyes were seeing could not make my brain make sense of what this creature was. i knew it was not human, but it had legs, arms, hands, wierd fingers, and extremely tall. it looked like it was wearing green? and the hands were so white and pale it looked transparent. i really would like to know how to make sense of this thing. all these years and i try to ignore what i witnessed and it keeps coming back in my head and i cringe when i remember how close it came. for a few years after this incident i would not want to talk to anyone about it or explain to anyone what i saw. i felt foolish and my family made me feel i was crazy and then i get embarrassed to ever bring it up again. but after i saw your show tonight i realize that i ai should not be embarrassed any more. after a few years i did see a ufo and it was this huge light the size of a football field. it was so close to the ground i could see the blades of the grass it was hovering over. i try not to say anything because i did not want to get teased. after i had seen this huge light, i had another run in with some kind of creature, on the islands it was normal to have outside showers and i heard wierd noises from the chickens on the trees, and when i came out of the shower, i looked to the left and there was this light, it looked like someone took a sheet that was made out of light and threw it over a figure, it was not standing off the ground, it was about a foot off the ground. i did not remember anything after that. i could not even remember how long or where i went or if i went to bed that night. this happened at night about 8:30 or 9:00pm when i would take my showers on the weeknights. i hope you are able to at least tell me something about what i saw. \r\n ","distance":"20 Feet or

reacted rather passively. much to my amazement, no one ever really spoke of it. i don't think they really remember. it came back to me in a later age when i was doing some memory recall exvercises. my husband is always excited about my story but i never wanted to talk about it, not unlike you just had on tv from 2008 where the guy's family started falling apart because they didn't believe him. i felt sorry for him. i know what it's like to doubt yourself. i think \"why me\". why haven't these visiters shown themseles to the world. i must say, when you see snapshots and videos of ufos on tv, i always say \"are they kidding me\"\r\ni had a full view of a craft no higher than a telephone pole over my head and no one had a camera! oh well, i finally spoke of it and that's it.\r\ni know it would be hard to find out any information about it now. i know the policman (whose name i know) is no longer with us. some things are more easily remembered than others. i remember my coat, but not my exact age.\r\nthank you,\r\nmarilyn

park west subdivision in fairfax virginia to the drop point for our washington post newspaper routes at the corner of dequincey drive and commonwealth blvd.  as we were about 100 yards from the end of the street we noticed an object in the sky about ssw from our position maybe 20 degrees above the horizon, moving upward and to our left at about a 60 to 70 degree angle.  it was white, roughly rocket shaped with a pointed nose cone, a main body and what looked like tail fins at the back end.  the nose cone was about as long as the main body of the object was wide, the total length was about 5 times the width of the main body and the tail fins extended out about half of the width of the body and the length top to bottom was about 1.5 times the width of the body.  the object was absolutely pure white from top to bottom as if it was lit up by very bright spot lights or some internal light source.  it was completely silent as it moved through the sky, had no lights visible on it and no fire out the tail end typical of rocket powered objects.  it also left a visible wake trail across the sky as it moved through the air.  the whole time it was visible it appeared to move at a constant speed but decreased in apparent size as it moved away from us.  at some point we just couldn't see it any more so we stopped watching the object and went ahead and delivered our newspapers.\r\n\r\nwe first noticed the object because it was so bright in the night sky, the apparent size was so big and the fact that it was silent and left a trail.  the width appeared to be about one fourth or fifth the width of the house that it was above when we first saw it.  we had never heard of a rocket or missile that could fly silently like that so we thought it was some sort of ufo since we couldn't identify exactly what it was.  we thought the wake trail looked pretty cool behind it but we never worried about what it was since it was flying away from us.  it was definitely a curiosity and to date we have never been able to come up with an explanation for what it was.  we never heard any reports on the radio or tv about it and it never appeared in the newspaper so we are not sure who else may have seen the object.  \r\n\r\nthe date could be off by a year or more since i only know it was during the time i delivered newspapers, and the time could have been plus or minus a half hour since we didn't always start our routes at the same time every day.  in my 27+ years working on aircraft including 20 years in the air force i have never seen an object that looked quite like what i saw that morning.  \r\n\r\nanother time within about 2 years from this observation i was driving alongside a field in a developing fog when an area off to my left, in a pasture, was inexplicably illuminated.  let me know if you would like information about this other unusual event also.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

and forth. after staring at it for a few seconds, i noticed a few other stars near it moving the same way. it was only around 4pm so it was still very sunny with little cloud cover. after watching these lights move back and forth i saw a grey / silver colored \"u\" shape with orange/reddish lights at the tips of the u shape. i don't know if it was fire or lights coming out the tips but it would light up and then disappear. the u shape would sort of change shape. as if the u shape was split right down the middle and was sort of twisting into a straight line. while this u shape was changing shape and flashing red/orange lights the white lights or star looking lights would move towards it, then stop completely and go back in the opposite direction. there may have been more than 5 lights, i don't remember exactly the number but at least 5. i thought maybe it was a satelite but i have seen plenty of satelites before and they never changed shape or had lights moving into and away from them. they usually dont have flames or lights flashing out of them either. i was with a few other people and just so i knew i wasn't just seeing something that wasnt there, i pointed it out to them and after a few minutes of trying to show them where to look they definitely saw the same thing. this wasn't something that appeared and disappeared,, it was up there above new york city, and it wasn't going anywhere. i wish i would have had a telescope to see a little further. i had a camera on my cellphone but theres no way it would have picked this up during the middle of the day,, it was way to bright and the object was way to far away. i am going to purchase a telescope and go back to the yard and see if it's still there. if i do see it i will try to send a picture. i looked everywhere on line and there is no such satelite or experimental craft that even remotely look like this. it is possible that it's some secret satelite, but as of now i have not been able to identify it.  i see strange lights all the time, but never have any equipment to view it or take

and clear with tempurature about sixty degrees with wind gusts around 15 mph.\r\n\r\ni was driving at about 25 mph, heading north on logan from belview when i noticed a large object in my upper-right prepheral vision.  i focused thinking i saw a flying piece of trash.  the object was large.  i estimate the distance at about 1.5 to 2 miles to the north-east of my position at a height of 1,000 to 1,500 feet, but south of downtown denver.  clearly not a traditional fixed wing/ or roatary aircraft.  the object was solid in build with sharp right angles at its' corners with straight lines along the edges.  what i saw was flat, meaning, not 3 dimensional in shape although it might have been.  there was nothing surrounding the craft such as ropes, baskets underneath, or a cockpit as would be seen with a blimp. if it was a man-made baloon or blimp, then it was the first i've ever seen of that type.  the object was dark in color with a rough texture, a dark dirty-rust brown.  there were no lights, just the reflection of sunlight off the flat body.  \r\n\r\nflight characteristics:  flight path was from the south-east to the north-west.  object followed a straight line and was traveling at a moderate speed for a powered aircraft.  my best guess would be around 75 to 125 mph from my distance.  a military cargo-jet such as a c-141 would fly at about 130 to 140 mph at a height of 800 to 1,000 feet if it were dropping paratroopers during training.  a single engine cessna would apear to be moving slower, and a comercial passenger jet much faster at that height and distance.  if the object was an advertising banner, there would be an aircraft towing the object with some fluttering of the banner, but as stated, this object was the size of a football field and there was no fluttering.  the wind should have been pushing the object to the east away from the mountains or at least affecting its' flight movement, but it was flying very straight and smooth against what the wind typically does here.  i would estimate the trajectory of the object to be heading in the direction of golden, colorado from broadway and i-25, about where i last saw the object if my range estimates are correct.\r\n\r\ni've spent 11 years in the military and have seen or been on various types of aircraft to include jumping out of them.  i've never seen anything other than man-made flying objects.  i want to say that what i saw this morning was a blimp, yet the perfect controlled flight and speed was not blimp-like.  there has been so much in the media now-days regarding unidentified flying objects that i felt somewhat accepting of what i witnessed, but the incident was strange enough that i felt i should report what i saw although i'm very skeptical about saying that the object was from outer space.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

hovering for 5 minutes or so the object took off moving north relatively fast making no sound what so ever.\r\n\r\nmy son and i saw the object and even though we have been looking for it every morning

about the plymouth and kingston, mass. backroads. it was a bright sunny afternoon, temps in the 70's, light mixed cloud cover, somewhat breezy and pleasant. as i was cycling down the shore road which leads to \"rocky nook\" area of kingston and the south side of duxbury bay, i stopped at the side of the road about 1/2 mile from the bay to rest.I had a clear sky view from there of the kingston/ plymouth/duxbury bay region.I noticed a distinctly black circular/spherical object in the sky at cloud cover altitude hovering and fading in and out within the partial cloud cover. i thought nothing of it at initial observation; perhaps a large weather balloon, peculiar aircraft, or any number of possibilities. i would estimate the cloud cover height at about 10,000 feet, but would have to check the actual weather records. what initially intrigued me about the circular object was it's remaining fixed in place/ hovering as the clouds moved in their normal progression. the object remained in place for at least 30 seconds, and then started darting about in zigzag and then horizontal and vertical attitudes a seemingly erratic pattern. it then hovered/stayed fixed in place for another 30 seconds or so. from that point in time, about 2-3 minutes had elapsed already, the oblect/black sphere proceeded in arcing/loop like courses. by this time about 4-5 minutes had passed while i stood transfixed gazing upward at the roadside. there were several people in their front yard at the opposite side of the road, and i imagine they were perplexed at my remaining still while staying focused skyward. i didn't want to break my focus by alerting them to what i was observing, because past experience has proven that these anomalies often dissapear in a moment. this object/sphere ceased it's looping maneuvers at that moment (5 minutes had elapsed) and stood still. the object then proceeded in a distinctly straight nortwesterly course until it escaped my view beyond the tree
