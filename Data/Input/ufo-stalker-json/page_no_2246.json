i happen to look up at the starts because it was such a clear night, when i noticed that one of them moved slightly to the right?  i asked her if she could see the same thing, and she replied yes.  as we kept watching the star flew off to the right at a high speed, and this is facing north. then slowly one of the other two that were left move west then circled around the one star that was very still. suddenly the first star came back at a slower speed. the two moving stars made a complete circle around the lone stationary star, then all of a sudden all three flew at a tremendous \r\nspeed in three different directions. we stared for a while, but they never came back.\r\ni realized they were not stars, but i have an open mind\r\ni was exited to see that happen. we went inside and told her parents about it, but i don't think they believed us at all?\r\n\r\n2:  in 1961, my best friend an i went to the isle of white off of  the south coast of england. one night after a couple of drinks at the local pub near ryde we were walking back to our hotel around 12 midnight, and the stars were very very clear.  this would have been in august, exact date unknown. the thing as above happened, but with two stars that were circling each other, and suddenly took off in different direction. this happened within a period of about five minutes. after we happened we just walked home and discussed the sighting between us. the next day we heard on the radio that seven hundred people had reported the same thing, but the british airforce said it was weather balloons!\r\n\r\n3:  sometime in the early 80's i was staying with my parent in rye england,  after about ten thirty all the street lights go out and it gets very dark. it was a clear night, and from my parents house you can see all across the fields to the sea which is about four miles away. also north is dungerness nuclear power station.  at approximately 11.30 p.M. i took my dads binoculars out in the garden to look at the stars. all of a suddenly moving from  east to west close to the nuclear power station i saw a green ball of light that changed from green to red and back. it moved very slowly, and it seemed to be about a thousand feet in the air about two miles away. i ran inside and said to my parents that i would like them to look through the glasses and tell what they see?   of course they were astonished, but then my dad told me that one night he had forgot to shut the hose off which was watering the grass. he said as he turned the water off a very bright green light shone up the whole garden, so bright that it was like day, but green. he said it went very slowly moving n.W. and suddenly shot up into the black sky like a rocket, but no sound. my father was not the type of person to make up stories either, so i believed him.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

they have reported to me seeing this same object earlier in the year but i was not apart of witnessing that.)\r\nnow i'v stood on this balcony thousands of times, and there are numerous planes that fly overhead heading north towards either dayton airport or somewhere else, and they're are numerous hospitals in the area so seeing helicopters is a normal occurrence. \r\nwhat i proceeded to see was a fire orange color sphere ball (the color of a candle flame) and it was flying relatively slowly. standing on the balcony, attempting to judge its distance, it had to have been directly over the ohio river, it wasn't very high in the sky either, it was almost eye level with us on the balcony just a few miles away. it was moving to our right, so from the northern kentucky, downtown cincinnati area headed towards eastern indiana. as it flew it never really increased speed nor did it climb vertically or change its course what so ever. as it began to get more towards indiana we began to loose sight of the object, of course it was by this time we had finally got the digital camera out but it was too late, the object was to far off.\r\ni remember feeling extremely excited but at the same time disappointed because it was such a short experience. but on another note on talking to other friends from the area, this sighting is nothing new the kid who named it \"the flying pumpkin\" saw it multiple times in this area, another friend of mine said he saw the same object in the sky recently as well.\r\ni hope this helps and ill keep my eyes open. \r\nthanks for running such an awesome services, thanks to you.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":16664,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1119682,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04252009-0002","longitude":-84.5041996,"occurred":1240551300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,  Oval,  Sphere,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240551300000,"summary":"It was a beautiful orange sphere that pulsated sporadically, \"flying pumpkin\" as dubbed by a friend.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cincinnati, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:236532"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Seffner","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At 10 pm when coming back from the store, while turning into my neighborhood i caught a glimpse of something large in the sky. i thought i was imagining it until my friend asked me if i saw it too. it was large and like nothing i have ever seen. kind of tear drop shaped and it hovered. it was only visible for a couple of minutes and disappeared just as quick as it appeared. we searched our immediate area hoping to see it but with no luck. we did notice increased air traffic in our sky after this happened.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":16663,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":27.9836329,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04252009-0001","longitude":-82.2756468,"occurred":1240556400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Teardrop,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240556400000,"summary":"2 eyewitnesses saw a large object hovering.

after a night at the drive in.  we were on interstate 89 heading south just past exit 14 when i first noticed two bright lights in the sky.  i've sat on the tarmack at o'hare airport enough to know what planes look like when they're \"stacked up\" waiting to land at night and have their \"landing lights\" on.  that's what i thought i was seeing.  after driving a few miles i could see a plane that was flying very low, coming in for a landing.  this was on the left side of the interstate near the williston exit.  looking to the right i then saw what i again thought were planes in line to land...But now there were three of the bright lights.  the two on the left were closer together than the one that was farthest to the right.  as we drove a bit further down the road either trees or hills blocked the view of that part of the sky.  i commented to my friend that it seemed very odd that burlington airport would have 3 planes waiting to land...Ever, let alone at that time of night.  he said he thought the lights were too close together to have been planes.  a mile or two down the road, the interstate curves to the right as it goes down a hill...About 2 miles before the richmond exit.  i figured that we would have a good view of the \"same\" sky when we got there and then we'd have another chance to look at the lights.  however, we never saw the lights again.  the night sky was very dark, no moon...And no clouds.  i believe that, if the lights had been planes, we would have seen them again as they came in to land.  but we never saw or heard a plane landing (after the one we saw landing as we drove past the williston exit.)  the lights appeared to be a almost an orange color, but a very yellow-white orange.  size-wise, the lights appeared bigger than any star or planet i've ever seen in the sky.  i can't say that i saw the lights moving at all, except for seeing 3 lights after earlier having seen 2.  the more i replay it in my mind the more i am reminded of how the planes looked at o'hare airport at night while they are in line waiting to land.  (they also don't appear to move when still far away in the sky because they are, in essence, heading directly at you.)  it was the strangest thing i've seen in the sky in a long, long time.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":16660,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.4452778,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04242009-0007","longitude":-73.0991667,"occurred":1240560720000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Vermont","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240560720000,"summary":"Looked like 3 planes lined up waiting to land.

orion.\r\nmy brother and i were just closing the front door of our house for the night from the inside when my brother called me outside. he said look up there ��� he pointed to the sky above the area of the woodbine shopping centre. my brother exclaimed that there were two objects in the sky. i said they must be planes ���cause we live only minutes from the airport. i saw the two lights, one that i am certain was an airplane cause of the flashing light pattern and the relative size of the lights. the object of concern was a very large yellow light and was shaped like a star in the sky (basically round). this yellow object did not flash or blink like an airplane nor did it grow or shrink in size. it just stayed in the same spot for approximately 60 seconds, then moves to one side very quickly and disappeared. when i first saw it (and my brother too) an airplane had been in the same airspace as the yellow orb light thing. the airplane seemed to have come from behind the light (ufo?) and broke away hard from the shared airspace and the plane continued towards the airport and then out of sight. i have lived by the airport all my life (33 years) and i see airplanes every three minutes (i live 2 minutes from the airport). oh, as i am writing this i can remember the absence of noise. in fact, the street was very quite and looked like a dull haze occupied the whole street. i could only hear the faint hum of the highway off in the distance. overall, i must say that the yellow orb (ufo?) is not like any aircraft i���ve ever seen. my brother (older than me) was slightly shaken by the unusual sight too.\r\nthank you for your attention to my observation report.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

correction at the beginning, i typed users/ when it really is user without the s. youtube.Com/user/maineufohunter\r\n\r\n\r\nright now the video is in 2 parts at these links:\r\n\r\npart 1 ----> http://www.Sendspace.Com/file/gr3mug\r\n\r\npart 2 ---> http://www.Sendspace.Com/file/616jkw\r\n\r\nyou may be able to view the videos at a larger size over youtube by downloading the sendspace files.\r\n\r\nthis is a rare video, what i filmed was actually 2 u.F.O. crafts flying in the sky at the same time. make sure to fully watch part 1 and 2 because the crafts can be seen throughout. i filmed roughly 18 minutes of footage, they 2 u.F.O.S were flying around my house for about 1.5 hours.\r\n\r\ni first saw a u.F.O. on jan 27th 2009. this sighting was my second sighting on march 10th 2009 at 8:15 pm. ever since jan 27th i had my video recorder ready every night. u.F.O. #1 kept flying a strange pattern in the sky over and over until is finally vanished. it would fly all up around the sky stop at a certain point in the air, come towards my house then fly around to the front sky and it kept doing that over and over.\r\n\r\nu.F.O. #2 kept flying from the right of my yard towards the left then it would vanish through the tree line. it would appear again from the right side and it kept repeating that pattern. it is either u.F.O. #2 or a 3rd u.F.O. that flew directly over my house in part 2 of the video. i think it was u.F.O. #2.\r\n\r\nsometimes when i zoomed in on the crafts their strobe lights would force my camera to try and refocus, that's why it looks like my camera slightly zooms in and out sometimes during zoomed filming.\r\n\r\nthat night was really amazing. i have seen about 5 more sightings in march 2009 and about 7 so far in april 2009 being april 4th,8th,10th,18th,20th and 20th (2 seen in same 24 hour time period).\r\n\r\nthe crafts would change up their light patterns, turn instantly in the reverse direction, change speed patterns, hover, hover downwards, and they flew in patterns that i have never seen any human aircraft fly before.\r\n\r\none one night in april a u.F.O. flew 60 feet over my house, the strobe lights from the craft lit up the fog and i could see the u.F.O. with 100% up close clarity. i could tell it wasn't any man made craft. i estimate 60 feet because i know how much 40 feet is because i have climbed many 40 feet climbing walls before, also i estimated the height of the trees next to my house as a reference also.\r\n\r\ni think this is some of the best u.F.O. footage out there right now. also there is a certain spot in hermon maine that the u.F.O. frequently hover over and even have possibly landed at. i may investigate that area in hermon over the next few days.\r\n\r\nhere is my maine u.F.O. hot spot thread that i originally started --> http://boards.History.Com/topic/ufo-hunters/ufo-hot-spot/520045963\r\n\r\n\r\n fyi, none of these crafts were airplanes or helicoptors or jets. i have seen enough of those in the daytime and nighttime to be able to tell the difference between them and u.F.O.S.\r\n\r\nthese u.F.O. were flying very low in the sky opposed to the normal aircrafts that fly high in the sky in a straight line to their destination.\r\n\r\nnotice how these u.F.O.S flew in strange patterns and stuck around for 1.5 hours...","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16652,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.8409744,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04232009-0018","longitude":-69.2642,"occurred":1236741300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1236741300000,"summary":"2

vegas, nv.  we planned to view and record the 10pm siren's of treasure island show and had been one of the first people to arrive (sometime around 9:15pm) and we moved to a position directly in front of the hotel.\r\n\r\nthere is not much to do during the 45 minutes leading up to the show, so my wife began talking to people next to us and i was observing the low-flying commercial and private aircraft that were departing mccarran int. airport and flying almost directly overhead from east-to-west.\r\n\r\nas more people gathered, sometime between 9:45pm and 9:55pm i noticed a group of people a short distance away from us (maybe 30ft to 40ft) looking up toward the sky and pointing.  my immediate thought was that they were looking at another aircraft as it flew overhead.  i glanced up and could not see anything out of the ordinary...I looked twice, trying to guess the general direction based on where the people were pointing but there was nothing obvious to be seen -- no aircraft or helicopters of any kind.\r\n\r\nwhile i was distracted by looking for whatever the distraction was in the air, the crew for the sirens show had raised a sheet or screen on the deck of the sirens' ship.  i asked my wife when they put that up and she said they had just raised it.  i glanced at my watch and it was almost 10pm.\r\n\r\ni started my video camera and aimed it at the screen aboard the sirens' ship while i continued to observe the people nearby looking up and pointing into the sky.  obviously, more people were looking up and pointing than before and i would guess at least 20 to 30 people were looking up at the sky instead of being ready to watch the treasure island show.\r\n\r\nonce again, i looked up and took a couple of moments to allow my eyes to adjust.  there were no aircraft overhead, so i assumed it must be something much more faint and harder to see than a boeing 737 at 1,200ft.\r\n\r\nthat's when i saw the object.  it was almost directly overhead, but i would guess that i was looking northward and upwards at an angle of at least 80 degrees.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was a triangular formation of lights...An open v-shape, perhaps 3-times wider than it was tall.  the leading point of the v was directed several degrees west of due north...Assuming the las vegas strip runs directly north-and-south, i would say that the formation was pointed and moving on an approximate 340-to-345 degree heading.  in the one-to-two seconds that i first observed the object, i concluded that it was not a commercial airliner, nor was it a formation of individual aircraft.  it appeared to me to be a single object, flying at an altitude much greater than that of the departing aircraft from nearby mccarran.\r\n\r\ni made a comment out loud to my wife, which you can hear on the video, and i attempted to frame the object with my video camera.  i had the camera lens zoomed in for preparation for the show, and was unable to obviously capture the object on video.  i tried to use the nearby lighting post (one of the many theater lights used for the treasure island show) as a reference guide to frame the object, but either the lens was zoomed in too tightly or the camera's iris could not adjust quickly enough to the change of lighting conditions.\r\n\r\nin the background, i heard emergency sirens from somewhere nearby on the strip but i could not say if they were police, fire, or ambulance sirens since i did not turn to look behind us.\r\n\r\ni directed my attention back to the treasure island show as it began moments later, and was unable to continue to observe the object.\r\n\r\nthe total event lasted at least 8-12minutes based on the actions of the crowd and the people who saw the object before i did.  and i have no idea how long the object was in view after i stopped observing it.\r\n\r\ni am a licensed private pilot, an amateur videographer, and professional graphic artist.  i have uploaded the video from the event and a photoshop image depicting what i saw.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

very clear and fairly dark night.\r\n\r\ni saw a bright light, about the size of a star, heading due north.  i have seen satellites on very dark nights before so i assumed that's what it was due to it's apparent altitude, size, brightness, etc.\r\n\r\nabout 30-45 seconds after i first saw it, it travelled past what i assumed was star, just slightly west of it's path.  as soon as the first object passed the \"star\", which was stationary (obviously since i thought it was a star), the second object moved directly behind the first and followed it for about 30 seconds or more before it veered due east at a high rate of speed, not so fast that i couldn't follow it but much faster than the first object.  it turned very sharply when it turned, not quite a right angle but it was an extremely sharp turn.\r\n\r\nas the object passed over my head i had to turn towards the house and my vision was a bit obsucured by porch lights, but i could still see the objects.  i had called to my brother a few times and he came out of the house after the second object had turned east.  he only came outside in time to see the second object, now heading eastward, but the first object had travelled far enough that it was obscured by the house lights and/or trees because i could no longer locate it.  the second was also soon obscurred by trees but its course at that point was not especially fast or erratic after it had turned away from the first object.\r\n\r\nthere was nothing remarkable about the color or brightness of these lights and i could not make out any shape.  they did not flash or vary in brightness at any time.  they were just points of light.\r\n\r\nthe entire event was only about 5 minutes long maximum, probably less.  i would guess that the objects travelled from a position driectly overhead to about 45-50��� from the horizon in this time.","distance":"Over One

bill. i took i believe it is hwy 27, you can look on the map , it may be hwy 28, but as i got on the long  quiet hwy that seems to take forever to get to dardanelle, long boring road, i noticed a star in the sky that had a tail attached, it seemed to be way out in the universe, a few minutes later , i saw the same star alot closer up to the upper left of my drivers side window, and it appeared to be alot closer,... as in hovering over the nebo mountain. i thought oh its the radio tower but still felt on edge and watched as it moved with in a 100 feet of me and i could see florecent lights 3 , on each side of a triagular figure. i kept thinking i am close to nebo mountain that has to be their lights, but the lights moved closer, i became really scared... rolled up my windows, ran off the road twice trying to get a good look and i saw the same rotating lights 3 on each side of a triangle. my car started a constant vibrating sound(soundelike a flat tire)i started to call 911 and my phone was dead, it was fully charged . then all of a sudden there was a flash, like a light bulb had totally illuminated the road and my vehicle. and then the drive home was non-eventful, my car was driving sound and secure and as i drove futher i was no where near mt, nebo.Although i watched my vehicles clock the entire time , there was no missing time in the event./  what also i would like to add is that this is the second encounter of ufo activity i hve encountered, and 3 othter people in 3 different places can back me up, because in or around 2003 or sometime in that area, 3 different people have seen what i have seen in three different places at the same time. also we have a nuclear plant in london arkansas, it is not far from us, we are in the evacuation route area if this helps any.Also when i got to work i checked my tires and all were fully inflated, no signs of a flat. my phone did not work the rest of the day , i had to fully recharge when i got home, i didnt think it
