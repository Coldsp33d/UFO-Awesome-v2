overhead.  it wasn't until it was starting to go pass me that i noticed there was a red light some distance ahead of the plane, maybe 2 or 3 plane lengths, moving at the same speed and trajectory of the plane behind it.  as the they got close to a tree line, the red light disappeared, although it may have still been there but beyond my sight.  the plane and the red light seemed to be locked in place, so it might have been a light on a very long extension from the plane nose, or maybe the plane was following a second plane with only a red light (i did seem to hear two planes).  i couldn't tell what type of plane it was, it was a large plane, not a personal aircraft, but it was not long enough to be a passenger jet and didn't look like a fighter jet of any sort, it was more short and squat but large.  i got the impression of the plane chasing or just following the red light.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16643,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.958152,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04232009-0011","longitude":-83.3725656,"occurred":1240376700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240376700000,"summary":"Plane

12:20am on the 19th  m and the second time just now was at 12:45am in the same location of the sky.\r\n\r\ni first noticed the object when i was looking out of the front double windows of my apartment which has a clear view of the sky above the highway.  i was making coffee at the time and just looking outside while waiting.  i noticed this bright strobing light hovering in the sky in the general area of the highway and, as a curious person, stood and watched for a bit.  at first the object didn't move, but then it began to move north to south back and forth a couple of times, pausing to hover ever so often, before it dissapeared out of my view.  \r\n\r\nmy very first thought when i saw this was helicopter, but i've never seen a helicoptor that changes colors.  when i first noticed the object it was bright orange.  the second color it changed to was a red.  the third color it became was green.  and the final color was a bright white.  the object also appeared to be flashing very quickly like a strobe light.  at first i thought this could be rotor blades of the craft passing in front of the light making it appear to flash, but after it changed color several times i discounted this theory.\r\n\r\nhovering above the highway here seems a little odd to me at 12:20am to 1am.  even when there has been a bad car accident(which there hasnt) it seldomly happens.  fort knox is only 11 miles from my location, but they do not conduct flight training there.  \r\n\r\ni can't say if this has been happening more often than the two times that i happen to notice

(i will not mention the actual name of the lake to protect all these discoveries so i will call it matawini lake)\r\n\r\nit all started the last time i took a plane ride over matawini lake. suddenly, i saw something i never saw in my life, either in photographs or in any exploration or discovery program. i saw from the plane what seemed to me to be a meteor crater right on the top of a mountain. a very, very deep crater, completely vertical like if a meteor would have come from a 90 degree vertical angle straight down. it was difficult to evaluate the depth from a fast moving plane, but judging from the relative size of the spruce trees, it could be from 300 to 600 feet deep, maybe even more, with a perfectly circular little lake at the bottom. the best way to describe the shape of this crater, is to imagine you are flying over a giant elongated trumpet that has been put on the vertical axis with the large opening on top, and you are looking straight down into it...\r\nthat is exactly the shape of this crater. so, for many years, i thought it was a non reported meteor crater i had discovered.\r\n\r\ndiscovery of celestrial civilizations:\r\nuntil some years later... when i eventually discovered the whole reality of the existence of celestrial civilizations, and i began to study this whole subject very seriously, and have now become to a certain degree a knowledgable person on the subject. i learned about the underground vitrified tunnel technology extraterrestrials used, and the very ancient underground bases that have been developed by them on our planet. then i began to reconsider the origin of this crater. one aspect was appearing significant to me under this new light. this crater was positioned right in the central axis of this very large lake and this lake has a very rare triangular heart like symmetrical geometry that is unique in the world. this lake could easily be seen and identified amongst the many thousand of very irregular shaped lakes that exist in the laurentian area even from a high distance in space.\r\n\r\nat the opposite end of this central axis where this crater is located, there is the position of the ancient megalithic sacred site i discovered at the age of seven.\r\nthat makes a lot of perfect geometry for a meteor crater ... the odds that a meteor would have strike at random with all this perfectly aligned geometry seems very slim to me. but, it would be a very convenient position in a visual geometric grid created by the unique geometric shape of this large lake, if someone would want to have an easily retracable position for an extraterrestrial underground base entry i thought!\r\n\r\nunder this light, the megalithic structures of the matawini sacred site seems to consolidate the possibility of the extraterrestrial origin of this crater and this very unusually deep vertical crater and it���������s perfect geometrical positioning seems to confirm the potential of extraterrestrial origin of the megalithic structures of the matawini sacred site which are also possibly quite unique in the northen regions of america. this is also in some way confirmed by the indians i spoke to who told me it was not them that could have build such large stone structures, because they were nomadic tribes that travel lightly.\r\n\r\nso, at this time i was having this whole reconsideration of this crater true nature, i read a story of someone who had tried sending telepathic messages to extraterrestrials and it did work. so, i decided to try it myself. i sent a clear telepathic image of this lake shape with the central axis position of the crater and the position of the sacred site at the opposite side of the axis, asking spiritually advanced extraterrestrials to go see this crater and check if it could be an ancient base entry that they might have forgotten about and see if they could use it again for their purpose.\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nmy first ufo sighting:\r\nnot long after i began sending these telepathic messages, one evening in the summer of 2007, as i was playing my chamanic drum and doing chamanic chanting outside on my patio in montreal, i had my first ufo sighting !\r\n\r\na very powerful bright flash, many times more powerful than the stronger flashes that can be seen from aircrafts, doing all kinds of behaviors that no planes ever do. being stationary, changing the rythm of the pulsations, stopping, restarting, moving vertically, changing directions ect. ect. ( after this first sighting i began to study with a lot of attention for many mounts all the possible caracteristic and behaviors of plane lights and flashes and never did i saw anything that matches the behavior that occurs in these ufo sightings.)\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\nsecond ufo sighting:\r\nthere was a second sighting over montreal again as i was playing my shamanic drum and blowing in my conqshell outside, with these same very powerful flashes and that time, at a point, i felt a beam of communication of energy of love coming from the ufo straight to my heart chakras. i could see the beam of spiritual energy linking the ufo and my chakras with love, and felt a very real spiritual connection with the source of this love.\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nufo sighting at the maniwaki indian spiritual gathering:\r\nthen, the first weekend of august 2007, i went to a great indian spiritual gathering 400 miles up north of montreal in maniwaki, an indian reserve, to meet william commanda a well known indian great chief & chaman to inform him of the discovery of this ancient sacred site. william commanda have personally met the great zulu chaman credo, so i am convinced he is well initiated into the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. william commanda is also the heir of some major sacred prophesies ancient wampum belts. these ancient prophesies where made before the coming of the white europeans to north america. they have prophesied step by step all that has happen more than 500 years before the series of events they describe. it also prophesied that 500 years after the terrible demise of their great spiritual civilization by the hidden hand of the illuminati that have used the christian church institution as a cover up for the same kind of cultural and spiritual genocide that we the white race have also been subjected to 2000 years ago, that the voice of wisdom of the indigenous civilizations of north america would be rising again after 500 years of total oppression and that by than, all on earth would see and understand it's great wisdom and sacred guiding path it points to, for a new age of harmony between humans and reverence for mother earth. ( www.Circleofallnations.Org )\r\n\r\nbefore i traveled to maniwaki, i had asked telepathically to the extraterrestrials, to give me a confirmation of the extraterrestrial nature of the crater and also to tell me if my discovery of the matawini sacred site was related to this crater. the confirmation i asked them was to follow me 400 miles up north of montreal to the maniwaki spiritual gathering and to appear there as a confirmation of all this ...\r\n\r\nthis sighting during the maniwaki spiritual gathering happened after i had made the transmission of the sacred site publicly to the elder william commanda, and after i had the privilege to do some shamanic singing at this gathering. i was talking to a man that was facing me, then suddenly i see his face change and he pointed the sky with his hand saying look! i turned around to look in the direction he was pointing, and there it was, the same very powerful bright flashes... i saw during the 2 first ufo sightings i had in montreal. the celestrials had followed me 400 miles north of montreal, to this great spiritual gathering in confirmation of my questions, and also in open support and confirmation for my relationship with them. the way these ufo manifest, they are not just flashes, there is a very strong intense communication or communion that happen when these flashes appear. there is an immediacy of knowing that it is a ufo communicating with us. a kind of instantaneous certainty without a doubt that it is so, a true deeply felt spiritual communication.\r\n\r\nwe are not alone anymore...We have friends... the great brotherhood of light of the celestrial is here. thanks god ...\r\n\r\n( i discussed with this man afterward, and he told me he had never had any interest whatsoever in ufo���������s in his life, he did not even believe in ufo reality, and like me, he had the absolute certainty it was a ufo at the very first second the powerful flashes appeared. i was very glad that someone else than me had seen and experienced this sighting, it comforted me in the authenticity and objectivity of these sightings.)\r\n\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nufo sighthing at the matawini clear area circle\r\nwhere the spherical stone appeared:\r\nthere was another sighting at the large clear circle area in the forest near the location where the spherical stone appeared when the lightning strike thunderbolt coming from the sky hit the ground. i had brought the spherical stone with me, and i was sounding my conqshell toward the sky of this summer day. i always had the intuition that this spherical stone, among it's many gifts, may also be a potential communication device to communicate with the extraterrestrials. my seeking was answered. eventually, i saw in high altitude a meteorite like trace of light following an object, but with a trajectory that was going up at a sharp 45 degree angle (which commercial planes or meteorites do not do) and then after a while the object suddenly completely disappeared in an instant in a clear cloudless area of the sky.\r\n\r\n__________________\r\n\r\nblue katchina crop circle that appeared on the 24 oct 2007 :\r\ni have been a contactee since last summer of 2007. i have had 3 sightings last summer, and subsequently, i had a crop circle appear in a circle of pine trees where i go meditate and do chamanic rituals of sacred singing and drumming. what is meaningful i believe for the ufo researchers community, is that this crop circle appeared on the exact date of the explosion in size greater than the sun, of the blue katchina 17/p holmes comet that occure the 24 october 2007. when i discovered the crop circle, i became white.... speechless, this place was like holy, there was like a radiance not of this world all over the pine circle area, like it had become a holy place... this crop circle had 2 sun shapes and another smoother circular shape that was slightly larger than the 2 sun like shapes. i believe the hopi prophecies do mention the eventual occurence of 2 suns. i understand that many informed people around the world, are poundering the possibility that this most unusual stellar object and it���������s sudden expansion in size could indeed be the blue katchina, the last sign mentioned in the hopi prophecies.\r\n\r\ni am now sharing with the celestrial civilizations researchers community this information as this crop circle astronomical message and the date it appeared seems to be a confirmation from higher powers from above, that indeed this 17/p holmes comet is the blue katchina blue star.\r\n\r\ni have heard of other crop circles that have been in advance prophetic of the coming of the blue katchina, but this is the only one to my knowledge that has occured on the very same day of this event. my interpretation is that the larger of the 3 circles might represent the blue katchina that is now of a larger diameter than the sun. as for the 2 suns like circles, one might represent our sun, the other nibiru. that is the best interpretation i can make of it at the moment.\r\n\r\nallusions to a potential rescue operation:\r\nanother meaningful element that was associated with this blue katchina crop circle, is that at the same time this crop circle appeared, about 500 pine cones i had gathered from the ground and used to make domes of about a hundred pine cones at the feet of 5 of the pines trees, have completely disappeared ...\r\n\r\nthe message i read in this symbolic mass abduction, seems to confirm in a symbolic way, the possibility of a rescue operation phase where the celestrial would come and abduct to the safety of their craft and planet, those on earth that are ready and willing to go on to another more spiritual phase of evolution.\r\n\r\nif i take into account this blue katchina crop circle, plus the abduction of 500 symbolic humans, and the next mass ufo sighting i had that lasted 2 hours on the 4 of july 2008, where a clock like geometric representation was drawn in the sky by about 6 ufo���������s, indicating the 2012 countdown clock has now reached the last hour, and it is coming very fast ...\r\n\r\ni f i take into accounts the information that have been transmitted by the tall blonds extraterrestrials to miriam delicado, and that are explained in her book, all this combines to indicate that there may be events of a great magnitude that are imminent and that the celestrial civilizations may play a role to rescue the humans that are spiritually advanced enough to be harbour and be given safe heaven in order to safegard the considerable amount of work it has taken to bring us to the level of evolution we are at now.\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n2 hour long multiple ufo sighting & 2012 countdown clock:\r\n\r\non the 4 of july 08, an almost 2 hour long sighting occured after i played my chamanic drum outside. this sighting was different then the 3 preceding ones, in the aspect that the ufo���������s involved did not manifest with the very powerful bright flashes i had seen in the 3 previous sightings. the intensity of the light pulsation was more attenuated, like more discrete and possibly higher up in altitude. this sighting had 3 phases. it started with a single ufo, that progressively crossed the sky from left to right, doing all kinds of movements and behaviors caracteristic of ufo���������s. then, suddenly, there was a central episode that had the same characteristics as a mass sighting i remembered was described in the book of an important contactee from vancouver, miriam delicado, who in her book blue star ��������� fulfilling prophecy, tells the story of her firsthand contacts with the tall blonde extraterrestrials since her childhood.\r\n\r\nthis common sighting involved a geometric structure made of multiple ufo���������s positioned to create a half circle formation in the shape of a letter c in the sky ... the ufo���������s positioning themselves with absolute precision like a grid of dots following a perfect arc.\r\n\r\nas it was occuring, i immediately remembered the c letter formed with dots, that was mentioned in this book, and likewise, there was a missing dot at the top, and i knew in advance what would happen... and it���������s exactly what happened, a ufo appeared in the geometric radius center of the c, and moved at a fantastic speed to go fill in the missing dot position at the very top of the c letter shape made of multiple ufo���������s. there must have been 6 ufo���������s minimum that were there in formation to create the c letter shape, one for every hour of the countdown clock.\r\n\r\nmy interpretation and understanding, is that it represents the countdown clock to 2012...\r\nthe half circle arc, represents the left side of a clock. the missing dot at the top is the 12 th. and last hour. so it signifies: we are now at the eleventh hour of the final countdown, and the 12 hour is now imminent... prepare... it may happen very fast ...\r\n\r\nso miriam delicado, on the canada west coast in vancouver and me on the east coast in montreal / quebec, since this recent sighting that occured in montreal the 4 of july 2008, we both have received the exact same message from our celestrial star brothers.\r\n\r\nthe last tableau of this tryptique sighting, is that the original single ufo then become accompanied by a second ufo, and the two remained together flashing for almost half and hour in the same position.\r\n\r\nthen, i decided to start to wave my hands to them in sign of joy, love and gratitude for their presence and goodwill towards us, and then the two ufo���������s started blinking with more intensity and faster pulsations. i continued waving my two hands to them in great gestures so they could see me even from that far, and then, a third ufo appeared close to the original ufo. i felt more joy and happiness and continued to wave for about 10 minutes to the 3 ufo���������s, then, i see a forth ufo appear, a few minutes after a fifth one, i felt the more i waved at them, and the more joy i felt, the more they responded with their presence, then another one started blinking, then higher another, another one, all blinking so beautifully, so joyfully, it was a celestial brotherhood between them and me, between the sky and earth.\r\n\r\nat that point, there must have been around a dozen ufo���������s blinking ... i then realized that i had previously had some kind of spiritual vision of this mass ufo sighting when i was meditating at the sacred site of matawini during the previous summer. and then i was there, seeing in the sky the true manifestation of this vision i had ... they were forming altogether, a circular constellation of ufo���������s, a sacred circle in the night sky...\r\n\r\n__________________\r\n\r\nsighting of 2 ufos in diagonal configuration in montreal- from astraelia\r\ntuesday 4 nov 2008 around 6.30pm.\r\n\r\ni was outside in the beautiful indian summer night, looking at the sky. i was sending telepathic waves to our brothers the celestrial that are in mission around the earth in the invisible spectrum.\r\ni was asking if i should go to the sacred site of matawini tomorrow for 2 days as i was planning, and i was asking if there was any plans from their part to further contact evolution at the sacred site.\r\n\r\nthen i noticed what seemed to be 2 very bright stars appear in front of my eyes where i was gazing. there was very few other stars in the sky at that early time of the evening around 6.30 pm. they were not blinking like planes, they were in a diagonal formation an angle like when the time on a watch is at 11 oclock, i was strongly attracted to them and it seemed to me they where moving very slowly, moving together like locked on at the same distance & speed in a cluster moving in the same direction. i found a tree top to use as a fix point to be sure that they were moving and yes, affirmative they were.\r\n\r\nso at that point it was clear it was classic ufo shamanic language if i can express myself in this manner. clear for the initiate, invisible for the non initiate. than after the moment i realized this was a genuine ufo sighting and in answer to my request, then with discretion, the 2 ufo started to progressively fade out into the invisible spectrum mode together, one staying visible a few seconds longer. the fade out was very progressive and lasted a good 10 to 12 seconds. i than knew it was their answer... yes i should go, they will be there in heart or in sight but they will be there.\r\n\r\ni then went in my room to take the spherical stone that appeared in the lightning strike spiritual experience i had with my girlfriend coming back from a visit to the sacred cave of matawini.\r\n\r\ni then put the medieval music the hymn to ste-cecilia from pursell, and with the spherical stone positioned over my heart chakra i started to sing and do a sacred ceremony in spirit with the celestrials and all the sacred world of light that all initiates in all ages, in all times have seen and known. it was the most powerful heavenly and lightful moment and concert, i really felt fully connected to them. i was healed by this connection, inspired, one with all that is. i felt the awesome power of the sacred stone. i felt i had succeeded in awakening the sacred spherical stone, and that it confirmed to me it's purpose is also to communicate with the celestrial. this is one more of it's powers it is revealing. the power to unite the sacred dimension of the celestrials with our dimension and make us all become one. it seems to be a portal stone, that has the power to open a spiritual sacred dimensional doorway. this was one of the most beautiful moment of my life. an inexpressible communion.\r\n\r\nwe are blessed my friends, more than we have ever known. more than we ever hoped or wished for, we are ... believe it. great things are in the making, it has been shown to me and to many initiates. the powers of above are coming back to earth. it is time that we play the role we have been sent here for, within ourself first and foremost. and also within the circle of initiates that we are.\r\n\r\nwhen i was at the site, after i rested in the evening after a day at the sacred cave, i saw one pulsating light in the night sky, and it was not moving, it kept pulsating steadily at the same position for around 7 minutes. so they were at the rendez-vous.\r\n\r\ni also saw something i never saw before, 3 huge meteors in the same trajectory within 5 minutes almost visually an inch wide compare to a hairline width that normal meteors are. they were huge and auto luminescent.\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the 2 ufo diagonal sighting:\r\nthe angle of the diagonal of the 2 ufo is the angle of the 11 th hour of the clock. again, like the previous mass ufo sighting of the countdown clock of 2012 i saw this summer over montreal, that was similar to a sighting of miriam delicado in vancouver, there seems to be this message of the final hour draws close, prepare...\r\n\r\n2 diagonal ufo sighting is an international phenomenon.\r\n\r\ni have received a email from someone in montreal that saw the same 2 ufo in diagonal formation over montreal at the same time i saw them around 6 30 pm and saw them fade out together.\r\n\r\nthere is more about this ufo sighting than i thought. i have found on a internet forum that this exact sighting configuration has been seen in many different countries and at different dates. the exact same configuration i saw. two ufo in diagonal moving very slowly, that appear like 2 very bright stars, non pulsating, that moves together and than progressively fade out in the invisible spectrum.\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\norbs of light:\r\none day on the matawini site, i was taking some photos of a mysterious smooth tunnel like large rock formation that i call the tunnel of the wind. when i took the photo i did not see anything particular. but i had a surprise when i looked at the photos on the computer. on   one of them, there was a bright orb of light that could be seen flying by in this mysterious tunnel.\r\nthis orb must be about 2 feet in diameter. at first i thought that it could be simply my finger that had passed in front of the lens of the camera and produced this light phenomenon. so for a long time i thought it was my finger who had produced this strange anomaly that never occured before in a lifetime of taking many thousands pictures. but one day i decided to clarify this mystery. i went and took my camera and tried to put my finger in front of the lens, and it was impossible... the zoom lens is quite long and it is just not possible to have a finger cover the lens area. it was a genuine orb of light i had captured. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

impossible in my point of view. on the evening of 9 april i was testing to record video and pictures of the moon with the telescope. now my normal photo equipment would not work and i could not attach the video camera somehow. the only way i could record some was with using my microscope camera and it worked well. i used a camera effect ���reli���f��� , this provided me more contrast in the pictures. 14 minutes after eleven there was a nice moon and i started to record and did a bit observation. i did not see anything by then. when i looked back the recordings i noticed a worm flying by. after closer examination it appeared to be a straight formated like objects flying with high speed between the moon and the telescope. i am wondering the high altitude , the high speed and the very

october 2008 \r\nat that night we ( my dad , girlfriend , daughter son and me ) stayed in a rented upper floor of a nice house in merzbach, germany , close to our family were we spend our vacation with. my girlfriend and i are smokers and we had to smoke on the balcony, i did that at 22.00 hour on my own , went to the balcony, sat down and started to smoke. i looked over the rail and you can see the lights of rheinbach , a little town nearby. nice view and cold. then i noticed a very bright star. straight above rheinbach . now i took a good look and noticed that it could not be a star! somehow i could see it was within our atmosphere so quickly yelled inside 'ufo ufo !!!' , my son was asleep and stayed so and my daughter rushed out of her bed towards the balcony. seconds later my dad together with my girlfriend appeared from the living room. clever of my girlfriend to bring the camera along. i took it over and at 22.06 i started to film. http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=o5q6dnaqczo&feature=playlist&p=bbb26cc1bc8bbed4&index=0     . i recorded five minutes and after a short moment of filming i putted the camera on the rail of the balcony because i did not had a tripod with me. the rail was rounded a bit , thats why you see the pretty straight left right and up down movements. hard to balance but much better then free hand. this recording has been witnessed of four people. during the first recording my daughter, girlfriend and dad went back inside because they where very tired. i kept on filming , i was very excited.The orb star object stayed stationary for about 15 minutes and left very slowly to the distance. the second take (22.36) i noticed the 'orange cloud' . thats how i saw it with the naked eye.When i zoomed in on this 'cloud' it appeared to be a fleet of orbs? i don't know. zoomed some times wrong. the recording take 2 is pretty horrible and hard to see. on take 3 (22.43) the star orb like object returned. this one is a real great recording. the orb were getting more colorful flashy orbs and even at one point it glows up very bright. much brighter then sirius, after that it breaks apart. it looked like if it were different orbs holding together and let go after a while. on the little camera screen however it came on to me as it was an airplane. i did not put this one on the net for four months. when i took a good look again after that four months i discovered it never could be a plane! and put it on the net then. take 4 , 5 and 6 are recordings of the fleet or cloud. it moved , i had to film it free handed and at a certain point of time i could push the camera against the roof for better stability. \r\ndue to .Dv to .Mpg to youtube the quality became worse. i have this sighting in dv files and can burn a dvd from it.For the highest quality for research etc. please contact me!  greetings and one love hans (umo, liberty studios)\r\n\r\nps made some compilations to, i like to do that because i am an artist and this one has nice stills and other enhancements.   \r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=hm9dytwgspa&feature=channel_page","distance":"Over One
