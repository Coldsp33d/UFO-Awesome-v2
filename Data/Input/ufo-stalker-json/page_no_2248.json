driving on a gravel road @11pm near community of boydsville when they sighted a beam of light slowly moving through a wooded area near the road.  he stopped the truck and watched as an object shining the light came into view slowly moving just above the trees.  he asked his wife if she was seeing what he was seeing. she stated yes.  he discribed the object as over 400 foot long with large windows about 8 foot in size.  the object then traveled slowly away.  at the rear were large glowing blue lights.  he discribed the color of the lights as being welding arc blue and just as bright. the object moved away i believe to the west and was lost sight of near a large ditch. \r\n\r\na friends mother in law who lives in the same area has been complaining of people looking into her windows late at night. oddly she discribed the peeping toms as very tall and very skinny with egg shaped heads. she stated that her border collie was hiding under the bed at the time of the incident.  my friend noted strange behavior of his animals also.\r\n\r\nonly thing odd that i have seen was a flash of bright blue light that appeared for only a second or so sometime the same weekend i think it was on friday the 10th. i was on the north side of the city of rector when i caught a glimpse of the flash. the flash seemed to be traveling from east to west and was located southwest of town. really thought it was a shooting star before i heard of these incidents.  the flash struck me as odd because it was very bright, much brighter than any shooting star that i have ever seen. i have seen alot i have worked nights for over 10 years.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16612,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.2631185,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04212009-0018","longitude":-90.2926008,"occurred":1239346800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1239346800000,"summary":"Large

was in the front yard of my residence in northampton, ma looking towards the sky.  i had my fathers \"maglite\" during this time.  i remember it was approximately 10pm.  out of nowhere from a southern direction, came a bright light, white in color, and a steady beam.  it was as fast as a jet would travel, but then it just \"stopped\" in an instant.  the light was still on.  i could not hear anything, as i was expecting to hear the \"chop\" of rotor blades.  the light continued to remain on.  i shined my flash light back to the object.  the object then moved in a 90 degree angle, again as fast as a jet and stopped.  this happened a few times over the time of a minute or two.  all of the sudden, the light was gone.  i have attempted to make sense of what i saw that evening for the rest of my life.  i thought it could have been a spot light like the ones at the fairs, but it was shining down, not up.  there was not a cloud in the sky for any type of reflection to take place.  there was no way it could have been a helicopter because of the speed and immediate stops.  during the time that this encounter took place, i was almost in disbeleif that it was happening.  i was attempting to make some form of logic of what was taking place but couldnt.  i have told several people of this expirience during my life, but never really followed thru because of the stigmas associated with these types of things.  as fast as it appeared in the sky,  it just dissapeared the same way.","distance":"Over One

shriner temple, at around 9pm waiting for the traffic to clear out after a rollerderby bout, looking north from the parking lot towards piedmont park my daughter (age 12) and i noted this object that we thought was a chopper taking off from the hospital. i realized there is no hospital in that direction as my daughter asked why it didn't blink. the object rose diagonally to the east, dropped came to a halt and moved back west and became brighter. from our vantage point it appeared to never go above the skyline or break the cloud ceiling. as it continued a short distance west it climbed, and grew brighter. it was then that i asked a group of people talking nearby if they would tell me if what i was seeing was real. one of them said it was a chopper and then had to quickly withdraw that opinion when the craft dropped down and east and appeared to flicker and vanish. the initial sighting was around a minute long. then we joined the group in looking at the sky in that direction and making wise cracks to one another about spacemen. about 3&#65533;5 minutes passed and it appeared again low in the sky and began to rise straight up and list from side to side. people were saying it must be a bunch of balloons maybe, or a large kite. then the object moved very suddenly and rapidly to what appeared to be the north. it just seemed to get smaller and dimmer and be heading away from our pov. it rose and moved west and we lost site of it from a car pulling into the lot we were in and hitting us in the face with their headlights. again, talk of what that object could have been arose. not a hot air balloon. not an rc chopper/plane. no faa lights. halting and suddenly moving, not enough wind to carry a kite or push balloons around. very strange. we were all getting a little anxious as more people joined in who had been other parts of the lot and seen the same thing. there was air traffic overhead. but all were easily identified. jets passing through the cloud ceiling. blinking lights. we saw a helicopter. all of these other things in the sky were making this one even more odd. it returned a third time after about 5&#65533;7 minutes. this time coming in low from the west and gradually growing larger and brighter. again, it was perceived to be approaching. a passerby was stopped and shown the object that he identified also as a chopper and then also had to correct himself. that's no chopper, what is that? exactly. we watched for a minute as the object continued to move erratically and do things no plane or swamp gas could ever do. a commercial liner was flying in what to us looked to be the direction of the object but at the height of the clouds so we could see it moving in and out and its silo and know that object was a jet. as it came closer to the object the steady glow became a strobe briefly and it dropped straight down then moved east and accelerated and climbed. we all we completely blown away by the last sighting and the group of about 10 were still scanning the sky to the north. there were a couple who insisted it be a chopper or maybe something else, but what? they couldn't say. everyone else was awestruck at what we think we had just been witness to. it really was a flying object that could not be identified with any amount of certainty by anyone who saw it.\"\r\n\r\ni saw it; i was there. i am a skeptic by nature, but this gave me pause. the... let's call it a ufo... the ufo moved effortlessly in every direction it headed; and, by that, i mean it moved on all 3 \"contemporary\" axes (x, y, and z), but it did so in such a fluid manner that is was arresting. it was brilliant and beautiful, and then it was gone. and then it was back again! it came and left a number of times, and every time we saw it, it continued to fly in illogical directions, performing impossible path changes. good flyin', fellas.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

the stars, which is something i do nightly, when i noticed what i first thought was a commercial airliner. as i watched i kept waiting for it to move and/or change course as they do as they fly over and near to my house. it was pulsating red, blue, and seemed as though it had a continuous white light.\r\nit never moved. or at least it looked very stationary. i could see it between two of my neighbors houses directly behind me to the west. i continued to watch for approximately 10 minutes when i decided to go inside to get my binoculars. i came back outside and it was still in the same spot.\r\ni looked through the binoculars, (a very inexpensive set of vivitar 7x50 297ft. at 1000 yards with coated optics), and could see the pulsating red, blue lights and again, what seemed like a continuous white light.\r\nthe white light could have been pulsating too, but it seemed as though it was not. i couldn't hold the binoculars still enough so i moved further back on my porch to one of the posts for the roof on the porch and steadied the binoculars against the post and just watched. as i was watching it i also noticed two other small lights that were close together, but to the lower right of the pulsating reb/blue orb, but they were at a downward angle, like this, /. they were also pulsating back and forth to each other. they seemed much further away from me as well as from the other larger orb.\r\ni watched for a few more minutes and then decided to come inside to get on my computer to check the mufon site for any recent sightings and descriptions in this area. i also wanted to see if i could figure out if it was a star, but i don't know the latitude/longitude. i was on my computer for about 10 minutes before going back outside to see if it was still there.\r\nit was. but the two smaller lights were gone. i then called a friend of mine and his wife who are both interested in ufo's. he handed the phone to his wife and i began giving her a description of what i was seeing. they live in bellevue. she went out onto her deck/patio to look in my direction to see if she could possibly see anything from her location. she said she could see a plane flying in my direction so i watched for the same plane and when it was within a count of 5 i counted down to one until it was directly \"over\" the orb so she could tell where i was looking. she said she could see it and that it was indeed pulsating red/blue/white.\r\nas i was chatting with her about this object and helping her to find it in the sky, i looked back to the object and it had moved enough that i had to walk out into my driveway to the back of my car in order to see it.\r\nit had moved north and west. while talking to her and looking through the binoculars, i kept having to take a step or two backwards every few minutes in order to be able to see it. i walked backwards far enough that i ended up crossing the sidewalk in front of my house and stepped into the street. it took about 10 minutes to get from the rear of my car to the street. by this point i could no longer move back without standing in the middle of my street, which is a busy road and there's a streetlight which made my viewing difficult. i continued talking to my friend on the phone about this possible sighting for about another 5 minutes, went back inside my house to set the binoculars down and went back outside. we talked a few more minutes and i wandered back to the driveway to see if the orb had returned or moved into sight again. i didn't see it at first, but when i began to walk back to the porch i spotted it. it had moved south. my neighbors house behind me is a 2 story with a small 3rd story addition which has a covered deck/porch. i spotted the orb through their 3rd story porch. i ran back inside and grabbed the binoculars again.\r\ni watched it move very slowly to the south for about 5 more minutes until i couldn't see it because of trees and houses.\r\nthis orb/object pulsated red/blue/white the entire time, which is what made me, at first, think it was a commercial airliner. it seemed to be  stationary for a very long time, roughly 20 minutes or more. when it did move, it moved very slowly. it first went north and west and then south before i couldn't see it anymore.\r\nit looked like it was probably over the puget sound.\r\ni will be watching for it every time i go outside now.\r\ni also noticed that someone else posted a sighting of a red/blue/white pulsating object in arlington, wa. not too long ago. i wonder if i observed the same object?\r\ni'm anxious to know what i was seeing and anxious to see it again.\r\ni wanted to get in the car and drive in that direction for higher ground with less light, but my camera is broken and i know cell phone cameras don't work well with distant objects especially at night.\r\ni will definitely keep my eyes to skies and will report any further sightings.","distance":"Over One

jogging and i was on the bicycle.  we were on a road (settlers pass) heading eastbound when i saw an orange fireball in the southern sky.  at first i didn't know if what i saw was a street light or a helicopter with a spotlight in our direction or maybe a meteor.  as i slowed down the bicycle i briefly lost view of the fireball behind a house.  i wanted to make sure what i saw so as i kept rolling east i saw the object again and it was flying northbound towards our direction.  i was surprised that it did not have any blinking lights like all the other aircraft that i see fly over.  i told my wife about it, she had already finished her jog before me spotting the fireball and was walking to cool down.  she thought it was strange too.  it flew almost directly over us, just a little to our east as it kept going north.  it moved the same speed as any other aircraft that i have seen.  by the time that it was some 2 or so miles north of us, it must have sped up because the light got small really fast and eventually we could not see it anymore.  i wondered if anyone saw it.  i did not report it to the police because they probably can't do anything about it.  i don't know if this was an

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"There was a group of three lights, first seen at about ��� mile distance while i was riding in my best friend���s car in the passenger side.  these lights were over my neighborhood when seen and my ride back home to my residence took me and my best friend, the driver, right to where this ufo was at.  the lights first looked as if they were a plane coming in to land at the local naval air station, nas oceana, but there were no flashing lights and only a cluster of solid white colored lights.  when we arrived at the location of the ufo, above amethyst circle, i realized that the ufo was so low that the pine tree in the yard of the two-story house just to our right front had blocked it from our view when we tried to pull up slowly to get a better look at it due to our low profile to the ground, where if standing or walking, we could have gotten closer before this blocking of our view of the ufo.  so, i told my friend to stop the car and we waited for the object to emerge from atop/behind the cover of the pine tree, which was probably just a little higher than the top of the two-story home next to it.  my first thought was that the ufo was a helicopter, with how low it was to the ground, but there was no audible sound.  the ufo took approximately several seconds, five to fifteen, to emerge from behind the not-extremely large, but good-size pine tree for a residential area.  when the ufo became visible again, i could clearly see three white lights in a triangular formation, approximately three stories off of the ground, with no structure visible whatsoever, as this night in particular had what i can only describe as a completely black sky, with winds gusting up to 25 to 50 mph, as it had rained earlier in the morning before the sighting.  the lights of the ufo, with the glare included, i would estimate to have been at most the size of half the width of a standard, inexpensive, capped pen held at arms length.  i would also state that the glare produced by the lights did not present a clear shape or outline, other than being able to conclude that there was a round point of light visible in the night sky, versus being able to see a square or oval shape and glare, for example.  i would also estimate that the brightness of the lights of the ufo to have been equal to that of a standard aircraft���s white lights, when viewed under dark sky conditions at close or distant range, given how i originally thought that this ufo was a larger aircraft in a landing pattern for naval air station oceana.  the ufo was traveling at most, 1 to 3 mph, with the size of the triangle of lights estimated to be between one to two times the size of a navy jet-fighter, which i have seen fly over me at close range on numerous occasions.  the ufo was also traveling in a completely level flight pattern, in a straight line, parallel to the street we were on, topaz lane, coming toward us and the direction we came from.  it took approximately 30 to 45 seconds for the ufo to reach a position where it was nearly overhead of my friend���s car, just to the right of me, causing us to stretch our necks to look at it.  at this point i opened the passenger side car door and was about to get out to stand to look at the ufo, but as soon as i did this, the ufo began to make a 90 degree left turn, as i could see the triangular formation of lights begin to turn, just like as someone would say, turning on a dime, but there was no curved flight travel of the ufo as it made the turn, the light formation seemed to just ���swivel��� in order to make a 90 \r\ndegree left turn.  as the ufo turned, it emitted the most haunting sound i have ever heard, which i found most disturbing, as it was not like the scream of a jet engine or any type of aircraft or engine noise i have ever heard, but it was more like a chorus of human screams alternating in tone, pitch and frequency with the sound seeming like it was almost machine-like at the same time.  this noise was very loud, but not as deafening as a jet flying that low, however, it was still quite audible, as we had rolled down our windows to be able to try and hear what it was when we first saw the ufo.  the ufo continued on the path of the 90 degree turn it had just made and passed over a home in amethyst circle, to our right, with no alterations in its heading, disappearing from our sight.  it seemed that the ufo almost picked up speed by about 1 to 2 mph after it had turned, but this could have been a trick of the perspective of my view changing.  the noise from the ufo continued until it was out of view.  my friend and i attempted to pursue the object in his car, but to no avail, as it seemed to have indeed picked up speed or made a course change after we had lost sight of it.  the ufo passed the distance of left to right from either side of amethyst circle, a court, with about five to six houses in it, all with modest size yards, passing from overhead of the yard on the left side opening of the court when facing it, to above the yard on the right side opening of the court when facing it and then traveled the depth of amethyst circle when the ufo turned and then disappeared over a house on the back edge of the court when one faces it.  many months after the sighting, i started driving past amethyst circle slowly every time that i could, as it was on my way home to my residence and i finally realized that the house on the back side of where i saw the ufo disappear overhead had a pine tree in the backyard, which appeared to have had the very top of it broken off to leave a bare section of the top of the tree trunk visible along with the broken edge at the very top and this being visible without me having to turn into the court to view the tree damage.  i would estimate this pine tree to be about the same height of the other pine tree which had impeded our view of the ufo, after the top had been broken off, making it about three stories high.  this damage was visible until i moved from that residence in 2006 and since then, the top of the pine tree has re-grown foliage.  the damage to the pine tree could have been caused by a nor���easter or one of the near miss hurricanes or tropical storms that frequent the east coast of virginia, but i strongly felt it to be a confirmation that there was a solid structure to the triangular formation of lights, which both myself and my best friend witnessed in early 2003.  i can only surmise that there was a structure to this ufo, between and perhaps extending outward from the triangular formation of three white lights, which was invisible to both my friend and me due to the very dark black sky conditions that night.  there was no fog or precipitation at the time of our sighting, only gusting winds. see inlcuded digital photos that show an artificial approximation of the different locations and lights of the object.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

i noticed a very bright white light moving very quickly at a low altitude. it's speed caught my attention immediately. it was in the western sky, heading north. i only saw this object for about 20 seconds until it disappeared due to its low position in the sky behind some buildings. i did not hear any sound however it may have been too far away to hear an audible sounds. while observing the object, it moved with a slight arc downwards toward the ground. \r\n\r\ni checked the nasa website and confirmed the iss was not visible at this time as i have seen the iss before. however this object was far brighter than the iss and moved much faster. \r\n\r\ntypically, planes fly over this area from logan after taking off heading east to west at a low altitude (somerville is about 3 miles from boston logan). the direction this object was traveling was not a normal flight pattern for any commercial aircraft. on this night, the winds were calm and planes were not taking off over somerville. i confirmed this on the passur airport tracker software on the boston logan massport website. one aircraft at the time i witnessed the object was heading west near somerville which is not the way i saw this object traveling. so whatever this object was, it did not appear on boston's airport radar.\r\n\r\ni hope this information helps and anyone else who saw the same object should be encouraged to report it as well. \r\nthank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

3:00 relative to our position just to the right of the moon but slightly lower in the sky. the object was close enough to the moon and being the only two visble objects in the sky at the time. we used the moon to approximate the size of the object to be roughly 1/3 the size visually than the moon.\r\n3.) as i said before my wife was the first to get a solid look at it but she could not identify it as anything rational. she imediately said something to the effect of \"look at that thing, that is the weirdest thing i've ever seen...What is it?\" at which time i leaned over the steering wheel to see if i could spot it. what i saw i could not explain. frist let me say i have had some limited flight time in addition to being a member of the frederick chapter of civil air patrol as a teen so i have seen many planes in the sky at least enough so that i could identify coventional aircraft. so at my first glance the first thing that came to mind was a helicoptor due to the shape and that's exactly what i said to my wife before leaning back. my wife however said \"there is no way that's a helicoptor\" so i tried to get a better look. upon further inspection i realized it was definately not a helicoptor. the shape at first appeared like a giant reddish orange pork chop (hence the helicoptor connection) however i realized that the larger side which gave it the pork chop shape was actually light reflecting from the sunrise more so off one side then the other making the object appear larger on one side. it seemed to be a large cigar or pancaked shaped craft made of some highly reflective material. \r\n4.) the object appeared stationary or moving very slowly the entire time of the sighting wich only lasted about 10 min or so. the size and clarity of the object is what was so odd. my wife starred at it in amazment for a solid 7-8 mins increasingly getting more and more excited.\r\n5.) at first our feelings were that of intrest or confusion while we tried to make sense of what we were seeing. i thought maybe it was even the space station or satilite but it didn't move like that. my second thought was a star or planet as it was early morning and i have seen a planet increase in brightness before dissapearing giving the illuision that something was moving. however upon closer inspection of the shape of the object this notion was quickly dissmissed as it was to miss-shapen to be a point of light unless it was being refracted by something, which is still a possibillity.\r\n6.) at this point we were extremely exited knowing this was definetely out of the ordinary even if could be explained later by conventional means it was still something you don't see everyday. at this time we are convinced that this is something out of the ordinary and i immediately yelled to her to grab the camera. my wife went for our video camera which was on the floor between her legs next to our still camera (we were heading to the aquarium so we had both with us) this is were things got weird. my wife quickly pulled out the camera and turned it on (this entire process took maybe 10 - 15 seconds tops while she did so i leaned back into driving position loosing site of the object) and that quick everyting was gone. the only items left in view were the moon and some planes or jets way off to our left (on the opposite side of the car). we made no turns on this stretch of highway and at no time was our view obstructed. the object we observed was completely gone without a trace in less than 15 seconds time after almost 7-8 minutes of continuous observation. this left both of us in awe and completely dumbfounded.\r\n\r\nif anyone has a explanation they can offer or would like to discuss our sighting further please feel free to contact us. my wife and myself will be happy to answer any questions regarding this in hopes to gain some answers.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":16581,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.6454629,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04202009-0004","longitude":-77.7161932,"occurred":1240060500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,  Disc,  Teardrop","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1240060500000,"summary":"Erie and unexplainable.
