after a rollerderby bout, looking north from the parking lot towards piedmont park my daughter (age 12) and i noted this object that we thought was a chopper taking off from the hospital. i realized there is no hospital in that direction as my daughter asked why it didn't blink. the object rose diagonally to the east, dropped came to a halt and moved back west and became brighter. from our vantage point it appeared to never go above the skyline or break the cloud ceiling. as it continued a short distance west it climbed, and grew brighter. it was then that i asked a group of people talking nearby if they would tell me if what i was seeing was real. one of them said it was a chopper and then had to quickly withdraw that opinion when the craft dropped down and east and appeared to flicker and vanish. the initial sighting was around a minute long.\r\n\r\nthen we joined the group in looking at the sky in that direction and making wise cracks to one another about spacemen. about 3���5 minutes passed and it appeared again low in the sky and began to rise straight up and list from side to side. people were saying it must be a bunch of balloons maybe, or a large kite. then the object moved very suddenly and rapidly to what appeared to be the north. it just seemed to get smaller and dimmer and be heading away from our pov. it rose and moved west and we lost site of it from a car pulling into the lot we were in and hitting us in the face with their headlights. \r\n\r\nagain, talk of what that object could have been arose. not a hot air balloon. not an rc chopper/plane. no faa lights. halting and suddenly moving, not enough wind to carry a kite or push balloons around. very strange. we were all getting a little anxious as more people joined in who had been other parts of the lot and seen the same thing. \r\n\r\nthere was air traffic overhead. but all were easily identified. jets passing through the cloud ceiling. blinking lights. we saw a helicopter. all of these other things in the sky were making this one even more odd. \r\n\r\nit returned a third time after about 5���7 minutes. this time coming in low from the west and gradually growing larger and brighter. again, it was perceived to be approaching. a passerby was stopped and shown the object that he identified also as a chopper and then also had to correct himself. that's no chopper, what is that? exactly. we watched for a minute as the object continued to move erratically and do things no plane or swamp gas could ever do. a commercial liner was flying in what to us looked to be the direction of the object but at the height of the clouds so we could see it moving in and out and its silo and know that object was a jet. as it came closer to the object the steady glow became a strobe briefly and it dropped straight down then moved east and accelerated and climbed.\r\n\r\nwe all we completely blown away by the last sighting and the group of about 10 were still scanning the sky to the north. there were a couple who insisted it be a chopper or maybe something else, but what? they couldn't say. everyone else was awestruck at what we think we had just been witness to. it really was a flying object that could not be identified with any amount of certainty by anyone who saw it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

was an electronics mechanic assigned to the control tower at the u.S. naval base at rota, spain. i daily checked with air controllers to see if any immediate repairs were needed. i entered the control tower at approximately 0830. two controllers were in the tower not paying any attention to a very large spherical object at the east end of the runway. it's hard to say how far away it was because i don't know the size and it is hard to say the size since i didn't know the distance but it was large. it appeared spherical but there was no shadow because it radiated a very white light. it was like looking at the sun but it didn't hurt my eyes. i ask if it showed up on radar and was told that the ground controlled approach radar was down for scheduled maintenance. i did see some pilots go to their planes on the apron to light up their radars but never did hear if they had radar acquisition. i had a strange urge to bow down to this thing. may say something about my mental stability. i mention it in order to record all that i remember.\r\n\r\ni ask what in the hell it was and nobody knew. they said it was there at 0600 when the controllers woke up from their nap. they slept on watch as there was almost never any traffic after midnight. the exact arrival time is therefore unknown. i was told that it at one point ascended at an extreme rate of climb. near instantaneous to around 50,000 feet. moved slowly to the south east and hovered over the port area. we had both missile boats and fast attack boats. i hovered there for minutes then did the climb and slow drift to it's original position where i saw it. \r\n\r\nat around 1000 i went up to the tower to see if it was still there and the tower was full of naval officers including the c.O. of the base. there were no intelligence types that i saw. air ops, air traffic control and others who were assigned to the air terminal building. there were secretaries from around the building. at some point one of the officers ask if we should scramble the air force. the c.O. said that they would just laugh at us. \r\n\r\ni returned to work and checked periodically. after noon chow the object had moved to the southwest and hovered over the atlantic ocean until 1700 when i got off work.\r\n\r\none thing that may be related is a strange action by base security. i don't recall how much later but sometime later, maybe a month or more, the air traffic control division and the ground electronics division was called to base security. we were given a story about fissionable material being missing from the weapons department. we had to carry radiation dosemeters which nobody did. i ask why we were involved since we didn't have access to the weapons dept. and was told not to be a smart ass. \r\n\r\nthe dates are approximate because there has been many years passed since the incident occurred. i will say that at the time i questioned whether the object was extra terrestrial or perhaps earthly and experimental.

high-altitude passenger-type jet passing from east-to-west (i was looking north towards the main house) with the usual white contrail.  as the jet passed by, i noticed an object slightly above the contrail that appeared to be blinking/flashing in an irregular pattern.  it was approximately 45-50 degrees up from the horizon.\r\n\r\nat first, i thought the object was another plane coming towards me (from my viewing angle), but as i watched it, i noticed that the object was stationary.  after a couple of minutes more, making sure that it wasn't moving, i attached a 70-300mm lens to my digital camera in order to snap some pictures.  as the object was essentially a point, the camera had a difficult time finding focus, so i manually focused to 'infinity' and snapped several pictures.  the pictures aren't terribly crisp (or, at least, it doesn't *appear* crisp to me), but i have several showing the object at varying levels of brightness.\r\n\r\ni also got the attention of the two people in my party to verify that they saw the object and that it, indeed, was not moving.  i walked to a spot where i could align my sight of the object with a fixed-position structure (pergola on the garden grounds) on the ground in order to be certain that the object was not moving.  in the approximately 10 minutes of observation from this spot, the object did not appear to move at all.  during this entire event, the object continued to flash/blink in an irregular pattern.\r\n\r\nour party continued to walk back up the path towards the main house.  i would periodically re-acquire the object at various times on the walk to the house.  i snapped a few more pictures with a less powerful 18-55mm lens, but i cannot find the object in those shots even though i know it was in the center of the frame.\r\n\r\ni attempted to find the object after we concluded our tour, but cloud cover had increased making finding the object difficult/impossible (provided that it was still there).\r\n\r\ni felt that the blinking/flashing was from light being reflected from the surface of a shiny object.  the blinking/flashing could have been due to rotation of the object, but it is (in my opinion) more likely due to thermals in the atmosphere.  i was a bit excited to see the object, and pleased that the people in my party observed it as well.  i'm not saying that what i saw was from another planet; rather, that i have no idea what it was.  it didn't behave like an airplane (it was stationary for long periods of time), it didn't behave like a balloon (again, stationary), venus (wrong spot in the sky...I think), or anything else that i'm aware of.  i suppose that it *could* have been a weather balloon...Regardless, i'd very much like to know what it was if anyone has

light traveling up the mountain right behind my house. originally, i thought it was the brake lights of a car traveling very fast up the road on the mountain. then i realize that the light was not on the road when it traveled straight up very fast to the top of the mountain and was still heading higher. at this time, i yelled for my daughter to come outside and see what i was looking at. she knew before she ever got outside what it was because we have had other sitings in the last year from our back deck. when she came out the light began to travel towards us. this was the first time that we both actually got a little nervous because it just kept coming closer to us just above the tree tops. i ran in to grab my camera and ran back out and it was still there just hovering about 100 yards away still above the tree tops. the light was extremely bright and the object made no noise. i took the picture and the flash went off on my camera. we then realized that the ducks down at the creek behind our house were quacking very loud and the dogs in the neighborhood were all barking. after, i took the picture and the flash went off the light seemed to began to vanish right before our eyes. i couldn't tell if the object was getting smaller, moving away, or just disappearing. within a matter of seconds the light had completely disappeared before us and then ducks and dogs seemed to quiet instantly. from where we were standing on the back deck if we were to hold up a quarter that would be about how big the light was. we continued to stay outside looking for it for about another 15 minutes but didnt see anything more. we have had other sightings including crafts zooming over the mountain stopping and hoovering while changing colors then disappearing and a single bright white light that flew over our house very low then returned a few minutes later to disappear right above us. this particular white light was a triangular, silent,silhouette. i have attached the picture i took with my cannon powershot a410. the light was alot closer, larger and brighter than what my camera picked up. maybe someone can zoom in on the light in the picture and get more detail about the object.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

from the east and the other approached from the west and as they got close to this object it shot straight up and disappeared in 2 seconds. i have never seen anything move so quickly. my best friend lives near us and as she was leaving for work that night(works third shift) her and her husband saw the samething happening. there have been other sightings in this area and i am sure that there will be more. i am not surprised at all about seeing these ufos i am sure we are not the only planet in this vast solar system with life and to think we are is to me quite arrogant. i believe there have

sunrise highway, a well traveled roadway.  the park was closed for three days.  brookhaven national labs was called in.  a large flatbed truck brought something large back to the lab.  my brother, who worked on the lab at the time, told me that they had an alien, alive, on the lab property.  he told me this shortly before he died in 2006.   he told the same thing to my mother, and his family in real time., at the time of it happening.  there are reports saying there there is film footage of the event.   the spot of the crash is still obvious from ariel view.   the trees are twisted and turned about.  some of them are bent.   and it is reported that there is no electro magnetic field where there should be there. \r\n\r\nin order to corroborate my sighting information i offer you this report from the paranormal investigative group. long island oddities:  i have also enclosed a picture of the twisted trees.\r\n\r\n \t\r\n\r\nsouthaven park - the crash\r\n\r\nthe most coherent information on southaven was located in the liufon press release on august 3 1998. the actual crash occurred at 7:00pm on nov. 24th, 1992. a man was driving east on sunrise highway heading toward william floyd parkway. there was a patch of trees separating sunrise from montauk hwy. to the south of sunrise he saw a large craft that he describes as, \"tubular in shape with two large bright blue lights on each end with a bright white light in its center whose structure was composed of a dull metallic grey texture\". he saw the object make a very tight right angle, cross the highway, and crash into the woods of southaven park. when it hit, the object emitted a dazzlingly white beam that was said to turn night to day for a moment.\r\n\r\nthe same man turned and came back on the other side of sunrise to backtrack and find the source of the crash. he saw helicopters near the exit to william floyd pkwy. neither the helicopters or the personnel that came to block off the westbound exit to william floyd bore any markings or insignia and the men were dressed in plain black. finally he went west on victory which was closed off later, and reached the second turn on gerard ave. this street and its neighbors would soon report all manner of electrical glitches, phone ringing with no one there, and tv static. at this time though our witness could see a huge fire back in the woods.\r\n\r\nat the same time someone also driving east on sunrise saw an oval shaped object fly over the town dump hill, \"on a descending course 30 degrees to the horizon which was leaving a green ionization trail as it passed\". could this have been part of its crash trajectory? the oval craft or one like it may have been scouting out the local area because there was an incident \"reported over islip town which were seen on the channel 12 news in march 1992 at the bagatelle road exit of the long island expressway\".\r\n\r\nsome researchers say even now that there are areas of southaven that have the trees bent as if almost torn out of the ground at some point in their growth. on a scouting mission we think we found such a site. we also found a good aerial shot of the area that shows a large roundish area that has no trees at all. the photos are below.\r\n\t\t","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16552,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.8014876,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04172009-0011","longitude":-72.8676033,"occurred":722660400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New
