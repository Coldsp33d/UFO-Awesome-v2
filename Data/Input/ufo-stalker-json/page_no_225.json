which was across the road. suddenly she spotted an odd hovering oval like ball of light that appeared out of nowhere. it had just turned 11 pm and she rushed inside to get me. i walked out into the garage and saw it too. at first i thought it was just a lost airplane but it wasn't moving, and there are no air ports for miles around. not only that but we live in the middle of nowhere, hours away from any big city. we agreed we should check it out, because it was over private property and we had animals to look out for. as soon as we crossed the road in my mother's car it started to move. we followed it further toward's the back of the farm. suddenly it disappeared. we stopped and waited. it was odd because we couldn't hear anything, not even crickets or cicadas and it was in the middle of summer. suddenly it reappeared, but back towards the south. we reversed and followed. it would suddenly descend then ascend. the second time it took us towards the back (aka the north) it disappeared once more. then suddenly it came back with a second weird white oval. they both hovered before shooting forward a small ways. then one by one disappeared. we never saw either one again. our small town has more cows than people, and most are over the age of 50. there's no way it could have been a normal plane or helicopter.","distance":"N/A","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

in the sky directly overhead and saw in the distant sky a small triangle. it did not move as i observed it for several minutes. i went in the house to get my wife. i had not described what i had seen at all to my wife only that she needed to come out and see something. as i returned to the dark area i could no longer see it as i looked upwards. i said, \"i think going into the light affected my eyes and can no longer see it\". she exclaimed, \"no, i see it\". i asked where and she pointed her arm various directions saying, \"there, there and there, its a triangle\". it was apparently an equilateral triangle. i said \"wow, it must have dropped straight down, it was a tiny (in comparison) triangle in the sky.\"\r\n\r\nwe stayed there and looked at this thing in awe. we observed a (possibly convex) surface between the lights but if i had to say what i think i saw is that surface was projecting an image of the stars above it, as if there were a camera on top of the triangle and the lower side was a huge display screen. i worked as a television engineer i was accustomed to observing slight variations in brightness and contrast and i felt i was seeing a false image of the sky above through this triangular object. the black of the sky inside the triangle was not as black as the night sky. also because we could see the lights and the apparent surface we estimated that this object was quite close and quite huge, no it was massive. my wife claimed to see some slight disruptions in the surface such as portals, but i could not see them. we estimated that night, it must have been 300 yards across. we observed it for probably 1/2 hour, the whole time discussing what we were seeing.  it did not move at all during that time, not in the least that we could tell. we agreed to not discuss what we had seen. we had discussed every detail of what we were seeing in that 30 minutes between us and felt there was nothing more to observe, and went inside. the object remained. amazingly, it did not seem ominous or scary neither of us were afraid. we were quite surprised though to see something so big and so close, even though it was an attempt to camouflage itself in the night sky it was not 100% effective. \r\n\r\nthe next day our neighbor to the back came running through the field asking us if we had seen anything the night before. we both denied it and asked what he saw. he said it was a triangle and it was huge. i then admitted we had seen it but agreed to not discuss it.  later, my wife and i went near a local football field knowing it was 100 yards across and as i stopped at what i figured to be the approximate distance of the object in the sky the night before. i asked my wife if she agreed the football field was now about the same distance as the object in the sky the night before . the triangle we had seen was three times the size of the football field confirming our previous estimation of 300 yards.  \r\n\r\nalthough i make this report many years later i can say for certain the date. you see my neighbor that also saw it, had connections to phoenix az. he had someone in phoenix send him a copy of a phoenix newspaper from the day after the night of the phoenix lights. he returned a few days later showing us the newspaper.  it was definitely the same night of the phoenix lights. if not for that detail, i would have never remembered the date. \r\n\r\nthe night of the phoenix lights was seen at least as far north as southern oregon. to date, other than the three of us that saw it that night , i have never heard other reports of it in oregon.\r\n\r\nhad it not been the night of the phoenix lights i would have written it off as a top secret military craft. upon further evaluation however i fee there is no way the us military had so many \"top secret\" craft in the sky that it was seen from sonora to oregon. \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

in hand, taking photos of desert flowers, not using the full zoom. just happened to look up at a jet stream and the jet, flying southeast at a high altitude. while staring at the jet stream behind it, i noticed a very small glint of light , moving below the jet stream. as small as a pin head three feet away, it was tiny. i was wearing prescription sun glasses, amber in color. thought at first it was my glasses, took them off and looked up. no glint of light. glasses were clean. only could see the glint thru my glasses. turned on my zoom, and got three photos of it. the photos are a little fuzzy, but still not bad. it is acorn shape, with a small dome on top. i guess about 2-3 miles away, guess over 300 feet wide, or wider. had two engines , one on either side, near the top rim. also was very shinny and reflected the sun light, strongly. it was moving side to side,very little. it then tilted about 80 degrees, kind of lopsided. it then would disappear and then reappear in the same place, did this 4 or 5 times. then one of the engines got very bright, and then went out. then both engines got very bright , and it took off, then disappeared quickly. this all lasted less than 3 minutes. i have seen many ufo's , nothing new for me, and encounters. never seen this acorn shape before. never seen glowing engines ? before. ufo's are nothing new for me. but having camera in hand is a first. i have the photos to prove it. i do this as a sharing service, and will put my photos up for examination if asked. not sure how to download them, but will do so if asked and shown how to, they are fairly clear. mufon can contact me. welcome your comments, could be experimental craft also, but had no wings. thanks for looking.","distance":"Over One

quiet, absolutely no sound disruptions. temperature 62 degrees, wind 1.5 mph, heavy cloud cover all day.  \r\n\r\nbackyard was dark, looked up at sw sky approximately over maspeth area.  observed giant stationary pulsating light behind cloud cover.  light was in a perfect circle.  diameter of light could be compared to 3 city blocks, appeared much larger than sun or moon does in the sky.  \r\n\r\ncolors pulsing slowly were red, white, violet-blue, mostly red.  my first thought that it was a plane but it did not move.  then i thought perhaps it was a helicopter but there was absolutely no noise and no vibration. helicopters in the area can always be heard and felt. light cast was much wider than any plane or helicopter could ever cast.  \r\n\r\nlight pulsated for approx. 3-4 minutes then disappeared.  it did not move in any direction, simply shut off.  again, this was behind cloud cover.  i could not determine the source of the light.\r\n\r\nnote: most queens residents are very familiar with all sorts of planes, helicopters as we live under the constant flight patterns of jfk and laguardia airports.  planes pass over our heads constantly. commercial aircraft is a part of our lives.  \r\n\r\nadditional note:  military jets flew over the neighborhood today at approx. 3:50 pm.  there was cloud cover and they couldn't be seen but distinctly could be heard and felt. the noise was incredible and it shook the house. this is unusual.  military jets do not fly over this part of queens at low altitude ever.  the only other time we heard jets like that was right after 9/11.","distance":"Over One

1000 feet in air. had some light like color while in the air sort of violet and at times like a greyish color and i watched it move from point a to point b in air and the seen it had 4 spheres around it. it landed about 200 feet rom me and there was a slight chime like sound when it was really close to ground. as it was about to land it appeared as if the 4 smaller sphere was getting closer o middle main phere and as far as i could see the four spheres went into the landing sphere. i made my way to object and found the perfect sphere resting onto the dry ground. at first i considered it was maybe a space fuel tank of some sort like oxygen tank or such. after about 10 minutes of observing the object from about 10 feet away i decided to get closer and as i did the light slowly faded away and i could still hear what sounded like chimes playing but very very slowly. i went back to my pickup truck to get a pair of gloves and when i went to return to object it had moved closer to where my truck was parked by about one half the original distance. the chimes sound was still coming from object and i knew then that a few tank would not produce any sound unless it was leaking high pressure or something like that? i touched the object to see if it was hot. it was neither hot or cold and as i touched it the chimes sound went away to a solid picted sound wave. about a c note? i knew then that this was some sort of military part most likely but why it had moved closer to my truck and appeared in its original flight path to move strangly, i knew the object was not a tank off some airplane or space craft .  i went on ahead and touched it again and it was like a 10 second morse code was chimed out then silence again and i finally pick object off ground. it was somewhat heavy and felt like what a gyroscope feels like or a bike tire spinning as you hold the axel in your hands and the tire is spinning. so it felt as if it had some weight about 20 pounts maybe but not like picking a solid off the ground. always a feeling as if there was some form of gyro inside the object. every now and then there would be a chime like sound. i knew at this time this was not normal. i decided to take object with me home. after getting home i began using my tuning forks to fine the pitch it wwould make and every time i used a tuning fork it would respond witht the same chime like sounds and about 10 second would the chime like sound stay steady and then dissapear. i have now placed object into a hidden place in another state and would like to know how i could make sure this object is studied but not by military or any agency that would hide it from the public. this is first time i have allowed anyone to know of this object . i will not allow this object to be taken and will not place object where some special team of people can infiltrate and hide this onject from the public. so i need information as to how such can be studied by others but not placed into a situation where the government can hide this find? i want truth and pure absolute truth and ability to maintain object in my protected hands until i decide to allow it to be examined. it will reproduce the chimes like sounds any time i want to interact with sphere. i repeat what country or how can i present this find to the world and yet maintain such a force to never allow the government to stale this object or cover this up in any way. i know that there will be someone knocking at my door or following me to find where object is hidden but they will not ever find ths sphere without me. so any help would be helpful thank you so much","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 101-500 Feet","duration":"01:01:14","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering

for 5-6 miles.When i stopped at the stop sign at us 19 i noticed it getting darker then realized there was no more light but an object come from behind me and i watched it stop a few feet in front of my car.I looked up thru my windshield and this object was dark and smooth and flat. i looked out my rear and side windows and realized it was perfectly round.I was thinking if there was 1 car in front of me and 1 in the back and if i drew a cicle around them that was the size of this object that was just hovering over my car. if i stood on the roof of my car and stretched i could have touched the bottom of this thing.I then saw that my dashlights were slowly dimming and my headlights doing the same until my car stalled.I heard a woosh and this thing took off north on us19 and i watched it make a complete stop.Then it took off west towards the gulf in a matter of seconds.I had such a sense of calm even starting when the light in the sky was following me.In hindsight i should of been scared to death when it was hovering over my car but it just seemed  fascinating. my old car started right up and i went home.I think about it every day and over the years told anyone who would listen. the next morning i reported it to the sheriff office and they said it was probably the military testing aircraft off the coast.This was a flying saucer that i witnessed.About a year ago i googled flying saucer and car stalling and was amazed with reports like mine.To my amazement i come across abductee john reeves which his experiences happened a couple miles from mine back in the
