flew across the sky and then over the house where we could no longer see it.  we both knew that it was a ufo.  it was like nothing we had ever seen, even very hard to discribe.  no way a camera would have captured, it was difficult to acquire by the naked eye. there were seven cirles or spheres in the formation of two sides of a triangle. one at the point and three on each side. you could see them but they didn't seem to be lit, more like dimly glowing or just reflecting light from the city. it looked like there was a shadow filling in the rest of the triangle. is a good word for it

in burnsville mn. the clouds where starting to move in, so i was not hoping to see many constellations. as we sat talking i began to notice six dim lights in the sky in the shape of a hallow. it was very clear that they made up some sort of a disc hovering in the air. at first i thought that maybe they where just stars peaking through the clouds, but as the clouds kept moving in i noticed that the lights did not leave. though they where slightly dimmer. they seemed to be within the clouds. for a moment i figured that they could be spotlights. however there where no beams of light shining up into the sky. at this point i asked my friend if she saw that halo too. she in fact did. we watched it for almost half an hour until it finally started to dim. eventually i could no longer see the lights and lost track of the object. not once did the object move. though i do believe that at some points it could have. however my eyes are not so great and i have issues with lights. neither of us wanted to leave the hillside and miss the event and neither of us had any recording device available, so we where unable to record it. \r\n\r\nthe entire time i had no idea what to think. i am still

 what is that?\"  i asked her where, because my eyes were focused on the water tower and wal-mart (approx. 100 ft.)  she said, \"it looks like smoke!  coming towards us!\"  at that very moment, my eyes picked up on the thing she referred to.  nothing in my database could explain what this was.  even though it's dark, we live in a well-lit area.  the first thing i thought was birds, flying in formation!  until i grabbed my binoculars and had a closer look.  each item i thought was a bird, was oval shapped.  almost like an egg!  by this time i paniced.  i grapped her inside by the shirt, and locked the screen.  these things slowed down and changed into several shapes.  one modeling a mosquito.  the others i couldn't quite identify because i was in awe.  at first, they were in v formation; as if they were birds flying like i said earlier.  there were no sound at all.  and they floated from east to west real slow-like to allow us to view the many shapes they were making.  they were see-through as they floated in our face (20 ft approx.) and through these things, the sky was visible.  as soon as it floated to the end of my house where the steps were, they disappeared.  we all ran outside, afterwards of course, to see where they had gone.  i wanted to get a picture with my camera.  it was me(35), daughter (13), son (11), and son (4).  it took me almost half an hour to calm down my four year old. this happened in a spann of six min.  for all of us to see.  it wanted to be seen, well they, wanted to put on a show, and they did.  if they were birds, as they passed the trees, they would be visible to us for a few more hundred feet.  but, to just disapper in the blink of an eye, after a photo-show, was extraordinary.  these were not birds i admit.  i am a teacher with a high iq, and have no reason to lie about anything.  as a matter of fact, i did not believe in anomalies, but now i want to know what the world did i see? i am a believer in the unknown now.

(christchurch is a very small city and at 12pm on a monday night it becomes very still). there are also very few helicopters that operate out of the christchurch airport and they have a very distinct sound that can you can hear for miles (the airport is less than 5 kilometres from where i live and to the north of the object.\r\n4. balloons/blimps: there are no blimps here in new zealand and hot air balloons are not allowed to fly at night over the city.\r\nabove all normal aircraft do not just simply vanish as this craft did. other strange effects to add to this are some odd electrical effects shortly before i went out for a cigarette. the lights in the house flicked twice as well as the radio producing static. the power here can get a little odd at times due to all the substations in and around the city sending power to the north island and we get power spikes on and off so i put it down to that at first but now i am not so sure.\r\n\r\nsorry i do not have a photo of the object

followed immediately by another helicopter that had red lights on it. we were driving south on e-470 at the east edge of the metropolitan denver area, very near southlands mall at smoky hill road. i first noticed two red lights on a low-flying aircraft that appeared to be ready to cross over e-470 just in front of us, from right to left (west to east) and looked up with curiosity as i started to hear the rather loud rumble of a low flying helicopter.  the moon was full (full at 8:56 pm that night to be exact), and it brightly lit up the southeast part of the sky above us through some broken and hazy clouds. against the bright moonlit part of the sky i saw the black silhouette of a completely unlit helicopter leading the red lights by perhaps 100 feet, very roughly. immediately, a second helicopter followed on its tail across the moonlit part of the sky, and i could see its silhouette too. it was lit with the red lights. for a few seconds i could see both helicopters at the same time, one following directly behind the other in single-file order. i sensed the two helicopters were of the same make, but my wife thought perhaps they were slightly different models.  looking at pictures on the internet we both agree they were a close match to uh-60 black hawk military helicopters, again as a rough guess. as the two helicopters passed overhead going east, i continued to watch them out my driver's side window. they quickly disappeared into the darker part of the sky, but i did noticed a very small and very dim, steady yellow light on the unlit helicopter that was in the lead, probably in the tail rotor area. i had the impression the only purpose of this tiny light was as a visible safety indicator for the sake of the pilot of the helicopter following very closely on its tail. that light was so very dim that within seconds it faded from my view and only the red lights of the second helicopter were then visible as they proceeded at a steady clip off to the east. without the moon in the background, i'm sure we would not have noticed the leading helicopter at all. perhaps these two helicopters were from buckley afb out on a training mission of some sort, but it struck me very odd that one of them would be flying dark over the community at such low altitude. tonight i heard a rumor someone else reported something similar on the same night, so combining the data from both reports might help figure out if this was an explainable military training event, or if something odd was going on.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

the night sky. we had already been stopped by the federal police to search for contraband and had passed through cascavel a small town. now we were on the main highway br 101 which is a two lane road one coming and the other going. some trucks and buses.The south of brasil is an agricultural area so i saw the feilds and ocaisionaly a cluster of trees, in one of those cluster which were far apart

a sudden i looked to the road down beside the bus and i saw the shadow of the bus on the asfalt. my first thought was street lights since brasil had begun to use these horrible orange street lights.

the passengers sleep. i looked out again and light was gone. at about 2 am the bus stops to change drivers and for a rest stop. i was dieing to ask the driver what he but my boyfriend kept ridiculizing me so i lost my nerve. i've never regreted something as much as not asking the driver what he saw. we reached rio the next day with no other incidents. but i will never

behavior since what he observed was what made me start asking some questions. his reluctance to talk about what he saw is part of why this report is delayed.\r\nin background, i have earned three college degrees. both of my children are intelligent,well schooled, and not given to making things up. we live in an area where aircraft traffic is common, both of a high altitude (from o'hare) and lower level nature from the local airport. my son, in particular, shares my interest in aircraft and weapons. in short, if they see something in the sky, they have never had a problem identifying it.\r\non a drive from dekalb to elgin in january of 2009, around 6:45 pm, my son observed and object that crossed over the van he was riding in and then stopped shortly afterwards.My wife and son had just crossed illinois 47, heading west on plank road, when he noticed an object that was approaching their van from the north.The area in this part of the road is mainly farmfields, with clumps of both houses and trees scattered around. the weather was cold and clear; my son had spent time on the drive earlier looking at the stars and higher aircraft heading into o'hare.He was surprised, however, by what appeared to his left (north) in the front windsheild. it was up at 60 degrees or more and would eventually pass almost directly overhead.He describes it as the following:\r\n\r\na very large cube, around the size of a 2 story house. his outstretched open hand covered about 2/3 of the object. the object had a white light about as bright as an outdoor light or headlight seen at a distance located at each of the bottom 4 corners. these lights seem to vary in intensity a bit, growing brighter and dimmer, but only slightly.When he leaned forward as the object passed overhead and observed through the tinted part of the windsheild, he said the light was still the same intense white. the corner lights lit up part of the object which he desribed as grey,textured metallic looking material. the south facing facet had a white light that was more focused and directed at an angle toward the ground, but he couldn't see where it was pointing at exactly. as the object passed almost directly overhead, he had a good look directly at the bottom facing side and noticed a circular opening in the middle of the side that was straight down and not scooped like a crater. radiating outward in four directions, were wide troughs or valleys that went completely to the edge of the facet and could be seen travelling around to the adjacent side. these valleys crossed the facet's side between two of each corner light. he said it kind of looked like a sci-fi borg cube, but it was plain and had no features except what was noted above.\r\n\r\nafter the object passed overhead, it travelled a short distance and appeared to stop. by this time, he was now looking out the right side passenger window. the formerly south side facing \"headlight\" then began to slowly turn westward and eventually toward the north (and the van). he could not tell if the object itself turned or the light moved across the two facings. at this moment, he became frightened. however, the van had reached illinois route 20 and continued to head north, blocking the object with the car's roof. two miles later, the van turned east and the object was no longer visable. the object was never seen

this date, around 7:00-7:30 pm , i got a call from my brother,(curtis) very excited/worried , telling me to hurry and come over. after i arrived, he didn't put any label on what it was, he just simply asked me \"what is that up there\". . at first glance, i replied \"looks like a bright white light\". . . after this being said, he replied, \"yeah, but there's no stars out right now\" . .(it hadn't gotten dark yet)\r\nwhile still observing the bright white light, something happened to convince me that it wasn't just a lone star. i began to see white lines projected in different angles. . and then pulled back in. . (i then closed my eyes and rubbed them with my knuckle to make sure that it wasn't possibly a glare from the light being so bright). . it was no glare. . the projecting lines, or what we called them at the time \"wings\" came out and were pulled back in for around 15-20 minutes, sometimes projecting out longer in length than others. . it was aparent that we were seeing the same thing and it was no glare, because when they were at a longer length, we both reacted at the same time explaining exactly what we were seeing. . . \r\n\r\nafter watching this for around 30 mintues or so, we then saw another light going in the direction of the object we had been observing. this i easily identified as an airplane, (due to the flashing red lights) however, when the plane got somewhat close in the direction of the object, we then saw the object take off at a rediculous speed and a weird angle almost arching upward towards the sky. .We watched as the object got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it. after the plane passes , we're still looking at the same point in the sky that the object was . . and out of nowhere, we saw the object fly back, at the exact same position and point in the sky as it was previous. . this was amazing. . \r\n\r\nafter calming down, from what we saw, we continued to observe the object as it continued to project the wings, then pull them back in. afterwatching for another 15 minutes or so, we grew tired, and went in the house. later,a bit after 9:00 pm the object was nowhere to be seen. . \r\n\r\nmy brother is a very straight laced,mature adult (39 years old) and a police officer. . . for me to witness this with someone that i look up to, someone that i believe (if i had mentioned or told him a story like this,that he hadn't witnessed with his own eyes, he would never believe me) \r\n\r\ni've always been a believer of extraterrestrial , ufo findings etc. . but always had that bit of doubt in the back of my mind. . after seeing this with my own eyes. . and with my brother being there seeing the same thing, backing me up. . . there is no doubt in my mind that aliens,ufo's,and life on other planets do exist. . . \r\n\r\ni have 5 , 30 second video clips, plus a picture taken with his nextel i880 video phone as proof. . not the best quailty, but i'm glad we had something to capture some type of evidence that we saw something out of the ordinary. . . \r\n\r\ni will be recording a video explaining exactly what i saw, this week, followed by all 5 video clips and picture summing up what we saw march 8th 2009\r\n\r\nany information of groups or organizations in the metro atlanta georgia area that shed light, investigates, or just has other witnesses of ufo's and extraterrestrial life would be appreciated.  is there a mufon ga?\r\n\r\naaron gordon","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":16517,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5985815,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04152009-0007","longitude":-83.8531827,"occurred":1236499200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cross,  Flash,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1236499200000,"summary":"Bright flickering white light.
