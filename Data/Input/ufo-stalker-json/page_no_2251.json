practice.  we left and headed south on cr 45 and then turned left on cr 44.  we went up over the first rise and my wife saw what appeared to be two separate crafts that seemed to be going very slowly from east to west and very close to each other.  my children 12 and 5 became very frightened mostly due to my wife over reacting to whatever we were seeing. but, i really wanted to pull over and look and listen.  when i pulled the car over and was able to turn around and look i noticed that one of the things was gone.  i asked my wife to look and she saw the same thing.  our house was about a mile away and i quickly took everyone home, ran in the house and grabbed our camera and quickly drove back to the site.  nothing there.  \r\n\r\nthen i see two very large airplanes headed west to east in formation going towards the north side of south long lake.  they went about as far as the lake and made a hard turn back the way they came and went directly over my house like they were searching for something. not uncommon for military planes and helicopters as we live about 15-20 miles from a base,  but never this low.\r\n\r\n\r\ni never felt a great deal of fear, mostly excitement because i had seen these light/crafts once before about 2 years ago and everyone thought i was nuts.  when my wife saw them she said she felt the same not really scared just excited.  kids were quite scared and did not really know what to think.\r\n\r\nmy father, grandfather, great-grandfather, aunt and uncle are all pilots, two active captains for major carriers.  i have flown all over in all different aircraft and i have never seen anything like this before.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

camp david and fort dietrich in fredrick md and fort ritchie maybe. my landlord, who recently passed away has a son who is a state police officer. he too saw the same 2 ships and said they were military planes this past thurs., 4/9.\r\n\r\nok, i cant sleep. maybe im a bit crazy but i have a prior experience. i was in no more then 2nd grade, lived in a apt complex in cockeysville md. one night i was outside the apt building playing with the locals. at one point, the sky was filled w/ 2 v shapes of light, point out front w/ lights fanning out like wings. they dominated the sky and passed so incredibly fast, i cant recall any sound relating to the incident tho i vividly recall going inside to relate my tale of ufo`s to my family (picked up from adult locals that night), which of course i was dismissed. a friend attributes it to stealth fighters, do they make sounds while directly over head? i recall seeing alien at the drive-in close to my apt at this time and being absolutely whacked. it must have been 78 or 79, that movie scared me tho i dont recall if it was post or pre the lights in the sky. i feel like it was post but meh it was so long ago and im already questioning how much the history channel has affected my memory.\r\n\r\nlast thurs night, the cupboard was bare, it was time to go shopping. it was after 9pm and i headed off to the store. as i approached the t intersection i needed to make a right at, i saw over the hill line a bunch of lights in the sky, hovering. i immediately flipped out, trying to reason what i was seeing.\r\n\r\ni continued on, it was 2 sets of 4 bright white horizontal lights. one set seemed parallel to the ground, the second set of 4 off to its right were askew, perhaps behind the first set. i reasoned it had to be some sort of suspended lights over the farm, but why?\r\n\r\ni made the right, headed still towards the store. the 2 sets of 4 lights were hovering over the farm to my left, which was completely dark. at this point it didnt seem to be suspended lights. i was contemplating on driving into the driveway of the farm to knock on the door when i noticed a car coming the other direction.\r\n\r\ni sorta decided to pull into the driveway tho i turned early because as soon as i made the move to the house, the lights made for my direction. it happened so fast, i was a bit short of the driveway so i just pulled a big u in the middle of the road, prior to the oncoming car.\r\n\r\ni had all these crazy thoughts, these lights were definitely coming my way, i ran the stop sign headed back to my house. up the road a bit i noticed the car behind me had turned in my direction as had the 2 ships(?) above and to my left. i was wired and scared {pd}, i was actually out front of my landlords other son`s new property, so i pulled over and got out.\r\n\r\nthe car behind me pulled up as the 2 ships flew over. the 4 bright white lights that dominated the front were not seen as they flew overhead. it appeared to be a plane shape, had a light blue glow and some standard looking (?) red lights. i cant say i got a great look at them, i was sort of freaking out and approaching the car behind me who was equally freaked out due to my driving.\r\n\r\ni asked them if they saw the planes (?), and as i did, i heard what was like a humming sound as if perhaps these were 2 auto-lite type ships were being used to spotlight deer or property. i was thinking bi-wing plane of sorts w/ the 4 big white lights between the wings but hell originally i thought the farm was being demolished at night and the lights were suspended for the work.\r\n\r\nthey continued on in the opposite way of the store, which now seemed like an even better destination place. the two young guys in the car were like \"holy {pd} what are those\" and i said, \"i hear a engine of sorts so must be some sort of plane\", to which they agreed. i got in my car, took off back towards the store, seeing them seem to split up as i lost them in my line of sight. as far as i know, the 2 young guys followed the 2 planes.\r\n\r\nive spoke w/ the farm owner today and he believes what i saw was c130`s. he says they do a training run 4 or 5 times a year and was able to describe the path of the planes almost perfectly. ive looked online but cannot find any pictures of c130`s w/ the white lights. ive found plenty of c130`s, just none that made me think thats what i saw.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16509,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5850291,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04142009-0006","longitude":-76.9908949,"occurred":1239336300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1239336300000,"summary":"2

wings.  then i thought maybe they were the blue angels, but again these things didn't have wings, appeared smaller, there was no smoke, and no sound or vibration.  they came in from the east and turned and went north.  the objects moved smoothly and were quickly out of sight.  from the highway there is good visibility and there is wide panoramic view.  when i say blueish, it was sort of a hazy atmospheric blue, the way mountains can look in the distance. the shape was sort of bulbous, with one side being a bit more pointed.  the formation was not perfect, but they maintained it in the turn.  again, they were flying very fast.  this was maybe a quarter of a mile in front of me, and not that high up.  lower than most planes fly.  when i looked at my clock it was a few minutes later and it said 7:11 pm.  also, i think that clock might be a few minutes slow. i don't drink or use drugs.  i didn't feel afraid, just curious.  thought it must be fun to bop along so

stright from south to north.When he shined the spotlight at it,it made a 90 degree turn left to go out over the gulf.We filmed it till it went out of view,it look to blink out.I don't have the right wire to upload the footage stright from my camcorder so i had to hook it up to the t.V. and film the t.V. with my little camera.We started watching about 8pm till 10:10 pm and seen a total of six,or seven objects, most were not bright enough to pick up with camcorder,but i did film them so they could be pulled out maybe.I checked the space station tracker,and nasa j tracker and the space

Francisco","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On easter sunday, april 12, 2009, i was sitting out front of the caffe trieste having a cappucino, in san francisco's north beach district. the location was 601 vallejo street, at the corner of vallejo street and grant avenue.  my attention was drawn to one of the caffe trieste employees who was standing at the corner excitedly pointing up at the sky to a woman standing next to him. i got up and walked over to them and asked them what they were looking at.\r\n\r\nthey pointed out a roughly circular object hovering in the evening sky.  the time was exactly 5:40 pm, pst. i happened to have a compass in my laptop bag and quickly determined the azimuth to be 90 degrees due east. later, using a simple protractor based inclinometer, i determined the angular elevation to be approximately 60 degrees plus or minus 5 degrees. \r\n\r\nthe weather at the time of the sighting was clear, with some high altitude cirrus clouds.  the wind direction and speed, according to the national weather service website at the time, was west to northwest, 7-10 knots, with gusts exceeding 15 knots.\r\n\r\nthe object's angular size was approximately 1/4 full moon.  it had a roughly circular shape.  the color was a muted white, and it was clearly illuminated by the setting sun.  the object did not appear to be illuminated from within, however. the object was completely silent and did not resemble any type of aircraft i'm familiar with.\r\n\r\nthe object hovered in one position for a minute or so, before slowly moving in a southerly direction -- perpendicular to the direction of the brisk prevailing winds. as the object began to move it also began to change shape.  it formed a rough triangle, and then became more of a rectangle.  the other witness and i were loudly commenting on this shape change, when the object changed back into it's original circular shape. the object then appeared to recede, as though gaining altitude, while slowly moving to the south to approximately 110 degrees east southeast, whereupon it simply faded from view.\r\n\r\ni turned another caffe trieste employee who had also been watching the object, and asked him what he thought he saw.  at that moment, the first caffe trieste employee, who originally saw the object, exclaimed \"there's another one!\" the time was exactly 5:48 pm, pst.\r\n\r\nthis second object was smaller, approximately 1/10 full moon in angular size and appeared in almost the identical 90 degrees azimuth as the first object.  but the second object's angular elevation as considerably higher, approximately 80 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.  this object hovered for about one minute before slowly moving to south and receding from view as if gaining altitude -- just as the previous object did -- until it was no longer visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nat this point there were a number people standing at the corner discussing what they had seen.  i asked the first witness how he initially sighted the object.  he said he'd been standing outside talking to a woman, when he noticed an object moving rapidly from the west to the east, when the object suddenly stopped and hovered.  that's when he began pointing up at the object, and when i noticed and came over to see what they were looking up at. \r\n\r\nat that moment, a man sitting in his pickup truck across the street yelled\r\n\"there's another one!\"  the time was exactly 6:05 pm, pst. this third object was identical in angular size to the second object, 1/10 a full moon. it's azimuth was approximately 130 degree east southeast, and it's angular elevation approximately 80 degrees, plus or minus five degrees.  this object was only visible for around 30 seconds before it rapidly receded from view, again as if gaining altitude.\r\n\r\nthe entire incident spanned approximately 25 minutes. it was unfortunate that none of the customers sitting outside had cameras, nor were there any binoculars conveniently around.  i immediately asked four of the witnesses if they would be willing to be interviewed about what they had witnessed. i am currently in the process of setting up these interviews.  three of the witnesses said they would have no problem recording the interview on video, while the fourth witness said he would consent to an audio interview.\r\n\r\ni was a combat photographer in the us navy during the vietnam war, and have extensive experience in identifying both private, commercial, and military aircraft.  these three objects were clearly not aircraft of any type i'm familiar with. my immediate reaction when i initially saw the first object begin changing shapes, is that it had to be some kind of weather balloon, or balloon cluster.  but after carefully observing the object alter its shape, i came to the preliminary conclusion that it was not a balloon or cluster of balloons.  i based that preliminary conclusion on the fact that the wind was blowing steadily from the west to northwest, and these objects both hovered and moved perpendicular to the direction of the wind. i still cannot rationally explain what i witnessed.\r\n\r\nit should be added that i am personally acquainted with all four of the witnesses, just in case this might impact my conducting a completely objective investigation.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path then

their was no sound what so ever. nothing was outside and nothing was moving so if the object did have a prop or a turbine i would of heard it. it went out of my site heading towards the road. i then ran to the other side of the house to the front door and saw it climb rapidly and ascend to a high alitude and circle around the house. it must of triples the alitude from before and then again i felt

[witness later stated that the red flash was \"very ruby red\"] the light appeared to the east southeast of our position.  it appeared to rise and mix into the clouds which seemed to partially obscure the light/object/craft. as whatever it was rose into the air, it seemed to maintain a more or less uniform distance from us as though it was pivoting about our position.\r\n\r\nafter about 10 minutes, it disappeared low on the horizon and did not reappear.  we then left.  i took photos with my iphone but all they show is a pinpoint of light in the sky.\r\n\r\nafter we arrived at our house and our guests left for their home, i returned to the site and drove through the neighborhood looking for signs of whatever it was that we had observed with no success.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":16488,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.276253,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04122009-0005","longitude":-97.7384708,"occurred":1237097400000,"potentialRelations":[16249],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1237097400000,"summary":"White donut-shaped light in the sky with intermittent red light discharge accompanied by crackling \"tesla coil-like\" sound that varied in loudness with the brightness of the object.","tags":["disc","photo","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Austin, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:241004"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Lexington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were driving on us 60 to  take my daughter to the kids museum and it was lighting and the clouds were very pretty.  i do photography on the side and like to take pictures of the sky sometimes.  so as we were driving i started snapping photos.  i did not notice the object until i was looking at the pictures later. when i first noticed the object in the photo i was not sure what it was i thought ufo, but of course you always try and talk yourself out of these things.  but i just don't know what else it could be.  i noticed in one photo there is a red light coming down from the object.  my feelings were i was excited but still am trying to find some other explanation for this.   but i really feel this is what it is.
