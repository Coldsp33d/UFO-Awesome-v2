i assumed they just had to go out so i put both their leashes on, took two steps out my front door, and heard a huge rumble.  i asked my girlfriend if she heard that, and in a panic she stated \"yes, what was that\". we both felt the house shake, and thought it was an earthquake, after about 1-2 min. i continued to take the dogs out because they were barking more than before. as i went back down the front pourch i heard, and felt it again. i looked around outside to see if anybody else was outside.  we live out in the country, in a higher end subdivision, so somebody is usally in sight, but nobody else came outside their homes. i continued to walk down the driveway, when i looked up and saw two blinking white lights that were at least 1.5-2.0 miles away from eachother, then i heard the noise again, this time it sounded like 2 f-14 flying at 1000ft directly overhead, and for a second i thought that it was 2 fighter jets in 1 mile formation from each other. it was very dark and extremely overcast so i had a great background that was lit up cloud cover.  i yelled at my girlfriend to come outside quickly. the dogs were going nuts. as we watched these lights, they were both directly across from one another, and moving very very slow. i knew then it wasnt jets/airplanes/helicopters. as we both watched the lights go over our road, the back light of cloud cover began to reveal a solid object from one light to the other. i could see that it was one enormous craft shaped exactly like a boomerang. we both were in awe!! this thing was huge, to big to fly, i couldnt believe what i was seeing. it was breathtaking. as we watched it fly, i could faintly hear the sound of several jet engines.  this thing just \"floated\" across the sky. the body was a shiney black, which at times looked like it was blending into the sky.  i ran the dogs back into the house, and to get my video camera. the camera was completely dead, and i was in a panic.  i ran back outside, and we both watched as this thing cruised straight north towards wisconsin.  this experience has changed my thought on our skies.  while i have no doubt that this was one of our own creations, probably military, it makes me wonder, how in this world could something that huge float so smoothly across the sky? i am unsure why it was flying so low(probably around 5000ft), and why did it make so much noise. i have alot of details, and could write about our experience for a long time, but that is the major parts.  i know our military has secrect aircraft likes this, but if you ask me, they werent being very secretive. it was amazing to see, and i feel privileged.  sorry about all the spelling errors. thanks for listening, im curious if anyone else saw this craft that night. - {pid}

seen some shooting stars and were hoping this night would be the same.  we walked down towards sebago lake and laid a blanket down in a path which had a clearing so we could see the sky.  i recall there being very little to no moon so the sky was very black and the stars were very bright.  we were watching meteors for a few hours, and the conversation had lulled.  suddenly a black triangle, with two rows of white lights on each side flew over us at a very high rate of speed.  the thing that struck me the most was that it was completely silent.  we had seen airplanes go by all night, and they had flashing lights and you could hear them very clearly.  but not this craft.  imagine an isosceles triangle, flying with the point straight over us.  the two equal sides of the triangle had two rows of lights each, the rows had aprox. six lights.  the lights were bigger than the stars, but not brighter.  it kind of blended in with the stars.  the thing is, if we were not looking at the sky at this exact moment, we never would have seen it.  i had the impression it was very large.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw it, my mind went blank.  i immediately thought to myself that it was a hawk or an eagle flying over us, with lights reflecting off of it.  i don't know why i thought that, the thought popped into my head as soon as i saw it.  we both said, \"wow\" and \"did you see that?\" but did not talk about it for at least a half hour.  then the shock or whatever seemed to ware off and we both could not believe what we had seen.  it did take us a while to get over it, and i still remember the thought that popped into my head when i saw it.\r\n\r\nthe craft flew directly over us at a very high rate of speed.  we saw it for maybe three seconds, but saw it clearly and both agreed to its

of my apartment complex at 5585 pacific coast ave. the parking lot entrance faces pch, and in order to exit the lot, a driver must look south (left) towards oncoming traffic. as i looked south (left), preparing to make my right turn onto pch, i noticed an extremely bright powder-blue streak across the sky. i do not believe this could have been a meteor or any other form of space debris incinerating while falling to earth for several reasons. first, i have witnessed numerous meteors, and this streak was much brighter in intensity and pure in color. this was not white, this was a rich, bright blue. second, and most peculiarly in my opinion, was the nature of the streak. i witnessed the streak start in a definite spot and then end in another definite spot, almost as if the streak popped into existence then disappeared. the entire event could not have lasted more than two seconds, and it is very possible that it was shorter than one second. whatever the object was, it appeared to be traveling at an extremely high speed. a third element that leads me to believe this was not a meteor was the height of the object from my point of view. although i could not possibly determine the distance from myself to the streak, the streak was only slightly higher than the roofs of the buildings in the direction i was looking. this leads me to believe that the object was lower than a meteor. i am unsure of what i saw on monday, april 10, 2009, but i am quite certain of the details from my vantage point.","distance":"Over One

for them. therefore, i went outside around 10pm for a cigarette before bed. the time was somewhere between 9:50 and 10:20 pm the evening of the 7th. the deck faces due south and i'd observed the big dipper up over my left shoulder a hands width above the house next doors' roof line. i looked towards the moon coming up which was approx in the 10 o'clock position in its' travel across the southern sky. out of the corner of right my eye i saw and directed my vision towards a pair of red lights which seemed to just \"appear\". \r\n\r\ni recall thinking i should have noticed them coming from some where, dropping from the sky, hearing yet another one of the many aircraft from one of the marine air bases or the air force base(seymour johnson) in goldsboro, nc that had been around that day and while considering this, they winked out. by winked, i mean it didn't just disappear but rather faded quickly. it seemed to have a white-ish center that was wavering as does heat waves over a runway but the dominant color was red as is an aircraft's running light. i have been around military aircraft for over 39 years and can i.D. over 40 at a glance. this was no airplane, jet aircraft, or helicopter, (nor were they osprey aircraft which could be from cherry pt., mcb lejeune, or new river mcas which lie to the northwest and southwest from here respectively). being as versed as i am in military air i can comfortably say these had no relation to any known vehicle, or method of flight. \r\n\r\nin brief:\r\nin all, i believe there were three separate \"lights\". one to the se, and two to the sw. all showed themselves a total of three times until they were grouped the closest together in what may have been a triangular formation and then \"winked\" out. \r\n\r\n\r\nin detail:\r\nafter getting my attention then disappearing, a second pair,  of lights or more likely the same pair repositioned, appeared a little more to the south with one more in the foreground than the other. these too faded quickly after perhaps 2-3 seconds and i called my son out. my son is 19 and will be in the marine in about 3 weeks. he too saw what came next, and last. just prior to his making it out the sliding glass door, the only light to appear to the southeast appeared in the distance and then went away quickly lasting the same 2-3 seconds. all of these lights had a dominant red appearance overall with a white-ish middle that you could not focus on (too fast and \"wavy\"). \r\n\r\nthe last episode has all three of the lights that had shown themselves grouped due south with one in the foreground, one well behind and to the right (west) and one in-between distance-wise and farther west. if i were looking down from above they may have represented the points of a triangle with the base at an angle from ne to sw and the third point to the west. they remained in this configuration for the same 2-3 seconds and were gone. i had hoped for a subsequent showing another night, but as yet no reappearance has been made.\r\n\r\ni called the newspaper and inquired, but no other reports have been made.","distance":"Over One

is important to report what occurred. \r\n\r\n\ti was on my way back to my girlfriends house after her, myself and our two friends went to a local store in orland park. she rode with our two friends and i drove by myself. \r\n\r\n\ti should mention a little about our background. i���m a student at a local college as is my girlfriend. my friend is the general manager of a restaurant and his fianc���e is a student also. \r\n\r\n\ti arrived at her house in frankfort square before they did so i waited in my car for them to arrive. as i was waiting, i received a call from my friend who was driving the car my girlfriend and his fianc���e were in. he told me to drive to  st francis road and turn east towards harlem ave. he said that there was a huge triangular object in the sky and i should be able to see it. i immediately did just as he  said and the was a large triangular object in the sky. \r\n\r\n\tthere were three lights on the object on each point and they appeared to be changing colors from red and blue constantly. the lights were far enough in the distance that the shape was not clearly visible but when the lights moved, they stayed the same brightness and appeared to be equidistant from each other. the object appeared at times to be pointing downward and then it would appear to turn and be pointing up or to the side.\r\n\r\n\ti told my friend that i saw it and we decided to see how close we could get to it. we decided to drive south on harlem to rt. 30 and head east. two other cars appeared to have noticed it as they pulled over and were taking pictures on their phones. i got out my small video camera and attempted to record the object but it would not appear on my camera. i kept the camera rolling however to at least capture the audio of our conversation. my friend called both 911 and nbc5 news to report what we were seeing.\r\n\r\n\tmy car got  separated from theirs and they got close enough to the object where my girlfriend and my friends fianc���e were both almost in tears because they were scared. they followed rt. 3o to indiana and when they got to the city of dyer, in,  they reported that they had gotten really close to the object and then it disappeared. by this time i was about 5 miles behind them and i could see the object clearly as a solid triangular object. however when i got close to it, the object also appeared to just flicker out. \r\n\r\n\ti caught up with them in a parking lot in scherriville, in where my girlfriend got in the car with me and showed me some pictures she had taken on her phone. only a single light was visible on all of her photos. as we talked in the parking lot about what had just occurred, my friends fianc���e said that she ���got a weird feeling that if we keep going east we will see it again.��� i looked at her and my friend and said that we should probably head back home because i got a bad feeling about her last statement. however, my friend decide that maybe they should keep going east towards merriville, in.\r\n\r\n\twell they decided to keep going east on rt. 30 and my girlfriend and i decided to head north on indianapolis boulevard. we stopped at a bookstore so i could try to relax after what just happened.  about 3 minutes after we had stopped at the bookstore, my friends fianc���e called my girlfriend crying saying that the object did in face ���reappear��� and it looked ���a lot more menacing.��� i told my girlfriend that i wanted to talk to my friend so she handed me the phone and i had his fianc���e put me on the phone with him. he sounded kind of scared and he told me that he yelled at the object and the lights appeared to ���flare up���.  i kept talking to him as i went outside with my girlfriend and we saw the object to the south east.  it appeared that there were one or two aircraft flying in the area of the object. i cannot say if they were commercial or military. i do know they were apparently circling and were flying pretty fast.\r\n\r\n\t my girlfriend and i got in my car and we drove south down indianapolis boulevard  back to rt. 30 and headed east. i called another one of my friends from valparaiso, in to tell him what was going on and to keep a lookout because it appeared to be heading his way as my girlfriend talked to my other friends fianc���e. they decided to turn around about half way to merriville, in. we followed the object to i65 in merriville where the object vanished.  we went home after that and my girlfriend was talking to my friends fianc���e on the way home and all she kept saying was that she kept ���wanting to look up���. we did notice that the aircraft that were circling the area were still there as we drove home on i80. \r\n\r\nthe whole event lasted about an hour and a half. it was first noticed at about 8 :00 pm.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16456,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.5189226,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04092009-0007","longitude":-87.8031048,"occurred":1238641200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1238641200000,"summary":"Following

my recent visit to the town of combate, near the famous light house on the southwest coast of puerto rico, at 8 p.M. i was walking towards my car and i saw two family members noticing a distant bright light approaching directly at us. it was traveling from east to west at about the same rate of speed as a helicopter. i thought this was an airplane with its landing lights on at first. the light was much brighter than any stars around it and was not flickering. no blinking lights or sounds were noticed. it was very steady and moving in a straight line towards us. i ran inside to get my camera as it did not look like anything i had seen before. as soon as i came back out the object was almost directly over us and as i looked up  the object took off at an incredible rate of speed straight up. almost as if the light just went out. it was not seen again. i wasn't able to determine if this was a large object at a very high altitude or a smaller object at a low altitude. i would have to guess this was at an altitude a helicopter would normally travel. i don't know what this was, but i can say this was not an airplane or helicopter or any other type of flying craft i'd ever seen. this thing just went from moving slowly, steadily overhead to gone in less than a second. at first, i was very excited that i may have just seen for the first time in my life a real ufo!! later on that night as
