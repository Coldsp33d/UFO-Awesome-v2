i was watching jay leno, so it was just after 11:30pm and power went out. i was the only one up. so i went to the kitchen to get some water and looked out the windows and saw a light flying around. did not think much of it. helicopter probably. so went back to my room and power was restored minutes later, as i comfortable again the power went out a second time. i was already into ufo's too so that got me worried and excited as i went back to the kitchen and there was light, which i could tell the shape at that time still. so back to my room and for the 3rd time the power goes out. that's it i go back to the kitchen to observe. the light seems to be coming my way along our main road called henderson, so lost site of it and walked outside under out walkway i froze, this huge object, could of been the size of the space shuttle or a blimp, but it was lit up like a christmas tree and not one sound came from it. i kept thinking it was military only because it was flying right in directon macdill air force base. i was once stationed at ft. bragg and saw all kinds of military helecopters flying at night and this could of been what i saw. i just watched it slowly cruise by and it went on it's marry way to the south flying just above tree level. i told some people at work the next day and got laughed at. so i just deciced to tell my closet friends afterwards. later on in the year though i was at my friends house and watching channel 8 news and they showed short clips that years ufo sightings and someone filmed what i saw. i have watched tons of ufo documentrys and

bethlehem pa. when i crested the hill i noticed a long line flying low near the trees off in the distance, at first it looked like a line of geese heading west, but i realized it was not in a v shape and it was one solid object. it captured my attention as i continued to drive north and soon i realized it was now heading towards me. i found a place to pull over just past a local farm, when i looked up to see it again, it was 100 feet from me approx 250 feet in the air, i had to lean forward and look up from the dash of my vehicle to see the top of the object which had gone from horizontal to vertical and was now hovering in it's place. the object seemed to be black / gray in color and looked like a large cylinder. it was like a plane fuselage but not smooth...It seemed like someone had crummpled up aluminum foil then tried to smooth it out again (crinkled), although it had some smooth areas. there was a pinkish light at the top and bottom and it remained staionary like this for nearly 5 minutes. i noticed someone's headights behind me and saw them turn into the farm and i contemplated flagging them down to ask if he saw it too. when i looked again, i saw that the object was beginning to move away. it returned to the horizontal position and as it moved away it looked as though it was shimmering or moving all along it's body, eventhough it moved very fluidly and smoothly through the air. it continued west in the direction it was headed originally and i watched until it disappeared in the distance.\r\nwhen i got to work, i called the local airport to see if it they had gotten clearence from someone flying in the area. they seemed to be very interested in what i saw but had not heard of anyone in that area. i called the state police to see if anyone else had called in a strange object flying in the area. i was told no one had called in, but they also seemed very interested in what i saw.\r\nthe next day, i was still trying to find someone who had seen what i did. so i called the farm owner and talked to a friend of mine, i asked if he saw this object and he told me that he hadn't seen it but he knew who had. that person contacted me later and confirmed he saw the same object i did, only he described it as looking like a very large vehicle standing on end, and he thought it looked blue, red and white (although it could have been reflecting the sun rise at his angle). i got confirmation but we still can't figure out what we saw. there have been no other sightings reported as of yet and no one can tell us what it was.","distance":"101-500

was just a few yards from the entrance to the hospital parking lot when i thought to look up. recently, i have become very interested in the ufo phenomenon and have been trying to pay more attention to the skies.\r\n\r\ni looked up through my windshield looking south. it was then that i spotted what at first appeared to be a plane. but, the more i looked at this object, the more i became aware that it could not be a plane. \r\nthe object was silver in color and reflecting the sun. it was heading from east to west, toward the gulf of mexico.\r\nit's difficult for me to judge the distance from the ground that the object was flying because the whole sighting only lasted about 10 seconds. though, it did appear to be at an average height of normal small aircraft. \r\nwhen i first noticed the object, i initially thought it could be a smaller plane. it appeared to be larger than if it were a commercial aircraft due the altitude in which commercial aircraft are normally seen.\r\nit's also hard to judge the size of the object since i was not able to determine its altitude.\r\n\r\nas i watched the object i leaned back a little so that i could view it through the sunshade section of my windshield that runs across the top. i did this because the glare of the sun reflecting off the object was very intense. it was at that moment that i noticed i could not see as much of the object as i could just a second before. i then leaned forward to again view it through the unshaded part of my window. \r\nthat was when the object appeared to be dematerializing right before my eyes!\r\nat first it seemed as though half the object had vanished. as i watched in amazement, driving very slowly down the road, the object became completely invisible. \r\n\r\nthere were no clouds in the immediate vicinity of this thing so it didn't go behind them. i first thought it might be a plane but, i don't recall seeing very many silver, shiny airplanes. i live in airport community, so i see a variety of airplanes regularly. and i can say without a doubt that this thing did not get lost from my line of sight, fly behind a cloud or anything logical. it simply vanished into thin air as i watched it!\r\n\r\ni stopped looking for this thing so that i could park my car in the parking lot of the hospital. once i had gotten out of my vehicle, i immediately began searching the sky for any trace of what i had witnessed. if it had been a plane, it should have still been in my field of view. as i looked all around the sky above me and in the area the object appeared to be heading, i could see nothing even remotely resembling this thing.\r\ni searched the skies until i had to get inside the building in order to make my appointment.\r\n\r\nthis is the very first time that i have seen something that defies explanation or logic. in fact, this is the very first ufo experience of my life.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

growing up for those 18 years inside the military had placed me in stations that defy common knowledge, as well as having served my own tour ��� so there aren���t any man-made craft - ground, air or otherwise, which i am not very familiar with.\r\n\r\ndate/time:\t\tdecember 31st, 2005, starting at approximately 2400 hours (12:00 midnight est, new year���s early morning 2006)\r\n\r\nlocation:\t\teast central florida, united states, on the atlantic ocean and within relatively close proximity to the space coast, nasa, and launch central.\r\n\r\nit was at this time i found myself spending some time out in an isolated county operated campground in east central florida. during this time, the weather was very mild and comfortable. being late december here on the southeast coast, the atmosphere was completely still and clear, and offered an incredible view of the night sky, practically unphased by local lighting.\r\n\r\nthe late evenings here with these crisp clear night skies, make it very easy to pinpoint any movement from satellites, high flying aircraft, or even the space station if it was within your latitude at the time. i especially look for extremely high-altitude military aircraft, whose height, course and speeds are unmistakable.\r\n\r\nit was approximately at the time mentioned above that i began to notice the absence of aircraft, all of them, everywhere and in every direction. i found this puzzling at that moment as in this part of the world private and commercial aircraft are constantly in motion in all directions, and at all hours of the day and night.\r\n\r\ni was casually viewing to a south easterly direction upwards of about 40-50 degrees when i noticed a movement in an otherwise standstill sky. it appeared in the exact direction i was looking. a bright spot, very high up, maybe even at the upper reaches of the atmosphere. it moved in a straight line downward from its upper position of appearance (from my perspective), not varying at any angle whatsoever, and appeared not having what one would expect to be a reentry burn if indeed it was reentering the atmosphere. the motion was emphatically too slow for its altitude and course. i discounted the possibility of a reentry vehicle at this moment as the speed and lack of burn plume was inconsistent with such.\r\n\r\ni visually followed this object in its path for about 10 to 15 seconds until it appeared to come to a halt. it was still situated fairly high up (in altitude) but did not move any further in any direction. in fact, it did not move at all. it remained completely stationary in its current position and altitude. its brightness remained constant, so its position point of reference could be maintained.\r\n\r\nsuddenly (within about 5 seconds) there appeared a second spot of equally bright light in relative close proximity to the original though at about a 35 degree retrograde angle towards the east in regards to altitude and position. this second object though was not stationary. it began to move at a rapid pace in smooth arcs of varying degrees and in varying directions. i am almost afraid to say that the movements of this second object were not possible, given the altitude, speed, directional changes, and apparent proximity to the original object, it was almost a dance of light.\r\n\r\nalmost as suddenly as this second object appeared it too halted dead in its position and altitude, at about the original position which it appeared. i would approximate the time frame of original appearance of the second object to this stationary position as about 10-20 seconds.\r\n\r\nit was at this point that what happened next will require considerably more detail in order to make sure this is clear.\r\n\r\nthere appeared an intensely bright object, of a brightness magnitude 5 to 10 times greater than the original two objects, and which appeared to come from out of or below the second object. it slowly appeared to fall to earth with slowly increasing speed and in a trajectory which would have placed it directly off the coast and somewhat south from my current position. this motion seemed free fall in nature, though may have been powered flight. it maintained a consistent brightness the entire way down before it disappeared beyond the trees that obscured any view of where it may have impacted, though i suspect its impact point would place it well into the atlantic ocean, probably several considerable miles off the coast. there was no vapor trail or burn plume. the two original objects remained without moving in their current positions. i think the key here is the ���without moving��� part.\r\n\r\nthe time frame of the third object descent from the second object to surface would be roughly 10-15 seconds.\r\n\r\nwithin about 5 to 10 seconds after the third object had disappeared behind the trees, there now appeared two united states military aircraft at afterburner speed and tree top level which came directly past my position in a direct course towards the apparent point of impact of the third object. these fighter aircraft came from a due west position from where i was standing. they too disappeared past the tree line heading in that easterly course.\r\n\r\nwithin about 10 to 15 seconds of the disappearance of the jet aircraft, there came (as near as i can recall) two military helicopters from the due north which were at approximately 500 feet altitude and changed course once they reached the same course position of the aircraft and headed in the same easterly direction.\r\n\r\nonce the two choppers had likewise disappeared beyond the tree line, and after approximately 10 to 15 seconds the two original objects maintaining their fixed positions still to this point began to slowly move in unison and gaining speed upwards and outwards from the atmosphere until they disappeared into what i can only guess is the night shadow of the earth. their course upwards was likewise a straight line.\r\n\r\nremaining in my current position throughout the entire night and into the next day, i never saw any of the military aircraft return.\r\n\r\n(1)\tif these united states military aircraft were actually ordered to this event, then someone somewhere knows why;\r\n\r\n(2)\tif statement (1) is true, then the event itself was ���known��� in advance. taking into consideration originating base of operations, flight time, and speed, it is very unlikely that these aircraft were ���already on some mission which coincided with this event���;\r\n\r\n(3)\tif statement (2) is true, then one can only surmise that the united states, and ergo the united states military are fully aware of what transpired before, during and after this event.\r\n\r\nin the following days, weeks and months, i combed the local newspapers and a myriad of internet sources for any word of possible naval activity off the east coast of florida. not even so much as a transient or vague offer of a recovery mission or exercise could be found. \r\n\r\ni very casually asked a few friends who fished the local seas if they knew of or saw any naval vessels or unknown or unfamiliar ships out towards the horizon during this time, to which none were ever reported. \r\n\r\nin conclusion, i personally found this entire ���show��� as a happy new year gesture, though admittedly not quite the new york times square ball drop version. \r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

stark against the clear, blue sky and that's what made me notice it. when i first saw it, it seemed quite far away, but drifted east toward where i was. at first, i thought it was a helicopter monitoring rush-hour traffic, but it's movements were not like a helicopter and when i got a better look at it as it came closer, it was obvious it was not a helicopter. it was disc-shaped, but somewhat morphic - it seemed to alternate in shape and it seemed to be drifting with and/or coasting on the wind and it was very fluid in its movements and covered some distance very quickly. it was approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away when i got a fairly good look at it. it was difficult to keep my eye on it, however, as i was driving and went under the i-25/belleview bridge. it was traveling in a ssw direction and as i continued on belleview, i pulled off the avenue (street/junction just before monaco & belleview, adjacent to office park). it didn't look like anything i'd seen before, and i know this will sound weird, but its movements reminded me of a dance ... its movements were just very fluid and graceful. but it was not a bird! that i know for certain! i thought maybe it could be a balloon of some sort, but its outer shell was definitely metallic, but not shiny, like mylar or polished silver ... it was more like a gun-metal gray, muted but finished enough to catch the sun's reflection. it rose and fell in altitude as it continued ssw, changing color from the sun's reflection (i think), then continued to rise in altitude before i lost sight of it. it was a clear afternoon, no clouds, but a slight, smoggy haze, and the afternoon sun was very bright.

golf course.  not a cloud in the sky; sun fairly high and bright. i heard a loud commercial plane overhead and looked up to see it.  in the far background, behind the plane, i saw a bright glint of sunlight off an object.  i focused on the object and it was a speck of light.  i believe it was north to north east of my position in palm desert, very high in the sky, likely 75 degrees or so above a horizontal sight line.  i immediately thought of a supernova, bright enough to see in the daylight.  i continued to view this spot, thinking i was in on a spectacular event.  i then sensed that the object was moving very slowly in the sky.  i move a few feet down the sidewalk to put a tree, about 20 feet high, within my frame of view.  the wind was very light to non-existent, so the branches on the tree were not moving appreciably.  when viewed next to a limb of this tree, the object definitely was moving as it slipped behind the limb.  i moved back clear of the limb and reacquired the object.  it stopped moving, hovered for a few seconds, then reversed course, not quite 180 degrees.  it moved in this new direction for a few seconds, then started moving in various directions, almost as if doing figure eights.  at that time, a golf course worker in a golf cart came by.  i asked him to look at the object to confirm it.  when we both looked up again, neither of us could see it.  feeling slightly foolish, i continued my walk.  i could not help looking up as i walked, however, hoping to see it again.  a minute or so after i starting walking again, i saw the object at about the same spot in the sky.  this time, however, there were at least five other similar objects in a loose configuration with each other.  i blinked my eyes and rubbed them to make sure i was not seeing things.  i was not.  the objects persisted, moving together in a direction i perceived to be west to north west.  two of the objects started to move close to each other, but then moved away just before converging.  i continued to watch these objects move slowly until they simply dissolved from view, as if suddenly moving directly away from me out of my range of acuity.  there were no contrails associated with these objects, even though i saw several high-flying commercial craft trailing contrails in all parts of the sky.  i only saw one glint of sunlight, off the original object, but it was bright enough to be an unmistakeable reflection of sunlight.  i considered the objects to be balloons, but could not explain the irregular, seemingly controlled movements of the first object that i spotted and the actions of the two other objects closing with each other and then separating.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

looking to see if it would come back and about 15 minutes later, i saw it again over to the east of the refinery, repeating the moves it had done before. this time it started to move southwest against

from my view behind another house.\r\nthere were no wings, blades, or protuberances, and it did not change shape or color. it was not a lantern or a helicopter (in my opinion).\r\nwaited for another 20 minutes but it did not return.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

driving down the street heading east a huge bright light came up above the tree line to our north.  we both turned and saw a large orange light just above the trees it was not round nor square nor oval, i could not make out the shape as it was so bright.  my first thought was than we were being bombed, but then i realized that it was going up not coming down. my son is yelling \"what is that\"? we turned the car north and sped to where it was, just before we got near it started moving east across the sky. my son is telling me to call the police. i told him they would think i was crazy. we could not hear anything but as it started moving east it looked as if it had a net over the top of it.  just above the orange light something was visible but not lit up and this was what appeared to have a huge net over it.  you could see something under the net.  the only way to discribe it is like a huge mobile home in the sky with the back of it having large bright orange lights brighter than any light i have ever seen.  my son and i were both scared. he told me to give him my cell phone so he could get a picture of it before it moved too far away.  the picture was taken on my cell phone and the object was much closer to us then it appears on the picture.  the object went east and in less than a minute after taking the picture we could no longer see it.  we tried calling my younger son's cell phone several times and he did not answer.  i really feared that he had been taken by this strange object as he always answers for me.  my 17 year old was saying the same thing to me.  we drove the 5-6 blocks back to our house and i pulled in the drive way.  my son went in to get his cell to see if his brother would answer for him.  as i sat in the driveway the object appeared to be coming back toward us.  my son saw it as he came out of the house and ran to the car yelling \"it is coming back chase it\". we pulled out of the driveway and just before it looked to have reached the edge of town our visiblity was blocked by trees for a split second and then it vanished. we noticed about 5 minutes later that a sheriff patrol had came in to town.  i think that he was there because he had seen the light also.

i can't tell which. the first time i thought it was a balloon, but it moves too intentionally, and i saw it today in the same area of the sky. i watched both times for about 15 minutes while walking my dogs, and then lost sight of it behind trees in my hilly area. both times i relocated it in a different area and it appears dimmer and less bright and very hard to see. i can see airplanes flying in hte sky near it, but can't tell which is higher. the second time i saw a similar object in the morning over hollywood - my 6 yr old son saw it first, along with three commercial airplanes -one of which he referred to as a \"rocketship\" b/c it was leaving very visible contrail and appeared to be \"going up\" from our vantage point. he pointed them out and said \"not the white thing in the sky - \"the rocketship\" sure enough, there was the star-like thing again - this time looking more white than \"bright\". it appeared stationary and appeared to be higher than the plane my son was watching. this object was a little larger than the star-like ones i saw.  we watched it for about 5 min. until we lost it while driving.\r\n\r\nthere is a fourth object that both me and my son saw about 6 weeks ago over glendale while driving about an hour before sunset. there were huge, puffy clouds in the sky, and he saw - and then i saw a small, round metallic looking object hovering in hte sky. there was a large cloud behind it so it popped out as being grayish/metallic. a traffic copter flew towards us and was considerable lower than this object. i asked my son \"what is that?!!\" he said he didn't know. i tried to pull over to get a better look, but it disappeared. it was larger than a star, but still pretty small. it looked totally round - like a ball. my son seemed a little upset and didn't want to talk about it, and i didn't want to upset him.\r\n\r\ni've never had experiences like these before - never seen anything out of the ordinary. in all cases, i kept telling myself, these things are balloons. but i've seen them too often -
