 i walked toward the field because the craft disappeared (which was probably due to the fog) but i did not see anything else.  i stayed outside trying to look for it for the next 10 minutes, while i called my boyfriend and my friend to tell them what i saw.  i later thought that since it did not have height -from what i could see, that it may have been controlled by a remote by the military.  however, i don't know why the military would fly over a small construction site and fly so close to civilians' apartments especially if they had the technology to even make a silent craft. i would say all of this happened sometime between 7:50pm and 7:58pm est.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":16413,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6908073,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04052009-0005","longitude":-117.7890742,"occurred":1225162200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1225162200000,"summary":"Triangle shaped craft, medium in size, three circular  white lights under it, silent , dull gray color.","tags":["lights","triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Irvine, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:243255"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Abilene","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside watering some new apple trees i had recently planted enjoying the darkness and cool breeze when a bright light in the sky caught my attention. obviously not a conventional aircraft because the speed was incredible. not a metor, i see those here all the time.\r\n\r\nfast moving  silent object at approximately 10 thousand feet moving west to east. the object was large bright and starlike with no blinking red or colored lights that might indicate the miss identification of a conventional aircraft.\r\n\r\nthe brilliant white object moved across half of the visable sky in level flight in less than 5 seconds.

located in mays landing. i went to arby's to pick up three of my friends and on our way back to my car we noticed an extremely bright light coming directly toward us. we were very alarmed at the brightness of the light and how low it was flying. all four of us stood outside my car and speculated on what kind of aircraft it was and it wasn't until it flew directly overhead that we suspected it may be something other than a conventional airplane. and certainly wasn't a helicopter either because as it passed overhead it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. what was even more interesting was when we noticed a second much smaller lighted craft that was traveling above the first craft at a 45 degree upwards angle traveling at exactly the same speed. the second craft had to be very small because it was not until the first craft flew directly overhead that we even noticed there was a second craft of some kind traveling above and behind the first craft. i know they were traveling at the same speed because the separation between them did not change. during this part of the event, we began to notice a great many more very similar looking craft flying everywhere we looked. this continued for over 3 hours and we had been traveling to various parts of the county throughout the night so it was not simply relegated to one area. these craft almost seemed to be tracking something, but if it wasn't for the first sighting we would have probably just thought they were low flying planes that were searching the area for something. i estimate sighting a craft about 30 times in the 3 hour period, but then we began to see the same type of craft when three of the four of us present during the original sighting began to see the same types of vehicles floating silently about the sky. this sighting took place in two places. the first was the wildwood villas, and here is where we witnessed many different strangely lit craft all scouring the area, and most peculiarly we witnessed a very bright white point of light hovering at about a 30-40 degree angle from our line of sight, and i'd say no more than 10-15 miles from where we stood. it was very low to the ground and considering the blanket of cloud cover over the area i find it difficult to believe it was a star or venus. not to mention when we watched it eventually begin to move as the other craft did, but not before yet another of the silent craft flew directly overhead. then we left the villas and i took my friends back to their house in whitesboro.  there were the same flashing lights as before, only this time it looked as though the object was either two very closely approximated craft with the same light pattern, or one craft that was very rapidly shifting position. the lights appeared in one spot one second, and then seemingly defying the laws of physics the light would move 1 or 2 degrees to the left or right making it seem...You know what? i have no idea what to make of it. it was so unusual, and i would love to know what that and all the other craft in the sky really were. then as quickly as they had appeared, the craft were gone and i did not see any more for the remainder of the evening. i wish my cell phone camera didn't have problems adjusting the light level enough to take a picture of what i was seeing. it was almost as though these craft were making an attempt to imitate commercial aircraft light patterns but terrestrial craft do not a: share such incredibly close airspace such as the very first sighting out in front of arby's because of the very real danger of a midair collision. b the second smaller craft tracking the first was too small to even be an aircraft, and c aircraft and helicopters are not silent. i hope this report is detailed enough, but i would be surprised if you've received any other reports because of the flashing light pattern that could easily be explained away by saying they're merely low level aircraft. my friends and i however were lucky enough to get an overhead fly by and what we saw did not add up to anything that we have seen before. i live directly under multiple flight paths and i have seen planes and helicopters in the skies over my head for my entire life. this was not a plane. i have no asked my friends if they wish to publicly talk of this, but i am sure they will all anonymously confirm my report. but out of respect for them and their privacy i need to find out if i have their consent. if this is of significant interest you may contact me and i can most likely set up an interview with one or more of them. two more things.  i am unsure if there were actual planes in the area, because there were so many countless lights in the sky all flying in nondescript flight paths, so for the questions below i am going to say that some of these had to be airplanes because of the part of airspace my county sits underneath. finally during the second night as the rapidly shifting lights on the craft flew overhead i was overcome with a very acute pain and stiffness in my right leg. this continued when i got back in my car and until shortly after i left. yet unlike the first night, i was not as worried or afraid. by the time i got home, i was filled with an overwhelming sense of calm and serenity as though i had no reason to fear what i saw. my one friend seemed very frightened however. so much so that after the second night of sightings, he said he, \"wasn't touching that one.\" he didn't want to continue speculating on the objects origin or intentions in any way shape or form.","distance":"501

antonio,texas,i went over to a friends house to have dinner with her and her family,afterwards she and i went out side to sit on the \"stoop\"as we called it,where the sidewalk goes down to the street,there were 3 steps and we sat down like we always did and then laid back on the warm sidewalk from the heat of the day,we were looking up into the sky,which was a very clear nite and we could see thousands of stars,we just tried to find the stars we knew and the mikley way and then the air just seamed to get so still and it became very quiet.We sat up and all of a sudden there was this huge round light,so very bright(like the ones they put up at a county fair,and light up the sky,but this light was thousands of times brighter,i put my hand in front of my face to shield the light so i could see just what it was,we started to scream and her parents and sister and brother came running out of the front door onto the porch and the light went faster than a lighting strike to the porch,it lit up their house and porch and they looked like they were frozen,as it was shining on them we could see just how big this disk was and it was huge,there were all of the red,blue,white,and a few green lights going all around it,and there were all kinds of strange pipe-like rods on it,and several windows,it moved very slow kind of rotateing just a little but stayed is the same place,there was no sound,no air moving the trees,it just hovered over all of us,then as fast as it came it was gone.We got up and ran to the porch and it was as if we were moving very slow.As we reached the porch he parents did not say a word to us,nor did her sister or brother,we all went into the house and her father called my dad to come over.When go got there my friends dad told him what had happened,and he needed to take me home,they were scared to death.At that time my dad had woked at kelly field for many years,and her dad asked him to see if he could find out something about just what we saw,when we got home her called a friend who was a major in the security divison at kelly,he told him what we saw and asked him to see if anything had come across on the radar,he called back later and that is when things got very hairy,if you know what i mean.Dad worked un a gen.Ramey and others and went to all of the bases you have shown on the show.Several of the officers came to the house and talked to me,then went to my friends home.We were told to not tell anyone,but dad kept on it.My friend and her family never said a word after all of the officers went to their home,but dads friend told us there was something on the radar,and that was all he was going to say.For years while sleeping at nite,i would be awakened by a very bright lite,this went on for many years,i asked my friend if she had they same thing going on and she said yes,but did not tell her folks,and that she had not told anyone about what we saw and her family never did either. dad has passed and mom is 99.I have told my husband and children and grandson about it,and as far as my friend i do not know where she is,and her family are all gone now.I need to tell you about this more,i can still see it in my mind,i will never forget what i saw and i keep looking to the nite sky to see if it will come back.Please let me know if you know anything about this from texas during the summer of 1956.Thank you sharon

thursday night���s class, traveling westbound on hwy 114 approaching the outskirts of rhome, texas, that i became aware of two red objects low on the horizon just slightly to the right of the roadway ahead of me.  these two red orbs were pulsing on and off at a rate of about 20 -30 times a minute.  the on to off timing was uniformly equal and pulsing in unison.  the size of the red orbs were slightly smaller than your thumbnail held at arms��� length and the shape was perfectly circular with a very defined edge, no fuzziness or light diffusion.  the distance between the two orbs was approximately the width of your fist at arms��� length.  there was some relative motion between the two objects:  the one on the left appeared steady on its course while the one on the right changed its altitude dipping down and then back to its level position.  as i continued driving due west the objects appeared to be drifting to the left or southward and now the roadway was turning slightly northward to a west-north-west heading and the view of the objects were being obstructed by trees.  i thought i would pull over and stop to watch these red orbs and continued forward to have a clearer view now appearing through my side window.  the clear view was now coming up, but before i pulled off to the shoulder there appeared what i would describe as a burst from between and above the plane of the two orbs not unlike a jet going supersonic with its wing producing a shock wave.  i had traveled about a mile in this episode so it was visible to me for about one minute.  i continued onward where the road crosses over the railroad tracks to view southward the moonless night sky but could see no lights or movement there.\r\n\tin review of this event i could not make any determination of the distance, speed, or direction involved or if any sound was made as my car windows were closed.  looking at a map of the area shows that when i first sighted the object it could have been over rhome, aurora or boyd, or beyond by 100���s of miles, or it could have been just beyond the tree line right over hwy 287 just a mile in front of me.  at the time, i thought the direction of travel was southward, but who���s to say that i was actually seeing it departing straight away from me (west) on just a slight southward track.  if that were true perhaps those who reside in newark, azle, reno, or springtown may have seen this occurrence.  i was a passive observer of this non-threatening event and i know of no other witnesses as traffic was very, very light and the only other car well ahead did not stop.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

(about 3-4 seconds between the two of them)i would really like to know what that was. me, being a ufo believer i would say that it looked like two spacecraft entering light speed over dmafb. i don't

route 10, to 60 to 5 freeways. traffic was very heavy. upon transitioning to the 5 freeway heading south i saw four bright white lights, hoovering over towards the east approximately two to three miles away. i told my wife to look at them because they were very similar to the two bright white lights i saw the previous weekend at about ten pm in the evening over the mountains on the 5 freeway just before pyramid lake on the opposite side of the lake, on our way back to la from frazier park.\r\nafter we got off the 5 freeway at slauson, we headed east two miles past the 605 freeway and arrived at our destination. i looked up at the objects and they started to move west. the first object was moving about the speed of a helicopter however it was not a helicopter. there was no rotor blade and no rotor sound. it passed over us, but not directly over us. it was a few degrees north. my wife heard no sound but i heard a kind of low hum wind sound, that's the best way to describe it. it was low enough and light enough outside to see it's shape vaguely, which was sort of trapazoid with lights around it. the three remaining bright white light objects started moving westward also but did not pass us because we were in route to return to west la. we reached the 5 freeway which was like a parking lot. i saw one of the objects fly over the freeway. the bright light came from the east and passed over the freeway. i told my wife to look. as it passed over the freeway the one bright white light spread out into three bright white lights in a straight line.\r\ni witnessed one light apparently splitting into three horizontal lights. as we reached the 60 freeway transition we saw the other lights further away in the sky moving sometimes separately and sometimes lining up in the sky. as we approached downtown i suggested we go to little tokyo for dinner as my wife was hungry. we got off the freeway at alameda. two of the objects had moved into view. one of the objects light went out and the other object moved off. \r\ni did not have my video camera with me. at first i thought the objects may be part of the police or a military exercise of some kind. if they were military aircraft they were unlike any i am familar with. i was most impressed by their ability to move slowly and aparently stop in air and their lack of noise/sound.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

(however, this may have only appeared so due to the angle of the craft in the sky). fanatically trying to rip my camera bag open without success, i finally looked down to find the zipper on the camera bag and removed the camera. when i looked back up, i could no longer see the backward flying white ���v���.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16382,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.2298549,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-04022009-0015","longitude":-93.2102958,"occurred":1238272200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Chevron","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1238272200000,"summary":"White backward flying \"v\" shaped craft.

me.I was a medical courier and had just made a delivery on the east coast i cant remember where.There was very little trafic hardly any thing but woods on both sides of the road.Suddenly slightly in front of me and off to my left there appeared an orange ball of light it wasnt big or didnt seem to be like maybe a large flair it deffanitly seemed like some sort of fire source i felt like maybe it was emiting smoke but i didnt see any.After maybe about 5 minutes other fire balls showed up some were larger than the first one a few trucks and cars passed from the opposite direction i wondered if the were seeing what i was seeing.I felt like pulling off the road just to watch them but i kept going there must have been about 10 of them when i saw a car getting ready to pull into the highway from a dirt road to my right i braked and pulled up next to the car and got out and walked up to the car. there were about 3 or 4 people in the car i asked the driver what those things were in the sky he was dark complectioned and started speaking in spanish i speak a little spanish and i thought he said something about a hunting club in broken english.He wasnt much help so i got in my car and kept going.More light began to appear some even bigger than the previos ones. i would estimate that they were no higher than a mile and no more than a mile away from the high way.After about 10 or 15 more of driving some of the larger ones started to devide thats the only word i can think of to describe it sort of like cellulre division the middle of the fire ball became more narrow till it got to the point that one ball became two one verticly a short distance hihgher than the other.Soon i would estimate that there were 20 of them with only 2 or 3 dividing.After about 5 or 10 minutes more of driving the werent in front of me any more but directly off to my left in another minute or so i came up upon a gas station that was closed bet still had its outside lights on i pulled into it and there was a station wagon with people in it. i got out of my car and walked up to a woman that was standing out side of the station wagon watching the lights there were 3 or four people inside the wagon i asked her what she thought those things where and she said she didnt know we watched in awe for maybe another 5 minutes. i asked her if maybe that there would be something about the lights in the news papers and she said o we will never know after a few more minutes one by one the lights went out.I was straining my eyes pretty hard as i watched them disapear and i thought i saw something like two blinking lights that seemed to be moving they were very dim like a very small distant star as all the lights disapeared the two separate blinking lights moved away till i couldnt see them.The whole scene seemed kind of an enjoyable event and i didnt feel threatened but i guess emotionally i was a little shaken up upon saying goodby to the people in the station wagon i continude west bound to my home on the west coast of florida.The rest of my trip was uneventful","distance":"501 Feet - 1
