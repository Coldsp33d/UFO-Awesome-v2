still taking some pics from the vehicle window. others are brave enough to took shots of pictures under the ufo. it was really huge and television signals are interrupted. some people were scared. we shared our pics to each others. it was still mysterious. most of the witnesses are kids playing in the playground with some adults. my friends also witnessed the craft. at night, i hear some voices i dont know what it was saying. it was just whispering and murmuring. that happening made me really scared that i hold the rossary and start praying. it only occured that night. i always dreamed that the craft had landed and when i woke up i was sweating. im not that really scared but theres a few creep deep into me. i believe that they exist.... i was just thinking if that night the aliens are

at the sky, observing the chemtrails which i do often. it wasn't a heavy chemtrail day, just a couple of xes and lines that were spreading out. suddenly i noticed something moving quickly past the trails. my eyes focused on what i first thought was a flock of birds in the far distance. it looked like bunch of dots in a formation. i'm wasn't sure how many, maybe ten or twelve, because this formation of dots was moving very fast. when i noticed them, they were directly in front of me, but within 2 to 3 seconds they had traveled across the sky to my left until they vanished in the distance.\r\n     i stood there a few minutes thinking about what i just saw, wondering what it could have been. if it wasn't for the speed, it could have been a flock of birds so far away that they looked like dots. then i thought it could have been a group of insects that were quite close to me streaking by and staying in a perfect formation. maybe a squadron of jet fighters? but there was no noise made by this ufo. i thought it couldn't have been any of these things because it was just moving to fast.    \r\n     i didn't think much more about my sighting until last night when i saw the

is my usual habit)when suddenly,in a west to south direction,at a 60 degree angle,i saw a fireball moving at slow speed,the fireball would stop for a few seconds at a time so that it took a few minutes (2 or 3) to cross the sky in from of me,at about 11:45 pm i decided to go to bed.Them at about 1:30 am, i woke up to go to the bathroon and while in the bathroon i looked up through the skylight and realized that the fireball was clearly visible on the left hand side of the skylight.I observed the fire ball for about 5 minutes.It was standing still in the sky.By then it was the morning of the 16th of october 2005.I was still observing the fireball closely when i thought about looking for something with which to tape it,i found a camera and decid to take a photograph,i lowered the camera to observe the fireball on the photograph and saw that it was dark,the i decided to take a second photograph,and when i took it,i lowered the camera again to observe the photograph.Upon observing it,ifound the great surprise and felt much fear.So much that i decided to shut off the camera and run to bed.The next day,in the clear of morning,i decided to ckeck out the camera to make sure that what i saw was the same as what i saw through screen.Yes what i saw was evidenced in the picture i took.It was the clear and distinct picture of what seemed like proyected e.T. faces.I dont know how they got there,close enough to peer through the sky-light.I dont know if the proyection of the faces come from the fireball that was above me,over the the skylight.Or what.

time, i do remember it was a monday night. i had gone to bed at about 9.00pm. it was one of those nights where the summer night sky was a light brown colour, you could see objects on ground a couple of houses away. my bedroom was on the upper floor at the rear of the house in the little town called hartburn in north yorkshire. i had gone to sleep but soon woke with a strange feeling over me, it was hard to explain, i just felt like i needed to look out of my window. my bed was near the window so i just sat up and peered out of the corner of the curtains, the sky was very clear, as i looked to the right out of the window i saw an object floating over an oak tree in the rear of a neighbours house about 4 doors down. it was as round as the canopy of the tree. about 1/2 as deep as the canopy of the tree. just under the rim of the disk seemed to have a dim orange glow that pulsated. i watched it for what seemed like 5 or 10 minutes then i suddenly got a very spooky feeling that i should not be watching it, i then closed over the curtains, that was when i started hearing strange noises in the air, all i remember is that it felt like wolves howling way off in the distance. not what you would hear i the north of england.I ended up huddled under the covers with them pulled over my head. after a while (not sure how long) the whole feeling and the noises just stopped. after a few minutes i got the guts to look out the window again. the object was gone. so i had a good look around and noticed it was way off in the distance now and then it just seem to streak up steeply and it was gone. it was then that i felt that all was normal again, it was like the air was all tense and then just all gone and back to normal. i told mum and dad the next day but they just put down to my imagination. but i am not 40 years old and i will not forget it at all.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then

ohio. it was a very clear night and could clearly see the stars, the half moon was really bright. over the tree line you could clearly see the lights of painesville city.  my friend and i were talking, not even looking toward the sky. i caught a movement out of the corner of my eye and turned to see what it was and saw a sphere of light make a circle air manuver that had to cover an imposssible distance in just over a second. i originally thought it was a flashlight for a split second because i saw light movement and thought someone was coming. i started watching the light and noticed that it had red and blue flashing twinkling lights all around it. it seemed to hover in the same place for a while after doing the circle manuver and then started to slowly move in sharp angles left to right, up and down, stopping abruptly and then going in the opposite direction than it originally came. it would also make slight curving turns, stopping abruptly. it was clearly over the space of painesville city. the direction in the sky was north, possibly toward the lake. the field that we were parked in was very wide open and you could see for miles. the main abundance of light from the ground was coming from painesville city. and this object was high in the sky over the city and was clearly not a city light, tower, plane etc..It was entirely too high in the sky for anything like that..I watched this thing for close to a half hour make darting movements in the same part of the sky. i would have never noticed the object if it would have not made the circle movement out of the corner of my eye. if you were to just glance at it for a second you would probably mistake it for a plane becasue of the red and blue flashing lights but this thing clearly made airial movements like i have never seen befor, covering vast distances in the sky and stopping abruptly.I felt like i was witnessing something unworldly and i seemed to be drawn to it and could not look away..After a half hour or so, we headed back to the trucks because it was almost midnight. this has really sparked my interest and i plan on going back with a camera just for the chance it would be back. i know what i saw and would take a lie detector test to prove it.

like it was on top of him. he got out and looked up for a jet and noticed an object in the field to the se. he got back in his truck and watched the object. he said the roar caused no dust. it was just getting light and there were no stars out. the object was cross-shaped, 500-600 feet high and about 700-800 feet away. he could see it from underneath and said it was silver. he looked for lights but could see none. he was in his pickup with the window down and watched for 10-15 minutes trying to figure out what it was. he said a pencil erasure tip at arm's length would cover the object. he said an arm or point came out 4 or 5 times and when it did there was an orange glow (circular) around the object. there was no sound after the intial roar. he saw his son-in-law coming down the road and thought \"i want him to see this\". he was in a tractor with a cab. the object kept the same perspective to the witness as it moved away and seemed to get smaller and smaller. it shrank or moved out of sight in about 30 seconds, before the son-in-law got to the witness. the roar was earlier when the witness first saw the object. the son-in-law told the witness he saw or heard nothing. either before or after (he was not sure) his son-in-law got to him, he went back west to the top of a hill to see if he could again see the object. when he went back to the maintenance shop in town, tabor, the mayor and others were there. he told the mayor what he saw. the mayor said \"don't tell anybody. they won't believe you\". he only told a few people. i asked if there might be any traces in the field and he said it had been disked several times. i did not go to the area with the witness, but i had a good description. it was rainy and foggy when i was there. i learned about this report from jean sorenson who is a friend of jack's. i sent in a report earlier of a sighting she had. jack's wife wrote it down in her diary so we knew the date. also his son-in-law said the night before ufo
