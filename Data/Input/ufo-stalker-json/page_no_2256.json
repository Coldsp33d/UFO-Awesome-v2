(crazy!!!!???)- we literally felt each other and patted ourselves and checked our door locks - we were floored!  we also quickly conversed about the fact that no one would believe us, or what would we even say?  i proceeded to take my friend to her boyfriend's house and drove home via a different route (as i needed to head back to kennewick).  afterwards:  i was not in the habit of reading newspapers at the time - but i picked one up for the next several days, expecting something about the sight/event- i really really wanted a \"realistic\" explanation... but i also knew in my gut what we had seen was above any capabilities i knew to exist to aircraft - and that there was no celestial occurance or object that could even possibly behave or look like what we had seen.  my friend and i did tell a couple people at the time - i think they pretended to humor us but frankly i did not feel that we were believed. i think we both quickly quit telling the story... over the years i have recounted the event to myself and very few others - all of the sights, sounds and feelings are as real today as if it is a movie in my mind. i have not seen this friend in ten years or so - but i am absolutely, 100% sure she would tell the same story, the same way to this very day.  i know what we saw and how it moved.  i may not be able to explain it - but the experience was as real and is just as recountable as the birth of my child, or a major accident that happened in my life and is permanantly seared in all it's details in my mind.  has anyone heard of an event in the same area, around the same time????  thanks for \"listening\".","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":16340,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.2894107,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03312009-0009","longitude":-119.2789621,"occurred":809766000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":809766000000,"summary":"Orange orb near nuclear reservation - quick and strange moving, hovering (observing), quickly moving away.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Richland, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:244077"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"WAYNE","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am reporting this for my mother, mary daily, who was the one to see it.\r\n 1. i told her to watch for the space station going over at that exact time. she was in the backyard looking towards the west. the space station came from the right side of the moon;

or far larger than even the largest planes we saw constantly passing overhead. there was no way to estimate its altitude. toward the posterior end (based on the direction of flight) there seemed to be dark projecting flaps on each side - almost like the way the sealing ring on an old mason jar projects from the glass lid. the flaps did not project beyond the posterior tip of the object, and were only visible at the instant of its appearance. my impression was that they may have been vortices related to its materialization. my friend had looked up from his binoculars and immediately saw it as i shouted \"wow!\"\r\n\r\nthe object either materialized at full speed or instantly accelerated to the cruising speed that carried it from about 5 degrees north of auriga to a couple of degrees beyond sirius in less than two seconds. if i was counting, the count would have been \"one-thousand-one, one-thou.\" as it passed orion, it faded slightly from view possibly from clouds but it may have also partially de-materialized. but beyond sirius, it winked out entirely. all in all, it covered about half the visible sky on a north to south path. it made no sound of any kind. any man-made object moving that fast would have produced a sonic boom unless it was above the atmosphere entirely. given its size, an altitude above the atmosphere would have made it many times the size of the largest objects we can get up there.\r\n\r\nthe object was a light translucent cool blue, with very sharp and clear edges. no hint of debris or anything meteor-like. no shifting colors or edges. too bad i was only stargazing and not filming. i asked my friend how fast he thought it was traveling (he has a pilot's license) and his response was a joking \"oh about mach 27,000.\"\r\n\r\nthe whole thing left us fairly blown away. for myself, after seeing all kinds of films over the years on various videos, films, etc., this was nothing like the wobbly, fuzzy, out-of-focus stuff that passes for unidentified flying objects. my friend sat and talked about it for a couple of hours afterwards. it was certainly more interesting than any of the celestial bodies we were looking at.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:02","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":16333,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":25.4759624,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03312009-0002","longitude":-80.4703569,"occurred":1238130300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1238130300000,"summary":"Sharply defined pale blue craft crosses half the night sky in less than 2 seconds.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Homestead, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:244083"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Francisco","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was reviewing the photos of my last trip to san francisco and noticed that a flying object appeared at the left of the city hall dome.\r\ni had taken other photos (one 8 secs before and another 40 secs later) in the same position and the ufo doesn't appear in them.\r\ni took these photos using a sony model dsc-w90.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":16332,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.7773595,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03312009-0001","longitude":-122.4123055,"occurred":1236535260000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1236535260000,"summary":"Ufo appears in a photo.","tags":["photo","ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16332_submitter_file1__UFO1.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16332_submitter_file2__UFO2.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"San Francisco, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:244084"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Seguin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was working with my son on his car in the driveway with one of my neighbors.  i walked inside to check on my two other sons, and came back outside.  i walked around the car in the driveway and started talking to my neighbor.  something just didnt seem right.  there was no strange noise or anything, i just had a strange feeling that something was out of place or just not right.  i looked around to the north, then turned to the south and saw the object in the sky.  i examined it for a few seconds, and i could not identify it.

the size.  the object was stationary at what i would guess at 5000 ft.  i am in the approach and takeoff pattern for sat, and have flown over my house at roughly 10000 feet everytime.  the craft was well over a football field in length.  the sky was clear, however, i live near a plant that has incredibly bright lights in their parking lot, so we could not make out any details of any shape other than the lights.  the craft had a large, very large, red light in the center, and a small white light on either end.  the lights were linear and horizontal in the sky, and never changed orientation.  the large red light in the center did not blink.  it dimmed, then got brighter, then dimmed again, but never went out.  it was more like the old bubble gum ball lights the cops used to have on their cars, only imagine the mirror inside spinning very slowly and the effect on the light omitted.  that is the best way i can describe it.  the only way to provide a contrast to the size of the lights, imagine the red light in the center the size of a light house lamp, and the white lights on the ends being the smallest christmas tree lights you can buy (the small led ones).  the white lights on the ends were constant and never blinked nor did they ever change.  their distance from the center never changed, so the orientation of the craft was e-w.  the craft slowly moved to the west for a few minutes, then stopped, stayed stationary for about a minute, then changed direction and moved e, paralleling i-10 heading toward houston.  we watched it for approximately 10-15 minutes until it was out of sight.  there was no wind or anything to obscure sound.  we live @1 mile north of i-10, and we could hear the cars and trucks going by on the interstate, we can always hear the jets going over, but this thing was dead silent.  it made no engine noise whatsoever.  the object was witnessed by myself, my 3 sons, my neighbor, and another neighbor and his wife and 2 kids who came home while we were standing in the street observing the object.  again, the thing that was the most shocking was the immense size.  the red light in the center had to be two stories tall or more based on my best guess of it being at 5000ft and approximately 150-200 yards in length.  my only regret is that my son, my neighbor, and i all had camera phones on us, and my digital camera was sitting inside my front door hung on our hall tree, but we were so shocked at the size of what we saw, that not one of us even thought about taking a picture of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

some reason i don't know why but i looked out the blinds of my window. i pushed 4 of the blinds down with my fingers.  this was a  2nd floor apartment i was living in.  what i saw i could not have mistaken for anything else.  just floating about 200' above a tree line by a housing addition across the street about 50 yards away was a dull greenish blue orb.  it appeared to be metal or something similar to a stainless steel textured material.  this floating orb was about the size of a two story house.  a perfect circle. the orb was not moving it was just floating there with no noise.  the orb had a lighted gold ring around itself with a single row of round lights evenly spaced out in orientation which did not have physical contact with the orb itself.  the ring was 5 to 6 feet from top to bottom and spun in a clock wise position centered around the orb.  the rotation was slow enough that i could make out the round lights.  i can remember being in awe of what i was seeing and studying it.  it was very hard to take my eyes off of the orb.  i can remember thinking i have to go wake up my roommate.  the point in time which i thought of waking my roommate up a very bright white light emerged from one of the round lights.  it was not as though someone had shinned a light at me.  it was almost as though this light was slowly pulsating at me foot by foot. it was like there was breaks in it and i don't mean like someone was turning off and on a light.  it was almost as if it would stall and then appear 2 feet in front of itself.  the light hit my eyes and i was blinded for 3 seconds or so.  at this point i can remember trying to look at the orb for what it was going to next but i also felt afraid as though i had no control. i was panicked. it was very helpless feeling.  when my vision was starting to auto focus on the craft again another light was coming at me.  this one hit quicker.  this light hit my eyes and i was blinded even longer then the first.  within 5 seconds i was auto focusing again by then light was already coming again.  at this point i blacked out and woke up the next morning.  there is not a day that goes by that i don't think of this and replay it in my mind.  i felt as though i was enlightend and stripped of some thing at the same time.  it was as real as typing this message right now.  i feel very different about ufo's after this. whether it was alien or man made.  although i don't think man has this technology yet and if he does why is he making a pit stop in greenfield indiana to float above some trees.  i can draw a pic of this no problem.  it is still that fresh in my memory 5 years later.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

passed me off to the left and crossed the low median and positioned itself on my drivers side traveling the same speed i was. it was a long cigar shaped craft with clear windows on its side just above

screened-in porch before going to work.  it was a warm night after an unusually-high temperature of 80 in the shade during the day with extra-high winds that still were gusting.\r\n\r\ni was in the kitchen making pauline���s lunch for work when i heard her yell in an excited voice, ���jeff, jeff, come here, quick!���  i exited the kitchen as fast as i could through the french doors onto the screened porch and asked pauline ���what���s going on, what do you want?���\r\n\r\nshe was facing east toward the backyard and said,���i just saw a green meteor thing shoot down from the sky toward the ground!���\r\n\r\npauline is not a u.F.O. buff like i am, but having heard me talk about green fireball u.F.O.S in the past, she definitely would be more aware than many people if she saw something unsual in the night sky that fit the description.  it was the first time that pauline had ever seen a u.F.O.\r\n\r\ni immediately asked if she was joking with me and she said in a serious voice ���no��� and that it really happened.  so i began looking east myself in the direction that she saw the green meteor-like u.F.O.  after about ten minutes, i decided to exit the screened-in porch which has a roof and venture onto the adjacent deck which is open to the night sky and affords greater visibility in all directions.\r\n\r\nthere was a slight crescent moon and only a few scattered clouds, so visibility was excellent.  i then felt ���prompted��� to look in the opposite direction of pauline���s sighting, west, and after scanning the sky for maybe five minutes and not seeing anything unusual, just stars, including orion, and a few planes on flight paths into richmond, i was ���prompted��� to say a prayer.\r\n\r\nsome people of a decidedly spiritual bent, like ���prophet yahweh��� and james gilliland of washington state, have been able to ���call down��� u.F.O.S via prayer and meditation, and i suddenly felt ���prompted��� to try it myself.\r\n\r\npauline was in the house getting ready for work, and i said a quick prayer asking god, the holy spirit, and angels to let me see a u.F.O. if there were any friendly e.T.S in the skies.\r\n\r\nbefore saying the prayer, i had been gazing at the night sky for perhaps 15-20 minutes with no results but within 10-20 seconds of saying my prayer outloud, i suddenly and unexpectedly saw a bright white orb u.F.O. appear in the western sky and shoot horizontally from right to left for a couple of seconds before vanishing again.  my sighting and my wife's sighting were fast and lasted maybe five seconds each.\r\n\r\ni was amazed and quickly said a prayer of thanks before yelling to pauline in the house about what had just occurred.  i then called my friend bryan capel and left a voicemail on his cell phone about the incidents and then called my parents��� house and told my mom what had happened.  i gave pauline the phone for a few seconds in both instances so she could verify what had occurred.\r\n\r\ni continued to scan the night sky but did not see anything else.  about two hours later, i decided to check out m.U.F.O.N. and was elated to see that the two most-recent reports, at the top of the website, were from virginia beach and chesapeake, virginia which both lie in an easterly direction from richmond, the same direction that my wife, pauline, saw her green meteor-like u.F.O.\r\n\r\none report mentioned how tv stations in eastern virginia had led their 11 p.M. newscasts with reports of fireball u.F.O.S and sonic booms, and a web search led me to discover a story in-progress from wavy tv that said \"hundreds of thousands\" of people along the eastern seaboard in north carolina, virginia, and maryland also had reported a fireball-like u.F.O. and sonic boom.\r\n\r\nreports such as this are consistent with many earlier meteor-like and fireball-like u.F.O. sightings from around the world that have been occuring in the last year with notable events in california, texas, canada, and mexico.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line
