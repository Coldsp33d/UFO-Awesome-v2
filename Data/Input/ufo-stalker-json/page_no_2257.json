in the coast guard and none of them ever flew and reacted like the object i saw just then.  when i got home a friend confirmed that he heard the boom and that it shook his house. his son saw the sky

east of my location. at first i thought it was a microwave tower that stands about a mile away, but then i noticed that the light on the tower was to the right of the lights i was seeing. the tower light is white and blinks around 40 times per minute. the lights i saw seemed to be rotating around on a horizontal axis and were red and green in color. they were similar to 'chaser lights' and were blinking at about 120 times per minute. at first i believed that the lighted object was hovering just above i-75 which runs north and south about a mile away. however, as i watched, the object slowly descended behind the hills some distance past the interstate. i did not see the object again. moments later, a small plane passed overhead from west to east over my home and in the direction of where i had seen the object. i then watched the plane until it passed out of sight and saw nothing more.\r\n\r\n     later in the day, i was able to eliminate other factors. the light from the microwave tower is clearly farther south than the lights i saw and it has only one white light. from the back of my home it is possible to sometimes see headlights on the interstate, but the object i saw was clearly high in the sky. this was not an airplane. this object hovered for a minute or more before descending. as best as i can tell, the object made no sound as i had my window open and could clearly hear cars on the highway but nothing else. \r\n\r\n     i don't mind saying that this has me a bit rattled. i know people who have seen unidentified objects and i do believe they exist, but this was the first time i have witnessed one myself. i considered reporting this to the local authorities, but decided to wait and see if there were any other reports that made the papers or local news. having seen and heard nothing, my boyfriend suggested mufon as he is familiar with the group and believes that my report will be taken seriously. thank you.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

window if it is a clear night. i just take a chair and sit in front of my balcony window and look into the clear night sky. i have always been fascinated with the stars and love to just look into the early morning sky in hopes of catching a glimpse of a shooting star. this happend somewhere between 5:45 am to 6:30 am over downtown minneapolis. after sitting and looking into the sky i noticed a beautifu v formation of birds, these birds were unlike any other that i have seen they were high up and i told my daughter that they seemed to glow against the dark sky. they weren't like i normally see 7 or 8 geese in a v formation, this was like they were maybe 10 to 15 birds on each side and flying in a tight v formation, it was so beautiful, it was soon after that when i shifted my gaze to the right and saw this flash of fire/light.It looked so different from any other meteor, comet or shooting star that i had ever seen. it maybe looked similar to a shooting star but the ones that i have always seen seem to shoot across the sky and look far away, not straight down and close by. this one looked like it happened just above this bldg. which was the united state court house, which is about three blocks away from where i live. it didn't have any beginning to it that i saw. it didn't land, it was a long flash of light just above the bldg. i felt that it was so close by like if someone shot a flare into the sky or like a firework went off only in a straight line of light. it wasn't a beam of light it was more fire like. i was amazed at how close it looked to my condo and i just happened to be looking in that direction at the time. i kept thinking of what it might be for most of the day, so i decided to go out and walk around that area. they are doing lots of road construction work around are area. i didn't see anything that caught my attention except for one large rock that looked a little different from some of the surrounding rocks but didn't think it had anything to do with what i saw. hope this is information might prove helpful in some way.

a very large disc shaped object with a single bright light in the center & a lit outer edge.  it appeared that the aircraft was as large as a football field (or maybe the size of the entire street i was on).  it had no propellers, and it had no wings.  as the aircraft passed overhead and continued to travel in an eastbound direction, it diverted it's course to a southbound/upward direction - in an extremely fast menner (i would best describe the way it left was like watching a rubber-band being flung across a room).\r\n\r\ni immediately phoned my father (who was at work as a police officer) to tell what i saw.  my father suggested that i call the northeast airport and ask if they had any information.  well, to my dismay, i don't think that the northeast airport took me seriously...Because they asked ignorant questions like, \"was the ufo operated by little green men too, sir?\"\r\nagain, i phoned my father and told him that the northeast airport had nopthing to offer.  next, he suggested that i call 9-1-1.  i did.  the 9-1-1 operator told me that there was nothing they could do...But my call was \"the 10th call in the past minute about this\".  9-1-1 also gave me a phone number to a ufo-hotline.  i called the number the naxt day, but never followed up with any more interviews or comments because i didn't want to waste my time telling this story to some \"science-fiction\" enthusiast who might be eager to believe anything & everything about ufo's.\r\n\r\n\r\n...As you can see, i am cautious when telling this story because of the mixed reactions i might get.  i am simply writing this because i am sick of people discounting the fact that there might be something else out there, and sick of cover-ups, etc.  i hope that this letter makes it's way to someone else who saw what i did.  maybe there is someone else who has reported this (or who has yet to be interviewed) that can cooberrate my account.\r\n\r\n...Too bad cell phones, videocameras, & other cool technology wasn't at our ready back then, huh?\r\n\r\ni am available via email or phone call for future discussion.","distance":"501 Feet -

that i could tell. it started to move away to the south-by-southeast. it was maybe three times the height of an oak tree over the tree line. it seemed to elevate slightly as it went away. i lost sight of it when it went behind the tree line. i can't say for certain that it was anything unusual, just something i can't explain. their were maybe 3 - 5 lights that were mirrored along two lines that were angled up to a point where there was one bright slow strobing light ( the angle was probably 5 degrees. the one bright light at the meeting point of the lights that caught my eye was a whitish light. the ones going slightly down and away were yellowish (fast strobing) and the ones on the ends were deep red (not strobing). the lights never seemed to changes position relative to one another: so, i thought it might be one fixed object. i was completely sober and awake when i witnessed the lights. i didn't tell my wife until three days agao -

Stonington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My cell phone charger had broke and i was driving southbound on route ninety five.  i looked to the east and noticed a fairly good sized cloud.  to the east of the cloud there was a contrail that had begun to be dispsersed by the wind.  in between these two points of reference and low down towards the horizon there was a shiny triangle, just sitting there not moving just sitting there.  as i continued to drive i kept my eye on it, i went behind a bend in the highway and when i could see it again, the triangle was now about halfway up the vertical length of the cloud and it had left a contrail.  at this point i pulled over to the side of the highway and got out of my truck with my binoculars.  i rested my elbows on my tool box and trained the binoculars on the object.  when i had got it into focus the object looked like it was made of a shiny angular(square) frame.  it still looked like a traingle but inside the triangle there was three circles that looked like very big halogen lights.  i work in a winery and we have four halogen lights that are about a foot in diameter with a kind of cage around them that is what it reminded me of.  i kept the binoculars on in it for a few minutes, but the binoculars aren't very high powered so what i just wrote is  basically all that i saw.  upon reflection i think it could have been in the shape of a pyramid.  after a few minutes i checked my watch and was going to be late for work so i packed it in, no one else on the road seemed to notice. \r\n\r\n i had also seen four craft similar to these about three and a half years ago.  i was driving down route three at around the same time,three or four in the afternoon i was wearing shorts at the the time so i think it was in june or july of two thousand seven.  i was heading in a south westerly direction along the same route as ninety five i was in rhode island this time, around the exeter/coventry area.  i looked up in the western sky and saw three shiny triangles in a traingle formation.  as i followed the road they would move in and out of my line of sight, well they weren't moving i mean my sight of them was periodically obstructed over about a fifteen minute period.  for the last five minutes of sight i observed a fourth object that looked identical to the others a little to the west and higher in the sky from the position of the original formation that i saw.  i didn't have the binoculars at the time so i didn't pull over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso not to cram so much in here but i have three more quick stories to relate about a different type of object.\r\n\r\n \r\nas i said i work at a winery in stonington connecticut.  in the summer my job includes hedging the rows, this is basically walking up and down the rows and trimming the tops of the plants once they have grown over the top guide wires.  being that the vineyard is a wide open space it affords a veru clear view of the air traffic, we are close to the coast so we get a lot of coast guard planes, as well as larger c 130s from the military base in quonsett point rhode island, so i am no stranger to seeing planes and blimps, but they always have wings that are usually visible even at high altitudes.  well it was probably in july mid july a tuesday around two thirty because i had just decided to knock off and walk in.  i turned north to star walking up the hill and i saw it. it was moving swiftly towards the east.  at first i thought it was the coast guard cargo plane, but it was much bigger, and it  had no wings. the way i first described it was like a large propane tank, a hundred feet, maybe twice that, laid on its side.  it was all white except for a red stripe about one third the way up it from the back end, it was moving at a very fast rate exiting my line of sight before i could cover about fifty feet.  at first i thought it might be  a blimp, but the top and bottom were flat and only the two ends were rounded, later i heard someone describe something that they had seen as like a tylenol caplet, which is also a good description as far as i'm concerned.  also if it was a blimp i would think that the sponsor's name would so up clearly on it.  i mentioned it to a couple people and they thought i had seen the hood milk blimp i went on the internet and searched for pictures of it and found quite  a few, but these were obviously blimps, bulging out in all directions and no staight lines except on the pilot house.  again the object i saw looked like the top and bottom were as straight as an arrow.\r\n\r\ni had two other sighting of the same object over the next four days, two days later i saw it again from the vineyard heading in the same easterly direction at roughly the same time.  and then on saturday of that smae week my fiance and i were heading north on ninety five around exit six in ri it passed again heading east.  both my fiance and i saw it that time and she says she didn't see any wings either, but she isn't sure that it wasn't a blimp of some sort.\r\n\r\nthese ar ethe experiences i've had and i would just like to pass them on to you hoping you can use them to further the case for disclosure.  if i can be of any help you are welcome to contact me.  i heard on coast to coast that you are skeptical about multiple sightings, but it is what it is, hope you can use my information.\r\n\r\n\r\njames","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

lived across the street from the beach) when we heard the huntington beach police helicopter coming overhead and it was rather unusual in that it was quite loud as it was very low maybe 500 ft. and to our surprise it was in hot pursuit of a small,dull metallic object. we both were employed at boeing long beach and are quite familiar with aircraft. my yearly physical confirmed my good eyesight as 20/17 at the time.  we went through a checklist right away and confirmed no beacons,wings,or propulsion units of any kind, however we could easily see the details of the helicopter. we also could not detect any sound at all from the object. it was about 10 ft. in diameter or so and a bronze color and somewhat weathered. it performed some zig-zag moves that were very impressive! the 'copter just couldn't keep up with it at all. it gave me the willys as it flew around the electrical plant a few times then shot off inland and out of sight! this all lasted about 20 seconds so no chance to take a picture. i thought about running inside and getting my camcorder but i sensed it would be over shortly and it was. i really wish i could have videoed it because it would have been proof that something

poway and pomerado road. we were talking while facing in a southerly direction. it was a very clear day with no clouds in the sky and a minimal amount of humidity in the atmosphere. as i was speaking to him; i noticed a very bright light appear in the sky. it's brilliance and movement drew my attention immediately. the light was so bright that i knew it wasn't an aircraft or helicopter. it was approximately 12 inches (relative) above the southern horizon. its point of origin was approximately 175 degrees on the compass. it was traveling at an undetermined, but very high rate of speed. from the point of origin; it was traveling north, north east to a point on the compass that would have ended at approximately 20 degrees. the relative distance that it traveled was approximately two and a half feet from its point of origin. it covered this distance in approximately ten seconds. \r\n\r\napproximately 3 minutes after the object disappeared two f/18's traveling from the north east came to the point where the object disappeared. they circled this area once then continued south west. thirty seconds later a third \"trailer\" f/18 came from the same direction and loitered over the area where the ufo had been for approximately 3 minutes. it then egressed to the south west as well. the flight patterns of any aircraft either landing or taking off from miramar air base is well known, as are the flight paths of aircraft that are in the area while performing carrier landings, touch and go exercises, or mutual support missions in this area. the flight path of the three f/18's was well out of normal parameters. as the f/18's approached the area where the object had been they slowed dramatically (no more than 300 knots).These factors, coupled with the fact that their flight path would have put them in direct \"head on\" contact with the object as they flew south west and it traveled north east, gave the impression that they were not only looking for what i had seen but had been on an intercept coarse. the owner of the establishment also saw the object and the f/18's but without his permission i did not want to include his information.\r\n\r\nthe object was a brilliant oval shaped light. as it traveled north east it grew in size. when i first saw the object it was approximately five centimeters across. it had increased to approximately 12 centimeters before it disappeared. it's change in distance to me as well as it motion makes it highly improbable that it was reflected light. the light was not only brilliant but constant and did not shimmer or shake. there were no visible anti collision lights of any pattern including red or green. in fact the light from the sun was so bright that the anti collision lights from the f/18's were not visible either. the object made no sound, left no vapor or exhaust trail, and if it's rate of travel was above 620 mph it made no sonic boom. after several second of observing the object i got an uneasy feeling. i would not describe it as fear but unrest as my mind went through the possible causes of the light and continued to fail to come up with a reasonable explanation. the individual that i was with was equally disturbed. i saw the object first but after i pointed it out to him he couldn't take his eye's off of it. it was not exhibiting non-ballistic motion or any other flight characteristic, other

and happened to look at the north eastern sky at the same time and saw an odd blinking red and white light on what i thought was airplane moving from the northwest towards the east. it appeared odd to me as the lights blinked more often than that of a normal plane and the way the way it flew in what i perceived as being in very quick spurts made me watch it for a few seconds. as i was watching another set of  blinking lights appeared to the right and pretty darn close to the first plane. i then looked at the first plane again and thought the planes were heading toward each other and i was hoping they were just playing games and would not crash in mid-air.  then all of a sudden the first plane, the one of the left, disappeared and reappeared to the second plane's right and seconds later approximately 10 little red/pink balls strung out horizontally and then quickly disappeared. i dont remember looking for the planes after the light display.\r\n\r\njust before the second plane appeared i was able to make out a shape for the first plane. i can best describe it as a right angle, meaning it was missing a wing and tail and it's body and only wing were of equal size and length. i dont recall hardly any details about the second plane. i only noticed its lights.\r\n\r\nanswer to number 5: when i saw the first plane disappear i was very excited and hoping i was watching ufos. when the pinkish red lights appeared i was juggling my phone in my hand trying to get the camera working but i was way too excited to think how to get it to operate. i wasnt scared but i was disappointed after my sighting because more than likely what i saw was a military exercise.","distance":"Over One
