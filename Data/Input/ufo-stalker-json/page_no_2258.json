event vividly. i was riding in the car with my mother and younger sister on our way to school. we came up to the stop sign at the end of the road facing east. the sun was coming up and you could easily see a star about 45 degrees in the sky. the star grabbed my attention because it started pulsating and getting brighter. i don't believe it's a star at all actually, it's in the sky most times of the year and day and doesn't flicker like other stars. anyway, we all sat there and watched the star for a couple of minutes. very suddenly, another bright star-like object seemed to drop down very quickly from the original star. it circled the star a few times and then seemingly became stationary. the object came closer and closer, very quickly. it stopped and hovered above a few houses right in front of us. it was about 300ft long (estimating) on each of its three sides. we all had a very long time to take a look at it because it didn't move for almost 15 minutes. three glowing circles were on the underside. all three changed color from blue to green to red and orange. it made absolutely no sound at all, and it didn't move. i was very scared, and couldn't believe what i was looking at. then all of a sudden it accelerated west and out of sight in a split second. i believe it came out of or from that star. it's always there and wonder if its the international space station. this

it for a few moments while smoking the cigar i could actually tell it was moving. at this time i still thought it was nothing (being a huge skeptic and thinking ufos are bs) but after continually observing it i was able to logically rule out anything i thought it could be.  it was at this time i told my brother about it.  i almost jokingly, \"i think this might be a ufo here\" (still just not really believing what i was seeing.  it was bright with colors rotating throughout it (90% sure these colors were just red, green, blue but there could have been subtleties i didn't completely perceive).  there were strobing lights coming from it at times, radiating out at least 5 times the width of the object.  it moved but not very fast, and it appeared to move back and forth a little but mostly in a single direction.  i tried to get some video but my handheld hd camera wouldn't pick it up in such light conditions.  my brother got his binoculars out of his truck and we observed it through those.  you could then clearly see it was almost a chrome light, and the colors made it almost look like a pearl glowing very brightly.  you could see the strobes very clearly with the binoculars.  after observing it for a while we went back in due to how cold it was but would step out and look at it every few minutes.  we almost convinced ourselves it was a star but then on the next trip out it was gone.  i've always thought ufos were just people seeing planes, etc but this was unreal.  still i think at the most it's just some advanced military craft.","distance":"Over One

no wind being generated nothing, but an intelligence we felt not of this world, as we have nothing and i don't care what we have revers engineered~ this craft must be thousands of years ahead of any technology we now have! it hung motionless for about ten minutes then tipped down towards a fair that was going on at the time as if to have been attracted buy the lights of the fair rides, it remained that way for about five minutes then slowly straight ed out again, it stayed that way for about five more minutes then began leaving at about twenty mile increments at high speed until it was out of sight! people where climbing on to there garages and houses to get better views the whole time. my friends an i where very exited and ran to my girl friends house to report it to the news, they said they had a flood of calls in on this sighting, soon we saw on the news that the authority's claimed~ it was a plain carrying an advertisement sign.  well i must say  after that obvious lie! i lost my trust in our authority`s, it made me so mad that the gull of these few people if you want to call them that! put me on a quest to find out who and what and why this grope feel thy know whats

january of 1996.It was witnessed by me my wife,also her secound(reported to mufon already)and my brother in-law.It was 10 pm and we were in pasadena texas and lived on vista between the beltway and burke st..We were on our way to block buster to take back some movies.My wife is driving,im in the passenger seat and my brother in-law behind me.Where driving down vista and im looking out the window and notice what i thought was an airplane.Being that we live around air ports its normal to see them flying.But this thing.Im picturing it my head now and this thing had no lights and it was dark.Thats what caught my attn. but what really got me to say something was it was just sitting there.At that time it was a distance away.I told them look,look what is that.My wife and my brother in-law start to watch with shock.By this time we are coming up to a turn.The street im talking about is the entrance to bayshore hospital.This part is were it gets wierd.We want to see this obect so we make the turn and pull into a drive way of the townhouses.But what was first at a distance,and this is were i have to explain becouse its so strange.As soon as we put the car in park we jump out and the next thing we see is this craft right above us.As i write this im feeling real angsiaty now.What i remember is im looking up and can see the bottom it dark in color but i can see that its ridged.In that instance when we jumped out it started moving away totally silent we watch it float away,and we then go on to block buster.For some reason after this encounter when i think now we never talked about it.Til now.This thing was so larg i dont remember even seeing the sides of it.\r\nnow what im about to tell you is why im reaching out to mufon.This is what i just found out about my wifes memory of the sighting.She said she did remember seeing the craft and thinking like we were what is this.I asked her what do you remember when we jumped out of the car?And i was shocked to what she told me.She said that as soon as we jumped out she saw a bright white light coming from the bottom of the craft.This gave me chills.Then she told me \"thats what i thought it was weird hearing you say it was black and ridged,she recalled a engulfing light.So this is the reason i felt so strongly on reporting.But nervous as i start to put things together,its overwellming.This craft was over us,and the hospital was no more then 500 ft.From us.This was me and my wifes secound encounter and this one was so diffrent then the first.You might be asking about my brother in-law.Just recently he has made contact with us.Since we havent seen him in 9 years.Im going to write him and ask him about that nite in 96.I am going to make no mention of what i have reported today to him in hopes to discover another piece of this puzzle.I will surely keep everyone informed.(story is completly true).And the reason im here is to hopefully get some answers. i am serious about this and would only want serious feed back.If i can make contact with someone i can trust i want to tell you of the dream i had a couple of years later that really got this ball rollin.Thnx so much-brother

 it was february  15, 1979 at night although i don���t know what time it was, the sky was crystal clear as i made my way through the mountains from winslow down to the valley.  there was literally no one else on the road, so i was able to use both lanes as i speeded around mountain curves.  i was close to strawberry and there was still snow covering the ground when i looked up through the windshield to see a strange aircraft moving west to east fairly slowly.  it was a golden color light and looked like it had light protrusions sticking out from the center.  i saw no blinking lights at all and as it moved to my left it drove my curiosity enough to totally stop on the road and roll down my window so i could hear the sound it made.  i stuck my head out the window, but there was no sound.  just about then it���s light dimmed to the illumination of just a star and it speeded up quickly moving to above a mountain towards the north  and it stopped and hovered.  well i rolled up my window and started driving down the mountain and i thought ���did i just see a ufo��� and as i thought about what i just saw i tried to figure out what else it could be.  i was driving at about 80 mph and after about 5 minutes i was down below the snow level and the road turned with the mountain from a southerly direction to an easterly direction and i glanced to my left to look north at the mountain the aircraft was hovering over, and it was still there, but just then a rock pile on the side of the road blocked my view and when i had drove beyond it i could see it sitting there not moving.  i jammed on my brakes coming to a screeching halt.  rolled down my window and looked at it. it came at me so bright so fast that within a half a second it had moved 10 miles to right in front of my face. the light was so bright, i was so scared i was shaking and couldn���t find first gear for seemed like forever, but i nailed the gas and the thing  started following along side just off the edge of the road which was a 300 foot drop.  i was able to get that car up to 90 mph and the object stayed with me for 10 minutes. as i drove i was nervous and i kept looking at my speedometer and then at the object hoping gravity would pull my car faster until i came around the mountain where you could see the lights of phoenix.  the valley was lit with a million twinkling lights.  the object appeared to speed up and then disappeared over the valley.  i could not believe what i just witnessed. was this a ufo?  as i continued to drive home i could not wait to tell someone.  as i drove i finally made it down to the desert floor and after about 3 miles i looked up and saw it again just hovering about 100 feet above the desert in front of me where i had to drive. i slowed down to 20 mph and it crossed over the road in front of me.  but it still was hovering about 100 feet off the road.  although i was scared i kept driving and as i passed just off to the left under it i could see it was more of a large object and the golden light was under it.  after i went passed it, it did not move from it���s hovering position.  now i started driving at normal speed trying to make it home.  i had a long way to go because floods had washed out all the roads through the river bed.  the only crossing point was in tempe on the mill st. bridge.  that took about an hour.  when i got home it was 3a.M. and rick was sound asleep.  well i decided to just go to bed and tell him about it in the morning.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16258,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4577671,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03262009-0012","longitude":-112.0685773,"occurred":287913600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":287913600000,"summary":"Followed

be the same object, move through the sky, at which point, i asked my mom to attempt to follow it.  i managed to get a couple of pictures with her camera on her phone, but they didn't come out very good.  the object remained stationary in the sw sky as we were driving home.  at which point i called my brother and told him to look in the sw skies for the object, at which point he said that he didn't believe it to be anything because he has observed the same thing in the sky for the past 2 weeks!  i got home and began charging the video camera, at which point, i observed the extremely bright object, waay brighter than anything i had ever seen in the skies before, in the sw sky just above the trees.  i wasn't positive (and still aren't \"positive\" that it was a ufo or an alien craft), but it did appear to move slightly during the duration of its presence.  then, i also noticed at least two other, smaller, but clearly moving star-like objects not far from the main object that seemed to be sort of circling the main object approximately 2-300 yards away.  not unlike/very similar, but differing in its luminescence from the other star-like object i observed and reported last year.  i did manage to get about 30 seconds of one of the smaller, clearly moving star-like objects (unfortunately, our video camera battery wasn't charged and unfortunately we can not pre-charge the battery and leave it charged, most likely due to its age), but i also managed to capture about 30-45 mins of the main, extremely bright object as well.  after observing it for that amount of time, i went back inside the house for no more than approx. 15-20 mins., at which point i went back outside and found that the object was gone!  the sky was still clear so i knew it hadn't gone behind any clouds.  then, a short distance from where the object had appeared when it was stationary, i saw, what i believed to be the same extremely bright object, moving just above and thru out the trees in the eastern direction, which i did manage to get on tape!  i saw the object in the same general direction for the following 3-5 days but haven't seen it in the skies since.  i am still unsure of just

sky that i had never noticed before. i often stargaze while i'm out back with my dog, so i knew that something was different.  they then both began to move west. i instantly ran inside to get my video camera. when i came back out, they had moved about 45 degrees to the west from when i left them.  up until this point, they were an equal distance apart. they then both blanked out and then instantly reappeared much further apart. they did this twice. the entire time that i was trying to film them, my cheap auto focus video camera couldn't hardly pick them up. then the most westward one sent out three very bright and distinct strobes. then the second one replied with a series of strobes itself. they then began to move at a slightly faster pace, whilst continuing to strobe to each other. at no time were any of the strobe sequences the same. if one sent out three strobes, the other would do a different number of strobes.  it was extremely obvious that the two ufos were communicating with one another. i continued to try to film them as they continued westward and out of my sight line.  once i could no longer see them, i got my iphone and googled mufon oklahoma, and called the number listed, and told the person what had just occurred. being a former police officer, i have had numerous hours of training in observation. these were absolutely not airplanes. airplanes don't disappear and reappear miles from where they just were in an instant. there was no sound, but even if they were emitting sound, they were so high up that i wouldn't have been able to hear them. when you witness something like this, it gives you a feeling inside that is absolutely unique. it's like you're hit with the realization that you are actually witnessing a ufo incident, and the feeling is just indescribable. but to try to put into words how it makes you feel is like the most scared that you could be, mixed with the most excited you could be, mixed with the most confused that you could be.
