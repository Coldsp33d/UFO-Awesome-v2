what--i can not keep the time zone straight, but it was before it changed to the time we have now)i am not sure which tuesday it was but before march and sometime in  middle february. my friend and i were getting in the pickup to go dancing.  as we walked to the pickup, i remarked how bright the stars were and how clear the sky was and no wind (which we had been having).  we saw the evening star in the west and as i was looking at the clear sky, i looked around the sky and in the southeast i saw a circle of lights with maybe 6 or 8 lights.  they appeared as if i was looking at the stars very far away but in perfect cirle. in front of the circle, or (hovering above the formation, it is hard for me to explain) was a formation with 7 objects in the shape of a v. as i saw them i said \"look at that\".  my friend said \"what\" and i said \"those things flying\".  they were in such perfect formation and my friend couldn't see what i was pointing at, at first, and by the time he looked up and saw them they had moved from the southeast to the north west and just about as he located them they were out of sight. he said \"those are geese\" because it resembled their formation and shape, only the wings didn't \"flap\".  i said \"geese don't fly at night\".  by the time of those few sentences, the formation was gone out of sight. it didn't seem they flew out of sight as much as if they just disappeared heading in the northwest still in perfect formation. they didin't appear to be as far up in the sky as the circle, but they were as high as a jet would fly .  the circle didn't move to the northwest with them, unless it was so high it was out of sight of my natural eye.  i looked back to see the circle and to see if i had imagined things, but my friend said let's go so i got in the pickup and we left.  he doesn't like things like that,but i said \"it seems so eerie because all those things didn't make even one sound\".  he agreed that it was eerie but wanted to dropped the subject.  it only lasted the length of time it took us to say the above sentences.  the sky was so clear that evening.\r\ni didn't report this earlier because i couldn't find any place on the internet, until i read the article about the cow in our local paper today, march 25, 2009, and saw this website.  i didn't report it to the local paper.  i do not like publicity, but do know what i saw.  i also saw a ufo in the fall of 1948 in nebraska, but it didi't look like this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

less than half the altitude of the plane.  i noticed it, saw it disappear behind the wing and reappear on the other side before leaving my range of sight out of the plane's window.  the object was moving in the opposite direction of our plane, slightly faster than our plane's speed.  at first i thought it was a power line with some sort of identifying object, but saw no other orbs or power lines.  my next thought was that it was a bird, but i later saw a bird flying below our plane.  the bird was traveling in the same direction and at approximately the same altitude as the object and it was easily recognizable as a bird.  after the sighting i tried to explain to myself what i had seen, but no explanation came to mind.  later seeing a bird which looked very different confirmed that i had seen something unusual and unexplainable.  the object was definitely in the air and looked unusual enough for me to want to report it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

across the sky.  it was a reddish-white colored light and at one point became extremely bright (mostly white) while continuing along its trajectory.  there was no indication of any strobes or beacons as i normally would associate with aircraft.  it was moving away from us in a nw direction.\r\n\r\nno sound whatsoever could be heard and the brightness i observed could only be compared to a very close plane approaching us with its landing lights on.  this object however was traveling away from us and away from any nearby airports.  i estimate initial brightness at 5x the brightest star or planet in the sky and peak brightness at about 10x.  the object disappeared from view beyond the horizon/tree line heading in a nw direction.  it was moving rapidly enough to cover a large swath of sky in less than a minute.  impossible to estimate the exact distance from our vantage point, but i would figure 5 miles north of us, give or take.\r\n\r\ni felt as though i had just watched an event in progress that was difficult to explain or compare to any other aircraft i had seen up to this point.  i scanned the sky and noticed a plane that was heading south to north in same general direction as where we lost sight of the object.  the plane's altitude was 2-3 times higher in the sky, it was only noticeable by the tell-tale strobe-beacon light and seemed to be traveling no more than 1/4 of

norriton township building walking my dog as i do 4-5 nights a week.  it was about 10 pm.  its a great spot to look at the stars and all of the planes flying by because there is very little artificial light at night.  as i watched my dog run around and play, i saw two bright lights in the distance which looked stationary - almost like 2 towers with bright lights atop them.  it seemed odd to me that i had never noticed them before in the 2+ years i had been walking my dog there at night.  as i stared at them, i noticed they had been moving, but very slowly.  i was transfixed on them because they seemed unlike any plane i'd ever seen.  finally, after about 10 minutes, they were directly over me and flying at a very low altitude, and at a very low speed.  they had lights on them that went from what looked like blinking white lights which would change to blinking red and blue lights and then occasionally a non-blinking bright white light.  at first their were only 2.  and then 2 more followed.  i started too look all around me and to the east i could see 3 more.  all flying low, slow, and changing light displays.  in all, i saw a total of 10-12 of them.  another thing is that they generally flew in pairs and very close to each other, much closer than normal planes do.  lastly, they made no noise until they were directly above me, i could hear the faintest rumble of an engine.  other than that, they were earily silent. after watching and watching, eventually they all just flew away and i couldnt see what happened.  after about an hour, the display was over and i still have no clue what i witnessed.  as i was watching, i was confused mainly.  i just could not for the life of me figure out what i was seeing.  the funny part is that the east norriton township building also house the police station.  i easily could have gone in to tell them but i didnt want to cause a stir if i turned out to be overreacting.  i apologize if this is poorly written.  im at work and have a

watching the sky. we live almost under one of the main flight paths for san antonio airport. my patio faces approximately northwest. almost all of the air traffic is on a north/south trajectory. you can clearly see all faa marking lights and landing lights as the aircraft are usually low in altitude. \r\nabout 09:08pm a bright gold flash caught my eye to the west and i immediately focused my attention there. i saw a very bright sold gold orb moving from the west to east at a very fast pace. it had no tail and was very well defined. it did not fade in or out, but simply appeared for about a second and disappeared. i got up and moved towards the west side of my patio to make sure that a small tree had not obscured the view, but it was not there. in about thirty second another bright gold object appeared just below where i had seen the first one. this one had a bright tail behind it that appeared to be debris like a sparkler would give off. it too disappeared in about a second. i yelled at my wife that we might be having a comet show. after watching the sky for another 30 minutes and not seeing anything else unusual i thought more about it and since the sky was very overcast i began to doubt that the two object could have been shooting stars because of the overcast and the fact that they were on a flat trajectory and not descending. watching planes coming in for a landing i could see that their lights were somewhat diminished in brightness until they got lower and closer which would indicate that the cloud cover was fairly low. please see the attached picture that i took this morning to get an idea of the position on the horizon and the distance they covered. \r\ni would like to mention that i saw something similar back in about october 2008 but the gold object traveled along the western horizon just above and along the entire roof line of our house. it only took it about three second to do this. i didn���t think much of it at the time as the sun was just setting and the sky was clear. the one odd thing is that it appeared in a bright flash and then instantly got smaller before it went above the roof line. i just thought it was a shooting star as well. i am a long time ufo buff and i read your daily reports and look at the pictures. i am usually very skeptical of what most people would like to call a ufo. i would very much like to know if anyone else saw these objects above san antonio last night.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16236,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.4324019,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03252009-0005","longitude":-98.4875282,"occurred":1237954080000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1237954080000,"summary":"Gold

appeared to be a plane taking off, although there are no airports in my area. it seemed to be flying at a height of about 250 feet, in an eastward direction at about a 30 degree angle. it seemed strange, but i didn't pay much attention to it until i saw it make a dramatic climb in altitude. it went from flying at a 30 degree angle to flying at about an 80 degree angle. it was practically flying vertically, and it was climbing altitude rapidly. after about 5 seconds of flying, it had probably risen to a height of about 600 feet. then, it gradually began to level - off. it took about 3 seconds for it to get level again. once it was level, it slowly turned left and headed north towards me and my dog. it banked, and its triangular shape became apparent. unsure of what this thing was, i started to run back home to tell the rest of my family, so that they could come and see it. but, as it flew closer, i decided to stay and watch it, because it was so fascinating. it was probably flying at around 70 miles per hour. as it approached and passed overhead, i was able to see its underside. it was clearly a triangular aircraft. from my point of view, the object was about the size of a baseball, and all three sides of the object were the same length. it was black or gray in color, and it had one small white light on each corner (which made 3 white lights altogether), and one small red light in the center. it continued to fly north, and i watched it until it disappeared behind the trees. throughout the entire flight, it made a low whistling noise, similar to a quiet \"whoooosh\" sound. it sounded similar to the sound that an airplane makes as it moves through the air, but i didn't hear the humming of an engine. the entire experience probably lasted about 1 minute.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

towards grissom but in kokomo so whatever direction that is. i noticed these 2 lights a little redder than the peach color of street lights towards my left. i assumed it was two plains in the clouds flying near each other with lights on. ahead of me and towards the right i saw a low flying re fueler with all its lights on so i would say it was about 150 ft in the air. i realized it was about same distance away from length and highest of other 2 plains and i looked back towards left at them the two lights were closer together, so still assuming they were two plains crossing i put my attention back on refulier. i often wonder how my times re fueler with lights on a mistaken for ufo's there so bright and look strange with all lights on thats why it was holding my attention. i looked back at reddish lights and noticed they were gone and figured they had passed and turned off lights. i was coming towards a 4 way stop and slowing down by this time. i then saw the reddish lights blink on and off 3-4 times but looked to be jumping around. then all at once like a jet dropping flairs in order 1 2 3 4 5 6 maybe 7 of these lights in a perfect line not real bright flairs that close would be but bright maybe do to clouds. i slammed on brakes and grab camera phone flipped open and was about to take picture and gone. 3 second no more were these lit up. i sat there looking for something nothing to be seen no flashing lights from jet nothing. i could see the flashing lights on refulier so i assumed on jet i would be able to see too. on the way home i was thinking maybe that it wasn't two jets passing in sky but these thing flashing lights on and off, that is unknown. what i do come to realize on way home that this thing had to be over man part of kokomo and doubt air force would drop flairs over a city, that even if they could put a 3 sec burn on flairs that they would have burned out in order they were dropped not all at once. i wish i had gotten a picture. i read another person reported this and thinks its flairs i thought it was to at first but not sure with the two things i just stated. i am sure that if there had been a jet i would have seen a flashing light on it do to fact i could see the flashing light on refuler even with all its lights on.","distance":"101-500
