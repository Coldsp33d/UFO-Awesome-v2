friday may 26.  standing outside looking at stars, primarily the big dipper i saw 2 sets of odd lights. i often see satellites cross the sky in the hours after a sunset, so they are very familiar.\r\n\r\nthe first set of strange lights i saw were just 2, no brighter than stars about a thumb width apart if you hold your hand up. they were traveling parallel to each (remaining constant distance from each other) from south to north through the \"ladel\" of the big dipper, about twice the speed of satellites i have observed, no noise at all.  initially i suspected a drone but seemed far to far for their range.\r\n\r\nbut watching them travel north i noticed a new set of lights 5 lights that formed an equilateral triangle cross their path behind them. these lights were also about the brightness of stars, and moving twice the speed of a satellite just as silently. lights configured 1 at the front point 2 additional lights on either side. so they formed a chevron.  these lights traveled from east to west, again through the \"ladel\" of the big dipper, then turned n-nw smoothly.  it didn't appear to bank (as a plane would) because it remained the equilateral triangle shape. size about twice the diameter of the first 2 lights, so maybe 2 thumb widths.\r\n\r\nthe total event was short just maybe 10-15 seconds before fading.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

store. i was headed east on winchester road  just east of hacks cross road and noticed something of low altitude  precisely following the road headed  west  towards me.  at first sight, i thought it was an airplane but thought the  low altitude and  slow  speed  made that impossible.   there was absolutely no engine sound – or any other sound i could discern at that time. there was no other traffic on the road so i stopped  in middle of the road and watched. there was no sound at all as the craft very slowly approached me.   i estimate it took approximately three minutes to reach me from the time i first spotted the craft.  during that time  the craft traveled a distance of about a   quarter to a half mile. it maintained a very slow forward speed and a very low altitude (estimate 40-50 feet maximum).  when it got directly above me it actually  hovered.  i heard a loud airish – whooshing – roaring sound  and,  leaning out the car window to look up, felt very strong air current coming from the craft.   other than when it was directly overhead, i heard and felt nothing.   it was almost as if the air current was initiated   once the craft iwas above me. it hovered for 20 to 30 seconds and then continued on the path it was on (headed west following winchester road).   the craft was triangular/wedge shaped and appeared to have no markings or lights.   however when it was directly above me i could see the underside  was very covered and crowded with  indiscernible  \" instruments.\"   as the craft hovered i attempted to take a picture/video with my phone. i was oddly disoriented, clumsy, uncoordinated and could not accomplish the simple act of  taking the photo or opening the door of my car to get out and take a picture.  during the entire incident i did not see  another  vehicle on the road which seemed to be a bit odd to me.  i at least had the impression the downward air current ceased and the craft continued on its way.  i watched it for a couple of minutes and then drove on to my destination.

lit trees in the front windshield from our headlights, no cars on road. into my view, from left to right, came a brownish triangle with red orange lights, one in each tip of triangle. it was right above the front of the car about tree top or less, moving fast, and then jerked up and to the sky as fast as can be, when the 2nd one appeared doing the same maneuver and looked the same.  not a sound was heard from them. they went straight up and disappeared in the darker sky. they both seemed to be some sort of metal.  i told my husband that there were two ufo's that had zoomed past our moving car.  he sat higher in the seat and didn't see much of them, just a glow.  i looked back to see them again out of the right side and back window but they were gone. however that is when i saw the second odd one, higher in the sky.  it was stationary in the sky and it formed a cross.  there were at least 20 to 30 circular lights making a straight line and with 15 or so lights making the cross.

spotted a star in the sky. i was just enjoying the breeze when i realized that the it was supposed to rain so practically there shouldn't be any stars in the sky. so i again looked up again to find few more stars but i was taken aback on finding none. then, i started to observe the object closely which i usually do. i found it like an arrow initially. i thought i was imagining and hence rubbed my eyes and closely checked it again. when i focused i found it in the shape of a triangle.\r\n   i ran to call my friend. she confirmed the same. we were surprised and started thinking of the possibilities. i initially tried to take a picture but due to poor lighting, i couldn't take one. when my friend went to get her mobile, the object started to diminish that is its brightness decreased and then the size started getting reduced rapidly. within a minute, the object had become too small just like a normal star. to any other person it would appear the same as it was just like a star, a small circle. but this one was not blinking at all.\r\n   this entire scenario was from 11:00 to 11:10 pm to be precise. it could have started before too but i can bet that it was not in the sky until 8pm that day and it don't last after 11:10pm. it stayed like a star till 11:30 i guess, and hey, i just checked out right now (12:07 pm) and the object is completely gone. it is a full black sky with the same cool breeze flowing and not a single star in it which can be viewed by naked eye.  \r\n   i had strong doubts of spotting an ufo but i don't actually believe it. i regretted not having a telescope at that moment with me and mentally decided o buy one asap. so, i just googled hoping to find a star or any other such shaped object but alas! the first thing that i came up with was an ufo. it was from an article titled as \"ufo hunters claimed to have spotted a triangular object over melbourne.\" the image in it was 80% matching with the one which we saw today, just the color of sky was pitch black. \r\n   then the first thing that came in my mind was to report to someone, so i logged into my quora account and came across your link. so, i posted my story here.Please help me in

my mother has always called me her celestial and i used to cry every night as a baby for the moon. san antonio ufo sightings (saufosightings) founder calls me regularly and believes they are attracted to my energy. ufo's and orbs are being seen (207,000 reports) almost daily, but most witness only once. in november's conference on extraterrestrial existence in canada, they stated billions have been put forth towards seeking et life and ufo's. . . i would like to personally invite anyone interested to witness these beings and ufo's to my home. you may film, take photos, and even see how they react when i just step outside. it's a 100% guarantee  hundreds will be seen regardless of what month or what night. it is very important to me that i show someone all of these things from my backyard. my parents came all the way from west texas to sit outside and watch them with me along with neighbors and friends. they are not all over san antonio nightly, but over my home, countless.  you can also tell the difference between each civilization  and the fact that some of these have wings. watching them with the naked eye is different then pictures or videos. sometimes electronics pick them up differently than what you can actually see. the largest one i've ever witnessed was  almost football field sized with huge multi colored lights all the way around this rectangular object. the lights were the size of a small swimming pool.  as i was videoing a ufo hovering above me, a bright light beam down on me lighting up the ground all the way around me, terrified, i turned to look as it swooped down almost like a bird would over water, knocking me to the ground, yet it didn't touch me. . . it had no sound, breeze, odor, or heat. i've jumped in my car and chased one only once. as i was navigating through the  neighborhood trying to keep up with it, i saw two others just like it. i turned down newcome street in front of my sons school and afraid of it losing me, i pulled over jumped out of my car held my ipad up and just began taking photos. what came out in the photograph was totally different from what i could see with the naked eye. it was round, multicolored light  beamed up words out of the object. the lights on it were huge and bulbous. it stopped and hovered over the right side of newcome. . . it knew i was looking at it. it was aware. . . then took off zipping down the street towards evers rd. too fast for me to have kept up. if anyone wants to witness or feels they have to see to believe, they are here and i will introduce them as i have many. i am a mother and nurse and an active sister at church. i finally told my pastor a couple sunday's ago. this past sunday, he informed the  congregation that he had talk to god about a few things with god answering tell your congregation that it's time to prepare it is the beginning. this is a man of great discernment.  a true man of god. my mother, tamara crockett has been a member of the paranormal and psychic research institute in switzerland since november of 1977. another strong gift in our family. i've seen hundreds of spirits since i was 12 yrs old.  i had to finally set visiting hours with them so that i could get sleep in order to get up and work the next morning as a nurse. they were keeping me up and i wasn't getting good rest. it just so happens that it worked! so that's what everyone in the family now does. they set visiting hours.  finally, i would like to add that i graduated first out of 120 students in college with a 4.0 with no diagnoses of schizophrenia or hallucinations. lol. i know i'm not crazy, this is real! thank you so much for your time.

kitchen window . at the begening i didn't even know why, after 20 mins i started seing red and blue light hover 30 feet into the air . where i lived was more then 80 achers of weat field . so i asked myself ''are these newly instaled light fixtures that they had put up for planes to not hit the mountains '' or something like that . then they started moving , almost appering at a different spot , but in an unpredictable fassion. blue on top and red on the bottom , it seemed that it was two small crafts , but i could only see these lights .They where about 5 to 6 acres from where i was . i was very attracted by these light. it was about 11 pm and had school the next day so i went to bed . i told my mom the next morning . \r\n\r\ntwo days later i did the same thing with some apreancion , but i dind't feal scared.The same accurence happend after looking out for abot 30 min, it seemed like the lights where playfull . like they where wanted to distract me from what they where doing . side not, the mountains that are 40 acres away are the oldest mountains on earth . so i don't know if they where scanning the ground or looking for something . after an hour of watching them , had to go to bed .\r\n\r\nlater that week i was looking deep into the field with my binoculaires , expecting them to be far away arround the area where i ha sean them , but after 20 mins i got tired and put my binoculairs down and simply looking out the window for a wile. when out of the blue this ship appeared out nowhere .The ship was at least the the size of a baseball field . i was at the same distance as those prevous lights. i couldn't beleive my eyes. aldought it was far away it slowly filled the window with its inormaty . the front of it looked like an illongated piramid and the back was diamond shapped with 4 pulsating domes that would move in and out . it seemed to propulse it forward. i was realy stuned . as it moved passed the window and out of view . i had to go out side on to my portch to continue seeing it , but at that point i got scared a bit and asked myself if that was  good idea to go out there .Something confirmed to me that it was ok , so i whent .When i got out theres i noticed that the ship was completly silent.  i was able to see move over the house in the neighbour hood for about 3 mins and it dissapered .I'm unsure if there was lost time at that moment. i told my family but they didn't see anything .\r\n\r\nwhen recaling the moment i see a big light surounding me but i know that there was no light on the large craft . very starnge . for several years i forgot about the insident and would recal it from time to time .Just last month i asked myself why where they there and in a dream that night i saw that they where there for water .

and a captain in the civil; air patrol. i have been a scanner during many sarex's. i am not current but have flown many missions with the civil air patrol doing border patrol missions at the new mexico, mexico border. the date was wednesday, may 24, 2017. you can check the times and locations via the \"spot the station\". i am sure the event we witnessed was real. if it were an airplane it would have made noise.  even if it were a helicopter, which fly over house very often, we would have heard it.I am a former police officer, sheriff, volunteer fire fighter captain and training officer and an,emt. i retired from the los alamos national lab. so i know what we saw was real.\r\n\r\ni hope some one else saw what we saw.  if so please let me know.  \r\n\r\nrespectfully
