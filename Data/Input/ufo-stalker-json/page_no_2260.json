strange light in the sky moving at incredible speed. it suddenly stopped on a dime over a field about a mile or so off the highway. i pulled my car to the shoulder as we were wondering what it was. suddenly is appeared to land in the field and when it did we could make out a disk shape but due to the darkness it was hard to tell exactly. it was a cloudy night. i pulled my binoculars out of the back seat and when i focused in i saw what did indeed appear to be a saucer like object on the ground. i at first dismissed this as a feeder for livestock due to my poor visibility and it being a farmers field with livestock. i soon realised this object had what appeared to be a door of somesort that opened up and a redish orange light could be seen when it opened from what appeared to be the interior. then suddenly it appeared 3 men walked out of the craft and the door shut. the craft then after about 3 minutes rose upward hovered for a brief time then took off northbound at a very high rate of speed and i lost sight. i then refocused on the field to see if i could see any one or any thing in the field but visibility was very poor. i did note to my wife that they appeared to be walking in the direction af a rest stop that was just off of the field near the high way. i wanted to make a u turn and go northbound and stop at the rest stop but my wife wouldnt let me, she was getting concerned that maybe it could be aliens. i have lived in the area 35 years and never have seen anything like this. we do live near fort hood but the military to my knowledge does not have anything disk shaped in it's arsenal. i never regained sight of the 3 figures but they did leave the craft and my wife refused to stick around for it's return if it did come back at all.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:06:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

no smoke coming off it. it was also the wrong color. most flares are yellow,orange and from wherenwe were we alsocould not see a parachute on it either. we were equipped with high power field glasses and a b.C. scope and were only about 2000 meters from the mountain ridge,so we could see it very well. it was a brilliant blue color almost as intence as an arc welders arc when he is welding.The shape was like an almond on its side and as near as we could tell it was about 100 feet long. ithovered about 500 feet above the ridge for about 15 to 20 minutes then it did the strangest thing. it dimmed so much yyou could hardly see it then reappeared down range about 25 miles and re appeared. it was almost like it moved with out moving for lack of a better discription. then it went slowly down behind the ridge out of sight.When i reported the incident to range control there was suddenly a new voice on the radio telling me to report to the provost marshalls offiec a.S.A.P. when i arrived i was hand cuffed and taken into a back office. there i was informed by a two star general and two gentle men in black suits that i was to keep my mouth shut about what i saw and that if i said anything toanyone about the incident that it is a big desert out there and it would take a long time for anyone to find my body. i am taking a huge risk reporting this but i am retired now and i

and i think it wasn't my first sighting, so i got excited and tried to take evidence from it, i tried to photograph it with my phone but the zoom was too little so i went looking for my aunts camera but she had hid the batteries and i couldn't find them, i was afraid it would leave; it took me about 10 minutes to find the batteries and i went to the window but i couldn't see it until, in a suprise had hidden behind the mountain and i took 12 images and 2 videos with her samsung s630 and for my suprise it had stayed for about 3 hours i think, since i dont think it was there from the beginning, in the proximity of the volcano, i just told my mother and my cousin about this and i dont know who else saw it; i always have believed in ufo's and had a lot of experiences but this one i have proof, i don't know if there were any planes or helicopter there but i dont think any helicopter or plane can rise at that much speed and steer so sharply or even have that shape, since also i play flight simulators and know the planes movements and aerodinamycs. i was thankful that it lasted so long, but i don't know how much it lasted, it kept going after i stopped the photos and the

with my 4yr old son and two other people.\r\n\r\nas we left the house we all walked down the driveway towards our vehicles then we noticed a bright white light ascending from behind the house across the road.  it was as big as a large car.  there was no noticable noise coming from the object.  it was a still, quiet slightly overcast evening.  the object seemed to be silent as it ascended into the sky.\r\n\r\nwe all watched the object for about 20-30 seconds trying to comprehend what the object was.  my thoughts at first were that it could have been a low flying plane or helicopter but then realised there was no sound associated with these aircraft.  \r\n\r\nthere was an airplane visible in the sky at the time of us sighting this other object.  as we were watching the object the neighbours across the road arrived home and parked on their driveway.  \r\n\r\nas we watched the object we overheard the occupants of the car across the road say something like \" what's that light in the sky\".  \r\n\r\nit was that remark that prompted me to go to my car and get the video camera.\r\n\r\nby the time i had the camera turned on the light looked like a star in the sky.  i then began to video the object using normal shot on the camera only zooming in on it once or twice which is noticable when played back.\r\n\r\nthe object moved eratically in the sky and seemed to change colour from white to orange, green, red and purple.  it also seemed to change shapes from round to oval and cigar and even looked as if it split in two as it changed direction at high speeds, looking at it through the camera lense.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to fly downwards toward the camera in a roller coaster fashion up and down, this is also very noticable in the footage.  then it seemed to retreat higher in the sky as it got smaller.\r\n\r\ni managed to get approximately three and a half minutes of footage of the object before it zig zagged across the sky rapidly, reducing in size and faded from view in an upward direction.\r\n\r\npart way through videoing the object one of the witnesses left.  this is clearly heard on the audio of the video.  when the object disappeared the rest of us went our separate ways.\r\n\r\ni took the video home and put it onto a dvd.  i am hoping to find an organisation that can help me get the footage analyzed to determine what the object could be.\r\n\r\ndue to the nature of the movements of the object i firmly believe that it is an unidentified flying object and that no aircraft known to man could move at speeds such as this did.  \r\n\r\ni also realise that sceptics may put the eratic movements of the object down to camera shake and movement of the camera, but if watched closely it is noticable that the camera is very steady and that the camera would have to be moved very fast at different angles for the object to achieve such movement, which i believe to be impossible.\r\n\r\nit would be very interesting to find someone with the expertise to analyze this footage to determine that the object is in fact flying in this manner and that it is not due to camera movement.\r\n\r\nif you can help please contact me.\r\n\r\nchris lawson\r\nnew zealand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

sliced off into the field in question the balls had been there since last fall but are hard to find due to the fact our field in this county (are no till)after finding four golf balls and knowing there were more i ventured some where 110 feet further back into the field came across a 12 foot in diameter circle.\r\ni returned home grabbed my sony handy cam and returned to the location of the circle photographed and and took video of the said circle i returned to the area around 5:00 p.M. after inspecting it to be sure i wasn't just seeing what i wanted to see or that it might be something explainable i returned home showed the photo's to my mother,she then proceeds to tell me she could swear she saw something strange in the sky to the north west of our home in the sky i can not on the other hand confirm this myself(in other word i did not see this object).\r\nafter reviewing the photo's and video clips i called a close friend told him i had found something i wanted to get his opinion at about seven thirty we left my home headed to the site i waited to discus the situation with him until we arrived we took more video measured the area and took soil samples while taking video for evidence one sample within the circular pattern and one soil sample from just outside.\r\nthe circular pattern was completely dry while outside of it was damp or moist this is visible in one of my photo's that i will attach to this report it looked as if someone lay a a round pattern on the ground and dried the inner part with a hair drier making a perfect dry pattern in the end.\r\nthere is a pile of dead corn stalks and bean stalks inside the circle that seem to show evidence of a swirl pattern (not well defined but seems to be a slight swirl)to the outer part of the circle the story is different there's an inch or more of plant matter that has been moved in what looks to be an evident swirl pattern around said area,there is more but i'm out of room here,we returned on the 22nd with metal detector compass and a stud finder to test for anything abnormal we got nothing with the metal detector or compass the stud finder on the other hand acted strange which i did not expect and this means nothing to me it was just an idea and these items were all we had to investigate with.\r\nif there is anything that you may want to know further you are welcome to contact me though i do not want to be hounded by outside sources other than mufon,and or mufon investigators in short what i'm saying here is that i don't desire having government officials pulling into my drive way thinking their going to take my camera because i stumbled into something that i may have not been meant to see,so i'm opting the circle below to not have any other person other than a mufon rep or

waking up on the morning of march 12, 2009, i went out on my balcony to have a cigarette.  i live in darmouth nova scotia and i always look to the west, appreciating the beauty of halifax harbour in the morning.  the sun was rising and the sky in the east was a light blue and the sky in the west was a darker blue.  minimal clouds, i do not recall any wind either.  when i noticed 7 or 8 lights in the west well above the horizon.  they simply looked like stars, but it was too light out and i did not see any other stars in the sky.  the lights formed absolutley no pattern or shape but they would move at mind boggling speeds left and right up and down.  sometimes they would kind of fade out then show up again very bright.  i did not count more than 8 but there could have been more.  i stood on my balcony in awe watching these things for a bout 1 minute before i realized i have to tell my girlfriend before she leaves for work.  when she came out to look, literally a few seconds after i called to her, there was a patch of clouds moving in from the right moving left and they blocked the view, she had to catch the bus so she never witnessed them.  i wanted to just stay on my balcony all day and watch these things, but i had to get ready for work.  after my shower i came outside again and they were still there.  the cloud cover was well gone by now and i could see them just as plain as i had almost 20 minutes ago.  \r\n\r\nand that's all.  i have made a call environment canada but they forwarded me to an astonomy dept. at a local university, but i have had no response yet.\r\ni wlil keep you informed of any updates.\r\n\r\n\r\njason muise","distance":"Over One

it but couldent seem to stop looking up, about 2 mins in i noticed they were not moving, thats when i told the people i was with to take a look up there and tell me what they think they saw. we all agreed these objects were not moving. about 10 mins later with us still watching one just dissapeared. then the other light about 3 mins after that slowly faded away kinda like a light bulb does when its about to die, but the object was also moving up.\r\n\r\nnow that night when i arrived home my mother who was also at the fireworks but not anywhere near us started to say \" did you see...\" i cut her off and said the two lights in the sky, we both froze she had also seen the lights and told me the same thing to the tee as to what i saw.\r\n\r\nive also asked a few co workers about this and

pulsating orange orb was seen at 30 degrees above the horizon straight west from my backyard in plainfield moving with incredible speed in a northeasterly manner.  the orb pulsated with a reddish-orange color and did not lose altitude nor break up at any time. skies were 25% overcast with cumulus clouds to the west.  it is interesting to note that the pulsating light had a long frequency of about 10 seconds that never changed.  the speed was so fast that if i went into the house for a camera i would have lost sight of it.  i watched it till it disappeared to the north. also, planes on approach to o'hare airport turn to line up with the runway.  their average speed appears to be at least 150 mph and it looks like they're crawling. so the speed of the orb seemed to move at least 950 mph.  there was no sonic boom or any kind of noise.  the object appeared to be moving from yorkville and to over carol stream.

aeroplane looks like, and i know what a helicopter looks like, both in daylight and at night time.\r\n \r\n what i witnessed truely baffels my mind, i cannot, after much consideration, come up with a

amber. i say this just to give some background.\r\n\r\n i happened to notice an amber light, which looked just like a street light, pass overhead. i observed this light maintained a straight course overhead, and noticed that it made no sound whatsoever.\r\n i continued to watch this light, which travelled on a straight course for no more than 20 seconds. which was enough time for it to get so far away that it became impossible to see. as it got further away, the amber light turned red. i put this down to the way light appears as it travels away, but am not sure what this phenonoma is called.\r\n i know estimating the distance of a light source is subjective at best, i would say that this object was at a height of no moore than 1000 feet, i would contend that it was even lower than that.\r\n this object was in the form of a globe of light, but this is difficult to determine because of my viewing perspective which was directly underneath.\r\n i have never, in all my thirty six years on this earth, seen anything like this. no photo's, sorry.
