could clearly make out this 'ship', it looked like an upside-down boat but much more square, didn't look aero-dynamic at all, moved real slow, and as that bronze-like reflection went over it, then i

towards the sky. there was a lot of ambient light coming from city lights so only the brightest stars were visible. i was looking at the star polaris towards the north east and instead of seeing the one star (polaris) i saw two. then one of them started to move slowly towards the north east. the object initially looked like a star, then momentarily increased in brightness (white light) to the point where it was the brightest object in the sky at that moment (the moon wasn't visible yet). then after just a few seconds the light dimmed and then changed colors from white to red. it continued to dim a bit more but remained red until it slowly faded off to the north east. the entire event lasted a little less than 5 minutes and was clearly witnessed by both myself and my girlfriend. at the same time as the event, there were airplanes in the sky as well, and there was a distinct difference between the object and the airplanes. my initial thoughts were that it could be a satellite, however they are almost impossible to see in my area because the sky never gets dark enough. then i thought it could be either the space shuttle or the iss, but according to spaceflight1.Nasa.Gov neither the shuttle nor the iss would have been visible in northern california on that date.

the house. \r\n  the light did not move like landing lights or spotlight would on a moving aircraft.   \r\n  my son said that he witnessed the same kind of event in the summer, just after dark. he said it was as if we had a spotlight right above our trees in the back yard pointing down.(our trees are approx 80-100ft high) he said at the time he couln't understand, because our lights dont shine

(see calafiacondos.Com for detailed information concerning the location.)\r\n\r\non february 4, 2009, my girlfriend, roberta, and i drove from downtown san diego to my condo at calafia.  we left san diego at approximately 3:00 p.M.  as we were driving south from san diego, beginning almost immediately after leaving downtown, both of us repeatedly commented on the strange clouds in the sky that had been produced by chemtrail activity that had taken place the previous 24-36 hours.  the strange cloud formations continued to be present for the entire trip to calafia.\r\n\r\n\r\nwe got to my condo at approximately 4:00 p.M. and didn't think any more about the strange cloud formations until the next day.  \r\n\r\nat approximately 3:00 p.M., roberta and i went for a walk on the beach and around the grounds and swimming pool.  this was roberta's first trip down to the beach and swimming pool area.  we took her kodak z812 is point and shoot digital camera (several photos of what we saw are included in the attached zip file: \"hand of god.\")\r\n\r\nafter spending some time on the beach, we climbed up the stairs from the beach and began walking south along the cliffs (which are approximately 20-25 feet above the water level) to the swimming pool.  \r\n\r\nas we were walking, roberta said: \"hey look, there's a prisim without a rainbow.\"  i looked up and saw the patch of sky depicted in the center of photo 100_3748 (\"48\")in the attached zip file.  in order to better orient the location of the patch of sky where the light was being refracted, i widened the shot to place the sun at the center of photo 100_3749 (\"49\").\r\n\r\nearlier in the day (evidently approximately 6 and a half hours earlier), i changed the batery in the camera. athough i set the correct date of february 5, 2009, i didn't set the correct time.  the information summary from the \"properties\" on these photos indicates that photos 48 and 49 were both taken at 6:37.\r\n\r\nafter i took photos 48 and 49, roberta and i turned our attention elseware.  however, approximately three minutes later i looked back to the prisim in the sky and saw what is depicted in photos 54, 55, 57 and 58, all of which the info summary indictes were taken at 6:40.\r\n\r\nby 6:43, all that was left is what is depicted in photo 61.\r\n\r\ni have the complete series of photos (20 or so from the beach and 20 or so after the \"hand of god\", all of which were taken at 3264 x 2448 (approximately 8 mega-pixels).  i've played around with various filters and such.  although i'm not an expert, i think there's alot more info in these pictures than meets the eye.\r\n\r\nalso, on march 2, 2009, after a couple days of heavey chemtrail activity, i took 172 photos of some real strange stuff, including some pretty clear photos of a \"flying saucer.\"  (see, the photos attached in the zip file \"flyng saucer.\"  especially photos 100_4218 through 100_4221.)  again, i've got the originals, all of which are 3264 x 2448.  i think that most of these photos also contain alot more info than meets the eye.\r\n\r\ni would love to meet with you to show the originals and discuss this incident.\r\n\r\nfeel free to give me a call.  i'm usually at my home, where i can be reached at 970-372-0955.  or, try my office in san diego at 619-53-0111.\r\n\r\nthanks for your time in reviewing this material.\r\n\r\nrick

this ufo stuff. my father however liked it very much, for some reason. but after what i've seen, i'm a believer. i even thought i was crazy - actually, i still believe that i am indeed crazy... but that event truly disturbed me. \r\n\r\ni'll try my best to explain.\r\n\r\nit was my family vacations. we always go to the country-side when we are on vacations or holidays. on a camping resort corumb���, i don't know if it's like that in english, in portuguese is salto corumb��� - camping clube hotel. i even have the link of their website.\r\nthese are the geografic coordinates of this club.\r\n15���50'49,5\"s\r\n48���45'52,1\"w\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Saltocorumba.Com.Br/index.Php?Id=acesso\r\n\r\nwell, it was a day before christmas, round about midnight. i was sitting outside on the cold and dark night, my parents were inside the house. i was just staring at the stars, i'm a star lover, i confess. so i was just looking up, looking at that beautiful milkyway and all those stars. then something in the horizon caught my eye. a little light, as big as the other stars, at first i thought it was a satellite or something like that. because the little light was doing a straight movement. but, all of a sudden the little light started to return on the line it was doing. it was doing a up-forward-straight movement, then it started to go right back at the same movement it was doing. i thought it strange, and i started to follow the light with my eyes. when the light reached the ground, it made a motion on the horizon. as i was looking: an up, down, right and left movement. \r\n\r\nit really started to scare me. because it was going faster and faster and faster... i started to reach out for my camera that was just at the floor. when i looked up to see if the light didn't go away, it stoped, brighten up a little bit more, and like a shooting star, when up to the skies. after the light went away a strong and freezing wind blown where i was. it was really scary. \r\n\r\nmy father and my mother don't know about this. i didn't want to make them think i was going mad. even though i thought i was...\r\n  \r\nwhen the light went away, i was so afraid, so scared, that i got up, and went inside the house, without a word to my parents and i made myself go to sleep. \r\n\r\nbut i couldn't sleep that night at all... i was scared, that \"something\" would get me. i was feeling sick. like, having a sensation that something was watching me... so everytime that i started to sleep, a nightmare filled my mind. and it was always the same nightmare. about the light. that the light came upon me. \r\n\r\none of my friends, said that it was probably a demon, or something like that. i don't know! i really don't know!!\r\n\r\ni hope you guys can believe me... you must hear these thing everyday, everytime and everywhere. but, you are the only ones that can make me believe that i was not at all crazy. \r\n\r\nto speak the truth, if i had the power. i would go back on that night and make sure i was inside the house with my parents. not staring the skies. so i wouldn't have seen that light.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16135,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-15.7945996,"location":null,"logNumber":"BR-03202009-0015","longitude":-48.7761314,"occurred":1230192000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Goiás","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1230192000000,"summary":"A

left and commented that he saw the big dipper.  we were discussing how he changed subjects in the middle of a sentence.  i looked up and saw what i thought was a gaggle of geese coming towards us.  i called my wife's attention and pointed. she thought they were geese also.  the ufo was flying very fast and straight heading in a northeast direction.  it just flew straight. no up, down or side to side.  much faster than jets that we have viewed before.  it basically flew above our heads and vanished.  it all happened very quickly.  the best i can recall is that it was a v formation of about 7-10 pale orange or yellow triangular shaped lights.  if they were seperate \"aircrafts\" they were flying in perfect formation.  absolutely no noise or sonic boom.  we discussed the possiblity of a stealth fighter or flying wing, but this thing was faster than any aircraft i have witnessed.  it didn't appear to be that high up in the sky, but that is difficult for me to judge.   absolutely no alcohol or drugs involved.  i did not feel threatened or anything.  it just kind of freaked us out and i feel i have to contact someone who wouldn't be as skeptical about a ufo sighting like i think the local police or sherriff would be.

organization a couple of weeks ago from january so i've been looking to the skies alot more lately. anyway, i pulled into the driveway and saw the object in a ne position about 2 miles or less away, i am not quite sure the exact altitude. i noticed it was blinking and the colors were changing, so i ran inside and got my phone to take a pic. you can't see it on the phone, but i got my binoculars out to have a better look. the object was clearly changing colors and rapidly changing shape. i was so scared but i had somewhere to go and i brought mt binoculars with me. as i drove south on us-25 toward lisle rd. (where my first sighting took place) i notice that i was coming closer to it. as i turned down lisle rd. you can see a pretty big open field to the left and just above the field hovering over the trailer park was the ufo! about 1,000-1,500 ft. up about this time. i pulled over and got my binoculars out again and it exibited the same properties as before, just hovering stationary not moving. i had to rush to meet my cousin for the money she owed me. she lives just across the street in the adjacent trailer park. when i got to her house the treeline shielded the ufo from my sight and i couldn't see it. i ran in and ran out as quickly as i could try and track this ufo's flight pattern. i would've chased it all night! when i got back to the intersection of us-25 and lisle rd. i looked to my right at the field where i had seen it before and it was gone! i am not crazy, i do obsess about this, i don't drink or use drugs and i am not on any psych meds. this thing was there and just as quickly, gone. something is going on in this area and i want to know what. these things are disguising themselves as stars so that we don't pay anyattention to them. you cannot drive closer to a star and around it when you make left turns just less than 2 miles away from the initial point of sight. stars don't change shape and color before your eyes stuff like that takes tens of thousands or millions of years to do.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":16128,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0500237,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03202009-0008","longitude":-84.4945264,"occurred":1237482480000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1237482480000,"summary":"Orange orb, changes colors from red to green to white to orange. stationary, hovering, blinking.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Lexington, Kentucky","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:247915"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"San Antonio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Saturday 3/8/2008 around 7pm. cool dry air and dusk with plenty of light.I was walking to my truck and saw a black triangle in the air. at first i thought it was this really cool looking kite or maybe a ballon. it slowly flew over my neighbors house then over my street. it was traveling slowly and was about the size of a small car. it was solid black but the bottom of this craft was iridescence golden black. it moved slowly about 15 - 20 mph and in a straight line with no sound. its altitude was approx. 100 ft and it never varied. its wings were drifting from left to right. i ran inside and grabbed my son. he saw it as it flew over the back yard. i got into my truck and tried to follow it but i did not see it when i pulled onto the main street . there have been multiple sitings in stevensville, corpus christi and san antonio since january 08. i found some pictures online of extactly what i saw. the drawing is mine but the pictures are from \r\n\r\nhttp://www.Ufocasebook.Com/2009/sc031609.Html","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":16127,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.4306219,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03202009-0007","longitude":-98.4851582,"occurred":1205031600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1205031600000,"summary":"A black slow moving craft flew above my house.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16127_submitter_file1__TriangleUFO.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16127_submitter_file2__tri2.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16127_submitter_file3__tri1.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16127_submitter_file4__Case16127drawing.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16127_submitter_file5__Case16127.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"San Antonio, Texas","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:247916"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2261}
