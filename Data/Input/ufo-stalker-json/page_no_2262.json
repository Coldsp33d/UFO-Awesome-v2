(air france) the aircraft was an airbus a320 and was travelling at an approximate altitude of 35,000 feet. between 17:00 hours and 17:30 hours i was looking out of the window on the left side. i noticed in the distance above the cloud cover and slightly higher than the flight a large oblong shape in the distance. it had a greyish coppery colour. i watched the object for some time thinking to my self 'could this be my first ufo sighting?' the object was sitting still in the sky. it looked solid. not clouds or anything explainable. as i was watching it i noticed to the right coming through the cloud base a small dark shape that looked like a fighter jet travelling in the opposite direction from my flight. it was small but i could just about make out the shape of the tail and nose. behind the jet was it's slipstream, dark in colour. i watched the jet fly up over the cloud cover heading towards the object i was watching. the jet then turned right and then ascended getting closer to the object. then i saw the jet do a zig zag motion towards the object. (i'd estimate the object as being at least 20 times bigger than the jet.) i could tell the zig zag motion by watching it's slip stream. as it got closer i noticed the object (ufo) get small very quickly then it disappeared moving away from my flight and the jet. \r\n\r\nabout 15 minutes later i saw the fighter jet descend back down through the clouds. obviously going back to base. \r\n\r\ni'm not sure exactly what country we were flying over at the time but i think it was southern france \r\n\r\ni am sure this was a ufo. i can't explain what else it would be. and i don't think a fighter jet would be chasing nothing. if there were any other passengers onboard who saw this too i don't know. \r\n\r\nbut i am confident in saying this was my first ufo sighting. and i hope to see more....... \r\n\r\na bit unfortunate i didn't have my camera with me!!","distance":"501 Feet -

it wasn't shaped like a helicopter. also, it seemed to be too low for a helicopter since the freeway was a bit further off to the right (east) than the location of this object. then i thought it might be a really big remote-control toy. as i paid closer attention, i noticed that the object was actually flat-shaped. more like an upside-down shiny metal plate. and it was really shiny. the sun was glaring off of it. as i watched, it curved further to the left, towards me, over the neighborhood, and then it started to go away from my location, heading north/northwest. before i could determine anything, it had shot away and was not even discernible in the sky. it went from flying away to being far away in just a few seconds. \r\n\r\nit was hard to keep track of it, as i was also trying to

the sky. the airplane looked nothing like what i had seen, other than it also had some red on it. and it was flying in the sky. other than that, it was very different from the object i had seen only moments before. i still don't know quite what to make of it! it wasn't until a few seconds after it had disappeared that i felt any real reaction to what i'd seen. my mind kept trying to make sense of

listening to the radio and watching the skies as i often do. the sky was crystal clear with no clouds, fog, or haziness in the sky...Absolutely beautiful blue sky! i frequently watch airline jets fly overhead, as my home seemingly is along incoming flight-paths to bush intercontinental airport (i have always been a sky-watcher for as long as i remember). i went inside the house to get myself a glass of water and looked at the clock and saw the time was 5:58pm (the radio show that i listen to ends at 7pm, and i wanted to know how much longer until the end of the program). i walked back outside facing east and looked up to the sky at the moon, which was almost directly overhead. the sun was low in the sky behind me, but the sky was still blue with no stars visible yet. as i looked at the moon i spotted an object straight up directly over me. it was a chrome dot that was intermittently flashing red. my very first instinct was that it was a chrome mylar helium balloon like you get with a floral arrangement, spinning in the air above me (with one side chrome silver and the other side red). but i quickly realized that it was not a balloon because it was hovering completely stationary. logically thinking that if the wind was causing a balloon to spin, then it would also be blowing it in motion and it would be moving. it was not moving at all...It was hovering completely still (other than possibly spinning)! i called my girlfriend over to show it to her, but she did not see it. it apparently was very high up in altitude so she couldn't get an eye on it, but i could not speculate as to how high it was. then, as i was continuing to watch it, without taking my eyes off of it, it simply vanished before my eyes! it did not speed off, flicker or fade away, it just disappeared! this was not a jet aircraft, helicopter, bird, or a star! this was a solid metallic object that was clearly above my house motionless in the sky, that suddenly vanished! this sighting lasted approximately 2 minutes.\r\ni am still at a loss for exactly what it was that i saw, but i realized that it is very similar to video sightings from mexico that i have seen on a television

just decided to end a cell ph. call as my airconditioner unit and neighbors unit had just clicked on within seconds of one another and my cell ph. was picking up the noise from these 2 a/c units making it hard to hear the person on the phone.  i sat back in my chair in the backyard and looked up in the sky when i noticed what i thought was a large commercial airliner (747 size) approaching from the west and heading east along lake ponchartrain shore towards slidell.  \r\n\r\nmy first glance was very quick and then it hit me to look up again at it.  the ufo had the body of a plane but it didn't have any wings, engines, undercarriage lights or upper tailwing.  basically, it was a large (say 747 size) white metallic shaped cigar flying around 6,000 feet almost directly over my head.  i cleared my eyes at least 2 times as it flew above me and i knew that it had no wings, engines, lights, etc. there was also a slight fuzziness around the body of the craft but it in no way hindered the fact that i could see what the craft missed compared to a normal commercial plane. the ufo was completely out of my view within 6 to 7 seconds (it flew about the speed of an airplane across my view).  i followed this object out toward a pond that is about 16 feet away from my backyard fence to see if i could hear an engine noise but i couldn't as i could still here my a/c unit and neighbors a/c units running. at the point when it was leaving my view i called a family member who lives across town, more northeast, but this person was a bit too far away from where this craft was heading more to the southeast following the edge of the lake to slidell.\r\n\r\nadditional notes:  i would like to state that i live directly in the northern flight path for commerical airliners landing at armstrong international airport in new orleans (i'm about 30 miles away on the other side of the lake from armstrong) and i see and hear these commercial planes all day long.  i am used to seeing the usual 737 and 747 plane forms that fly over my home at the 3,000 to 4,000 foot range and i can clearly see the wings, lights and engines on these crafts at this level and what i saw in june 2007 was not a plane.  additionally, just 2 to maybe 6 weeks before this incident there was a news report that armstrong's commercial flights had reached a level of 75% post hurricane katrina to what was received prior to katrina.  the ufo wasn't flying in the normal north to southwest direction that other commercial craft were so it wasn't in a waiting pattern flying around as the airport wasn't back to full capacity.  additionally, planes flying in to land in gulfport to the east wouldn't have been flying at this low of a level in this area and most of the planes that fly out of gulfport's airport (70 miles to my east) are only of the size of a 60 seater plane generally and this craft was larger than that.  these were my initial observations that occurred as i watched this craft and thought just after it left my view.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

a row,so i was enjoying the patio and the view of the mountains. i took my camera and started shooting. later, i examined them. and i found the object that looks like a ufo with silvery metallic body that i include here. it was far away a and i did not see it while i was taking the picture. i am in the habit of not observing the sky, i examine the pictures.\r\n\r\ni discarded all other photos, around 16-20 of them.... \r\n\r\nwhat i did was zoom in with microsoft office picture manager and grab a screen capture when it was zoomed in with faststone capture. i keep for my records the big 10

the actual object was far away over the  mountains, far beyond  rocky peak, i would say. it is not normal to see green helicopters flying by, though i can identify others that may be private, commercial or police flying by over us sometimes. i also so the same helicopter in the afternoon of march 17, and i took some pictures again. there were two objects in these but i could not say they are ufos since they are blurry since by this time i had seen the morning pictures and was a little nervous about it. \r\n\r\nthe zooms are  200x and 400x

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"While looking outside of my window at work i noticed a grayish, shaded object move across my sight line in the sky. there were some clouds out, but for the most part the sun was out and it was relatively clear. i work within a couple of miles of o'hare airport, so i see airplanes flying in all of the time. that day was no exception. so when i saw this object i kept waiting to see an airplane break out from the clouds and appear, but it never did. the object never changed shape, color, or speed. there were no lights. in fact, from beginning to end the sighting probably lasted 3 seconds, but by 2.5 seconds i realized that this was something i might want to pay attention to.  i jumped up to get a better look because it was leaving my line of sight. by the time i made it to my feet and looked out of the window the thing was completely gone. it's likely that it just continued to fly the same vector and flew out of range of my sight line, but i was still surprised that i couldn't find it in the sky. my view out of the window still gave me pretty good view of the daytime sky. \r\n\r\nthere were construction workers outside and some employees are out there all of the time, but i don't think anyone saw it. i wanted someone else to see it, but there was no commotion and i'm not the type to start any.\r\n\r\ni have to be clear. this thing never changed shape or was distored by the clouds. i expected it to change shape as it flew through the clouds. this had me believe that the damn thing was flying underneath the cloud line...And that freaked me out but i didn't realize that until the thing had just about disappeared. this thing was grayish in color but it didn't appear completely solid. that's why i though it might have been a particularly low flying plane. i was indoors so i don't know if it was making any kind of noise. also, and in retrospect, this thing appeared to be 3 separate pieces (a sketch is attached). they were moving in unison which is why i was sure it was a low flying plane of some sort.  but the sketch that i drew of exactly what i saw represents 3 independent objects. my brain wants to believe that it was one object.  nonetheless, the sketch represents two long cigar-shaped bars and one shorter cigar shaped bar in the middle.  the fact that my mind couldn't process what i was seeing blows me away because i was waiting for this \"plane\" to appear through the clouds and it never did.  i don't know if i'm ready to say that this was an \"alien\" spacecraft with green people and stuff, but i didn't know what the hell it was, and i felt compelled to tell my wife (who promptly called me nuts and told me to get back to work). i didn't tell anyone else because i do not want people thinking i'm a nut case or ufo watcher. seriously. i'm not a conspiracy theorist, but i am curious.\r\n\r\ni can't resolve what i saw. one of the first things i thought was was the movie predator where the alien creature went into stealth mode. you could tell that something was there, but you really had to focus...And then you could only really make out an outline. that's sort of how this object appeared, minus the shiny mirror type effect. the edges or outline of this object were much smoother.  i can't say it enough: i was sure that it was a plan ready for landing, but the damn thing never broke from the clouds...It was below the clouds. i thought it was a plane that looked funny because it was flying through the cloud line. it never changed shape or color, like an object would appear to be if it moved through the clouds. i don't even know if that makes sense. i just hope someone can understand what i'm trying to explain. the object stayed exactly the same as it moved across my line of sight. it appeared to move no faster or slower than a plane...But i see planes all the time and this thing was like no other plane i had seen before or sense. \r\n\r\nplease see my sketch. that's the best i can explain it. the sketch shows exactly what i saw move across the sky, only not as solid as the sketch appears to be. it was sort of transparent...Like some sort of stealth.  i think my mind wanted to \"fill in\" the rest of the image. that's why the sketch appears to be cigar shaped.  this was not a triangle.
