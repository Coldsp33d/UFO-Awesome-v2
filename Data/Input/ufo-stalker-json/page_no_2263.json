however it didn't beat the triangle \"mothership\" we all saw last november 12th, and i don't think anything else could! that was reported the same day on ufo northwest, if you are interested. \r\nanyway, i took a few \"real-time\" photos of the craft, but didn't want to \"waste\" the pictures and knew the only way to be sure to \"get proof\" was to take timed shots, so - as a result - most of the almost 60 photos i shot were 8 second exposures at a f 2.5 setting with an exposure value at +2.00 (the highest my camera goes) and certainly showing the true colors of the crafts lights and its flight pattern/path. i used a high-pixel, sony cybershot digital camera and did not alter the originals at all! i have kept their integrity to help you to prove or disprove whatever it was that caused more than ten helicopters to be in the air after it disappeared, and caused them to refuel and return to the search for the next 2 hours or so. the light appeared to be of whitish/yellow color with a bit of red from time to time, and what got my attention was that the lights and colors did not match the faa regulations with regards to red on the left and green on the right and white lights that blink 40x per minute. this thing pulsed and then stayed lit. then it blinked white lights fast and then went back to pulsing again only to follow it with another blast of bright, solid light for another thirty to sixty seconds. from where i was, it looked like a saucer, then looked like 2 doing maneuvers together. then it looked like two orbs that were connected somehow, then \"shape-shifting\" into something else... more square-round. \r\ni would also like to mention that based on the photos i have taken, i have reason to believe their may have been more than one craft in the sky last night, too. several shots seem to show what could be mistaken for stars, but upon closer inspection, can be seen to have the same color coding/ shading as the inital craft and in two of my photos, it looks as if their are 2 saucers of another shape that might even be a couple of boomerangs, but on a timed photo, it is hard to tell. you are the experts and i do hope that my final disclosure to you will help figure out what is happening on our planet!\r\nwell, this was absolutely incredible, but did not come close to others i and my family have had and would like to talk with an investigator about.\r\nlast night, there were a total of 7 of us and an 8th joined in at the last minute, that witnessed this sighting and the after-effects. only three of us saw it for the first 20 minutes or so, because i was getting pictures while the boys watched and tried to get neighbors out to see it, too. \r\nwhat else is interesting is that on march 11th, 2009, there was little to no usual traffic going into or out of long beach airport and around 8:18pm, seven military and police/civilian helicopters flew over our house, seeming to be looking for something on the ground. they flew rather slowly, from west to east and then took a more southerly direction when above seal beach, moving towards the huntington beach area. \r\nscary thing? i took photos of them, too as soon as i heard them coming and watched them go... and the first shot set off the flash which seemingly caused one of the helicopters to turn on and shine a searchlight on us! i had the kids shut off the lights in and outside of the house, got to my computer and downloaded them as soon as i could - just in case i got something i wasn't supposed to have!\r\ni would most certainly like to speak with an investigator, especially since i've had multiple sightings (as has my eldest son) over the last many years and would like to finally share some of them with anyone willing to listen. i am beginning to fear whatever the heck is going on... and there is something going on. especially here in long beach, california.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":16094,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.8075867,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03182009-0014","longitude":-118.1539056,"occurred":1237341540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,  Circle,  Cylinder,  Disc,  Saturn-like,  Sphere,  Square,  Rectagular,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1237341540000,"summary":"Long beach ca ufo hotspot.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16094_submitter_file1__Mar172009045.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16094_submitter_file2__Mar172009004.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/16094_submitter_file3__Mar172009027.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Long Beach, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:250126"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop, Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Atlanta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I looked out of my front window about 9:30 pm i saw a bright light come toward me tree level. i thought it was a helicopter, it was not. it was very bright then turned to the right at roof top level. it was a silver and white with a red bottom. later i looked out my back thinking the should be coming there later. there it was, it shot up and turned into a bright blue light twice and vanished.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":16093,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.7564654,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03182009-0013","longitude":-84.3825624,"occurred":1237350600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1237350600000,"summary":"I saw one bright light come to me, then swittched to the left fast revolving white and silver, then behind out house later i saw two.

(my elevation is 3200ft. and i would guess the objects to be at about 6-7000ft). the plane followed at between 100 to 300 yards mostly directly behind and sometimes slightly to the right as they were passing me from left to right pretty much right above me. the f-18 had two white strobes, one on each wingtip, otherwise no illumination. the \"thing\" it was following was some thing different all together. it was triangular in shape yet somewhat blurry. i could not see clean edges. it was about twice the size of the chase plane. the whole underside was illuminated by a cream colored warm light. there was one bright light at each corner that also acted as a strobe light but only visible from below. there was one red strobe in the center of the craft. airspeed was that of a single engine prop plane which is the only type to fly this low around here. any type of jet traffic is usually in the 30 000ft range except for the occasional fighter from beale afb and they only fly during the day. as they flew right above me the diesel sound(a pulsed rumble) was the loudest, the dogs still barking like mad. i could clearly see the outline of the chase plane against the starlit sky but the outline of the triangle remained blurred. as they past i could finally hear the sound of the jet engines from the f-18 even though at very low throttle. i wondered what the stall speed of an f-18 is because they were flying so slow, but i never heard the engine pitch change as long as i could see them. the sound from the lead object also never changed but was still audible long after they were out of sight. the dogs went quiet as soon as i could no longer hear them, which surprised me a bit since dogs generally hear much better then us. but from start to the end they seemed to hear what and when i heard it. the only other time that i have unusual things in the night sky is with my gen.Ii night vision goggles but that is a different story all together. one last thing. with out checking by compass, i estimate that they were flying south maybe south/west.\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with

sighting a few days ago. my wife convinced me that i must. sure enough, last night at approx. 8:30 pm, march 17th 2009, i stood up in the back yard of the house we were visiting and faced east. from my chair a few minutes earlier, i had noticed the star sirius blazing away in the dark night sky. left of sirius there was an aircraft flying very low with abnormally consistant bright red lights on what looked to be the tail end and front end of the vehicle. one strobe flashed in the center. i dismissed that particular set of lights because for some reason the planes in thei are don't have to conform to any fcc rules as their lights are \"just whatever color\" and placed without regulation on \"just wherever\" on the plane. that's another story...So, after viewing this aircraft and sirius for a short time, i noticed that the craft did move east over the mountains and was approx. at 6000ft alt. when it disappeared from view. a moment later, i stood up and stretched and glanced over to sirius again. i saw three very bright but distant lights light up in horizontal form relative to one another. the lights was whitish-orange and had a large \"body\" to them. i would go so far as to say they were spherical orbs emiting copious amoutns of light. the three lights lit up one at a time and i don't remember the order. the middle light seemed to be on first. after only a few seconds, the right light faded out, then the left, then the middle. my best guess on altitude would be 10,000ft. i would also guess they were attached to a single object because of the uniform distance from each other and perfect alignment. the total duration from my perspective was approx. 10 seconds. i watched the sky for over an hour afterwards and did not see them return.","distance":"Over One

i saw a golden orange light east of breckenridge, tx at about 8:00: p.M.  i saw it long enough to realize it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  the light was moving north and over hwy 180 (maybe a mile from my location).  the light was lower than the path taken by planes landing and taking off at the local air field and much larger than the average landing light on a fixed wing aircraft.  my farm (and residence) is nne of the local airport, by less than 2 miles.  \r\nthe light appeared to cross hwy 180 on a south to north heading, and then disappeared.\r\ni then left town heading south on hwy 183.   i was about 8-10 miles ne of cisco when i again saw what appeared to be the same golden orange light, only this time it was to my wsw and it was pacing my car. there was no discernible shape, just the bright light.  as i neared cisco the light winked out and was gone.  it paced my car for at least 6 miles.  the light was 500 to 800 feet agl and approx. 1/4 mile from my car.  i came to this conclusion by observing the lights of town in comparison of the moving light.  \r\n\r\n\r\nthen tonight, march 17, 2009, at 8:15 p.M., i had again left breckenridge on 183, headed to cisco.  i had just topped 5 mile hill.  to my south was a bright light, which i first assumed was the star sirius.  it was still dusk and i thought that it was odd how bright sirius appeared to be, when it was still fairly light outside, plus the light seemed to pulse 3 or 4 times, then flash brightly, in that order, continuously.   suddenly the star began to ascend and become brighter and appeared to be moving somewhat east but i figured that due to the bends in the road, maybe it just appeared to be to moving east.\r\ni traveled south and as i reached the rest stop between breckenridge and cisco, i again saw the light and it was definitely due east now and approx. 1000 feet agl.  i knew then that it wasn't a star, it was that odd golden orange color.  the light had also taken on an elongated shape and if i held a large grain of rice between thumb and finger at arms length, that would almost cover the object.\r\nas i kept glancing at this golden object, another object appeared slightly behind and above the first object, both the same size, so that it looked like 2 large glowing grains of rice, side by side. i passed a pickup on the side of the road and the driver seemed to be looking at the lights. i started reaching for my camera and began slowing down to stop and take a photo but as soon as tapped the brakes and released the cruise control, the object(s) rapidly dimmed and disappeared.  when the lights disappeared, they were approximately 40 degrees north and east of the cutoff to eastland (hwy 112).  total viewing time for second sighting was about just about 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n1. i was driving when i saw the light(s).\r\n2. the light was directly in front of me, i couldn't miss it.\r\n3. i first thought it was a star.\r\n4. it was a bright, golden orange colored light that was moving towards me then off to my left.  i could not determine speed but i would say it was close to cruising speed of a small single engine prop airplane.  then 1 became 2.\r\n5. had no specific emotions at the time of sighting.\r\n6. object(s) dimmed to nothing, disappeared.\r\n\r\ni am enclosing a digital art depiction of how the lights of the second sighting

the belmar area of lakewood.  a second or two after making the turn, i noticed this white \"line\" (could have been cylinder, cigar, disc or almost any shape) moving fairly quickly from left to right (west to east) well ahead of me - i estimate at least a few miles, maybe several miles (could have been over wheat ridge or arvada...).  as it got further east, the white color dimmed to a gray color, probably from going underneath the shade of a cloud (just a good guess).  it was difficult to keep a really good eye on it as i was in rather heavy traffic, which was slowing down as i approached alameda ave., so i had to also keep a good eye on the traffic.  i lost sight of it as it went out of view (an office building on the ne corner of wadsworth & alameda blocked my view).  once the traffic had moved forward enough, past alameda ave, i looked for it again, but could not see it, and had to continue to be careful driving.  it might have still been there, but harder to see perhaps because it closely matched the color of background clouds?  it also would have been getting farther away (farther to the east).  i did not have a camera with me, and even if i had had one, i wouldn't have had time to turn it on, aim it and snap pictures while driving in heavy traffic - would have been very unsafe, also.  however, i went back to that stretch of wadsworth blvd and took 4 pictures, approximating what my views were as i was driving this morning. i then used software to draw in what it looked like to me.  i will upload the pictures in the sequence of the viewing; you will be able to see it as a white, angled line, west of wadsworth and roughly above a bank building on the left side of the street, past alameda ave.  the 3rd and 4th pictures show how it dimmed to gray as it moved farther east.  i was on the phone with a friend this afternoon and told him about it.  he asked me if it could have been an airplane banking in a turn.  no, it could not have been that; if it had been that, it would have not appeared to move relative to my position, as it would more or less be flying away or toward me, not moving to my right (east), and it maintained this \"tilt\" throughout is movement eastward.  if it was an airplane, then this would mean that the nose of the plane was inclined about 45 degrees, the nose pointing up and the tail pointing down.  when a plane is landing at an airport, the nose is slightly raised so that the rear landing gear touch down, then the nose lowers and the forward gear touch down.  this was a much greater angle.  if it was a plane, then something must have been very wrong and the passengers would have been very uncomfortable, to say the least.  so, no, i don't believe it was an airplane.  if it wasn't an airplane, what was it???  my mufon id is 10646.  i have been a member since 2005.  i could only upload 3 pictures.  i have the 4th if anyone is interested.  keep in mind these are illustrations, not actual photos of the object, but i am pleased with the result.  this is what i saw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

if the object was moving very slowly upwards as it stayed within our perspective; it did not appear to radiate any color other than a very bright white light. at first, i assumed the object may be a

made a good attempt to see if the object was still visible in some way, but nothing was visible in any way that i could identify. the sun was rising from behind the mountains and this made for a reasonably well-lit viewing, but the object did not appear to be reflecting light - it appeared to be emanating it's own star-like light of exceptional intensity. airplanes do approach south orange county from the saddleback area, but their movements are frequent and familiar and can usually be tracked with the eye - even with changing perspectives. some airplane light usually remains visible on

notice that when i report and incident here on the site, the jets will be out in droves. so when the jets come, the object will no longer fly around. i dont know where to begin.\r\n\r\ni saw a woman on utube being interview about a ufo that she had see in arkansas and she had some pictures of it. i saw the same thing from about 100yrds away  on my way to work. it was about 5:40 am. hwy 7 entering camden, ar. from the south. the object apporached fast from the west on 376. it had red and green light so i took it to be a  small single engine plane because there is a small air port near by. next it then did a 90 degree turn above the traffic light there it kinda tilted over ... really slowly....Now i could see under it... this is when i saw that it also had  a bright white light at the front and the back of the opject. the white lights was just above  a red  then a seperate green light. these lights were the identical color as the traffic signal. there was 1 bright white light at the front and the back seem to be more like a spot light, lighting up the area around it.  i took it for a a large military copter then, but it wasnt making enough sound for me to hear it. it then went directly north up the street as if it was following the traffic lights. the object was less then 10 feet frome the traffic lights. then it took off and was far in the horizon in a matter 30 seconds. a co worker also saw it.\r\n\r\nalso in feb i saw a   star-like ufo. this one was out on a very cloudy night just after dark. u could not see a star in the sky because of the cloud cover. but u  could see it very well moving slowly across the sky.   \r\n\r\nanother night in feb i was cooking in the back yard and a starlike come by.. this time i had my high power flash light handy and and shinned it on the object. at first it flickerd  a lil... scared. i shinned the light back on the object.. this time it dimmed totally out.\r\n\r\nanother night my wife calls and tell me to go out  and see if i can get a  glimps of 3 very bright lights in the sky. she is about 4 mins away from the  house and could see the light in the sky... when she got there  i told her that i could see nothing. we watch the sky for a few mins, like usual.  then we see what looks to be a plane coming with the landing lights one.  i dont pay it any attention, because im really assuming its a lane.  when it gets dirrectly over us... from under  the object.. we could see 3 triangle objects with  a red light at each corner. u couldnt see the bright light anymore, just 3 triangles in a row going across the sky.  we try to follow it to get a  good picture of it but they were moving to fast... as soon as we get back to the house about 30mins later.. we see 3 more of the same objects, but this time they were in a triangle pattern. they kinda looked like the phoenix lights going by.\r\n\r\nwe recent got hold of some binoculars. we really wanted to see what they looked like through them. so far we have only see the star like one... and they just look like balls of very bright light going across the sky. a perfectly round ball of intense white light ... that dimms when jets get near them..???","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16070,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0201401,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03172009-0010","longitude":-92.7185943,"occurred":1235548800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,

more or less, and after beating more than 100 photos with my canon powershot a620 was deleting the photos, discouraged because they were showing useless, had not even caught any radius. when i was almost giving up and deleting a photo everything seemed intriguing. three risks appeared in the photo, not delete and go running pro pc to see this picture better. \r\nthe original photo is with resolution of 3024 x 2304. at the same time there ran out and was looking at the sky and the surrounding area looking for something that you can explain these effects in the photo, but nothing! \r\nafter review, analyze and examine an explanation and can not now send the picture to several people to give them your opinion and nobody is in danger. \r\nyesterday watching the discovery saw the work of you and would like an opinion about this photo. \r\nat the time it hit the photos did not see anything different or heard anything unusual, only the rumble of distant lightning. \r\n

september.  it was between 8-8:30 pm (i remember this because i was in cub scouts at the time and the meetings ended around 8 on monday nights, and i remember school had just started back recently so it was either august or september).  i was riding home with my mother (she wants to remain anonymous and doesn't remember much she did give me permission to use her name but she doesn't want to be contacted) from my cub scout meeting we were less than a mile from our house when we rounded a curve when we saw it (i don't remember who spotted it first).  the object was shapped like a upside u with two large spotlights (it was these that drew our attention) on the bottom it also had numerous smaller red and green lights (like naviagation lights on aircraft), it was colored black or another dark color, it had no visible cockpit or propulsion system, and it was completely silent.  it was hovering less than 50 feet (if i had a baseball i could've hit it) above a field (this field is about 5 feet from the road on the right side so the object was almost directly overhead) that was about 10 - 15 yards long and it seemed to be about as wide as the field below it, i'd estimate the height of the object to be 10 - 15 feet.  it hovered there for about 2-2.5 minutes completely silent it then took off slowly at first but is started accelerating at a steady pace towards coats nc which is about a 2-3 miles west.  as it started to accelerate it started make an electrical humming that got louder as it sped up.  it took less than a minute for it to leave our sight.  during the time we saw it i wasn't afraid and i don't think my mother was either (she stopped the car in the middle of the road to look at it and she wouldn't have done that if she was frightened or concerned for our safety), i was curious about the object and so was my mother judging by her actions.  i remember looking for a camera and asking my mother if she had one with her, she said no.  i also asked if she knew what it was because i didn't, again she said no.  i didn't feel in danger at anytime during the sighting and now that i look back on it i get the impression it was surveying the area (don't ask how i get this impression because i don't know i just do).  after the object left me and my mother agreed not to tell my father because he would think we were crazy (when i finally told him several months later he treated me like child who says there's a monster under his bed).  for a long time i thought it was an experimental military aircraft (based on the lights that looked similiar to red and green naviagation lights and the fact that i live in between several large military bases) but i've thought more about it lately and i can't understand why the military would test an advanced and obviously secret experimental aircraft so early at night in such a densely populated area near 3 major roads and 2 interstates, then there's the lack of a visible cockpit (could have been on top) and propulsion system (i was close enough to it that it would have been impossible to miss and also because i got to see the front, left side, bottom, and back of the object) its beacuse of these things that i no longer think it was an experimental military (or civilian) aircraft, i don't know what it was.  i still remember the object like i saw it 30 seconds ago and i could draw a very good sketch of it (i would've done it for this but i don't know how to transfer sketches to my pc).  as an interesting sidenote after i saw this object i started taking an interest in ufos (i already an interest in military aircraft) and i began to read books on the subject of ufos and sightings of them to try and find out what it was (when i come across something i don't know i try to find out more about it).  i still don't know what it was but i know it'll stick with me for a long time.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

light up i noticed in the sky a bright object. at first i thought it was a star but after closer examination i noticed that it was far too bright and that it was blinking rapidly in array of different colors (blue, red, yellow, green). it almost looked as if the object was moving side to side slightly, but i wasn't sure. there was another witness who was at first skeptical claiming that it was a helicopter, however even he was in awe of the sight. after a few moments it seemed to dim, almost disappearing all together. then it became bright again. the sighting lasted for thirty minutes until it seemed to fade out all together. throughout the whole time of watching the object i felt as if it was communicating somehow, or even surveying the area. i did have a camera with me at the time, but i wasn't able to get the object because it was so far away. that and the fact i couldn't turn the flash off the camera. i haven't uploaded the photo's to my computer but would be willing to hand over what photo's i do have. i had a very eerie feeling during and after the object faded away. the weirdest part, aside from the ufo sighting, was the military aircraft that has been flying around our parts in the past few weeks. earlier in the day i had seen a military helicopter flying low over the town of port neches. what i saw tonight was no star and nor was it a helicopter. there has been rumors of a secret military base in the area. this was not the first strange thing i have seen in this area, however this is the strangest of them
