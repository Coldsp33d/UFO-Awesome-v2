 well i've told it to you.  i am interested to know what they are upto.  i've written a blog on the ufo files and someone said they might be looking for certain minerals in my area.  which kinda makes sense since they were looking at the ground. makes me a bit uncomfortable! if i had a good camera i could probably see right into the craft!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16061,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.0048102,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03172009-0001","longitude":-92.8026673,"occurred":1237001400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1237001400000,"summary":"I have seen two triangle shaped crafts on many occasions in the last 2 months they hover near the ground and not far off the road they seem to be in the same place at the same time of day repeatedly.","tags":["triangle"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Perryville, Arkansas","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:250895"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Cincinnati","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"On sunday 3-15-09 @ approx. 10pm i went outside to look at the night sky with my binoculars since the sky was perfectly clear. after about 2 minutes i saw a small private jet flying at about 1500ft at 45 deg due south of my viewing point that was heading north on a path that would take it directly over my head. i wanted to get a better view so i used my binoculars to look more closely at the aircraft, when i did, i notice a faint blue/grey light that was slightly behind the aircraft but at a seemingly much higher altitude that i estimated was about the same height that i usually observe satellites at. by faint i mean that this light was not visible with the naked eye and was not a sharp pinpoint of light like most satellites but about twice the size and hazey. the other odd thing was that it moved about 2 to 3x faster than any satellite i've seen and i say it followed the jet only in the sense that it's pace seemingly matched that of the jet, never gaining or losing distance relative to the aircraft. this sighting lasted only about a minute before both objects were out of view. i observed 3 satellites in the next 5 minutes after this sighting and they were exactly what i am use to seeing and very much different from the blue/grey light.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":16060,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.1121982,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03162009-0017","longitude":-84.5107096,"occurred":1237100400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1237100400000,"summary":"Faint high altitude blue/grey light following small jet.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cincinnati, Ohio","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:250896"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Bogota","country":"Colombia","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Pease vssit http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=lbwktjmxd5u and tell me if this video is real or not , and please notify at my adrees","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":16059,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":4.6074756,"location":null,"logNumber":"PR-03162009-0016","longitude":-74.0729433,"occurred":1190876400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Bogota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,  Square,  Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1190876400000,"summary":"Ovni.

condition called 48xx/yy syndrome, a rare condition that causes physical problems as well as many emotional and behavioral problems. he has a cognitive i.Q. of 79, which is high for his condition. basically, he is very verbal and insightful and can distinguish reality from fantasy.\r\n  my son, who i'll call james, was about 12 years old when he had a close encounter. we live in a rural area of upper michigan about 9 miles from escanaba on 40 acres of land. one night my wife and i decided to go to bed at around 10:00 and asked james if he wanted to go to bed. he asked if he could stay up to watch a t.V. program that he wanted to watch. my wife and i agreed and went to bed and fell fast asleep.\r\n  upon waking the next day we were shocked at a story that james told to us about what happened the night before. james said that he went to the kitchen to make a peanut butter sandwich when he noticed, through our large twin picture windows at the southern side of our kitchen,an unusual light hovering above the tree line, which is about 150 yards to the back of the kitchen, seperated by a field. i quickly pointed out that it was just an airplane, being that airplanes normaly took a direct route over the edge of our land enroute to the delta county airport. to our surprise, he became agitated by my presumption and insisted that it was not an airplane!\r\n  i told him to calm down and explain what he saw. he said that the light was not moving like an airplane and was perfectly still in the air about 50 to 100 feet above the tree line. he said that it then floated towards the house over the field about 50 feet off the ground (as high as the pine tree at the right of our back yard, for height referance) and stopped between the apple tree and the garage,that is 40 feet from our house, and hovered motionless without a sound, but he felt a vibrating hum in the house.\r\n  when i grilled him about such a fantastic story, he said that the craft was about 15 feet across and 25 feet high and shaped like an ice cream cone and glowing a purplish color with lights that surrounded the middle of the object. he said that the object floated in slow-motion to the left (east) until it stopped above our pumphouse where we get our fresh water.It hovered there for a minute or so and then slowly moved out over the field and suddenly shot up into the air \"faster than a jet\" and disappeared up into the sky. \r\n  my wife and i didn't know what to make of the story, being that james had never created such a fantastic story before and he was adament that he was telling the truth. since that time i have grilled him periodically on this episode and have even suggested that he was watching a u.F.O. program that inspired the story, but every time i do so he gets upset and repeats the exact same story in detail that he told to us that morning! \r\n  i believe him and i wonder how many sightings there have been that have been shrugged-off simply because the observer was developementally or phychologically impaired, even though a similar story may have been accepted by a \"normal\" observer? thank you, dan.   \r\n    ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

for the airport)and we think that's why it started moving east. it was under the cloud cover as we watched it perfectly move into a cloud and lost it. it was not out in space at all. it was sitiing there in our face that we saw. so wierd. we see this stuff all the time. i have reported several of these sightings.","distance":"Over One

pasadena, los angeles, california. we were standing, joking around. must've been 7:30 - 7:45 and a medium-bright, white-light caught my eye traveling at medium-fast speed. with no sound. not blinking. traveling straight. i could assume that it was no more than 3mi. north of us traveling east, apparently flying directly over the city of pasadena. there were no other air craft seen or heard during this sighting. as soon as i realized that there was no sound and that it still wasn't blinking i said to my buddies: \"help me witness this\" to get them to turn and look. i got their attention... they confirmed that there was no sound and that there were no blinking lights, only one light consistently illuminated. there were some clumping clouds... and we saw it for 30-45 seconds as it moved in the space where the clouds had cleared; only a couple hundred feet above these clouds. then saw it slightly again through a smaller break in the clouds. then it disappeared into the clouds. a minute later, we saw a jet air plane at almost the same height fly directly above us with normal lights and normal sounds. by this, we were able to gauge that we weren't def, blind and crazy...\r\n...Then for some reason we did... we went crazy for 3min. we laughed hysterically, \"flipped out\", rallied...Repeated the saying: \"i cant f***in' believe that!\" and \"oh my f***in' god!. \r\n\r\ni seriously could not believe that my first sighting was almost trivial. \r\n\r\ni went inside to bring my dad a plate and quickly tell him what happened... and (without warning) when i came back out my friends were all packed up ready to leave like they had something to do. i guess they were a little too \"freaked out\" . \r\n\r\ni've been a believer for over 10 years and i listen to coast to coast from time to time, but never had a direct experience. this is my first sighting, and im so glad a had some close buddies share it with instead of being alone when this happened. i've done enough research to know that this was very low profile sighting. but i dont care, i know that every little bit helps. this sighting has turned me from a \"believer\" to a \"knower\". however i really hope you get a corroborating report. i'd love to hear it and share it with my buds. \r\nalso if there is some explanation for this sighting please let me know.\r\n\r\nd\r\n","distance":"Over

sky and all that it harbors since i have been a child.  this is a clear night a two or three  hundred feet off of lake st. clair here in michigan, three or four miles north of the lights of the little downtown area in this community so the stars and planets are always brilliant on a clear night such as this. \r\n\r\nafter i exit my back door i look up and scan, as i always do, and my eyes are instantly attracted to a large human aircraft in the western sky traveling northeast, maybe at an altitude of several thousand feet high. there is selfridge air national guard base about 6-10 miles north/northeast of my house.  and i have observed several types of  aircraft  in both the day and night coming and going in my 7 months of living in this community of st. clair shores, michigan. \r\n\r\nthis plane had two fixed lights on its wings with the red flashing lights  in the middle. the second i saw the airplane i saw a bright light, seemingly so close to it as it appeared to me looking from below, that i took a deep breath thinking that it was another plane and if they were at close enough altitudes they were about to collide. but strangely the plane kept going in its path northeast and this light, nothing blinking like the other craft, just a light, it carried on west/northwest.\r\n\r\n then  my attention was grabbed by a similar star like light in the southern sky traveling east, also in a straight line, as the other light was traveling in its direction, just as the plane was in its.  all three objects resembled the same speed to my perception. so i am looking at both of the lights moving and the plane traveling over my head, of course one at a time, but then the light in the western sky abruptly disappeared as i was looking at it!  this was very odd because there were no clouds for the object to fly into or over, and there were no other significant celestial objects in that patch of the western edge of the northern sky for it to obscure my view of it, or for me to mistake the light for it. and if anything it should have reappeared.  \r\n\r\nmy eyes confirmed that the bright light was gone when i looked back over to the other light in the southern sky traveling east when a few seconds after i re-tracked it, it too disappeared from my sight as i am watching it. i looked back to the airplane and saw it was still traveling on its path northeast. \r\n\r\n not saying i am professionally trained or anything but once again i have been obsessive over the sky since i was a child and i have learned a great deal about my favorite sciences astronomy and cosmology and my love for aerospace has taught me how to track with my eyes where a moving object is going and were it should be in the sky after a few seconds have elapsed, if it is man made.  \r\n\r\nthe key points i am making to myself and to mufon is this:  i can't stress enough how clear of a night this is, the celestial spheres are bright and it was easy to see both the lights and the airplane and distinguish them from the stars and planets which do not move as the lights and the plane were.  i tracked the airplane till it was out of sight.  so i am sure that i should have been able to see those lights traveling in their respective paths until they should have disappeared out of sight.  and the one traveling northwest should have stayed in sight longer than the plane.  but those two lights vanished, and i could no longer see them when they should have occupied the sky for at least the same amount of time as the plane because of where they were when i first observed the three of them.  like everything regarding life, i have my theories, but i can't explain this.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

from ground.  lights seemed to be in a cloud, greenish-gaseous, not moving (cloud), blinking lights of various colors.  thought it was weird but assumed it had something to do w/telecommunications & 2008 world series coverage.  on the other hand it just stayed there and didn't seem to move.  i kept checking and it was still there a couple hours later.  obviously it could probably be easily explained - except that on the following philly home games during the world series, i didn't see anything more resembling - sky was clear on one night and on actual win it was horribly raining so didn't see anything but i kept checking back to see if same phenominon occured on other dates during the ws.  i believe the lights i saw were on/around that preceding sunday or possibly monday before the phils win.\r\n\r\nthis was from my kitchen window, i was getting something to drink between commercials on the ws televised game.  what made me first notice object was that it was a weird greenish

the light and atmosphere directly enveloping the craft. this band of distortion was ordered and not random. a distinct pattern was present in the halo. the ripples and waves of this translucent halo gave the appearance of emanating from the craft.  \r\n\r\nwhile sitting outside with my dog casually observing the clear sky and evening sunshine. i first observed the objects in the southern sky at a low declination. as i live near to a small airport with frequent light aircraft departures and approaches, aircraft are a familiar sight. \r\n\r\nhowever, within the span of a second, it was clear to me the craft did not fit any definitive criterion of known aeronautical craft.  as an engineer with extensive aviation experience and knowledge, i have a larger than normal list of criteria. without an explanation for the speed, altitude, shape, and ballistics demonstrated by the craft i was observing i became immediately riveted, curious, but calm, and methodically analytical. \r\n\r\nas the objects approached toward my observation point, more detail became clear. i could at this point clearly make out precise shape, color, and the above stated characteristics. what my eyes saw my brain had no immediate explanation for. first the shape of the object defies the laws of classical physics, and should fall from the sky at any moment. second there is dead silence, no sound of a propulsion system of any kind. third i observed that both flying objects where in a controlled wobble, that is to say they appeared to exhibit the same characteristics as light aircraft traveling at the low limits of airspeed. a gentle rocking or tipping left to right was readily apparent. \r\n\r\nof particular fascination and interest to me was the transparent halo around each craft. i am taking some liberty with the facts by saying this appeared to be a energy field. the halo or aura if you prefer was distinct and visible as a translucent pattern that distorted the atmosphere and visible light in zone that completely enveloped the both crafts. honestly, the effects of the halo where quite disturbing on my senses, and seemed almost surreal. i think these feelings are normal for anyone seeing all he has ever learned, experienced and seen about flight and the physics of flight defied. the entire experience is quite unforgettable, but i suspect it is seeing this halo that will stay in my memory forever. i have seen heat waves in the mohave and sonoran deserts reach 200 meters above the surface. never could i have imagined a force so strong as to distort the atmosphere in such a distinct manner as i observed on march 14. the distortion had a ordered pattern, it was not chaotic and random. \r\n\r\ni watched the craft travel to the north as long could observe them with the naked eye. having already calculated the approximate speed i knew any effort to retrieve a camera would have been futile. i witnessed this alone and have no one to corroborate these events. i am a professional engineer with 24 years experience. i am currently in fine health. i simply cannot explain what i saw, and i have no factual evidence of any kind to offer anyone. all can provide you with is my testimony. \r\n\r\nmy rational mind keeps seeking for a scientific explanation. but at this point, what i saw in the sky march 14 simply does not exist within my understanding of science and any aircraft i am aware of. weather balloons do not travel at 3000 ft, 120 knots against the wind, and have a patterned distortion enveloping them.

edges all around of no similar pattern estimate about 40,000 feet in altitude. this came through my window of view in the northern milky way galaxy.\r\ndirectly behind one pair split apart in tight central formation of the leader. exactly like the leader only smaller in size, if combined together they would equal about half the size of the leader. directly, behind another pair only smaller than the first pair. in tight formation and central alignment of the first pair, exactly alike all the rest in shape and color, together in mass the second pair would be equal to anyone of the first paired objects. the sixth object directly behind the pack and in central alignment of the last pair.  same as all the rest only the size was about half that of one the second paired objects. the seventh object was about half the size and the sixth same shapes and color. the background sky was a deep midnight blue and these object were all solid jet black, i saw only the bottom dimension of these craft as they came out of the north about 45 degrees at ground view.  all of these disappeared into the dome of a massive cumulous anvil cloud to the far south about on nebraksa/kansas state line.  i would estimate the cloud height to be 38,000 feet.  this sighting last less than ten seconds, not a sound, not a light and they darkened the stars out as they zipped across the sky at an super sonic frightening speed.  they were solid and hard to determine how deep they were, as they came straight overhead.\r\ni was standing on the corner of west 13th and n.Custer ave. i have one witness and he saw the last of the formation at the end when they disappeared through the clouds in the south. the previous hours before this occurred we were star gazing,counting and spotting meteors out while his sister was at a skate birthday event just inside. what i thought about when i first saw these objects caused my knees to buckel from pure fear or super startelled in awe. it was almost as if i was sunday punched without notice in pure darkness. after the event and walking the last leg home to my house from my friends, i thought about what i saw and felt powerlessness, nothing of this earth would have any chance in hell to combat what i saw, if they were hostile towards man.  i tried to tell my parents what i saw but they wouldn't listen being glued to the t.V. watching ronald reagan give his exceptance speech. i was 15 years old at the time and not a day goes by without thinking of what i saw.  i have a photographic memory of these craft and can send a picture.  view this picture on maximum so the that pixel patten would give you a better and realistic view of what i saw.  the white dots are background stars and this flew over my head and disappeared through the dome of a

cylinderal either.  hard to really explain.  it was moving southward and would move behind clouds and fading contrails.  remembering that my cell phone had a camera, i took it out of my pocket and tried to take a picture but never could zoom in close enough to get a good snap.  i watched it for 30 to 45 seconds before my attention went back to the dogs.
