the weather was warm, winds were calm and the sky was cavu. the geographical location was approximately 350 air miles north of edmonton, alberta. exact co-ordinates would of course be provided to a professional investigator, if accompanied by the assurance of confidentiality.\r\n\r\ni was helping, or perhaps hindering, my father work on his 1954 chevy pickup; he was cleaning it up in preparation for trading it off on a new car, which is one reason i remember the event so well. i was a pretty excited kid.\r\n\r\nthe hood was up on the pickup, which was parked facing east and a mere 4 or 5 paces from the front of the house; he and my mother were carrying on a conversation through the open, south facing kitchen window as she prepared lunch.\r\n\r\nin those years there were no jet aircraft, or even air services of any kind (beyond the odd rumbling beaver, otter or norseman bush plane) in that rather remote farming community. there was, however, at least one local resident who flew an aeronca champ, and another with a piper j3.\r\n\r\nlater research indicates that there were, at that time, no established long distance commercial air routes that passed over that area using either piston engine or jet aircraft. there were no military air bases for at least several hundreds of miles, and there was no subsequent air or ground search activity. under the circumstances, a search would have been impossible to conceal from the local population.\r\n\r\nin the north-eastern sky i noticed what i later came to know as a contrail, which i duly pointed out to my father. it was advancing in a north-to-south direction at considerable speed - as fast as i would now expect a modern fighter to 'pull a con', and somewhat faster than the contrails of current commercial airliners.\r\n\r\nit is important to note that at no time did i see \"an object\". i only saw the the effects of a flying object which remains unidentified.\r\n\r\nthe trail began within my field of view, starting from nothing to a thin white thread and rapidly thickening to the now-common white contrail, but then quickly changing from white to light brown, then to denser, dark brown. \r\n\r\nthe trail then abruptly turned from horizontal to apparently vertical. i acknowledge that the object may have been simply climbing steeply, either directly toward or away from my point of observation, giving the appearance of vertical flight. the 'trail' very rapidly continued darkening from brown to apparently black, whereupon there was a spherical 'puffball' as the object exploded. the 'puffball' would have perhaps covered a golf ball held at arms length. during this time, i do not recall any sound - this was simply a silent event in a brilliant blue sky. the event spanned an estimated 20-25 degrees horizontally, and an estimated 3-5 degrees vertically. the vertical element was brief, and took perhaps three seconds.\r\n\r\ni recall my mother asking what we were gawking at, and my father responding that we had just seen something explode. a few seconds later - i can only estimate 5 to 7 seconds, and i realise this is the most critical component of the observation - the blast wave arrived. it was strong enough to shake the open hood of my fathers pickup, and soundly rattle the windows in the house, which of course also brought my mother out to see what was going on. the remains of the contrail and the 'puffball' hung in the sky for at least several more seconds before gradually dissipating, giving her plenty of time for a good look. i am also aware that a blast wave travels faster than the speed of sound, and that the event probably happened a considerable distance away, which would have put it over a vast forested area that remains completely unpopulated to this day.\r\n\r\nduring wwii, canada had established a group called the goc, or ground observer corps. this consisted largely of airforce veterans and private pilots; their purpose was to record the time, direction and type of aircraft that were noticed passing overhead. this was started, no doubt, from fears of enemy invasion but was continued post-war to aid in search and rescue efforts in a time when there was no reliable long distance radio contact with civilian aircraft. one such fellow (the airforce veteran with the aforementioned aeronca champ, and one of the few people who actually had a telephone!) was a neighbor and family friend. my father immediately contacted him, and he in turn reported it as a possible accident. several days later, he was simply informed that there were no aircraft reported missing.\r\n\r\nover the next while, at least one other area farmer cautiously mentioned seeing the event and feeling the blast wave. even then, i had the impression that it was spoken of warily; that if you spoke of something unexplainable, you were likely to be ridiculed.\r\n\r\nthe event fascinated me enough that the details remain as clear as if they happened very recently; i truly don't think i've lost or altered anything. i have been at the exact point of observation regularily, and the angles, directions, and intervals remain clear in my mind.\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":16026,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.9421206,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-03152009-0006","longitude":-116.5737635,"occurred":-399879000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-399879000000,"summary":"Another 'uneducated farmer' report from a place you've never heard of.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"MST7MDT","timeZoneName":"MST7MDT","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Alberta","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:251665"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Howland","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was taking my dog out and while it does its thing i tend to stare up at the stars in hopes of seeing a falling star. it was about 10:30pm maybe later and the sky was clear and the stars were bright. i looked around and saw what i first thought to be a falling star. i remember being glad that i hadn't missed it and noticing how bright it was. after a moment or so i realized that the \"star\" was not disappearing as expected. it was then that i noticed a twin light was running parallel to the first. both lights were red, and i know you must be thinking it must have been a plane, i thought this as well. even with that thought in mind, if it were a plane it did not have the characteristics i would expect such as the color red on a plane is much brighter, the color tone not the light. the ones i was watching were almost a maroon orange texture. there was also no blinking lights as you see on commercial aircraft and the like. even then i would have dismissed it had it not been for what happened next. as i stood and watched the lights dropped and flew over my head and out to the horizon and disappeared at a phenomenal speed. further more there was no sound, in fact my dog did not even notice. the lights were approximately 1000 feet overhead or less, and the final thing that made me ponder was the fact that though the lights were moving at such tremendous speed there was no streak effect as you would find with fast moving light. in other words if you have ever been camping and placed the end of a stick in the fire until it was glowing and waved it around to see the circles and streaks in the air, these lights did not have that effect.

was september 13, 2008 and i had seen on the news that the eye was enetring galveston island. the weather outdoors was already very windy and a hard rain falling. i got out of bed to see first hand what the storm was doing in the event that i had to provide additional protection to my family. i was very much awake and alert.\r\n\r\n2) at first only through the lightening could i see any further than the nearby parked vehicles and motel buildings. i stepped just out the door but quickly returned inside as the wind was strong and i did not want to get knocked over. after a few minutes i opened the door again to look at the storm. it was then that i saw a very emerald green object directly in front of me. the color was strong but did not seem to be bright or lighting up anything nearby. there seemed to have been a greenish halo of a less intense light that surrounded its configuration. it at first looked to be triangular in shape but, then seemed to be rectangular. the distance was only 100-150 yards from me.\r\n\r\n3)the light seemed to be at first suspended, motionless, and soundless. the object completely blocked a 6-10 story building that was directly behind it. i stood in place looking at the object a good 2 minutes when my 11 year old son asked if he could get out of bed to see the storm. i gave my approval and he came and stood next to me. he immediately saw the object and asked what it was. i said, \"so you see it too\". i told him that i did not know what it was. the object then made strange slow movements while never leaving its location. the movements made it clear to me that it was three dimensional.\r\n\r\n4) the entire time of the sighting, i was trying to determine the source. i first though that it was a mirage or reflection of other lights. the strong hurricane winds and rain did not seem to have any effect on the object. the movements that it was making made it appear as if they were self controlled and intelligent. the object did not spin, it did not rotate, it did not zig zag. the best i can describe the motion is that of a slide show in which different views of a same object is seen on a big screen but, of different sides.\r\n\r\n5) during the first moments of the sighting, i stared at it and then around it trying to explain to my self what it was that i was seeing, in a logical fashion. i was very curious. when i could not find an explanation i became a little frightened. because my son was standing next to me i did not want to frighten my son so i acted as normal as i could. the object and movements led me to believe that it wanted to get noticed. after about five minutes of seeing this object, i closed the door and for a few minutes and then went back to the door with my son and opened it to look outside. the object was gone.\r\n\r\ni have been bothered by the fact that i have not reported this incident. this incident is absoluely true and i now report to the best of my ability.","distance":"101-500

the driver of the car that we were to go meet a 'friend'.  we drove to the country into a quiet, secluded valley on a shale road.  the car was stopped at the bottom and we all jumped out to wait for the 'friend' to show.  nothing happened for a while.  eventually, the driver announced the friend was on his way as he pointed to the sky.  the rest of us went along with the story, laughing and making jokes about the new 'friend' who was about to join us.  things changed when we soon saw something that looked like a star slowing moving across the sky. \r\n    as i watched it, i didn't really think much of it--it was possibly an airplane until it was obviously moving towards us.  everyone decided to get back into the car.  it ultimately became clear that it wasn't a star because it became bigger and bigger. it was a spaceship.  to give an idea of it's size-there were many willow trees in the valley where we were parked and the ship size spanned the width of the willow grove.  by this time my friends and i were terrified.  the driver announced that he was leaving to go visit his 'friend.'  my girlfriend was begging him not to leave us.  her brother demanded to go with the driver, scared but trying to be brave.  the driver told him no, that he should stay with us.  i tried to hide from the blinding light that was flooding in on us.  i began whispering to my girlfriend to be quiet as she was crying uncontrollably.  we tried our best to be quiet and our terror subsided after a few minutes when we began to realize that we were ok.  i peeked out the window.  what i saw next will remain with me the rest of my life.  \r\n    i clearly saw a silver colored saucer shaped ship with a raised bump on the top side.  the bottom was smooth.  the white light came from the bottom of the ship--that's the light that lit up the entire road and the willow grove.  around the perimeter of the ship, there were colored lights that seemed to pulsate.  the entire time, it was completely silent. it hovered above the trees.  when it left, it was gone in a snap of an instant, angleing right up into the sky.  the driver returned to the car, jumped in, and we drove back to town saying

when i looked into one of the many valleys that run no to so in that area when i passed one that was illuminated by a bright red sort of incandescent lite and near the bottom of the valley there appeared to be an object that looked like a small submarine with multi lites hovering about 40 feet off the ground in a valley that was no more than 150 to 200 feet deep. it was to the south from our vantage on the west bound side. we passed it rather quickly at our speed just long enough to see it and that it had the entire valley lit up.  it surprised me and i sort of exclaimed \" what the hell was that !\"  i dont know what it was, but i know what it was not.  it was not moving and it had no wings or rotors.  it looked a little like the  trieste bathysphere from the marrieannis trench dives. i think the object was probobley no larger than a small rv.  we moved onwards towards barstow cal.  and i began to forget about it for perhaps 45 mins to an hour, and  then just as we began to near barstow i rolled down my drivers side window and for some reason i looked over my left shoulder behind us and there prob. about 500 to 700 feet to the left rear of me the same object with the same unmistakeable color and hue was moving in the same direction and speed that we were. it was 700 to 1000 ft off the ground just at the edge of the cloud cover. there was an intense sort of santa anna wind effect that was blowing very hard that evening  so hard that it was moving the truck but it didnt seem to affect the object at all.  at that point i took my foot off the gas and let the truck slow somewhat, i leaned out of the truck and looked back directly at the object and got a better look at it, and as i craned my head out of the window over a period of prob. 30 seconds the object seemed to be aware that i was looking at it and it moved upwards and into a bank of quickly moving clouds that obscured it but as it moved away it illuminated the cloud bank as it left and then it was gone. with the better look at it , it seemed to be bell shaped, almost like an inverted bell and the way the lites on it seemed to be moving upwards from bottom to top  it kind of looked like a xmas tree orniment  it almost seemed to resemble  one of those deep sea jellyfish with the phospherescent lites moving up and down on them. {pardon my spellings }  i knew i should report this somewhere but i didnt really know where.  this really happened and pretty much as i described.  i dont know what it was, but i know what it was not; not any conventional aircraft that i have ever seen. it didnt move at any exceptional speeds, but to me it seemed to be aware that i had noticed it and somewhat diverted its course into the clouds as i slowed down and turned around and looked at it.  i dont know how long it had been ghosting us  so to speak or how long it had been going in our direction from where i first saw it, but i almost got the impression that it had been observing us after we first noticed it; we may have gotten its attention when we first saw it.  i almost got the feeling that instead of its being a craft it may have been a life form itself.  maybe thats just my

and my attention was imediatly captured. this object was too low to be a star. bright white light illuminated it. saturn was visible that time of month but was in a more western part of the sky i think. i imediatly began to realize that this thing wasn't moving. no lights indicating a plane. i looked and stared at it to move, but the contour of the road, the turns...Made me realize this thing was stationary. i had to move closer tho the windshield to keep my eyes on it and i knew something was up when we went right underneath of it! it had to be about 1,000 ft. up, i say that because the planes that usually land at the bluegrass airport, nearby in lexington , are seen around that altitude when assuming their descention. i began to lose sight of it when we turned a corner and it disappeared over the tree line. only when i turned around to see it throught he rear windshield, did my fiance turn and ask what was going on. i just shrugged it off, and told him he would think i was going crazy. a couple of days later, i was coming down lisle rd. the opposite way during the day and to the left of me is i-75, to the right, open field and a 200 ft. radio communications tower. as i approached the railroad tracks near the tower, i notice multiple satellite dishes. 15'-20' in diameter. pointed in the same direction. this is where i first noticed this object, i remembered and it

up, and as i did i immediatly saw this black round object that seemed to float, spin, and dip along in the air. i was determined to not take my eyes off of it for one moment. the object stayed in my field of view for approximately two minutes total. the wind was out of the southwest at a brisk fifteen m.P.H. the black object changed shape several times as i watched it. i thought at first it must be a plastic bag of some sort but it continued to fly directly against the wind! the approximate altitude i would guess was at about 1200 feet at first site. the object then moved directly over where i was standing and appeared to come closer to me, i would guess to about 800 ft. then i could clearly see the surface seemed to be folding in on itself! it did have a somewhat metalic (or plastic) shine to it. this thing then moved back up to about 1000 ft. and proceeded on its course to the southwest. the oddest thing that occured to me as i tried to give myself an honest evaluation as to its make-up was that it appeared to be trying to look like a plastic bag! as this thing began to move away i tried to hurry to a better spot so i could keep it in sight, and as i watched it changed to a classic saucer shape and a little further on to a delta wing shape. just amazing! it then was momentarily obscured by some trees, and i lost sight of it. i only wish i had my
