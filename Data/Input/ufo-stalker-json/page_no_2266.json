(dixon, il.) at about 9 pm.  i was with my fiance and future mother and father in-law. my future in-laws just took us out for our engagement dinner celebrating out marriage coming up in september.  about 5 or 6 miles from sterling i saw a very bright light low to the south maybe 10 degrees above the horizon, and stationary.  this interested me being an amateur astronomer (have a questar 7) for about seven years, and being familiar with venus, jupiter and other bright objects in the night sky.  the sun had set about an half hour earlier and just a faint glow of twilight was in the west, but basically it was dark. chicago being 100 miles to the east, it is not uncommon to see large commercial planes coming at you directly from the east with their landing lights still on slowly gaining altitude without any apparent motion, but as the craft comes closer motion can be finally detected and increases as they eventually pass overhead or therabouts.  but this was different.  it was motionless, and motionless.  i kept quiet, being that i was the only one having seen it so far, and waited for it to move marking it in sky visually.  it did not. i remarked then almost a minute later about this unusual motionless bright object. as we got closer it was apparent we were on a course to intercept this object. by this time i was quite excited and captivated as we approached the main highway where this object was hovering. with the object just 100 yards or less my father in- law (pulled onto the highway trying to watch and drive at the same time. i told him to puill over aobut 3 times and finally he pulled off onto the shoulder behind several other cars with people already out of their cars and watching this object.  it was captivating. i have tried to find the drawings i made afterwards and notes i have yet to find them.  back then i told this story many times in detail to a point it became ingrained in me but now 32 years later the estimation in size may be slightly off but i believe well within the ballpark. but here goes. when we got out of the car the object was coming right at us slowly maybe 10-15 miles an hour. i  when it became alarmingly close (70 yards?) and maybe 45 degrees up, i then got a good look at the size and shape of this thing.  i had been an airman in the navy for 4 years, (66-70) working with the a-6a intruder as a plane captain receiving many of these and other jet aircraft types as well on the flightline and on carrier parking them for post flight inspections, but i have have never received one of these babies and didn't really want to chalk this guy.  it was approx. 65-75' in diameter, disk shaped, and about 10,and brilliantly lit up. before it broke out of its pattern, it made about 6or 7 rectanglar passes each time coming at us raising up to its' closest point and then banking slightly (tilted) to the direction (west) for about 75 yards, south for 100 yards, 75 yards to the east then at us (100 yards) to the north doing this 6-7 times.  being dark without the lights was impossible to tell the shape except for the lights. the lights! spectacular almost hypnotic at times.  the ten foot heighth of the craft was divided up into about 5'wide by 10 high panels side by side each fully lit. (from inside?) outlining the shape as disk  shape.  but each panel went on and off and synchronized, moving rotating completely around the craft all the time it made these passes.  the motion was quite rapid as i recall and at times had a reverse movement. it reminded me when as a boy i would turn my bicycle upside down, crank the pedal as fast as i could get it and watch the wheel and spokes make that reverse motion similar to some affects i've seen in the aurora borealis. almost hynotic and quite spectacular. anorher unsusal thing i noticed was that it made no sound.  the only sound i heard an almost undetectable sound of the wind being cut as it rotated. a gentle cutting of the wind. in my mind i am gong over all the possible things this could be and i was coming up with a zero.  plane? moving too slow and no noise. helicopter? no noise, too small. balloon or dirigible? don't think so. so what was it. i mentioned to linda i wanted to run across the highway before its next pass, lie down in the grass and wait for it to pass overhead to get even a closer look, but she would not let me. and to tell you the truth part of me wanted to go and part of me said stay put which i did. finally it slowly broke pattern and went off to the east. we were all getting into our vehicles when the person ahead said it was a helicopter but it could not have been. as we were coming into town still in sight i noticed it had now turned on colored maybe even blinking lights and then i lost sight of it. the next day i looked for headlines concerning this sighting especially being seen by scores, but i saw nothing in the newspapers. it was said that it was a dirigible hired to make passes over a nearby residence in celebration of someones birthday and i always had a problem with that explanation being there was not a house close. thank you for listening.  it is unusual with such a spectacular, captivating and entertaining tool at our use it has never been seen again to my knowledge any where else. jim stroup  ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":15996,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.788642,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03132009-0006","longitude":-89.6962194,"occurred":204610200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":204610200000,"summary":"At night, large, disk shaped, spectacular color, no noise, close prox., slow rectangular passes, 60' off ground, 20 minutes.

mind was on getting breakfast. i saw a metalic gray form above the road and took it for another airplane getting ready to land at the nearby airport. then i noticed it wasn't moving. i looked

other stars with its brightness. asid from northern lights, which are shaped differently, i have never seen such color in such an object in the sky, including the sun at sunrise or sunset. the rays of

saw nearly the same thing in april of 2007 at approximately 0330am flying over my home in northeastern kentucky.\r\n\r\ni was having a bout with insomnia, and decided to go outside and videotape and observe some of the strange goings on in the airspace above my home.\r\n\r\ni saw a light flying through the air, coming from the north and headed due south and it was making no noise.  i decided to start taping it when to my joy, i noticed another light approximately 200 feet away, on the firsts starboard wing, and i distinctly remember saying, \"hmmm, that's strange, the one on the left is flying awfully close to the one on the right, but it's cool, because there are two of them!\"\r\n\r\nwithin about 10 seconds of making the above statement, my knees almost buckeled, and a great deal of fear came over me, because it dawned on me that, no, i wasn't looking at two different lights on two different aircraft, but i was looking at one huge aircraft!!!  and it was flying extremely low!\r\n\r\ni mean, it looked like it was just barely clearing a large grove of huge probably two century old oak trees, which are at least 50 feet tall.\r\n\r\nit was then that i noticed, out of the corner of my right eye, that there was another light, to the right (port side) about 200 feet away...So this thing was h-u-g-e!\r\n\r\ni remember saying outloud, \"oh my god!  this is one huge f-ing thing, and it's so damn low, that yes, i am scared [cms/tg/pd] right now!!!\"\r\n\r\nit was then that i truly realized the enormity of the thing.  it was at least 300-400 wide and maybe that much long, if not more!\r\n\r\nit had three white lights on each \"corner\", and one red light dead center underneath, whith six pale white/yellow lights in rows of two center around the red light underneath.  it also had deep blue looking lights on the underside of each corner.\r\n\r\nit was so huge.  it flew directly over top of me, my house and my yard, headed due south.  \r\n\r\ni had my video camera running the whole time, and i know that my voice probably sounded at least an octave higher in pitch, and that i was talking twice as fast as normal.\r\n\r\ni was able to clearly see all of these details, as there was a full moon, and it was in the low in the sky in the south/southwest, with a few clouds, but mostly clear.\r\n\r\nwhen this thing flew over me, i believe i was more scared because it was so low, rather than the fact that it was huge!\r\n\r\ni was so big, that when it flew over, it literally blocked out the star field for about 10-20 seconds, which i know that i stated while i taped it flying over me.  \r\n\r\nit appeared to be completely stable in flight, was quiet, but had a very low pitched rumble to it...You could feel it more than you could hear it.  it was really creepy sounding.  it sounded like a sub woofer which had a really low frequency noise on it, turned up and placed on a carpeted floor.  weird.\r\n\r\nit flew really slow.  extremely slow...Like a blimp in flight.  come to think of it, it might have sounded like a blimp's engine, except lots more quiet.\r\n\r\nalso, and this is really strange...As i watched it fly over, i noticed that a willow tree which was in my front yard, and which had not yet bloomed, or had leaves, started shaking.  i mean, the really longs and slender branches, were almost quivering.  i tried to videotape them, but i'm sure you could not see them in the darkness, but they were shaking. what drew my attention to this anomaly was that i heard them first.  i then noted that there was absolutely no wind, so i was further creeped out!\r\n\r\ni then watched it fly on a continuous southerly heading, and approximately 1/2 mile away, it made a slow bank to starboard, and floated toward the south/southwest, which gave me a really good look at it.  \r\n\r\nit was not black, but almost an air superiority gray color, and it was definetely triangular shaped.\r\n\r\nafter i saw this, i came into the house, and was shaking.  i even woke my wife up, and she immediately sensed something had shaken me up.\r\n\r\nlastly, although i did videotape this...Thing, i have never, gone back and reviewed the tape, because it creeped me out so bad!  i still have it, but i have not worked up the gumption to re-live that period in time!

 \r\n\r\nnow, here's the deal...I live one mile from a new general aviation airport, which was not yet finished when i started noting all of this, but i live at a minimum, one hour from the nearest commercial airports and most only have flights leaving at 0530. \r\n\r\ni know for a fact that some of these aircraft are b-2's, as i have seen them do flyovers, and i know what their engine \"note\" sounds like.  i also know what their contrails (when they leave one....Which isn't often) look like.  i also know what their light pattern looks like when i see them.\r\n\r\nhowever, i have also seen small and medium sized triangular shaped craft, which make absolutely no noise, and leave no contrail, which have done some pretty amazing aeronautical feats.  i saw one, literally (and i have this on tape) spin around 2 times, while maintaining an e to w heading.  it did not slow down, speed up, bank, or fall out of the sky.  i also saw one (on tape also), go from a w heading, to a a sse heading instantly!  it made nearly a 240 turn, without slowing down!  and, with no noise.  none!  \r\n\r\ni've also seen lights(on tape as well), which had two stacked on top of one another, and watched them change elevation and appear to change places with each other, without any noise. \r\n\r\none morning, at around 0600, my wife yells up to our bedroom, from downstairs, \"honey, you have got, to come down here and see this!\"  so, i jumped out of bed, ran downstairs and looked through the blinds of a window which faces due south.  low and behold, right there, over one of the ponds in our subdivision, is a black, triangular shaped aircraft, making absolutely no noise, literally hovering over this pond, no more than 1000 feet off the deck!!!  i am not one to get easily excited over things, especially during a crisis, but i almost soiled myself!  i was flabbergasted at what we were seeing!  my heart rate jumped up, and i literally rubbed my eyes, because i thought i was dreaming.  i recall saying to my wife, \"am i really seeing a black triangular shaped aircraft hovering and making no noise?  i'm am awake, right?!\"\r\n\r\ni told my wife to run upstairs and get me some pants and a shirt, because i am going to videotape this, because no one will believe this, and as soon as i go out side in my skivvies, one of the neighbors will be out walking there dog!

(3/12/09) i walked out on my deck which overlooks the hoodcanal. i saw a bright star like object about 20 degress up from the north western horizon. as i watched it, it pulsated about every 5-10 seconds with a bright green, back to yellowish white star shape, another 5-10 seconds with a bright red pulse, back to yellowish white star shape, 5-10 seconds with a bright white pulse, then back to its original color. thinking possible plane (as many plans fly over that area) i continued to watch it. it did not behave like a plane. i expected it to diminish in size if it was flying away from me, or get larger if it was flying towards me. it did neither, instead it moved slowly from left to right. i estimated the object to be 5-10 miles from my location. from my porch it travled the length of a yard stick in one hour. if estrapulated to say 10 miles i don't know how far that is. however, it was moving very slowly towards the right. about every 15 minutes it would do a quick strobe like effect with red, green and white.. it performed quite a light show. i found it very unusual as the pulses were very bright. at that distance of course there was no noise, however i did see two planes fly fast toward the opject i could not tell what kind of planes flew towards it but they were the ones i see at night occassionaly with the extreemly bright strobe lights which go off and you don't see anything for about ten seconds and then a very strong white strobe lights again. they appeared to circle the object i was watching as they appeared in a circle about 5 in from the object from where i was. when the sun came up at about 7:10 this a.M. i saw a very thick fog bank from the horizon up to the same hight as the \r\nobject. i estimated the fog bank about 20 miles from my porch, which means the object was inside the fog bank from 5-10 miles from my porch. i have no idea what it was and was wondering if anyone else in my area reported the objecj. slower than any plane, definitely not a star, and not a satelite. i am an avid star gazzer and have seen a ufo at another time. i belive something is out there i just don't know what. i felt at the time that i had just witnessed something very unusual. the last time i saw the object was at about 6:50 when it continued moving toward the right out of my visual range because of trees.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":15982,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.737848,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03122009-0012","longitude":-122.6399072,"occurred":1236861900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1236861900000,"summary":"Watched an object moving slowly from left to right, with bright pulsating light which changed from red, green and white.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Poulsbo, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:252445"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":null,"country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was with a friend when i was 10 or 11 years old we were riding his honda cub 50 around his yard when we ran out of gas we were geting gas when i looked up an seen this flying disc shaped object very clearly the sky were cloudy and you could make object out clearly,i showed it to dennis whom i was rideing the honda with he dissmissed it as a satillite thi was no satallite it was climbing up not too fast not too slow we or i looked at it for several minutes, then it went into clouds and disappeared i know what i saw! but thats not whats bothering me, this happened in 1968 or 69 i see this image of it awake or a sleep also there is not a day goes by that i do not think about it 2 or three times a day this has been going on for 38 years !!!!! why can't i get this out of my thoughts it just really bothers me and seems the older i get the more i think of that day i know that sounds plum crazy but it is the truth.

degrees, to the right front of my south bound vehicle, toward the west. clear sky and stars visible, no moon that i noticed. appeared to be below 80 feet (8 story building) agl and descending at about a 5 degree angle toward the west. above some trees on the south side of south century dr.. what i expected to witness was a crash of an airplane because the light looked very much like an aircraft right wing navigation light. i had just passed the fire station on south century dr. and of course that is an area where helicopters land. there is an illuminated helicopter landing pad there. no activity at the fire station that i noticed, no ambulance or other vehicles that i noticed. all quiet at the fire station. as i rounded the turn to the west on south century dr., i stopped the car and rolled down the window. no sounds. no airplane engine sound, no crash, no helicopter rotor blade or engine sounds, nothing. i stopped the car within 20-30 seconds of seeing the light.\r\n\r\nno debris trail like a meteor from the light, simply a bright greenish-blue light that came on and went out 2 seconds later.\r\n\r\nthe light came on and extinguished before the angle it was descending at would have made contact with the ground.\r\n\r\ni estimate the light was south of south century dr. after it turns west at the intersection with huntington rd. that would be a distance of about 500-600 feet from my position which was north of the turn about 200-300 feet. i guess speed to be in the 150 mph range. the light moved faster than most helicopters but at about the approach speed of a business jet that could have been inbound to the sunriver airport which is about 3 miles to the north. i consider the fact that both a helicopter landing pad nearby and general aviation airport 3 miles north has nothing to do with the light as i perceive it to not be from an airplane.\r\n\r\ni am a retired aviation professional with 25 years and 20,000 hours of flying experience, many aviation related

see cars coming down our road from. i guess the thing that got my attention first was the brilliant colors. you could see red, green, white,yellow and sometimes purple with the naked eye. i watched it for a while and it seemed to be moving slowly toward the south. from about 8:00 pm it was in my se direction from my house,when i first noticed it. i went to bed about 11:00 pm that night, and from the time i first noticed it until i went ot bed it had moved from the se to pretty much straight south sky, and then back north almost straight above my house. i think it was the very next night i saw it again and i showed my fiance and i was watching it for a while when she said hey, there's another one. i didn't believe her at first, then she said really, look over here, and sure enough there was another one towards the sw of the house. the next time i saw it i got my telescope since it seemed farther away, and tried to take some pictures but they just looked like apurplish red blob. i did seem to get a pretty good look at it though and it looked round with a flat or slightly domed top and bottom. at one point it looked like a bunch of orange squares rotating around it from my left to right with a brilliant white on the top and the bottom, this continued for a while and all of a sudden it looked like purple exploded out the top and bottom of it simultaniously. shortly after i first saw it i got on the internet to see if a satelite would look like this and the only info i found was that it would look bright white. i have seen this thing in the sky quite frequently when there is no clouds, even just the other night. i finally found someone to ask about it and am doing so to clearify this as to what it could be. i guess what added to my interest is what else has happened to me personally in about the same time period i have been seeing this object. on 3-9-09 i fell and probably tore my rotor cuff. this has nothing to do with this, accept i knew i would probably be going to the doctor about it as it was really sore. yesterday, wednesday 3-11-09 i woke up for about the fourth time since about last summer with what i had been calling scratches on the upper back part of my right leg. only this time i also had them on the front part of my leg just below my beltline going downward about 5 inches long. prior to this i thought i had just did this myself, accept this time i could see them much better. there was about 4 marks spaced about 3 and a half inches wide and about 6 inches up and down. the weird thing was one line going down y'ed off into 2 line and one of those two y'ed into another line all totally continus like it formed out of one line with no gaps between. on the back of my leg was even more distinct or deaper marks only running horizontal just under my but cheak. this is where they had been before. looking closer with a mirror, one of the lines in back of my leg y'ed off twice like the one in front. i guess the y ing off with no gap in the line got my attention the most. well i went to my doctor today and had him look at my shoulder and then i said i would like him to look at my scratches. i told him it happens in my sleep, and i don't even wake up, i just notice a slight burning sensation when i wake up. he said he had absolutly no idea what it could be from, but he said to him it looks like it was done with a razor blade and asked me if i had any lapse of memory at any time. i said no cause it only happens when i'm sleeping. i still see this thing in the sky but it seems farther away lately. i would greatly appreciate any input you would have on this. i guess if you could have someone call me to talk about this, that would be great. thank you for your time, it is appreciated. steve

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"To quickly preface this���\r\n\r\n     i���m currently writing a book about an important scientific discovery located within the rocky mountains of the united states, known as the wis (western interior seaway) impact project. this unique discovery has allowed me to be the first person to locate and study the first major physical evidence of the dinosaur extinction, which occurred 65.2 million years ago. this physical evidence exists within an ancient 300 ft tall by 75 mile wide asteroid impact debris pile. the physical evidence located within this debris pile includes: fossil dinosaur bones (millions), showing evidence of high speed ballistic impacts, along with strange \"signature\" impact materials from the impacting asteroid, such as large iron (fe) spherules (millions), some of which, are so strange, that do not\r\ncurrently register as any known substance thus far within several series of professional testing.\r\n\r\na strange thing happened on june 6th 2002���\r\n\r\n     this occurred at the wis discovery site, during the fifth and most important day after the initial discovery of the impact debris pile itself.  i would estimate that it was about 9:20 pm. it had just gotten dark on the ledge of a mountain where i was camped. the camp was located about 1 mile away from the original discovery site. i was inside the tent when my father (and recently deceased co-partner) called out to me about a bright light moving across the sky. i figured he was either seeing the space station or a satellite in orbit. i walked out from the tent, and also saw a bright whitish light streaking across the sky at a high rate of speed. i instantly knew that no plane could cover that distance so quickly. the light reached us in about 1-2 seconds after i walked out of the door. the light then literally stops and hangs in mid air over the initial wis discovery site location. it hangs perfectly still for about 1 1/2 minutes. then...It changes course direction and shoots off at an incredibly high rate of speed again. both me and my father sat discussing the incident for about 5-6 minutes until we noticed that two air force jets (flying in formation) came chasing after the object in question. the two military jets changed course direction in the exact same spot as the lighted object in question had also performed minutes earlier. that concludes the facts as i know them. it is now pure speculation as to what that object was, and why it was there that specific night.\r\n\r\n     the possibility exists that a ���mini neutron flux��� occurred during this large asteroid impact upon north america millions of years ago. a neutron flux is the process in which heavy elements are created during the supernova of a star. should this indeed be the case, the wis impact project will introduce a series of new stable elements that mainstream science has not yet seen before, such as unfamiliar isotopes of iron (fe) and possible theoretical elements like element 115 and beyond. most of the materials within my research samples do not seem to have the actual weight required to be considered one of the ���super heavy��� element groups. it will likely turn out to be an unusual isotope of iron (fe) and other surrounding elements on the periodic table. these samples need immediate access to the most advanced testing equipment around the world.\r\n\r\n     i have sincerely dedicated most of my time to the wis project and still research steadily to figure out ���that��� strange connection ever since. this project involves a dedicated knowledge within 8-10 separate areas of academic science. no single person has achieved a degree within that many fields. they simply don���t exist. by the beginning of 2003, i have only existed within a scientific monastery in near complete isolation ever since, pondering and working to further understand the true aspects and importance of this incredible discovery.\r\n\r\n     i thought that you might find this project and that strange occurrence interesting, and possibly worthy of further research on your part. please feel free to actually review the evidence and view the ���information��� and ���evidence photos��� located on my web page.\r\n\r\n{pid}\r\n\r\nsimply click the ���photos��� button, and browse through the wis project\r\nphotos album.\r\n\r\ni would really appreciate it any opinions���\r\n\r\nfor the world is hollow���and now i have touched the sky,\r\n\r\nquentin

had often done, when i noticed a bright light approximately 10 miles or so away.I was facing that direction already so it was no effort to look up. this was a very common sight because the international airport is about 25 miles to the south east. at first i thought it was an aircraft with it's landing lights on, but after a minute or so i realized the aircraft was going away from me.\r\ni thought it was odd because i could not remember ever seeing landing lights on a plane that was going away from me. i contemplated what it was.\r\ni thought it might be a jet with it's afterburner on. the aircraft was climbing steadily at about a 30 degree angle or so. i figured it might be the sun shining on it from the horizon. i watched as the light moved further and further away. it was also getting smaller and eventually kind of looked like a star. then all of a sudden it took an immediate 90 degree sharp turn to the left (west) and increased its speed to an incredible rate and disappeared. i have never seen anything that could turn on a dime like that and i have never seen an aircraft go that fast before and i was in the military. after i got home i told my wife

craft with 3 lights underneath it heading in a ne direction in the early evening sky underneath the cloudcover. an airliner that was passing thru the same area nearly hit it but veered away and up. we pulled over to check it out and i grabbed my camera from the back seat (i always keep it with me in the car). after the near miss the triangle made a tight circle and headed back sw. shortly thereafter it appeared another airliner was coming thru the same area as the triangle craft was making its turn but it was much to large and actually appeared to be a diamond shaped craft with many lighs around it including a forward and rear facing directed type spotlight. this diamond craft was 4 or 5 times the size of the triangle craft but unlike the smaller triangle it was still mostly in the bottom cloud cover so details were obscured. the diamond made a wider and slower turn and matched up with the smaller triangle craft heading sw. i snapped the picture as the triangle was beggining its turn, i only wish i would of snapped a shot of the diamond craft but my wife and i were far to blown away trying to figure out what it was. very interesting sighting and for what its worth it was my first.\r\n\r\nsome additional notes...\r\n\r\nthe triangle craft was solid black with 3 lights underneath it near each tip, very easily viewed with the naked eye. this craft moved slowly and smoothly, and when it turned it made an impossibly tight turn. we heard no sound from this one although we heard the plane it nearly collided with perfectly well as it passed overhead.\r\n\r\nthe diamond craft was truely massive, hence the primary reason i didnt snap a picture of it i think, my wife and i were stunned (im still kicking myself over this). i dont recall a noise from this craft but my wife distinctly recalls a low humming or electrical buzzing sound coming from it. we've discussed this sighting many times since it happened and we've come to the conclusion that the diamond craft wasnt actually in the bottom of the cloud layer but was instead most likely projecting the clouds above it on its surface as a form of camoflauge perhaps. this craft moved very slowly and smoothly.\r\n\r\nwe live relatively near a small airport that is used by small cesna type planes and we see planes around constantly. i think this strengthens this sighting as opposed to weakening it however because we are painfully familiar with what planes look and act like in the skies. these 2 craft were not like any civilian or military planes we've ever seen, and that includes the stealth fighter/bomber.\r\n\r\nif theres any way we can help with additional info please let us
