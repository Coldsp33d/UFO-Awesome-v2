mile or more, and above the roofline between the sillhouette of two mountain tops i saw a series of six lights.  i have studied the lights and being familar with the skyline i knew these were new and unusual.  i waited approximately 15 mintues to see if they would move or change and they did not.  i went quickly into the house to get my camera, and this approximately one minute, i returned to the back yard with camera and photographed the skyline and lights wich were unchanged.  i waited approximately five minutes longer and then went to my vehicle drove approximately five minutes, lost visual, returned to my back yard and they were gone. i did not witness their leaving or disappearance.  i then sat waiting hoping they would return and noticed a brief return of one individual light in similar position in the sky, but further south on the horizon.  this appeared in front of me, and then disappeared as if a cloak was covering it from one side and then was gone.  i then drove approximately 1/4 mile to my moms, picked her up and together we drove approximately 100 yards to the edge of our neighborhood.  we sat looking into the night sky to the west, hoping for a nother glimpse or sighting.  we waited approximately 15 minutes, and again south of the original sighting two more lights appeared.  this was witnessed by my mom as well.  these remained in the sky approximately three minutes, and then disappeared as per the single sighting, as if a cloak covered the two lights. then using binoculars i searched the skies and noticed sporadic silver individual sparkler like objects that were silver flashing on and off throughout the field of vision in the binoculars as if strobing and changing position. these were not visible with the naked eye.  we then waited another twenty minutes, and no other lights appeared.  we drove approximately five miles to another location, waited approximately twenty minutes, no further sightings and we returned home.

was already pretty late, it was getting dark, i started to freeze and i wanted to move back towards the city, when i noticed the silence. there was no car, nothing. i stopped and looked around me. although it was a pretty shitty day to be out, nature had a strange beauty in the fading daylight. suddenly i got a strange feeling in my chest, like when i was standing on a vibrating platform, but only very faint. suddenly i felt weak and then i noticed an object in the sky. it was hovering just at the base of the deep hanging clouds and dissappeared every once in a while into the moving clouds maintining its altitude. there was no sound except some light wind, only the strange humming feeling inside my body, maybe like pulsating electricity, i have no idea, i haven't felt like that before. at first, while it was still pretty close, i didn't move at all. i was like in a shock. but while it slowly moved away i realized that what i was seeing might be quite unique and took out my cellphone. i wanted to take a picture but the display wasn't working right. the images had stripes and pressing the trigger didn't do anything. only when the object was already pretty far it worked, i shot the attached picture and then, seconds later, the disk was covered in clouds once more and i never saw it again. here are a few facts:\r\n\r\nsize: can't tell, but i would guess it was pretty big, like 50 meters maybe? the clouds, although deep this day, are still a few hundred meters above ground, so the thing should be bigger than just 10 meters.\r\n\r\nshape: flat gray disk with lights at the bottom\r\n\r\nheight: just below the clouds/ in the clouds\r\n\r\ntime: around 6 pm, dawn\r\n\r\nspeed: slowly moving across the sky\r\n\r\nlights: three white/blueish and one red, no blinking etc.\r\n\r\nduration: very hard to tell, it felt much longer than it probably was, maybe 15 seconds for the whole encounter\r\n\r\n\r\nas i work for the local city administration i can not give you my real name, nobody would take me serious anymore here in w���rzburg. i never believed in aliens or ufos, but this thing got me thinking and i actually have no satisfying explanation for it. maybe you guys know more about this thing, especially because it doesn't look like the typical ufo that i have seen on the many silly photos on

ago i was stargazing with my meade telescope.The night was clouldless so viewing was optimal. i decided to view venus since it was the most brightest thing in the night sky. when i trained my viewfinder on the planet, i noticed a tiny glint off to the side .I thought nothing of it at first.But when i trained my main viewing scope, something strange was hovering beside venus.At first i thought it might have been glare on my lens.Thats when it slowly began to change shape.First it was a oblong-oviod.Then it became a bar with partitioned sections.I went off for a few minutes and when i came back, it had moved! it completely changed its orientation beside venus.First it appeared to the upper left.Then it was to the lower right. the best way to describe it is a transluecent shapeshifting bolide.I know it is transluecent because i could see venus through it. if it is a craft of some sort, then it is made of pure energy(hypothosis)it appears to shimmer with opalesent light.I don't know what it is. i have witnessed many things in the night sky.I have never seen anything close to this.If you wish you can view it for yourself.Thats right, its still there.Every night.Still in geosynchronous orbit.I am inviting anyone from your organization to view this object from my house. you can bring any recording/viewing equipment you like.If you wish to capture this phenomenon come between the hours of 8 and 9 pm.Contact me by email so that i can know when to stand outside to greet you. please honk three times.Thank you and i hope you take advantage of this

cover for a glimpse of the international space station and a tailing shuttle. at approximately 21:05 i saw a small object far off between a hole in the clouds northwest, on a northeast path. two minutes later, at 21:07, i saw another very similiar object in the same location, moving the same way, though it was moving more slowly than the first. i assume these were the i.S.S. and the following shuttle now, but that night i wasn't convinced and wanted to see more, so i remained outside. i kept checking the clock, because the time given for the space station's overhead pass was different than the time i had seen it and hadn't yet passed. after i checked the clock at 21:13, i decided to give the wait a few more minutes then head back inside. i sat down on the back porch step and looked skyward again. it couldn't have been half a minute afterwards when i saw a light appearing over the shed to my left. at first, i wasn't very intrigued by the light, but simply watched for a lack of anything better to do. i didn't know what it was, and i didn't have time to ponder it. then another light followed it, and another after that, and another after that one. the four lights were in a circular pattern, but there was a large circular object blotting out the sky surrounding the lights. the craft came into view slowly, very low, almost leisurely. after the craft seemed to have centered over me, it stopped and hovered. from the position of the four lights, the craft looked to be rotating in a counter-clockwise direction. i don't remember if it was rotating before it stopped. there was a dome in the center of what i could see of the craft, but i don't remember if it was a light or not. i don't think it was. the craft spanned the distance between the roof of the shed and the roof of the house.\r\n\r\ni stood and pulled the camera i had in my lap up to take a picture of the craft (though it sadly caught only blackness). the craft hovered breifly, and then stopped rotating. it then quickly shot off to my right, southeast, over the roof. i felt and feel as though the whole event couldn't have lasted more than a two-minute maximum, but i checked the clock as soon as i couldn't see the craft anymore, and it was 21:17. i then went inside, focused on drawing what i'd seen, this being the first time i used the camera.\r\n\r\njust recently, my mother and i took the measurements of the area between the edge of the roof of the shed and the roof of the house. using this, the craft had to have been more than 106 inches in diameter, and was at least 108 inches off of the ground. the sketch i've provided is, sadly, not the original, which has been lost. it's not the best, but i hope it'll do.","distance":"20 Feet or

approximately 7:45. she was driving and i was in the passenger seat.  it was already quite dark out as we were hours shy of day light savings' spring forward.  i recall the highway being quite busy at the time.  as we are driving through arlington, we get pretty close to six flags over texas.  looking ahead of us a few hundred yards, i see two sets of lights in the sky.  from the spot that we're in, i can see that there are two separate air crafts, but their shape was somewhat elusive as they were dark, and blended somewhat with the dark sky.  they appeared to be shaped somewhat like a bullet, even a helicopter without the blades or the tail.  originally, i did think that they were helicopters.  as we neared them my girlfriend and i could see how close these two crafts were to each other, and simultaneously yelled out that they were going to crash.  we quickly realized, however, that they were not moving at all, but hovering in place.  as we continued to get closer, we could see how close to the ground they really were - only about 60 feet above it.  confused, we both looked up as we got under them.  though their lights were, making it difficult to see, the stationary crafts' shapes were definitely not those of any flying craft i've ever seen.  they were like bullets, but bluntly tapered at one end, much like the cross-section of a domed silo on its side.  if i could compare it to anything, i'd say it looked almost as if there were two cars floating in midair there.  completely in shock from what we were seeing, and attempting to reason with ourselves what they were, she continued to drive, and i turned around and stared out the back windshield as the hovering crafts stayed there.  we finally drove out of their sight.  as we continued to drive to forth worth, our attempts at reasoning became more absurd, and succumbed to the possibility that they were paranormal objects.  dropping me off in fort worth, i told her to take the same route back and see if there was anything there that was possibly suspending the objects in the air.  when she drove back through the area, nothing was in sight.  i am extremely eager to know if anyone saw this as

the driveway at my home in chester connecticut.I was listening to a rough mix of a track which i had just recorded in the studio the previous evening when i noticed a bright object coming into view in front of me. looking towards my back yard into the neighboring property there is a very steep hill where at the top it is tree lined,it was above the top of the trees which i saw the bright light emerging from a distance.I really didn't think much of it at first figuring that this was maybe just a large aircraft. being that there was nothing else present in the sky {at least from my vantage point within the car} at the time that all of this was occurring the light really seemed to stand out and i figured that i would just follow the flight path of this object since it would probably be heading almost directly over my vehicle in a short time, suddenly the object appeared to stop before it reached the treetops of the neighboring property. in the dark it's very hard to judge the actual distance away that this object was but i'm thinking maybe at least a half a mile? i continued to watch the object sit completely stationary in the sky and of course i now knew that my interpretation of what i was watching in the sky was totally incorrect, this couldn't be an airplane. i must have sat in my vehicle for at least 5 minutes or so with my eyes fixed to the object and never once saw that it was moving, as a helicopter might move around when it's trying to hold a steady position. the object looked more or less roundish in shape and extremely bright {almost yellowish}, like a huge bright star only at least four times or more as bright and large as any star might ever be. at one point as i was still sitting there i observed a small airplane fly relatively close by the object dwarfing it in size. it definitely makes me wonder whether the small plane was also checking out the same thing that i was? the next thing that i did was go into the house to tell my wife about what had just occurred and also knock on my landlords door so that they could both also be witness to what i was seeing. all three of us then went out onto the back porch and viewed the object which remained motionless in the sky to the naked eye, i'd also like to state that there was no audible sound associated with it,at least from where our point of reference was. while we were observing the object i had called my brother on the phone to inform him and also decided to try and find a pair of binoculars which i knew i had in the house somewhere. when i was unable to find the binoculars i went back outside, a few minutes or so probably had passed. once back outside i noticed that the positioning of the object now looked different to me, also the light did not seem quite as bright. i continued watching the object but i could now tell that the object was moving back in the direction which it had originally come from {northwesterly}.It just seems awfully odd to me that something could or would sit in one position in the sky without any movement for such an extended length of time, my estimate being close to 30 minutes long!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15938,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.5711209,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03092009-0011","longitude":-72.6466788,"occurred":1236412800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1236412800000,"summary":"Observed

about the comet lulin and where i thought we might see it in order to show his children. from his property on any clear or partly cloudy night , you can observe commercial aircraft coming out of the houston, texas airports headed east toward florida and the east coast. we are familiar with where these planes fly, how fast they move, their lights and general behavior. we can also see the aircraft moving in the commercial lanes going west. the ones going west are farther to the south, about the same altitude, speed, navigation lights, etc as the ones headed east.\r\nwe had been discussing comet lulin for about 4-5 minutes when i noticed the object come into view. it appeared out from behind the trees in the yard, moving at a speed made 5 to 7 times the speed of the jets. it was at a much higher altitude. it appeared as a solid green object, long and thin, with a cross section approximately one fifth to one sixth its length. it left no visible trail and when we had both observed the object for about 6 or 7 seconds together (i had pointed it out to him after i had seen it originally) it simply disappeared, turned off, vanished. my nephew-in-law stated that he had seen this in the past, but was not sure about what to sat or who to report it to. \r\nwe discussed what the possible explanations might be; a satellite that passed into the earth's shadow, the fabled aurora spyplane, or some other high tech government vehicle that is not known to the public.\r\ni have had flight training in both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. i have a very good knowledge of what conventional aircraft can do and the speed of this object was well beyond anything that we can build, that is known to the public.

this description of the object and it's actions.  it's like asking a caveman to describe a helicopter.  i'll do the best i can.  \r\n\r\nhe and the neighbor's wife and two pet dogs had walked across the yard to overlook the creek.  the area is completely wooded, with thick undergrowth, but the yard is up above overlooking seiad creek.  suddenly this \"thing\" appeard, they both saw it, and one of the dogs that also saw it barked at it.  it acted as if it saw them, and immediately slipped into the thick trees and underbrush where my husband and this lady said it was \"impossible!\" to penetrate.  she asked my husband, \"did you see that?\" as if she couldn't believe what she saw.  he confirmed that he had.  now, months later he is still reluctant to talk about.  he simply doesn't know what he saw.\r\n\r\nwhile the details were still in his mind i asked him for a detailed description.  if  you will try to follow....\r\n\r\ni listened to his first description and decided to try to get a picture of it in my mind.  i took three (3) 3\"x5\" card and laid them end to end.  then overlaped the second card about 1/2 inch over the end of the first card and did the same for the third card, overlapping the second card.  then moved the second card up about 1\" above the first card, and moved the third card about 1\" above the second card.  he agreed that this was the shape.  only it was between 15 feet and 20' long and maybe 8 to 10 feet high.  it was thin, metallic looking, a grey-beige (platinum (sp?)color.\r\n\r\nit was flying in a flat position over the creek, undulating, as it flew.  when it seemed to see my husband and neighbor, and seemed to hear the dog bark and immediately turned to the left and went into that thick brush, which my husband said was \"impossible.\"\r\n\r\nmy first thoughts were that it was some kind of recording instrument, that it was collecting information on the creek.  keep in mind, where we live it is a small town (350 people) along the klamath river.  there are approximately 10-15 houses max along the creek for the 5 miles of seiad creek road.  the creek does contain some gold.  there used to be a platinum (got to look up the spelling of that word!) mine up above where the houses are.  this is just a little thread of humans living among \"government property\".  something like 85 percent of land in siskiyou county is in private hands.\r\n\r\ni might as well mention also, that this is \"bigfoot\" area.  some people feel that somehow bigfoot and ufo's are connected.  there are several stories told by \"reliable\" people of ufo's in this area.  i'm one of those people who really, really don't want to see one.  there are some memories that i just do not want on my memory bank, mainly bad vehicle accidents and ufo's.  just thought someone else should know about this.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with
