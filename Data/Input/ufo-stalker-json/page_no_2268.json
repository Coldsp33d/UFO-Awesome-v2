States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was walking my scotty dog after dark at 6:42 and looked up in the sky and saw a large v-shaped grouping of lights, it seemed about 6 or so starlight intensity lights on each side of the leading edges of the wings of the \"v\".  the only thing i can compare it to would be the flying wing bombers of the 50\"s except all i saw were the lights. i first thought it was a jet, but it was too big, flying too slowly, and not making any noise for it to be so big/close to the ground if it was that close. there was no way to scale the object, which makes it somewhat frustrating. i was trying my best to figure out what size the object was as i was watching it in total disbelief.  i held on to a light pole to steady myself as i was looking up at it fly from south to a north/slightly northeast direction. the only speed i could compare it to would be a jet at crusing altitude of 40,000 feet, so it seemed to be flying somewhat slow. at that height its' size would be very small.  i read later about someone in brazil who saw something that she was able to scale with her fingers held 3 to 4 inches apart at arms' distance.  that is how big the object seemed to me. it seemed to be big. the lights were the color of dim starlight, so it wasn't something that would stand out and would be easily overlooked unless you had the fortunate opportunity to look directly in its' direction. if 90 degrees was straight up, i saw it at an angle of about 70 degrees, 20 degrees to the west from straight up. it did have red blinking lights at the ends of the wings, one red light on the wing on the far side of me, and two red blinking lights on the side closest to me. i usually look up at the all the planes flying around the area, and my location being about 6 to 7 miles west of downtown los angeles, there are alot of planes in the sky.  the object crossed the flight path of planes landing at lax coming in from the ocean flying from west to east before they turn over downtown l.A. to fly into the airport. i thought planes flying in the air would have had to of seen it, how could they not unless it was higher than they were.  without anything to scale it to, there was no way of knowing how big or how fast it was going, and this is what is still frustrating to me, that i can't figure something that defies any logical explanation or description. one thing i did make sure to do was to see if the object would block out any stars/starlight that it passed under.  the starlight was not blocked out, even between the lights at the leading edge of the object. i can only assume the lights were on the leading edge of the object, but maybe they were at the bottom of it as it passed from view at about 30 degrees from the horizon.  also deciduous trees were beginning to hide it from view. if it weren't for the trees i would have seen it at it's end as the guy and his girlfriend in the san fernando valley would be beginning to see it at 7 p.M. as they had mentioned in their description. a few minutes prior to 6:42 p.M., a neighbor with his dog was walking away from the objects' direction and i a jogger was also headed away as well. they both passed us and disappeared from view. when i saw it i was totally alone except for the dog who was sniffing a bush, she wouldn't have cared if she saw anyhing anyway.  it was a situation of wanting to shout \"hey come out and look at this!\" but i didn't want to take my eyes off of it for fearing of losing my sight of it.  it seemed somewhat majestic and beautiful slowly flying across the sky, i thought, as i was looking at it.  my nickname for it is also \"battlestar galactica,\" and i have refered to it as that since i saw it. i only today, march 8th,2009, have read the other peoples' descriptions, the people from the san fernando valley (mufon 14894), and the family from long beach, so i am another who can be added to the list and am wondering who else could have seen it, as it flew over an area of millions of people.  i called ktla channel 5 and talked to someone there about as i expected other people who saw it would call in and maybe it would have been mentioned in the 10 o'clock news that night, but it never was talked about. there have to be many others who will hopefully some day read of our shared experience and also write of this fantastic, although unsettling experience. it is something that i think about almost every day when i have some time to myself. hopefully i have remembered most of the pertinent information.  unfortunately i do not have a computer and am using my mothers' computer.  i have left information that will allow those at mufon to contact me, and i would like some day to meet the people in the valley, specifically, as it was unbelieveable that he was describing the direction and time frame of the object as it passed from the south, where i was, to the north, to where they were, within the approximate time frames. thanks, -mark ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

pool.  my two daughters were swimming.  it was completely dark and we had the pool light on in the water.  it was a very clear arizona night. all of a sudden, to our east a bright, pulsing light appeared. there was a streetlight about 25 feet from our location.  the light appeared first above the streetlight and was so much brighter than the streetlight.  my husband and i both noticed it at the same time and pointed it out to our daughters.   it was shaped like an inverted teardrop.  the light was bright and pure.  i have never seen anything like it before or since.  it was pulsing and seemed liquid as it descended at an angle.  it was going quite fast but we watched it for a couple of minutes.  the streetlight pole blocked some of the light as it descended, but it quickly emerged on the other side of the pole. i am horrible at estimating distances, so i won't even try to guess how far away it was from us.  it seemed quite large, bigger than a hot air balloon.  all of a sudden the thing stopped and was still.  then suddenly it just disappeared as if it had never been there.  we lived near luke afb and the small glendale airport.  we had been in our home for 4 years and i know what the jets look and sound like at luke.  we also could see airplanes approaching the phoenix airport and knew what landing lights looked like as planes made turns toward the airport.  this thing was far, far brighter than the any airplane lights we were used to seeing in our area.  i wish i had the words to describe how pure the light was.  it was just a beautiful pulsing white light.  the light was mesmerizing.  my husband and i tried to figure out what it could have been, but stopped once we realized we were upsetting our daughters.  i wasn't afraid of the object, just puzzled as to what it could have been.  the rate of descent, sudden stop and bright pure white light still stands out in my mind even to this day.  the next day i asked several co-workers and neighbors if they had seen anything, but none of them had.  if i ever see another object i will pay attention to the details of the time and date.

through the sky at the southern hemisphere. it wasn't much after that that i noticed another event in wich i saw a white star like object approching the earths atmosphere, as it got closer it started changing colors; first blue; then red; then orange, all of a suddne it broke into three sphere's turning a green and yellow color. all three headed off in diffrent directions, the event itself only lasted about 3 minutes. ever since that i have made a rotuine of watching the night skies just to see how much activity was going on over our heads, and i have to say i am amazed. any way over the years i have noticed that must ufo's when moving through the skies it's like a fish swimming in water they don't just move in a straight line like our aircraft do. i have also learned that most movement is from the south to the north or from the west to the east, and usely when the moon is not out for some reason when the moon is out there is no activity no matter what the moon cycle is. if you remember the year the big earth quake hit in the indian ocean causing the tidal waves that killed hundreds of thousands of people, the very night before it happened the ufo's i was observing changed their habit's. they started strobbing, and i don't mean like we are use to seeing in strobe lights, these seem to grow in intensitiy and as they grew the craft would seem to stop and when the intesity of the strobe would start dereasing it would move on. there was no pattern to the strobbing such as we see in intervals with our strobe lights, the only time i saw this pattern again was when hurricane katrina it in new orleans; and i mean the night before it hit. \"strang\". well anyway i have notice now they seem to get down low now, till this recent sighting i have now had. this ufo was transparent and if you don't have some kind of light reflection or water vapor you can't see them, but they are so low now they are with in our own aircraft flight paths. this really should be looked

this spectacular bright light in the sky right over new jersey, but not too far off the hudson river. at first, we thought it might be a star or venus, but it couldn't have been because it was so close and clearly in our airspace. my friend had a camcorder on hand and proceeded to film the object. we stared out the window for about a half an hour to see if it would move. it looked as though it was staying in one place, but when i returned to the couch, i noticed that it had changed locations and had dropped about 500 feet and north of where i had seen it originally. this is when the filming starts again, and we catch it zipping around in the air. no, the camera was not on a solid surface or a tripod, but we were holding the camera still enough to catch its movements. we then decided to get a better look on the roof of his building. when we arrived on the roof, we noticed directly below the object, a stretch of brilliant light illuminating and hovering over what looked to be cliffside park, or fairview, nj. i've never seen any aircraft light up such a large chunk of land and for such a long period of time. furthermore, there were planes and helicopters flying under, across, and over the object for the entire duration of the sighting. there had to have been at least one pilot that reported this to the faa. after being on the roof for about ten minutes, we noticed an additional ufo that seemed much lower in the sky than the first. it appeared and in about 5 seconds had vanished completely.  after witnessing the second object disappear, we became increasingly concerned. also, the freezing weather was making things worse so we left the roof. by the time we arrived back to the apartment, the bright object was gone, and the brilliant light over nj was no longer present. it's a little hard to describe how we were feeling after the sighting. we were a little freaked out and confused. but, of course we are trying to stay skeptical. aside from being a bit freaked out, it was truly fascinating to have witnessed and up to this point, unexplainable. lastly, i would like to apologize for any profanity on the video. i was just naturally freaking out. \r\n\r\n the entire sighting lasted for about 1 1/2 hours. by approximately 9pm, the bright star-like object was gone... \r\nnote: time displayed on camera is two hours behind. \r\n\r\ni would like a field reporter to contact me.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then

outside to have a cigarette when i had noticed a bright flash to the south east of my friends place, then i noticed a set of bright orange lights moving in a nw direction from where i was. there is a royal australian air force base about 2 hours drive from where i live and at first i thought it was a jet doing a flyover but then the lights changed direction, they turned almost 180 degrees and headed in a south easterly direction from where i had seen them originate. they went right over my friends, who shall remain anonymous, and we both got a good enough look to see that it was a cylindrical object roughly 70-80 metres long and roughly 20 metres wide. we were both confused about what we had seen. later when i was going home i noticed that i had no recollection for 2 hours of the night and whenever i try to remember what happened i only get the image of a giant bird swooping down on me, i still get headaches when i try to recall the night in question. it was my 22nd

in 1971 i was up on cape breton island, nova scotia-sight point area along the coast with my girlfriend's family for the summer.  many stars, the northern lights and milky way are visable up there as it is far from city light pollution.  one night after dark we were outside star gazing etc. and i noticed a very obvious bright metallic looking object moving at amazing speed and in a highly unusual fashion.  it was small, about the size of a big satellite or very bright planet or star but was moving and hovering, making impossible turns.  my girlfriend had seen it right away also and asked me if i saw it too.  i simply said yes.  we continued to watch this object fly around high above us and after about 10 minutes it simply \"took off\" into space at a very high rate of speed and dissapeared.  there was no sound, no little green men, no abduction, etc. but whatever it was it wasn't a plane, helicopter, satellite, star, or weather.(it was a very clear night)\r\n    i've thought about this off and on for years and i've been all over the world, flown many planes, have seen military secret planes like the sr-71, steath planes etc. and this wasn't anything like ours.  what can you say?\r\n    this \"craft\" or whatever it was could make 90 degree turns on a dime and also hover motionless.  it's speed and manuvering was incredible and when it took off and dissapeared the only thing i can think of is star strek when they blast into hyperspace or whatever.  there was no sound.\r\n    didn't know what to think except it isn't anything i've known or seen before or since so i'd say it was an unknown flying object.\r\n    ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

above me was an unmarked, white helicopter hovering above my house with a cameraman inside. i followed the trajectory of the camera's path and saw a glowing orb hovering above the city of tempe, az. it would sit still and then float from side to side. it had no marker lights and was clearly freely floating in the air.\r\n\r\ni watched in amazement for a while and decided to run in and grab my

minutes max and was moving away from our direction, slowly the whole time. look very closely and zoom in on these pics....It goes from being an orb, to what resembles four thrusters firing as it flew away. if you need to get the rest of the pics, send me an email.\r\n\r\ntempe az 2007","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1
