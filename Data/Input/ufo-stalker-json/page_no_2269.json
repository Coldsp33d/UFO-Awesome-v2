and i noticed an orange glowing light approximately 1500-2000 feet high flying, and i know the date was 8-23-08 saturday night at 9:30pm; glowing up straight ahead and moving towards me (northwest)while i was driving towards it (southeast) and there were many cars on the road. i pulled off the side of the road, got out of my car and watched this orange glowing object silently fly dirctly over me and i have to tell you that my eye sight is top of the line and i noticed no other structure aound this thing. it looked like a glowing basketball. orange in the night sky. all the cars kept going by and i just stood off the side of the highway pointing at the object, alone, following its every move which was mostly going in one direction traveling around 30-40 mph is my guess. the only reason i am writing this now is because i am watching the history channel and they are talking about tinley park 8-21-08 which was the thursday, 2 days before my sighting. i called my friend up that was supposed to go out with me and told her i witnessed an eternal flame fly by. \r\n\r\ni do want to express that i am a highly open minded person and i questioned everything about this object to myself. \r\n\r\nthere was no wings, no shape other than a round orange glow, it was silent, it had no shine, no engine, no blinking lights, but it looked liked it had a mild twinkle on occasion, and i was able to see the sky back drop to confirm no wing shape nor any constructed vehicle. \r\n\r\nthis was quite bazaar and i am still extremely puzzled about the other things i have witnessed my whole life that i really never yet to tell anyone. \r\n\r\nthis date is blowing my mind. i witnessed this 08-23-08 2 days after the tinley parks sightings. i can't believe i'm just

august) of 1967.  we were listening to music and talking when all of a sudden, a bright, circular light appeared on the dashboard of the car, like one used at the time in movie theaters.  it could only have come through the rear window, if it was a flashlight.  tit was perfectly round.  there were no lights visible around, none at all.  a broken-down barn was about 1/2 mile behind us and it was totally dark.  we were terribly startled because we thought someone was shining a flashlight in through the back window.  we instantly turned to look back at the rear window and there was no one or nothing there, but upon turning back to the front of the car, the light was still there.  we passed our hands over it and you couldn't see the light on our hands but you could still see it on the dashboard, and it remained there on the dashboard (right next to the radio) for maybe 20 seconds, then it sort of moved to the right and was gone.  that circular light was approximately 3 inches across. there was no sound associated with this.  nothing outside of the car could have been causing this light.    \r\n\r\nwe were really scared and my boyfriend quickly started the car and we raced up the gravel road to the paved county road, about 2 miles away.  we stopped there, shaking, discussing it, asking ourselves, what in the heck was that.  i looked out the passenger window and straight down, next to the road but looking like it was almost attached to the car was a small cloud of brightly colored sparkling lights, moving within the cloud, which looked like smoke, sort of.  you could see through the cloud.  that cloud and lights were maybe the size of basketball, probably a bit smaller. i said right then, it's following us. we tore out of that gravel road, and when we got to my house, in hawk point, mo, the lights hadn't followed us.  we never saw them again.\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend became my husband--we just celebrated our 40th anniversary, and we talk about this every now and then and we were convinced then, as now, that we were being observed.  the cloud of lights followed us, we think. \r\n\r\nafter that, we started hearing about possible ufo sightings in lincoln county, mo, and then there were cattle mutilations reported, also.\r\n\r\ni know it doesn't sound like much, but we were so frightened and then convinced, beyond doubt, that this light was not obeying the laws of physics as we know them.  it was a round light on the dashboard which had no outside source and the lights which were down by the passenger door were unexplainable, too.  we are sure it was something associated with a ufo or an observation.","distance":"20 Feet or

the couch watching tv when all of a sudden a bright light shined through the windows behind the couch and i immediately heard the sound of jet engines but they didn't seem as loud as the normal fighter jets that buzz over from time to time. i could see that the light came from an aircraft in the sky so i jumped up and ran out onto the back deck and witnessed 8 stealth style aircraft flying in two's at approx. 600ft - 800ft going from south to north and following close to one another. they were huge so i'm assuming that they were bombers & not fighters. they were flying so slow that i couldn't believe that they could stay airborne at that speed but they were. it was somewhat windy that night. winds were sw at approx. 15mph. one of the first pair that flew over had its search lights on searching the ground all over which incidentally is the one that shined the light on my location. the next pair that flew over only had their marker lights on as did the next two. one of the last pair to fly over had it's search lights on and was shining it all over the place like they were searching for something. they kept the same speed & altitude until they flew out of sight and they kept searching the ground.\r\n\r\nthe very next day, friday, march 6, at around 5:30pm approx. 6 more stealth aircraft flew over except this time they were flying single at around 25 seconds apart at a very high altitude and were traveling from south to north.\r\n\r\nit may be normal but i thought that it was worth reporting. i witnessed a bunch of black unmarked appache helicopters 'searching' around here a couple of years ago as well as a couple of hueys(spelling?) and no i am not crazy.\r\n\r\nhave a good day and thanks for all that you do\r\nlarry neff\r\npool, w.V.

far the strangest. in the night sky were four sets of lights. these lights were grouped in sets of two, three and four. the lights glowed intensely and would blink on and off in order. the set of four lights were moving south over buckeye toward the desert between i-10 and i-8. these four lights blinked off only once in a hour period of time(when 6 fighter jets from luke went toward them). as the jets reached the lights they went out one by one. they returned about two minutes later when the jets flew off. there were another two sets of three lights over i-10 to the west. these lights were also moving south at an even slower pace. the last lights were a set of two(like i had seen on the first two nights). these lights were due west on the north side of i-10 and moved up and down over the hour. these four sets of lights were all over populated areas. i have heard that flares are dropped for testing over the barry m. goldwater test range, and this is the reason for the sightings in the phoenix area.  the problem with this theory is that none of the lights were even close to the range. also these lights moved together, there was no smoke coming from them, and they held altitude

this report is derived from an article that ran in the november 23, 2008 (sunday) edition of the augusta (ga) chronicle. it appeared in the newspaper���s ���carolina chronicle��� section, delivered to an aiken, sc address. i did not witness this event. i do have a copy of the article.\r\n\r\n     the article is headlined ���look, up in the sky���, with a subhead ���aiken teen shoots photo of meteor���. the article is centered on the section���s front page and consists of a single column of about 8 inches of text to the left of a photo measuring 4 7/8��� by 8 ������.  \r\n\r\n     the lower 1 inch or so of the photograph showed a dark, uneven treeline. in the tan sky, about an inch from the top edge, are two bright orange-white parallel vertical lines, not starkly linear but more ���cursive���. they are both surrounded on their mutual exteriors by a reddish glow. in the photograph they are both 3/8��� long. they are angled from the photographer���s location, slightly to the left for the lower and slightly to the right for the upper. \r\n\r\n     in this area trees can grow very tall. even a cursory glance at this photo indicates a large object(s) in the early evening sky. i have attached a full-sized cropping of the object(s) with this report.\r\n\r\n     the sighting occurred a few miles from the savannah river site, which produced 90% of the radioactive components used in the us���s nuclear weapons arsenal.\r\n\r\n     what follows are excerpts from the augusta chronicle article of 2008-11-23, directly in quotations and summarizations not in quotes. the article is used under the fair use doctrine, 100 words or less:\r\n\r\n     ���aiken ��� about a week ago, an \r\naiken teen witnessed a spectacular \r\nevent ��� an unidentified object blazing \r\ntoward earth.\r\n     thinking he might be seeing the space\r\nshuttle endeavor���s fuel tank burning up\r\nin the atmosphere, a 17-year-old name \r\nwithheld snapped a few pictures as he\r\nstood in the yard of his home.\r\n     ���it was visible for a good while ���\r\n10 minutes or so ��� and finally disappeared\r\noff into the distance,��� the high school senior\r\nsaid in an e-mail. ���i was able to take\r\npictures and sent them to a friend . . .������\r\n\r\n     the friend, highly educated and knowledge-\r\nable of astronomy, ���told {the teen} that the object \r\nin the pictures was most likely a bright meteor; \r\ntypically called a bolide. bolides occur anytime a \r\nlarge meteor hits earth���s atmosphere.\r\n     ���most bolides last only a few seconds��� he\r\nsaid. ���some do last for up to five or six\r\nminutes, but 10 minutes is very rare.������\r\n      he also said ���it was exciting you were able\r\nto see this. it is even more exciting that you were\r\nable to capture it with a camera.���\r\n\r\n     ���the bolide sighting was not the first in\r\nthe aiken area. \r\n     {the astronomer} ���said that about 2 or 3 years \r\nago, almost to the day, there was a sighting.���\r\n     ���i remember it because it was a few days\r\nbefore a meteor shower���, referring to the annual\r\nleonid meteor shower of mid-november.\r\n\r\n     the astronomer said meteor showers generally\r\nare due to very fine-sized comet dust, and usually \r\ndon���t produce the brightest bolides. he speculated\r\nthat a few large comet fragments may be in the orbit \r\nof comet tempel-tuttle.\r\n\r\nend of article. \r\n\r\n     the photo is somewhat similar to 2 photos submitted to mufon about a week ago from great britain. it was case #15454. those photos were labelled by the submitter ���points of light��� and ���bolides���.\r\n\r\n     personally, for this object, or objects, to be as large as they obviously were, and remain airborne for 10 minutes, does not indicate space rocks. if they were part of a meteor, they would have to have hit the atmosphere at exactly the correct angle to 1) partially burn in the atmosphere, as it or they were clearly luminous, and 2) not fall to the surface within a 10 minute time span.\r\n\r\n     i don���t know what it or they were, but i doubt they were space rocks.\r\n\r\nyou can see the entire

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Two of my coworkers, a man and woman probably in their mid-50s, both said they saw a strange aircraft hovering at a low altitude along a state highway between summerville and hawthorn, pennsylvania, around 2:30 p.M. on tuesday, march 3.\r\n\r\n\"bill\" said he was traveling south along state route 28 toward our workplace in new bethlehem and was passing through an open area known as the shannondale flats when he saw what he described as a strange \"plane\" flying low above the highway up ahead which appeared to be either about to crash or land in the open field to his left. based on his estimate of his distance from the craft as it travelled toward him, it was probably about 20 to 30 feet from the edge of the highway and 100 to 200 feet off the ground when it stopped its descent and hovered stationary. bill said the plane stopped dead, \"as if he had a stop sign.\" at that point, bill's truck was nearly adjacent to the object's position alongside the road. his driver's side window was down and he could hear no noise coming from the vehicle.\r\n\r\nbill slowed down but did not stop as he passed the craft, and he watched it in his rearview mirror as it hovered in the same position for several seconds. just before he lost sight of it as he crested the top of a hill, less than a minute later, bill saw the vehicle rotate to its right about 90 degrees, as if on a vertical axis.\r\n\r\nhe was somewhat vague concerning the size, but i get the idea that the thing was about the size of a small- to medium-size airplane. the entire craft was dark gray with no apparent markings. bill stated he didn't see any windows or cockpit, but the vehicle had at least two swept-back wings and two similar appendages that he said looked like they may have been wings also, although he wasn't sure. bill also noted that the vehicle had an odd rear end, \"like it had a spoiler on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"marcy\" was also traveling south along route 28 at around 2:30 p.M. on her way to work, but she was a few miles behind bill. she first spotted the same craft, or one similar to it, sitting stationary in the air low over the town of summerville about a mile off to her left. marcy described the craft as completely gray with \"rounded\" wings and a tail that was \"shaped like a t.\" she said that it's general shape was that of a strange-looking airplane, and it appeared to tilt slowly from side to side as it hovered. she noted that she found the sight \"kind of scary\" and wondered what it was doing there.\r\n\r\nwithin about a minute, marcy lost sight of the craft as she started up a hill. then, when she reached the top of the hill, she again saw the same or a similar craft much closer hovering just a short distance ahead of her car and a ways off the road. i got the impression that the distance from her car to the craft at this point is about the same distance as the beginning of bill's sighting, perhaps a little further away. marcy also noted that she could not hear any sound coming from the vehicle. this view of the craft lasted less than a minute before marcy lost sight of it due to hills and trees.\r\n\r\non thursday i brought in a picture of a couple different harrier jets to work and showed them to both of the witnesses. they said the vehicle they saw didn't look like any kind of fighter plane they had ever seen and that it had no visible engines or propellers.\r\n\r\ni tried to locate pictures online of other vertical-takeoff or hovering planes, but was unable to find anything that matched the witnesses' description. if anyone can find something like that, i would be very interested to find out what this thing was. after talking to these people i have no doubt that they are describing, as best they can, some flying, hovering aircraft they actually saw on their way to work.

can't forget.  it was the last night of a vacation me and some friends from my university took to an island just south of the great barrier reef in queensland.  most of the group was tired from a full day of sight seeing and swimming, but four of us stayed up to watch the sunrise.\r\n\r\nwe were on a large sand island called fraser island just of the eastern coast of queensland.  it was about a half hour before the sun would rise over the water on the horizon, so we decided to wait under the stars.  there was about a half moon so the lighting was dim, not pitch dark.  it was however fairly cloudy, and when the clouds opened up we could see the countless amount of stars behind them.  \r\n\r\nwe were laying back in the sand when my friend adam pointed out an unusually bright star out over the horizon.  we were all running through ideas of what it could be.  we thought it may have been a star glowing through an opening in the clouds, but after looking at it it was clear this light was below the clouds.  it was unusually close to the horizon and we though it may have been a light house, but we were certain there was no land off the island.  we figured that it had to be a plane or a helicopter, but for a couple minutes the light didn't move at all.\r\n\r\nshortly after, the light was gone.  we shrugged it off as strange but a couple minutes later we noticed it was back.  this time it seemed to be a little higher than it was before.  i was pointing out how weird this all was to everyone drawing our attention to it.  then, all of sudden the light moved in a right-up-right motion, similar to pac-man.  \r\n\r\nat this point i started yelling and screaming that this couldn't be a helicopter, there's no way this thing is a plane.  i continued to yell \"what the hell is that!? and pointed at it when we all witnessed the light make two motions at an angle down to just above the surface of the water where the ocean met the horizon.\r\n\r\nas we watched this white circular orb, it seemed to change shape, kind of elongating in a way and changing to a greenish color and then back to white.  we were watching it in shock when it, as i can best describe, projected itself at us.  it was similar to when a light is coming at you from inside a night club or from a distant laser pen.  we could see the light now coming towards us.  this thing was clearly coming straight towards us at an incredible rate.  i had my eyes fixed on it except when it looked like something whizzed past us left to right on the beach.  it then felt like the light that was being projected toward me was going up and down over my eyes as i was staring at it.\r\n\r\nin a matter of seconds, this orb, which was now a dim gray came in quickly, floating just above the water.  it followed the contour of the terrain stay just feet over the water, then the sand, slowing as it approached.\r\n\r\nas i saw it coming in, i was petrified in fear.  i was yelling and pointing \"its coming right up here!\"  as it came in the four us all backpedaled, completely shocked.  this thing made absolutely no sound, but we were all very aware of its presence.  the air seemed to be electrified, as if there was some kind of electrical charge in the air.\r\n\r\n it was about ten feet high, and about 4 feet in diameter.  it looked similar to a disk only flipped up like a tire or a snail shell.  i could clearly see its outline as it approached, but very strangely, i was able to see through it.  the best way i could describe it was as if it were cloaked, similarly to the predator in the film with arnold schwarzenegger.  \r\n\r\nall four of us backed up terrified, stunned, too scared to run.  as we moved back, the object gradually decelerated to a stop right above the sand where we had just been sitting.  i remember asking my friends in a yelling whisper \"what the [cms/tg/pd] is that??\"  i reached for my camera and tried to take a photo of it.  we sat there silently for maybe not even ten seconds, when i could no longer make out its outline.  then, suddenly a very bright pulse of light above us lit up the beach.  i say pulse because it was very quick, unlike a lighting bolt or camera flash, rather it was a quick 'bing' of light that could've been missed if you blinked.  the moment after the flash of light, the energy in the air dropped.\r\n\r\ndisclaimer  **at this point, everything became very strange.  i will tell the rest of what happened that night exactly the way it happened from my perspective.  two of my friends remain skeptical.  to this day i can't forget what happened.**\r\n\r\nas soon as the object was gone, we started asking each other what it was and where the light came from.  before we could even start to come up with answers for each other, we noticed a group of people suddenly standing down the beach from us maybe 100 yards away.  we started asking each other how they could have got there.  they certainly didn't walk past us from the left, the only trail down to the beach was behind us, and to the right down the beach the next campground was 9km away.  either they walked through thorny bushes down from where the resort was or they were there the whole time unnoticed, two very unlikely scenarios.\r\n\r\ni just had the most unexplainable event of my life just take place, so i told my buddies that we can't rule out the possibility that those are aliens.  one of my friends was so scared all he could say was shut up, don't say that [cms/tg/pd].  as we're trying to figure out how the hell these people got down there, my friend matt started walking towards them.  i was hesitant to go with but when he got about half way i decided i had to check this out for myself.\r\n\r\nas we got closer, i could see that there were 8 people facing the horizon.  they were all standing in two lines, shoulder to shoulder, in groups of two .  we stopped about a rocks throw away and yelled hey!  as we did this, the two standing in the front and one directly behind him simultaneously did a 90 degree about face, much like a soldier or robot.  one of them was very tall, and was wearing a black suit, the person in front of him was shorter and very fat in the hips, opposite of an hour glass, and another was very short, maybe two feet tall, about the size of a small child.\r\n\r\n\"who are you? how did you get down here\". i yelled.  no response.  they just stared at us with dark faces.  at this point we were pretty terrified.  we had already seen lights in the sky and invisible orbs, now a strange group of silent people moving like robots was staring at us.  we could not see there faces.  they seemed to be looking down slightly and had shadows over their faces.  keep in mind this is in april in tropical queensland.  we were all in shorts and t's laying in the sand looking at stars.  these people were all fully clothed and standing, staring into a dark horizon with nothing to look at.\r\n\r\ni yelled out again \"where are you from?\"  as i did that another did a 90 degree about face and looked at us.  me and matt jumped and grabbed each other, not knowing who or what we were looking at.  this figure was holding a small blue light towards the ground.  i could best compare it to a digital camera lcd if a small camera display were on.\r\n\r\nwe stood there silently when one of the four that had turned towards us suddenly did an about face back to facing the horizon.  we had had enough.  we started walking back towards our other two friends.  we got back to them and started trying to explain how the people were dressed and that they moved robotically, when we noticed one of them was coming towards us.\r\n\r\ninitially we were pretty alarmed but i remember thinking well there are four of us and one of him.  as he got closer we could see he was no longer coming straight at us but running a path that would cross about 30 feet in front, perpendicular to us.  he was running in very short strides, chopping his feet behind his body very quickly, leaning forward.  as he got exactly perpendicular to us, he slowly moved an open hand left-to-right  in front of his head at about a quarter of the speed he was chopping his feet, as if to waive.\r\n\r\nwe were all shocked.  he seemed to have big gloves on his hands and was wearing a scarf.  my friend matt began chasing after him.  as soon as he got close to him, he did an abrupt 180 and began chopping his feet back to where he came from.  nobody new what just happened.\r\n\r\nmy two friends that had stayed behind said that was it, that was just too weird.  they left the beach and went back to our hostel.  me and matt sat down in the sand trying to figure out what happened.  we waited for the light of the sun to come over the horizon, and when it was bright enough to look around, the people were gone.\r\n\r\nto this day i can't explain what i saw.  whatever came down to us from over the ocean was nothing spiritual, it was not a hallucination, all four of us saw it.  what i will say with one hundred percent confidence is that what i witnessed was some kind of advanced technology.  as far as the figures that showed up, i really don't know.  but if anyone who reads this testimony has had anything similar happen, or can provide any answers i am open to speaking with you.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15879,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-26.4462186,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-03062009-0012","longitude":153.0883543,"occurred":1209279600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Queensland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1209279600000,"summary":"4

it snowed. so i���ve been out every evening with binoculars looking for ufo���s or whatever they are. so five days have pasted and i have not saw anything else. on the sixth day after my first sightings it is thursday night, march 5th , 2009. i have 3 sighting that were note worthy. these objects were not at all like the objects in my first sightings on feb. 27th, 2009.\r\n(1)\tmarch 5th, 2009 in the evening about 8:05 i spotted 2 odd bright white lights close together above the mountain range nne of down town salt lake city. i didn���t recall ever seeing any lights here before so i watched them. about 8:15pm an airplane flew near these 2 lights and over the mountain range, so i decided to watch the plane. the airplane was flying across the valley from the east and heading west. because of this i spotted an object with my 10x50 binoculars while i was watching this  jet fly over the valley from east to west. the object i spotted was coming from the north west and heading south east ward and just a little lower than the airplane. the object was a small dim light with a slight amber color to it. it flew close and under the airplane and then arced up and stopped at about the height that the airplane was. it stay at that spot for about 3 seconds. then the object moved north a very short distance before stopping again. during this very short movement towards the north i could see 2 circles of lights on the bottom with one light in the center. the lights were white in color, one circle of lights with a smaller circle of lights inside that circle and inside the inner circle was the light in the center.(the object was mainly visibly clear with my binoculars and too far away to bother with photographing it.) the object was fairly high up and hard to get any real detail once it stopped and hovered. at this time i could only see that it had a cluster of lights on the bottom of it. it hovered there for 20 minutes before it flew north and disappeared at about 8:35pm. while i was watching this object, at times i would put the binocular down and give my arms a rest. it was during these periods of resting that i would check out the 2 lights that were close together but never moved. (this sighting is pictured in the northern west area of the map picture with the white line showing its flight path. in the ���v��� of this line is where it hovered for about 20 minutes.) i am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where west valley city is on the map.\r\n\r\n(2)\tthe other object that i first saw (8:05pm) was the two odd bright white lights that were side by side and a little above the mountains (nne of salt lake city). i had not ever seen anything bright there before and this was about 8:05pm when i first became aware of this. i felt that it didn���t belong there. i watched it off and on with the binoculars, it never moved at all.  it was during this that i saw an airplane flying near these 2 lights and decided to watch it fly across the valley and if not for this i would have not saw the sighting i first described. during about a 4 minute period of time  while i was watching it, to my surprise, it took off and headed west and then sharply turned north. it didn���t appear to bank at all during this turn. shortly after i saw it moving north i could see other lights on it and after a short distance a few of the lights  began blinking. soon it was out of my view. ( 8:20pm) the lights were mostly white and one red light. it flew away at a normal speed similar to a regular aircraft? it was at a good distance and i didn���t bother with trying photograph it. it would have only been another unknown light with no way to identify it. (on the map picture of salt lake city in the area nne on the edge of the mountain range is a red line that goes northward. the start of this red line nne of salt lake city is where it hovered for several minutes before flying north ward) i am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where west valley city is on the map.\r\n\r\n(3)\t later near where i spotted had saw the 2 odd bright lights hovering above the mountain range nne of salt lake city, but north of this area. i panned across this area with my binoculars and i saw a multiple colored light darting back and forth, up and down at times. it mainly zig zagging up and down in ���z��� pattern laid on its side! it moved in this jerky fashion as it traveled south ward across and near the mountain tops. at times it was higher than the snow topped mountains under it and other times it was lower than the tops of the mountain. the multiple colored light was only visible with my binoculars. the colors were white, green, red and blue, i didn���t see any of the lights blinking. at times the colors were very sharp and vivid. it kind of reminded me of a buttery fluttering about. (9:40 pm) the sighting was about a ��� a minute in duration. i don���t understand why anything would be so erratic in flight. (on the map picture is a squiggle greenish line just north of where the red line starts. this is about where it was sighted moving south ward.) i am viewing this sighting just south of the red dot marking where west valley city is on the map.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":15878,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7002032,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03062009-0011","longitude":-111.9951401,"occurred":1236312300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1236312300000,"summary":"Objects hovering for 15 to 20 minutes and one moving in zig zagging very erratic.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/15878_submitter_file1__SaltLakeMapofUFOsightsMarch6th2009.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"West Valley City, Utah","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:255477"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Kansas City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I saw it briefly. i wasn't near the object, but i was on a high point in kc and could see at least 30 miles in the direction of kci, and i, too, saw this anomaly. i would estimate the brightness of this object to be 3x that of venus. i was a passenger in a car, so i couldn't stop and observe this. at 30 miles away, it was on the horizon, and if it was near kci, it had to be at a decent height. i estimated it was south of kci, but without time to study it, i can't verify that estimate. it almost looked like a 'bar' of lights from my locale. i also would like to see the videotape just to verify this is what i also saw. it was near 9 pm, cst. i was near arrowhead and the k stadiums. it was at 10-11 o'clock from my position. and i also agree this was not a conventional airplane/helicopter. the light was only 10 degrees above the horizon when i saw it, which is why i didn't ask to stop and observe this longer than i did. i assumed it was a helicopter with special lights....But if this thing was near kci, i don't understand what it was. kci is about 30 miles from my location. these distances, and heights (degrees above horizon) i can verify. and i also can verify this was not venus. it's at the 8-9 o'clock position at this point in time. submit the video, please!

bay door sitting on the forklift having a smoke.  i saw something leaving a vapor trail in the distance so i focus on this object which i determined to be a military jet by its shape and speed, it was going extremely fast west to east.  i was about halfway through my smoke so i continued and i saw another of the same aircraft on a slightly more southern trajectory same speed and vapor trial. \r\n  i am for whatever reason more observant than most of the skies (i work in aerospace and find aircraft interesting) so i know what level and style of activity to expect in this area of sky.  what i saw was odd so the southwest portion of sky had my full attention at this point, that is when i saw a white orb drop down from about 45 degrees above horizon and move in a parabolic curve in proportion to the letter 'j' and disappear, this appearace lasted about 20 seconds.  about 10 seconds later i saw the same exact thing happen, orb appeared did a j move and vanished.  the coloring was eggshell white, i can't say that it was glowing because it was a clear sunny sky but it was not reflective either, just white with some texture or faint shadowing. about a minute later 3 more jets were scrambled followed by a transport helicopter (double rotor) all west to east.  i had to go back to work but i kept my eye on the sky the rest of the day and assorted military helicopters and insersecting vapor streaks in the sky, lastly black helicopters maybe 2 patroling near and far.  at 11:30am a c130 was observed on a more north eastern path.  \r\n  it was an odd thing for me, as much as i was looking up during this time, to not see any commercial aircraft.  the first commercial flight i saw starting at 10:45am was not until 1:30pm.  this sighting took place between the john wayne airport and the naval weapons station, closer to the station.  the only sounds i heard were from the choppers.  only other thing i can think to say is about myself.  i have perfect eyesight, never had to go to an optomatrist.  i know i did not see a seagull or balloon or other common object.  father was in the military and worked aerospace (pan-am, sperry, honeywell).  i am now in the aerospace industry, point being i'm above average in aircraft awareness.  i have no evidence photographic or otherwise. so hopefully you can pull up radar stats or something from one of the nearby facilities or at least tell me someone else saw some of that activity. please contact me via email, if you are interested i am willing to give you a call for phone interview.  thanks for

project in the driveway until dusk and wanted my wife to take me for a quick drive around our neighborhood to see a house in the west part of our subdivision. as we drove around the block i noticed a bright light with glow above in sky and figured right off it was airplane but after 30 seconds or so noticed it was not moving at all. the airport was in general direction however after several minutes it was noticed that the light did not move , blink or display characteristics of an airplane due to the length of time it was stationary.  i had a number of minutes to grab my video camera and took over 14 minutes of footage.  i made call to friend who lives about 10 miles west of me directly to look out back of his home and he immediately noticed the bright light above. he was a pilot in the army and had several years experience flying helicopters. he was clearly moved by what he was seeing and could not find a legitimate explanation as to the light.  i would not be suprised if several people and pilots flying into to kci did not clearly notice this in the sky.  it was clearly in out atmosphere and not a planet, star, comet, or satellite.  it just stuck around for a long time and glowed in the sky. during filming , in the view i had a few airplanes come into same view screen as to clearly distinguish this was not a plane as the ones flying across the screen were clearly airplanes.  after several minutes i stopped filming as i started to second guess that this was \"supposed\" to be there like a bright star or something.  then as i talked with other neighbors i continued to glance at the object and noticed it seemed to get lower in the horizon and fainter until it over about 2 minutes just faded out heading west.  the weird thing is that if it was a star or planet or plane it just sat stationary in the sky for almost an hour before disappearing. \r\ni have video of the event but currently my camera battery is down. will be glad to share it or upload at another time. approx 14 mins of footage.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
