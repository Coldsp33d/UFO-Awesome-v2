i think.  i was basically in the middle of nowhere.  there were no other cars around or any houses or lights that i could see - everything was basically pitch black.  then in the distance, i saw 3 lights in a triangle shape hovering in the dark somewhat low over the road - lower than what you would expect an aircraft or something of that nature to hover.  it was dark so i couldn't see any point of reference but i imagine it was maybe at the height of a tall tree line or just above that.  they were white, round-shaped lights that reminded me of parking lot lamps. i couldn't see what they were attached to but they were all level like they were attached to the underside of some flat object.  the lights themselves seemed maybe basketball sized and the total size of the shape seemed like it would've been the size of a pickup truck, maybe a little bigger.  i thought maybe it was a helicopter  but as i got closer, it just didn't look like that.  it didn't have blinking lights like planes normally do and it didn't appear to be moving at all and it made no noise that i could hear.  as i got closer, i could see that the lights did, in fact, look like they were attached to something. i got nervous because i was about to pass underneath it and couldn't tell what it was, so i called a friend and told them what i was seeing but they had no idea what it was either.  i ended up just driving underneath/past it and that was it.  i saw it in my review mirror for a bit too.  in total, i probably saw it for a couple minutes.  it was too dark to see trees or power lines or to tell what else the lights could be attached to.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

looking up.  it's been cloudy for awhile.  haven't been able to see blue or anything in the sky lately other than overcast.  the sky was remarkably clear for a change.  approximately less than 10 clouds.  which is why it was easy to notice a bright dot come out of a cloud to the southwest and proceed west-southwest.  the cloud soon dissipated when it left.  very starlike.  small.  i'll add i was wearing sunglasses.  without them, the sky washed the orb out visually since i'm photo-sensitive.  i paused, went oh hell no... went inside and grabbed my camera, hoping to catch it on camera but it was gone.  i always look up.  that's another story.  \r\n\r\nthen, i saw another reflective high altitude orb approaching from the west, traveling east through the sun's path.  for the record, i use the word orb, just because stars are stars.  but this was too high to be anything but having the appearance of a distant daytime star.. to end the confusion.  i moved my position to block out the sun and starting recording.  for some reason, i remember learning that a long time ago when recording ufos.  barely block out the sun.  i was facing west, in front of my apartment.  there's an overhang for the garage i used to block and started recording. \r\n\r\nthese aren't the little specs of light that dance around when looking at clear sky, or the other artifacts high in the air that reflect the sunlight, ice, etc... or even birds... i'll admit, they're all on the video.  but... why i recorded...  and if you pay attention, is because of the 20+ daytime star orbs that were high altitude and going in a straight line and/or changing direction.  \r\n\r\nthe further away from my vantage, away from the sun, they got... eventually they faded into the blue of the sky.  my knowledge tells me that the sun's reflection was too much for whatever cloaking tech was used, and eventually the further they got, they were able to once again disappear within the blue. \r\n\r\ni have the cell videos, taken on an iphone 7 plus.   it's still on the iphone.  i took screenshots from the video. they are way too fast to be a plane.  i've slowed it down to 25% in imovie.  it's a lot more impressive.  personally, air traffic control has nothing on how busy it is up there if you know where to look. \r\n\r\nimages were screenshots from my iphone 7... screenshots taken on the iphone 7.  then simply circled in paintbrush for mac.  i have a digital forensics background, hence my explanations, and trying to be specific as possible.  i am not a digital forensic image specialist.  i deal with straight e-discovery litigation type support.  i just understand forensic integrity.\r\n\r\ni know what's going on in general and moreso.   i'd work for you if i could.  but due to a recent personal evolution per say, i'm just here because i decided to share some images.  no more no less.   \r\n\r\nwe're in the mayan age of heart.  no longer time to dance around the issue.  i'll share

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This happened in 2001 when i was 21 years old. it happened at my mothers home in the country west of longmont, south of lyons and north of boulder. i was living with my mother at the time and she was not home when this event occurred. no one else lived there and as far as i know no one else witnessed this. i had come home around 3:30 or so and was planning to go back to town (longmont) that night to see some friends. this event started at dusk which was around 4:30-5:00pm. it was a mild winter night. no snow even on the ground and very clear as far as clouds. i took a shower around 4:30 and when i was in the shower i could hear the dog barking. usually this was a normal occurrence because of cows and such. but this bark sounded different and i was worried a cougar or even a bear might be outside. i looked out the window and could see the dog barking facing the field but i could not see anything from inside. i went out into the front room and all my moms cats were meowing and acting \"frantic\" i knew at this point there had to be an animal out side. it was still light out although the sun had just set. i went outside to were our dog was along the fence to the field. about a quarter mile east out in the field was a swampy small forested area that is full of cattails and trees. down within the trees there was an extremely bright white light emanating from the ground and few (4-5) small red lights floating above the white light. they moving like a fire fly might move but only above the white light. the dog was fixed right on the light. i stood the watching for about 5 minutes or so. as i did more and more red lights appeared until there was about a dozen or so. there also began moving faster and more vigorously. i started to get nervous and at this point i decided that i was going to have to drive down there and see what was going on, although i was reluctant to do so. i went into the house and called a good friend and my girlfriend (now wife) and told them both what i had saw and that i was going to investigate. i told them if i didn't call them back in half an hour that something had happed to me. when i went back outside the light was gone and the dog had stopped barking. i got in my car and parked at the gate into the field that was generally in line with the area i had saw the light. i then proceeded to flash my headlamps on/off and bright/dim. i did this for a few minutes. nothing happened so i stopped. for about 5-7 minutes i just sat there looking at the sky for anything strange. i had time to smoke a cigarette with nothing happening. by this time it was relatively dark. to my left was a row of trees that grew along a irrigation ditch it went east for bout 150-200 ft and then cut south for 40-50 ft and then back east for hundreds of feet. i first saw some lights behind the trees to my west heading east following the row of trees. it was just on the other side. the lights were white and yellow. at first i that it was a small airplane because to the east you can see vance brand airport in longmont and it is very common the see planes taking this route to the airport. however, once it reached the area where the trees cut south, it turned south and rose above the tree line. it was a disc roughly 30-40 long and roughly 15-20 ft tall. it had alternating white and yellow lights rotating from left to right(from my view) it was dark so i could not see the color of the rest of the craft. it had a small dome on top roughly 8-10 feet tall. there were backlit \"windows\" on the dome with \"object's\" shadows visible. the disc just hovered stationary directly over the tree tops. i rubbed my eyes not believing this could be possible. i have never seen anything move like this before and it did not seem real. after i would say 20-30 seconds i decided to flash my headlamps at it. when i did, instantly all the lights turned a deep red, stopped rotating and emitted beams that focused on my car. i immediately threw the car into reverse, flipped around and took off up the driveway. the driveway is uphill and runs west to east (i was heading west) it is about a little over a thousand feet to the road. i stopped at the top just above the cattle corral once i realized it was not following me. i parked with my car facing east. you can not see out into the field or my moms house from here because there is another row of trees following another ditch running north to south just on the west side of my mothers house. although i could not see the field or the house i could see white-ish light lighting up the trees from below. i decided to flash my headlamps at the general direction again (don't ask we why) and i believed i saw the emitted light move so i took off out down the road heading north. i have family living very close to me. two of my uncles live just down the road to the north on adjacent properties. i stopped at the closest uncles house just to the north of us and knocked on his door. no one was home. i then went to the other uncles house and no one answers when i knocked on the door there either. i decided to drive down the roads that go around our property to see if i could see anything. i drove the whole distance and saw nothing. when i got back to the top of my moms driveway my girlfriend and her cousin were just coming back up from my mom's house. neither had seen anything. this was the end of it and i did not sleep there for over a week.

mcnary dam on the columbia river and the hanford nuclear reservation. (my father worked there for 23yrs.). the media reported the object as a \"weather baloon\". my dad had other ideas having observed \"foo fighters\" while serving in the navy. he took me along, (i was 3yrs of age), to a wheet field approx. a mile away. he observed the object through binoculars and then handed them to me. he told me that i was looking at a foo fighter. what i saw was a disk shaped object above the top of that point. i was so excited that when we returnd home, he poured me a 1/2 shot of bourbon to calm me down. (@nd & 3rd observation to follow...) 2nd sighting: age 11. while smoking a cigarette, i observed five objects in a diamond pattern, leaving the nuclear reservation, they headed east and north and slowly moved upward, coming togather as a single object headed towards the north star. 3rd sighting: approx. 9:oopm. while sitting in a cell at high desert prison in nov, 18th 1995, i observed a singular object extremely bright yet cast no shaddow moving across the prison yard at an altatude of 200'. it dissapeared over the hill lying before me, approx a month later, cattle mutalations were reported to me having occured at that date.        another interesting fact that relates to all of this::: when i was about 12 or 13, my uncle had aquired a film from a man who he knew that worked for burlington northern rr. my uncle was very addament in my father viewing the film. the contents of that film are as follows. (i had kinda snuck down to the basement to watch... they did'nt know i was present.) the film turned out to be a dod film documenting the us's nuclear weapons test, from trinity to the hydrogen above ground test at bikini. the last 45sec. of the film were the most interesting; a runway at a desert area, with a jet of the korean era parked facing a disk-shaped object. two half-tracks and two tanks were on either side of the runway. standing in front of three small aliens, (what have become known as 'greys', were two armed soldiers and president eisenhower who had an object that appeared to be rolled up papers, and he was handing those to the three aliens. if you connect all the dots; it appears to be documented footage of the treaty between the aliens' and the u.S.. hmmm...","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"N/A","formattedAddress":null,"id":83949,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.21916536143106,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05242017-0010","longitude":-119.1430466201617,"occurred":-428803200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1495634200000,"summary":"Hovering approx. 50' above highest point. sport model.","tags":["hovering"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1495648939921,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":{"dailySummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":24,"meantempi":76,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":16,"mintempi":61,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}],"dailysummary":[{"snowfallMillimeters":0,"fog":false,"hail":false,"maxtempm":32,"maxtempi":90,"maxvism":null,"maxvisi":null,"meantempm":24,"meantempi":76,"meanvism":null,"meanvisi":null,"mintempm":16,"mintempi":61,"minvism":null,"minvisi":null,"rain":false,"snow":false,"snowfalli":0,"snowfallm":0,"thunder":false,"tornado":false}]}},"zipcode":"97***","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":22273,"locationName":"Kennewick, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:12995"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less, Unknown","city":"San Antonio","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This was the a most strange, bizarre, and quite frankly, scary moment. one of the san antonio spurs coaches grabbed something from his birefcase and tossed it inconspicuously into the air. i took a picture of it flying; it was a strange peculiar looking transformer/bird (have kno idea please watch the videos i sent.)\r\n\r\nthis could be the most strangest ever posted. it was so bizarre and surreal, it's hard to explain. there was a conspiratorial discussion between the coaches at the far right of the spurs bench prior to the incident. very incredible and weird experience. \r\n\r\ni sent the videos to several sports/ news org's, tweets, posts.. i'll try here as well until i get an answer. much thanks!
