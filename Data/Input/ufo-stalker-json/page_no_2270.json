reports. well, i beleive it was november. there was'nt any snow in a little while, which gave me a clue to what time it was. it was definitly 2008. honestly, i don't remember what the day was, because i don't keep track of that. i was really angry at myself because of it. me, my younger sister and my mother were getting out of our toyota bennet camry. i think we came back maybe from my uncle's house, not entirely sure. i was on my front porch and i was looking at the night sky admiring it's beauty. i looked at the moon, and then i saw the constellation orion, i saw his belt, his legs and feet, and his body, and i believe i may have seen his head. i then noticed a star. this star was slightly larger than the others. maybe in finger comparison, less than a milla inch. except, what caught my attention was that..... it was moving. i began staring at in awe. i thought to myself, \"what is that... is it a...\" i thought it was a meteor at first. but from my knowledge, meteors aren't blue. then i noticed that it sortove left a white sortove misty trail behind. it wasn't completely covering the portion of space. i could lightly see black behind it. then i began to believe it was a ufo. my mother veiwed the object also. i only remember her saying, \"it does'nt seem like an airplace...\" she does'nt believe in extra terrestrials. i do though. i've believed all my live. i believe my sister was there, but she keep's saying she does'nt remember. i don't remember her saying anything about the object. i then went inside and began veiwing it with my 10 by 8 binoculars. i noticed no features on it. no lines or arks. then, it began moving in a backward direction. when it went over the mist, the mist began to dissappear. i began watching discovery channel, ( i don't remember what was on)mighte have been mythbusters, then after 1 episode was completed, i looked outside again, and the object was gone. i looked b=for it for about 7 minutes. after the expirenence i began having nightmares about seeing aliens, ufo's, being attacked by white beams of light, and skinny, tall being's with long fingers touching my forhead. i asked my mother if i could take a picture of the object with her t mobile razor phone. she refused. thank you for letting people be able to share their expirences with you. please believe me on this one. i have no mental or phyisical poblems. i'm not insane. to be honest, i still attend a middle school. i have nothing to gain by posting this.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

the first day of school, which should be monday, the 4th of september, 1972. time is estimated to be around 8 to 9am.  sky is clear, weather appears to be comfortable, no evidence of wind in the picture, sun is rising from the east, causing long morning shadows.  mothers are seen talking amongst themselves and with teachers, their kids are lined up waiting to enter the school.  located at the center top of the photograph, right above a tree, appears to be a silver, saturn shaped ufo, banking either asending towards the left, or decending toward the right.  this is based on optical features (shadows?) shown on the ufo.  i am no optical expert, however it does seem to be evident from normal viewing that one branch from the top of the tree is showing to be blocking the view of the lower left rim of the ufo.  if this is the case, this object would be truly quite large.  nobody in the schoolyard appears to notice or hear the object, however, considering the social environment, this may be understandable.  i don������t know what kind of camara was used, but it surly was not digital.  this object does not look like the moon in any circumstance imo.  what is needed is some serious optical analysis to rule out traditional ifos.  remember, this is 1972.  there were no commercially available aluminum helium balloons for kids at the time.  nearest airports are la guardia airport, located about 12 miles to the wnw of new hyde park and jfk, located about 10 miles to the sw.  this area of nassau county is a high air traffic area.  i doubt official weather balloons would be released under such air traffic conditions.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

and i took the trip...Noticed a strange cloud all by itself  unlike a storm cloud  this one came overhead and parked itself right over the battery park...Heh...It was huge  easily larger than downtown charleston proper...It wouldnt be all that unusual to see a rain type cloud over us, really but it was  a beautiful sunny afternoon,  no clouds   pretty clear.  i watch the air traffic around here and it seems pretty normal and patterned.  i was in the military during the gulfwar  and worked with many aircraft.   its a fascination!  my son shares the same fascination ...So you can imagine our surprise...We said nothing to each other about it really.  on the way back from downtown,  we drove up the connector,  and i asked my friend  and my son if the weird cloud is still there, as i was merging and couldnt take my eyes of my mirrors...Driving safe ya know!   i got situated and looked up to see...  well...Its  now kinda obvious from this angle thats  there is something in that dark smokey gray cloud,  it appears to have a saucer with a rather huge chrome frontend.Very thick  maybe 200 feet  thick  tall and a square half mile in diameter..But the cloud seems to be drafting and produced a rolling smoky front edge...Weird kinda gave away its \"cloak\" we all were totally glued to it...I had to pull over.    i couldnt,  traffic was mad that day...We went home...We dont talk about it,  but i know we are being visited...It could be one of ours...Or....","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15833,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7788756,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03042009-0008","longitude":-79.9210616,"occurred":1231574400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"South

out an object in the sky taken with cheap (iphone) technology. i wanted to know why these ufo photos are always so grainy and suspect. and thought,  if you practiced shooting planes and helicopters with decent equipment, you should get a pretty good picture.    as i stepped out of my work place that day, i saw a copter hovering above the expressway and decided to test my idea. 2 days later while watching ufo hunters i remembered the photos. to my surprise i had captured these other objects.  one directly above the copter, the other to the left at about 11:00. i took 2 shots one after the other.   i thought it might be a bird at first, but it should be smaller than the copter.  or a plane taken at an angle, that distorted its characteristics, could be!  22 years in the navy and 5 aircraft carriers, i think i should be able to tell the difference.  so what do you guys think.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15832,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.954495,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03042009-0007","longitude":-75.162449,"occurred":1235697600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

started to get closer i couldn���t hear it. now i���m confused. here is this massive airplane flying over my apartment complex and it���s completely quiet. at that point i had called for my fianc��� to come take a look at this. as it got closer you could clearly see 5 white lights and one lonesome red one. it was eerie��� this object with five lights just slowly moved across the sky until it eventually faded out completely. my camera didn���t catch all of the detail i was hoping it might; my camera isn���t the best camera. this object was huge; it was the size of the apartment building i live in (if not bigger). i am thankful that i had enough sense to grab my video camera before the craft disappeared. the duration of this event only lasted about a couple minutes; i caught the first 48 second on film.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line
