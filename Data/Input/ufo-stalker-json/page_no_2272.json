without moonligh. as i drove along i saw three small triangles in a vertical line. i assumed that they were silver-white reflectors on a large truck on an overpass. the went east to west and disappeared. i assumed they went behing a freeway sign. i didn't think much of it and then a few minutes latter i saw the same thing. they to were going east to west.  but as they passed to my right the went up at a 45 degree angle and vanished. my reaction was, what the hell. when i got to where the vanished i looked to my right and saw three bright lights about the size of the full moon they were equadistant from each other and horizontal. the two outside lights were blue green and the center one was orange red.\r\n\r\ni don't know what my reaction was, maybe shock. i was driving at 70 miles an hour and had to look back to the road. several seconds later i figured i  should take a \"mental photograph\" of the light and look again to my right. the were still in the exact same position. i was covering 102 feet per second and the lights stayed even with my car. the were almost straight of to the right. since there were no points of reference i have no true idea of how far away the lights were but i feel it was less than 100 yards. this really freaked my out and i turned back to my driving and put it out of my mind, i did not look to the right again. i had three cameras with me and i could have stopped for a picture, but i wanted nothing to do with what ever was behind those lights. that's my story and i am sticking to it. i might point out i drive this road three to four times a year for the past 27 years and have never seen anything like it before. i have no idea what it was and don't want to see it again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":15795,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.142938,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03022009-0014","longitude":-120.3519596,"occurred":1235714400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,

from. a small brouse on my left arm like i had given blood,but i have not it turned from a purple to a yellow center over night and has now nearly vanished. and a small purple brouse on the inside of my thigh right leg just above my knee there dose appear to be two tiny puncture marks inside the brouse. i have no knowledge of where they came from.  bar.  ps for the last 4-6 weeks there has been an increase in small aircraft activity and helos as well. also this area dose have a military fly over route but not regularly. and you can tell when an aircraft flies over ever the commercial ones.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

group of boys were in a camp site about 75 yards from where i was,near a small lake on the property.I was in clear view of the nighttime sky panoramically from the north to the east and to the south.The western sky was behind me,and was obscured by the woods,where the boys and their counselors slept.My job was nighttime \"security\".Around 2 a.M., i noticed a blinking light.I didnt think much about it.Thought it was a plane in and out of douglas int'l in charlotte.This traffic was always obvious.Some 10-15 minutes later,i noticed that this blinking whitish light was still there,same place---had not moved---so...I began to watch it.Some 20 minutes later,this blinking light still hadnt moved.So i started timing the interval between flashes with my watch.Every 19 seconds it would blink on and take about 1 or 2 seconds to dim to black.This went on for a good 25 minutes more,and then it started to move,from its sse position to my right.Very slowly,it took some 15 more minutes to cross the distance of my fist,held up to the sky for reference in my line of sight,now directly due east in front of me,from one star to another,and i totally forgot to note which constellations it was in,near or moving across during its movement.Then as it was moving,still taking 19 second sequences,it stopped.Did not see it any more,saw nothing else of any interest for the rest of the night. now, i know what planes look like in the night sky,they must move,even helos dont do this,and there was no noise at any time during the event.I also know the difference between satelites that seemingly tumble across the sky catching light as it goes or turning into shadow as they move along.I am a navy veteran,and a trained observer,after working as a correctional officer,and security work,(of which i recently reported another incident involving \"golden lights turning to red and zipping off\"in front of my position.)again im not saying it was anything but a light that demonstrated some different manuevers than i'm used to seeing.I felt a little \"uneasy\" almost \"scared\" as i watched this this light do all but nothing much but do its wierd little motion,or lack there of......

direction of the object.\r\n\r\nhttp://maps.Google.Com/maps/ms?Hl=en&ie=utf8&msa=0&ll=39.008847,-95.241079&spn=0.01574,0.038624&t=h&z=15&msid=101526258472004611186.000464081a7d019651ef6\r\n\r\nfirst off i want to disclose that i follow ufo news closely.  i've read about what to do during a sighting.  ufos were even faintly in my mind as i surveyed the skies, mainly because venus was so apparent.  having experienced this, i think my awareness of the ufo topic may have been entirely responsible for the experience, in that i was actually searching the skies somewhat purposefully, and that i feel obligated to fill out a report over an experience that an uninterested person would probably just shrug off.  i almost shrugged it off myself, but part of me knows i simply saw what i saw and should take logical action.\r\n\r\ni was out for a walk along a walking path that runs on top of a dike, on the north side of the lawrence river.\r\n\r\nthe sun had been sinking below the horizon and the stars were coming out faintly.  what i suppose is venus was shining very brightly near a crescent moon.  i noticed a faint light with no blinking heading from south to north at a steady rate.  i thought this was strange, but could be a satellite (for all i know).  it faded quickly from sight, but i kept watching the skies as i walked back near my vehicle.\r\n\r\na few minutes passed.  i was scanning the skies and suddenly noticed a fairly dim star rising straight up.  this continued for around 7 seconds until it slowed and stopped.  it was brightest when i first saw it, and as it rose it got dimmer and dimmer.  where it stopped, it was nearly too dim to see.  i would have never noticed it without seeing it proceed there from a lower altitude.\r\n\r\ni understand it may not make much sense that i saw the object as rising straight up rather than going a cardinal direction, but this was my perception.  the changes in brightness may have been what gave me such a sense of its movement.\r\n\r\nthere were two other stars of similar brightness (that is to say, not very bright) to the left and to the right of my first sighting of the object.  they served as a reference point.\r\n\r\nwhen i saw it, i thought that it had been sitting stationary between these two stars, but i can't say that for certain.  i certainly felt at the time that i was seeing a star suddenly move up a distance and then stop, but i realize now that may have been a false impression.  it could have been going up continually and i only noticed it when it passed between these two other stars.\r\n\r\nthe overall impression i got was this was an object that appeared like a star, but was actually hovering motionless in our atmosphere, surprisingly so.  when it moved i realized that it was close (relatively), not a star at all. it was still too far off to see anything more than a dim light similar to a star.\r\n\r\ni counted hand-widths to various points (i was standing on a dike, which is elevated above the ground twenty feet or so):\r\n\r\nthe two other stars, and the point where i first noticed the object were 5 hand widths up.  the object traveled a full hand width up to 6 hand widths.\r\n\r\nyou can see on my map that i was looking in a north easterly direction.\r\n\r\nthe point on the map where i was standing is exactly where i was standing.  i made note that i was next to a sign which is at the end of a lay of rocks along the side of the dike (visible on google maps).  i also made note that the object was roughly in line with the lights from some buildings on the ground, which i also marked on the map.  \r\n\r\nthe speed was very constant, like that of an airplane, but this was no airplane.  imagine a model airplane hanging on a string above you.  suddenly it is pulled straight up by the string for a distance and then stops, almost like an adjustment of height.\r\n\r\npart of me wonders if it was actually traveling at a very high rate of speed.  it seemed to be traveling across the sky at about the same speed as jetliners appears to, but is was a faint point of light, suggesting it was much farther away, and consequently traveling much faster than a jetliner.    of course it could have been a tiny object than a jetliner and been much closer.  these are just thoughts.\r\n\r\ni know the time was within a few minutes of 7 o'clock.\r\n\r\nthe object remained very faintly visible, and easy to lose sight of.  it was bitterly cold out, so i drove away.\r\n\r\nmy feelings were pretty steady, that is surprised but not overly emotional.  i have looked at ufo evidence quite a lot, and though i don't have any concrete views, i would not be incredibly surprised to see most anything.\r\n\r\ni've been looking at the skies a quite a lot for a few years and this is the only odd thing i've ever seen, though i did see a green fire ball briefly once, i assumed it was a meteorite.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:07","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15777,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.9733389,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03012009-0001","longitude":-95.2292901,"occurred":1235808000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1235808000000,"summary":"[cms/tg]

pm. it had  3 very dim lights on the bottom?  the lights were in a triangle pattern moving very fast, silent and nnw direction. it appeared to be bending light around it? it was like it was invisible, like you could see though it in a way, except for the lights on it. the lights didn���t blink at all and were white in color with a very slight gray yellow tint, and was very dim and hard to see. very stealthily, no sound at all. the bending of the light around the lights reminded me of the movie ���predator���. like when the creature was kind of visible yet non-visible. i���m in the flight path of the jets that come in to land at the salt lake city international  airport, it was about the same height of the jets that come in to land but slightly higher and just west of me. my thumb held at full arms distance would be able to cover this object. the sighting was less than 4 to 5 seconds. see the 1st sketch below \r\n\r\n    (2)\r\n    i���m excited to see such a thing, so i stay outside and watch the sky intently. i���m on the cell phone telling one of my friends about this sighting, he lives near ogden city, about a 45 minute drive on the freeway. while i was telling him about the 7:10 pm sighting, i see another dim set of lights come straight towards me. except this is huge! it was a single row of 3 lights (dim) on a 45 degree angle. it moves straight over me with no sound at all and again in a nnw direction. the sighting was about 3 ��� seconds, in 3 ��� seconds it was gone! it was as low as the lowest jets fly that are preparing to land at the slc int. airport. it appeared to be having light dimly radiating from above it with almost a shadow like area around it, i could almost see a craft on one side where the row of lights was. over towards the right was where most of the light emanated from above the thing. it was like one side of a v of lights that were visible.  this thing also seemed to be bending light making it was very hard to see. if i held my arm fully extended with the palm flat against it still would not fully be able to cover this object. like i said earlier it was huge! the time was about 8:30 pm. i had binoculars around my neck but was so dumb founded at this object i didn���t even think of the binoculars or of the camera in my pocket, plus it was so fast! see the 2nd sketch below\r\n\r\n    (3)\r\n   i���m still outside watching the sky���s (8:45pm). my neighbor comes home and see���s me outside with a coat, hat, gloves and binoculars. with a puzzled look come over and asked me what i���m doing. i tell her and she starts asking me where i seen the object etc. so i���m telling her and  all of a sudden i see another object barely visible in a sense and very high traveling in a nnw direction. i immediately remember my binoculars this time and quickly find this object in my 10x50 power binoculars. it was like a flying wing with about 9 round lights forming a slight v formation. it was fast and silent. the sighting was about 4 seconds long. her eyes were better than mine. i asked what she saw and she also saw a triangle pattern of lights. i can���t say that i could see much more than the lights. but it did appear to be dark between the area of the lights in the form of a wing type v pattern. we also noticed it had no sound what so ever. see the 3rd sketch below\r\n\r\n  (4)\r\n  it���s cold out and i���m still out watching the sky, 3 in one night! what���s going on! anyway it���s about 11:00 pm now, i���m in my back yard now, earlier i was in the driveway. i���m looking to the south. all of a sudden i see a dimly visible row of lights in a slight v pattern but yet almost straight across. it���s coming fast and low about the same height of the jets that come in to land at the airport. i quickly view this with my  binoculars. i���m shocked! it���s not one thing, it���s a group of white triangle���s. they were moving in a, a moving formation 15 to 17 of them in triangle formations in each triangle pattern the lead one would drop back to the rear and then move back to the front again, this was happening in unison along this formation line, from one side to the other(one triangle of formation with one in between the next triangle formation with one on each side of the triangle formation. they changed pattern about 4 times). it was very strange and puzzling. it also reminded me of birds in flight but different too. the sighting was no more than 4 ��� seconds. i would guess each craft was a little bigger than a small airplane. they had no lights on them but had a white glow to them with a ripley effect around them. they were not bright at all, dim yet very solid looking triangles. they were a perfect triangle shape with a slight v notched out the back edge of them. they were silent and fast. they went right over me. i stared at them intently with my binoculars. the width of the formation was wider than the palm of my hand flatly held out at arm���s length. please see the 4th sketch below. i stayed outside until about 1:15 am, i didn���t see anything else peculiar. in all the sighting they all were traveling nnw, with only white lights or color.\r\n\r\nall of this in one night! i will never forget this night!\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

sky as i ordinarily do on clear days when in the air straight up above me at an altitude of about 3000 feet i had spotted a round ball-like object hovering in a slow but steady glide \r\ntoward a southerly direction.  \r\n\r\nthis visible object did not in any way appear as what would normally have been a bird or plane, no wings or tail were seen.  with the extreme force of wind current and at it's estimated height, it would not have been possible for any winged creature or balloon to hover so sternly, as they \r\nwould have shown an air pattern in a more turbulent or vibrational path.\r\n\r\nadditional note:  using my very sharp and accurate vision i was able to depict that because of the slow steady movement it presented, this was not a star nor even a meteor.  either one would have displayed a more split-second sparkling streak or no movement at all.\r\n\r\nthe object remained in sight for at least one minute and as the cold wind began to water my eyes i glimpsed away briefly and when i quickly returned to what was a very open part of the sky, the object was nowhere in sight.  after another whole minute of observing that area of sky and \r\nwith the awareness of how the sun will divert things at different angles and colors, there was nothing visible.\r\n\r\nin retrospect from what similar reports have stated, it seemed very possible that the object must have made itself off at a high rate of speed.  it is unknown to me as to what it was or why i had come to observe this, other than for me to account for it and being clearly seen and recognized as a ufo.  i'll be recalling this experience until the end of my days.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering
