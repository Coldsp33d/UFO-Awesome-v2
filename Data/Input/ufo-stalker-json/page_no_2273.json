my dumb butt had my camera right there but you know i couldnt take a picture, i didnt want to miss what i was seeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nit came in from the southeast somewhere to the right of aquila (see picture below), i say aquila because it came in toward the right of the star altair, it came in so fast at first i saw this glowing white light and as it passed over us just a little to the southwest of our center location it was almost directly over our heads, as it passed, it had a white center ball then an outside layer of yellow and a thin layer of a light orange, it had a long tail but nothing like meteorites who cast a long after trail when they shoot, this had a tail maybe twice its ball size long, the tail at first it seemed like a fan but it wasnt it had 2 tails one that cast white yellow and orange and one that was clearly blue and both came to points. it was hauling faster than anything i have ever seen, it was in the atmosphere and too my own eyes somewhere between the size of an eraser head and a dime in the sky it's was huge, it was spectacular and very fast(the other acct that i read said it was very slow,, i dont think it was slow just really big it had no sound but you would have expected to hear something like the shuttle launching we didnt have a side view like the other acct. we had a direct view because it came right toward us) , it went all the way to the lower part of the celestial dome in the north, and ursa major was it's background so north of ursa major.\r\n\r\n\r\nnow im also well aware that there are several comets happening around earth on those dates, comet c/2007 w1 boattini, comets c/2006 q1 mcnaught, c/2008 a1 mcnaught, and 19p/borrelly (2008) and according to the info on them you pretty much still need a telescope to get a decent look at them... this was to close to be a comet, so close that when my sister saw it she ducked and covered her head because she thought it was a plane getting ready to crash..Thats how close it was, no need to use a telescope it was just that close. \r\n\r\ni have attached a picture of the best origination, path and ending as far as i could figure according to our location. the event between12:30 and 1:15am and went on for a good maybe 30-50 seconds maybe even longer, the star chart  is the most accurate depiction of the stars around that time this is the star positions at our location at 1am. we would have been in the center looking toward the southeast when it came into view it traveled directly over our heads into the northwest where we watched it till it disapperaed out of our range of view. \r\n\r\n \r\nmy grandpa was in the air force so i grew up pretty familiar with anything government flown or nasa oriented it's a family pride thing, and when i was young i was obsessed with comets, space ect... i am 34 now, a big sky watcher all my life...I have never ever seen anything like this ever.\r\nif you have any questions i'll be happy to answwer anything i can.

was on a regular evening walk in perth, western australia with my wife and two children.\r\n\r\nas i was walking in a northerly direction up a slight hill, i saw a white light seemingly 'flash' once in my peripheral vision (above and somewhat to the east of my line of sight). i thought it might be an aircraft of some kind and casually looked up toward the region in the sky. however, when i continued to watch, there was no visible flashing for several seconds. this caught my attention. i stopped at a t-junction before crossing and continued to watch. approximately 15 seconds later, there was a second light.\r\n\r\nbecause i was now focusing on the region, i saw the object more clearly on the second occasion. it appeared to be a pulse of light; i.E. the increase and decrease in the luminance of the object seemed to be a pulse in the proper sense of the word. the duration of the pulse was approximately a second (possibly slightly less). this pulse was almost certainly the same object. it was white, slightly grey. its luminance was that of a relatively dim star; considerably less than the brightest star in the evening sky but brighter than the dimmest stars. its size was larger than any star, its diameter in the order of 3 or more times that of any star. it was well after sunset.\r\n\r\nat the time of the second pulse, i made a point to 'get a fix' on the location relative to nearby stars. it was to the east of two stars that were close to one another; one of the stars being above the other. it was between these two stars and another to the east of them.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch the region. there was a third pulse of light, exactly the same, after another 15 seconds (approximately).\r\n\r\ni continue to wath. after approximately another 10 seconds or more, there was another pulse of light, this time rectangular as seen in the sky. it seemed distant, and i could not in any way ascertain its actual 3 dimensional shape. the width of this rectangular object was in the order of 3 to 7% of its length. this estimate is based on drawing the shape as it appeared, and measuring the dimensions. its hue and luminance seemed identical to the three circular pulses. the rectangle was close to parallel with the horizone but inclined slightly downward from west to east; in the order of 15 degrees.\r\n \r\nby the time i observed the third pulse, my wife had returned to my location with the children. after i stopped, she had crossed the street, and only came back when i called to ask her to do so. i had oriented her attention to the region of sky by pointing to the three stars.\r\n\r\nmy wife then observed another rectangular light in the same region. it occurred seconds after the one i observed. i did not see observe the pulse she saw. she said it was white, but slightly orange in appearance. i conveyed my estimate of the length, width, luminance, duration, and inclination of the rectangular light that i saw. we discussed all of these characteristics at some length. she thought the object she observed matched all characteristics except color. she was sure there was a slight orange hue. i told her of the preceding three circular pulses.\r\n\r\nwe watched the area for about ten minutes after this and saw nothing more. as the minutes passed, i scanned a broader and broader region around the three stars. i then gave up and we continued on our walk. \r\n\r\nthe object(s) was nne and approx 30 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\ni was intrigued by the object. i reacted with a little surprise at first, then intrigue. because it was not like anything i had seen previously, i found the appearance striking and quite strange.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":15758,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-31.9484336,"location":null,"logNumber":"AU-02272009-0004","longitude":115.8608489,"occurred":1212633000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Western

bright lite in the sky and asked me what it was. i took a look and told him that i did not know and that it might be a plane or a star, since we live next to buckley air force base we have lots of planes flying around, but after a second look i noticed that the light was not moving. so i went in to the house and grabbed my digital camera and started taking pictures of it.\r\ni took 16 pictures of the light with all the diferent settings my camera had. then i went back in the house and grabbed my video camera and started filming it with normal and night vision on. than i went up stairs and climbed out the second floor window on to my garage roof and started filming from there. the object moved slightly lower from where it first was and then stoped. i kept filming it for another 15 or so minutes and got kinda cold on the roof so i desited to go back in the house. i set the video camera down and take some more photos of the light.\r\nafter that i got a bit cold again and went back in the house for a few minutes. then i came back outside to check on the light and it was further away and a bit dimmer but i could still see it very well and a few seconds later it just went off like some one just fliked a light switch, and that is it. my mom and my friend all saw it as well. and none of us could tell what it was. a few minutes later my sister got back from work and we all told her what we saw but she would not belive us until i showed her the video and the pictures, \r\n\r\nil post the pictures as well they are all original straight from my sony  cybershot digital camera

woke to pee in what seemed to be a very bright moon, therefore i was not afraid of the boogie man. i went next to the blueberry bushes. while crouched i heard voices loud and what sounded like people revealing in happiness or whatever \"older people\" get to do, like go to the lake.\r\n\r\ni stayed low so they could not see me . i was going to spy on them! as they came closer toward our little pup tent , which had been put right next to a big pine tree. i noticed, hey! they were naked! they had no clothes on and oh, i could really see their eyes. \r\n\r\nit scared me to my full height, to run... then froze ,they had already some how noticed my presence! they did not jump back from me . i thought maybe i would have scared them a little, because it was so late at night. i was as quite as a wood mouse. ( i thought rapidly).\r\ni felt it of no use to run anymore to my parents house. maybe they were to kidnap me. i didn't want them to get my brother ,too. i knew i was helpless.( weird to have that feeling with your parent only yards away)\r\nor maybe,\r\n i had mistaken their nudity and these were people for halloween tricks. then i remember this high squeaky sound and then it lowered to a voice mixed with the radio. eyes smooth as glass, large brown with some black in the center. penetratring eyes.\r\ni could hear them talking in their language and didn't understand, but a few words in my language came to me; not this one! the taller one said. i heard it and new it cam from him, he had no mouth!\r\n it was then i realized in my child mind this was a bad thing. these are, i am not sure if i knew the word alien, but it was not the boogie man!\r\n\r\ni think that one short evil one i'll call him and ruthless is the one whom wanted to do awful things to me. his face was more scrunched and wrinkled with a brownish pink naked skin. long arms , not hairy , just weak looking arms with long fingers.\r\n it gives me the creeps writing it now, like they know i am writing this(sorry transgressing, maybe a real or to others an unreal emotion to compute)..\r\nevil also had a large head with more of the pinkish tone,still ugly.\r\n\r\nthe three of them stood there like the british solders do in the movies at war. looking at me. i looked to the middle, taller being. he gave me a sense of calm . again i felt as though he talked to my brain and my brain answered! my mouth did not move, i put my hands on my lips i felt them not move. before i could be shocked, evil squiggled withed his voice and \"interrupted us\" i did not understand evil, but felt his desire for me so to speak.\r\n\r\ni could only as a child think what on earth do you want with a kid? aren't you here to teach the big people how to behave? we have a war going on.\r\nmaybe this , these words i just wrote are inserts from rationalizations for the past 40+ years or memories are just a result of trauma of the vietnam war?? i have asked my self over and over. you will never know how many times i have asked myself. if it is just a bad dream why do i have that;the burnt in my brain feeling there? \r\n\r\nwhen evil was for lack of a better description,arguing i heard or felt the urge to run. i did right into my brother's side . realizing that was scary i covered my head and said over and over\" if i can't see you you can't see me\"! \r\ni do not remember going into a craft. i have always really feared what they did to my brother. \r\n\r\ni beleive i have seen them throughout my years five of more times. i have shooed them away after my daughter came home from the hospital. i commanded them, as my mother had told me to do! other than that i believe i have in some odd way gotten used to them. i also get angry over the fact that if there was something to be done to me or others they only need to ask! the tall ones are more compassionate then the smaller or uglier ones. i don't know if i make this crap up or i just kinda know like telepathy. one other thing water is important to them and they use lakes.\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":15754,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.8185056,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02262009-0023","longitude":-70.4151444,"occurred":-47494800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-47494800000,"summary":"Alien encounter.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Windham, Maine","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:259999"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Phoenix","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"19:15 mst-az 2/26\r\n\r\noutside in the nw above the mountains amber colored light appears.  in less than 2 minutes the object moves rapidly across horizon and finally disappears in the ne over the mountains. \r\n\r\nobserved through binoculars almost appeared to like a hot air balloon.  was moving faster than all other planes in the air.  could not have been a hot air balloon like would have been intermittent like a camp fire, plus high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nmy wife also observed the object, and was unable to view it with binoculars because it disappeared before she could get the binoculars on the object.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":15753,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4508171,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02262009-0024","longitude":-112.0662173,"occurred":1235704500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1235704500000,"summary":"Amber light in ne moves rapidly accross sky and disappears.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"America/Phoenix","timeZoneName":"America/Phoenix","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Phoenix, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:260000"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Yucca Valley","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My husband and i saw a bright shining star like object moving in a eastward direction. over the 29 palms marine base, this was higher then any usual plane, we see these all the time when we look hard enough, i feel if i had some type of night vision anyone could view these objects.. anyway we have a good view from our house from our house, it would fade in and out, slow down then speed up as it was traveling. it was in eyesight view for approx. 4 to 5 min. it faded to the east. possibly folks in laughlin nv. or parker arizona, saw something traveling east around 6:15 or so..I realize there is a marinebase there but even for them this unusual in the area...The camera i have does not zoom in close enough. even then it would look like another white dot moving awkwardly\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":15752,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1230043,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02262009-0023","longitude":-116.424075,"occurred":1235700600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1235700600000,"summary":"Looking up at the darkening sky above joshua tree, ca.

it was nice out and there was clear visibility that night.I had been looking up and saw what i thought to be a lil \r\nsatilite.As i watched it was shifting from green to blue in color moving at about a pace which a satelite would then all the sudden it almost  tripled size or more as it became a very bright white cirlce then returned to its pin point size  never changed speed  and continued on over the horizon at which point i lost sight of the object.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

(descent, pitch up - breaking action/effect, pitch down, pitch up #2, pitch down #2 - this prevents atmospheric burn up and it is also is part of steering into the landing zone) the final pitch up, #3, took it out of site, to the nw and aid area. the ablation effect varied as the vehicle made its velocity adjustments. it then turned toward the nw (to dulles -- aid --). where it went after that i do not know. i did not time it but i think it may have been thirty seconds.  \r\n     in school the next day my friend and neighbor, {pid1} (lived one block away on oakwood dr. -- 1st barn style house on right after the cul-de-sac, foxwood nook?) saw it too. he asked if i had heard about the ufo crash in kecksburg, pa. i said \"no.\" he thought we did see it. i can't positively remember if other classmates saw it too. after all of these years i'm still not sure if that was the kecksburg vehicle or not.    \r\n     from what i have read on the kecksburg vehicle, it was picked up over canadian airspace then came through the u.S.'s airspace to crash in washington center's region (artcc) at kecksburg, pa. . i don't know if the faa keeps \"interesting\" radar tapes archived or not. it should have shown up on at least tapes for the dc artcc (wash. center - leesburg) and maybe aid, was and bwi. military radars would be andrews and bowling. at that time i was teaching myself about flying airplanes, spacecraft and rockets since i wanted to become an astronau/pilot. nasa had visited our school at that time. if you need to get a second story on that from rich, i do not know how to reach him. after that school year his father, (air force) was reassigned to california. i want to say vandenberg, afb but i'm not sure. our school was belvedere elementary on columbia pike. fairfax county may have a record of where he transfered to if you need to check with rich. his older brother charlie may or may not have joined the air force. i don't know if he or his sister (becky?) saw it too. \r\n     fox in raleigh, nc ran a regular tv show about ufo's in the fall of 1996. one night they ran kecksburg. after that story ran i called their call-in phone number and told them the federal governments given explanation was a lie, which it was. i want to say james oberg was the \"government's expert\" appearing on the show that night. names of russian projects and passed u.S. missions were also used to say it was that spacecraft. that also became the last episode since fox took the series off of the air without any announcement.

the las vegas strip on the 95 freeway. corn creek is out in the middle of the nevada desert so the skys are always clear. on or about the night of march 2 2006 at around 10:15pm i heard my dogs barking like there was someone on my proprty.\r\n\r\n as i went out to see what was going on my dogs stoped barking. there were know cricket sounds and it was like everything went silent and the air was heavy and smelled like iron and sulphur. as my dogs began to wimper i looked up in the sky and what ever it was was there. \r\n\r\nit was about as big as two football fields and cloaked to mimic the sky. imagine looking up and seeing all of the stars in the sky and then watching all of the stars move as this thing moved you could see that the stars were in there places. \r\n\r\nas it moved there was no sound. it would stop and the stars in it would move across the valley from one mountain ridge to the other witch had to have been several miles apart.\r\n\r\nthen it would stop and 20 of them would flash white lights like stars then it would move agean and the patterns would change and flash 12 then 10 then 12 as it moved away from me it felt like the the air changed and the desert sounds began to return. the feeling i had as i watched this thing  move away from me was like nothing i had ever felt befor.\r\n\r\ni tryed to use my cell phone and regardless of my repeated attempts it would not connect untill it was what looked like around 5 miles from me and then i got a signal. \r\n\r\ni called my mother and told her what i had seen and what i was looking at as it was moving away. she told me to followed it if i could so i tryed but could not catch it. it was heading north towards the military base on the 95 freeway.\r\n\r\ni had decided to drive back to my house in town to try and make sense on what i had just witnessed i left my three dogs at the corn creek house with my friend who was house sitting for me. the next day she had called me to tell me that there was something wrong with one of my dogs.\r\n\r\ni asked her to expalin what was going on and she had told me that it seems as though one of my dogs had caught it self on a part of  the fence that surrounded my house but it looked strange to her and i needed to come take a look. as i got to the house only two of my dogs came to me. the one that had the issue was hiding in the house under the bed. i tryed to get her to come out but she was not the same dog at all.  finally i got her to come come out and what i saw could not be explained.. \r\n\r\nshe had a triangle mark on her left side right behind her front leg along with three ovel shaped marks that were down to the bone were you can see the dogs ribs the marks were carttarised  and there was no blood. i took her to the vet and the marks could not be explained. she was stiched up and i took her home she was never the same after that. the dog use to be very friendly and soone turned mean when ever the night came the dog would hide were ever she could and would not come out untill the morning \r\n\r\nthe strange thing is everytime the night would come she would act lathargic and unsure of were she was. i had to put the dog down because she stared snapping at my kids and attacking the other two dogs. its been years now and i have started comming down with diffrent health issues that make no sense to me my kidness are starting to have issues and my spleen is not right. i also have an issue with one of my lungs. also i have a case of bad aruthritous in my joints along with un-explained headachs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n

7:30pm the weather was warm with a cloudless sky. across the road from our subdivision is the pleasantview swamp which runs seven miles north to south and three miles wide east to west. we lived near the south end.\r\n\r\nas i walked the dog towards larks lake road, two houses down from my own, i noticed a shiny cylindrical object appear from a near distance to the north as it flew a smooth, soundless, straight line, north to south, with no contrail whatsoever. it appeared as if it were following larks lake road. i am not good at estimating distance above the ground but it was clear and low enough above the tree line to see a smooth bright silvery surface of its cigarette shape with no wings and flat ninety degree angles on both ends.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw it the thought of it being a missile crossed my mind but it flew too slow but yet too big and fast to be a helium balloon. if i were to hold my fist to the sky, the length of the object would have extended beyond both sides of my hand.\r\n\r\ni watched in awe as it passed directly over me and to the south towards nubs nob. after watching for thirty some seconds i ran home to get my wife but her view was obstructed by trees and by that time it was too far away.\r\n\r\nmy emotions at the time were not so much scared as it was being mystified and creepy hoping like hell it wasn't going to land in our open field. i still get that feeling today. over the years i have told a few professional people, policeman and pilots about the sighting and at the time of the sighting i drew the crude digital drawing attached to

in july.  i was 12 years old, and prepared to get home and unpack.  while driving we turn off of st.Charles park way onto the small strip of road called kintore.  from kintore we take a left turn onto university drive.  as soon as we turned onto university drive i looked up from my passenger side window.  i saw a large light blue light pulsating.  i dont exactly remember if the light changed to a red/orange.  my father is a aviation contractor is retired airforce, and he too said that this quiet light was strange.  the light slowly moved its way past the treetops and out of our line of sight.  we turned onto greystone circle, where my house was located.  we got out of the car and payed no mind to the strange light we just experienced.  i remember walking up the hill to my front door.  suddenly two low f-16's flew right above my house in the dirrection the craft was going in alarming speed.  later, maybe two days ago, they report was in the newspaper and we realized what exactly we saw.  i understand others have come forward and explained much more exciting details of this event, but i believe that every little bit helps.  i've heard on the news that there had been many eye witness's in the area who saw this ufo.  it baffels me that their has not been a investigation, or atleast i havent know of one.  thank you","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:25","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15735,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8966518,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02262009-0006","longitude":-77.0325458,"occurred":1027666800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1027666800000,"summary":"Blue

little brighter then faded to a pinpoint in about 5 seconds. could not tell if it was moving as i was walking. i was as bright as jupiter..Or venus which was also visible in the western sky..About as large as venus..A bright white that didn't change color, just slowly faded. i had first thought maybe i had witnessed a supernova...Then i was waiting for all the lights to go out from a emp..Who

over lower roswell rd it was on oct 31st around 2000 - yes i know that this is halloween that it is why i didn't mention it the first time. \r\n\r\nlater that same night i was on columns drive which parallels the chattahoochee river and i had a delievery up to river heights. i was headed up the steep incline up to the apt complex and noticed that to my left was the same floating ship i had noticed earlier in the evening. as i woulnd my way to the apt. i needed to go to the ship proceeded to fly over the apts. i had a delievery to make and so i couldn't go after it as it went behind the building i was delivering to. i called out to some people walking that evening that if they wanted to see a ufo they should look behind the building. that was the last i saw of it.\r\n\r\nnow to the next sighting years later of the same style of craft.\r\n\r\ni was headed what i think is east on river valley rd, the time was 9:45 because i looked at the cars clock. river valley rd also parallels that same river but at a greater distance but in the same general region. i saw 3 lights in a row flying low over the trees, i thought that it was a plane and was headed into the ground and that it would take me with it. i gave my poor volvo all it had but in a few secondds the middle light lifted up and i saw that these 3 lights although they looked to be in a row were actually on 3 diffenrent points of a triangular aircraft. it slowly turned left  or to it's right and floated over the subdivision to my left i followed it and raced through the streets following it. it never went fast. it appeared to just be floating at a slow pace. the road went down and so i go a clear view of the various lights under it. one in each corner and some in the vey center. it lifted it's nose and just continued away to where i could no longer follow it.\r\n\r\nthe next ufo i saw was the only one i feel might have really had aliens as pilots, i was on a very sombe trip with my brother and his two sons to the funeral of our neice who had recently died. the road is us 77 it runs from talledega to gadseden where the funeral was. it can be a scenic road as the road runs over bridges  and levees that have expanses of water to both sides. this was  in about 2006. anyway the craft was built like a hamburger with thin buns and the filling was two levels of likghts that were rectangular in nature. it looked like it might have been some swanky restaurant except i knew of know hight tech restaurant built in the lakes by 77. it moved slowly parallel to the road but we lost it when we again hit land and my brother darrell would not stop the car to look at it.\r\n\r\nthe last ufo i have seen was what i call the most boring ufo  i have ever seen. it was just a ball of white light. i was on the phone about 3 years ago with a friend. it was about 2am and the summer heat was horrid and my cells reception indoors was horrid. so i went outside to smoke and was laying on the trunk of my car looking up at the sky while talking to my friend elaine. who lives in littleton co. she can verify this story because i hung up on her. i was the only person on the street when this ball drifted overhead. the clouds were thick and i think that is what it was about. it seemed to want a look at me from various angles and heights. it drifted in over the parking lot and when it got oevr me it just stopped. it then rose in heght and the lowered. i told elaine what i was looking at and she thought it was a gag. i swore that i wasn't kidding her and then while i am looking at this floating ball she's telling me that there is no such thing as ufo's. after a brief squabble i hang up on her. the ball however seemed to be going from left to right of me and looking at me from various angles and such. my only guess at the time was that it must be some kind of af viewing device and they were testing it in thick clouds to see how it did. the whole think too about 3-5 minutes. but it was not a really bright ball it was actually only visible. it was white or slightly green in color. i don't remember how it disappeared thoughh. i'm sorry. it just wasn't there anymore. \r\n\r\nnow you hae all of my ufo stories. if there is anything i can help you with that would be fine. \r\n\r\non recent discussions with a person who lives on the river i asked him if he had seen any lights over the river. he said no but that the af does testing of it's stealth aircaft over the river at odd times. he was so normal and certain when he said this that i didn't think to question him. when i deliever to him again i will ask. also you have to be sober and not on any kind of drugs to deliver for the major deliverychains with a perfect driving record. one other thing is that a friend of mine - caroline - has spotted the triangle ships many times and may be available for contact.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15728,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9242688,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02252009-0018","longitude":-84.3785379,"occurred":1132551900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1132551900000,"summary":"Black

the fact my father is a huge aviation buff.Im not ready to jump to any conclusions but felt i should fill out a report due to how odd i felt this was. \r\naprox 6:20 pm \r\ni was sitting at my computer fliping around on the net just enjoying myself.Then i decided id pop up you tube and put on some music. after the music started playing i walked over to the kitchen table got a cigarette out of my pack and headed out the back door. i stepped out side and immediately north of me  between two houses i could see what i thought to be a really bright planet due to the fact it remained perfectly still. my attention soon shifted to stars and other air traffic out that night which there was alot of. a minute or two later i looked back at the object which was still and noticed in a perfect line it started hovering over to the left not moving up or a down at all and then for maybe one second it stopped and reversed direction. at which point i really started to question what i was looking at. it just didnt seem to look right.  it continued to move to the right, paused and became bright very bright so bright i thought it must have been moving close to me and it should be over head any second and became concerned as to what this really was. the light then dimmed after a mintue and i did notice a tiny green light to the left of it which im not sure if it was blinking or not. then it started drifting to the right until it was behind houses and i couldnt see it any more. a bit after the first sighting i had that night i did go out about 15 to 20 mins later to search the sky and saw a tiny light moving east from the west the size of a small star which was fading from green to blue then it lit up very bright which tripled its size i mean this thing got alot bigger then returned to its original size and continued at the the same speed until it was over the horizon out of sight.
