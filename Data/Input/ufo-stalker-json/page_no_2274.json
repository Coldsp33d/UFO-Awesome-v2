leaving woodburn, and driving on the highway towards the small town of mt.Angel it dawn's on me i haven't seen any other traffic on the highway, which is highly unusual since it is a week day and i'm sure i'm not the only one to get off work at that hour. anyway i'm enjoying the quiet drive home and about 2 or 3 minutes into this drive kind of in front and slightly to the left of me, i spot a beautiful star. it was quite a bit larger than most stars and unlike most stars, this one not only was larger but it had colors in it. so i kept watch on this star until corners, trees or the direction of the road changed, obstructing the view. after some obstructions when i knew i should have been able to view it again, it was gone. the whole trip my mind was either on that star or the fact i still hadn't seen any other traffic. anyway, it only takes me about 15 minutes to get to mt.Angel.Coming into mt.Angel everyone knows to slow to 25 miles an hour as it's a very small town and the local police are usally sitting at the entry way, more than willing to give any speed violaters a ticket.I never speed through town anyway.Funny, this particular night the police wern't there.Nobody was there. i mean in the whole town. you always see cars moving, people walking on the sidewalks, people sitting outside the deli eating and visiting you can even see the cashier through the windows,but not this evening. it was as if the whole town was home asleep, or the people were hiding.All the lights were on in the stores,just no people present.Anyway it only takes 2 to 3 minutes to get through town.So i get to the end,and about to start excellerating to head down mt.Angel-silverton highway,when off to my left,hovering above some large electrical power system,is this black what i believed to be chevron shaped air-bourn vehecle.I was a little shocked but,not afraid.I think i surprised it at the same time,i'm sure they hadn't planned for me to show up.(continued on

perfectly clear night. a bit cool, but it was beautiful aside from that. i noticed a bright light in the sky. my initial thought is that its mars, because it kinda has a very light reddish glow to it. after about 20 seconds of looking at it, i notice that its flashing slightly. not the entire object, the main light that caught my attention never wavered. it almost seemed like the bright solid light of a plane with the flashing lights on the wing. so as im watching this thing its sitting in the same position, so i start thinking its a plane. if a plane is flying strait at you, it sometimes gives the appearance of hovering. after about 30 seconds of seeming to sit still, i notice it moving. slowly at first, in a strait line. then it triples in speed instantly. it flies fast like this for about 5 seconds and then stops totally. at this point i realise, this is no plane. i run inside to get my camera and when i come back outside to film it, the thing wont show on my camera at all. then i notice its in the same spot, but its not near as bright. as i watch it for another few minutes it stays mostly stationary. but everynow and then it would fly around in a circle, or it would take off really fast in one direction, then another, and then settle back into a stationary position. after a few more minutes the object just faded into nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe whole experience took only around 6-7 minutes. whatever this thing was it was way to far away to see any kind of shape, or size, or anything of that sort. and i noticed as the whole episode was going on every dog in the neightborhood was barking. and i also heard some strange noises outside my fence. kind of like a weird scratching and then what sounded kinda like sickly

kind of bright light appearing and disappearing in the sky in front of my home at lake brownwood. i called the sheriffs office on the morning of feb 24, 09 and asked them if they had had any reports of a light in the sky, they said ���no��� that i was the only one that had called about it. after work i went home and started to make dinner and had to run to the store, i returned home from the store at about 7:00 p.M. and i know that it was about 7 because the store that i had just came from closed at 7. when i got to my house which took me less then a min. my fianc��� and son were sitting on the front porch step talking, so when i got out of the car i stopped and talked to them. while i was standing there talking to them to the right of me in the sky above my neighbors house 4 red lights appeared in the sky one right after the other, i dropped everything that i was holding in my hands and started to scream at my fianc��� ���did you see it ,did you see it?��� and as soon as i started to scream it took off and shot up in the sky, he ran out into the street and i ran in the house and got my digital camera and we ran down the street screaming at our neighbors to come out side and see what was going on. while we were going down the street the 4 red lights appeared again, and the neighbor got to see it, a different neighbor came out of her house and watched the sky with us- it was almost dark but the sun beams were still kinda shinning in the sky behind the horizon and you could see lots of the ���aircrafts��� moving around and turning in way���s that normal man mad aircraft surely couldn���t. we seen an f-16 jet come from one side of the sky and fly right over us and to the left of us- made a big turn and went back the way it came. but when it turned around to go back one of the crafts took off after it and just smoked by it-then made a 90��� turn and went straight back the way it came and flew out of sight. we could see lots and lots of the crafts in the sky fluttering around and when it started to get really dark you could see them fly up higher in the sky and make themselves look like the stars. my fianc��� stayed up all night looking at the sky and you could see them move one way and come back, change colors. they would be next to each other in sets of 2���s one bright and one dim-or they would be in the shape of a triangle. the more you stared at them the better you could see them move around and go back. they were still moving around way up in the sky early is morning.I took some video with my digital camera and you can see a bright light be there and disappear and reappear. i can���t find the cord to my camera to load it up with this but i have it none the less.

was shortly after 9pm local time (pmt) when i went out on to my balcony to have a coffey and relax from a long days work, i shut the padio door and sat down on the chair i have on the third floor facing directly north. the balcony on which i saw the object has a wide view of the mountains to the west as well as the mountains to the east and of course a birds eye view of the valley north of me. no less then one minute after sitting down and looking up in to the clear night sky ( which is something i do often) a circular object no more then 1000ft directly above my location, streaked north across the sky line and continued directly north untill it was out of sight. the object i saw had no disernable shape to it, allthough from what i made out it was a circular shape. the object was simply a circular light on the bottom of the craft, approximetly 100ft across, it made absolutely no sound at all and was travelling no less then eight hundred miles an hour. my reason for saying that speed was no less then 800 mph is that the view i have of the valley directlynorth of me is 20 to 30 kilometers and then it fades in to the night, also there was a lake directly along the path of the objects course. from the time i saw the object and to the moment it dissapeared in the distance it was no more then 8 seconds.  the light the object emitted was the brightest most white light i had ever seen in my life, if i had to compare it to anything it would have to be the moon on the clearest night possible, and even then the moon would not compare to the brightness emitted by the craft. also on closing the objects light source was directed undeniably twoards the ground and i saw no light emitting from the side or the top allthough there was no shape, i saw that the light and craft was definable by the human eye. \r\n    so this sighting was either american military in design or it was extra terestial... this experience not only opened my eyes, but helped me to understand that day in age i am living is more remarkable then even the most wide eyed man could have imagined.

was out fishing with my mom's boss's husband and my little sister. normally my mom and his two daughters would tag along but that night the daughters wanted to watch a new episode of hannah montanna. john( won't say last name) is obsessed with fishing and i didn't want to go out that night because we had gone fishing every day that week and i was sick and tired of eating \" fish\" and catching fish. my mom said that my sister and i should go because it was supposed to rain for the next couple of days so we might as well go and get it over with. i hated taking the motion sickness pill and being out on the ocean so late with a grown man who panics a lot and my little sister who is 10 and very cranky about handling \" gooey fish\". it was like two in the morning and john was like \" oh we have almost reached our fishing limit\" and i was like thank god because i was getting tired as hell of listening to john's lame fishing techniques and lectures on how to be a \" good fisherman\" so i went towards the back of the boat where my sister was lying and staring out at the stars. that night i witnessed my first shooting star and boy was it beautiful!. i was gazing into the night sky in hopes of pointing out one to my little sister who teased that i was just \" seeing things\" when i saw a bright red/orange orb like object hovering in the distance near the stars. i thought it was a plane at first but then i changed my mind because the object had remained stationary for quite some time. i went towards the front of the boat to ask john what he thought it was and he took one glance and was like \" ah, it's just a plane\". i kept my eyes on the object for quite some time and it still didn't move so i tapped john on the shoulder to let him know that the object hadn't moved so it couldn't possibly be a plane. he then said \" well, maybe it's a meteorite moving slowly or something.\" i didn't what to think but 15 minutes had passed and the red/orange bright object was still there when i got done helping john clean up the boat of fish blood. it wasn't until we were leaving that the object took a sharp turn and vanished. i couldn't believe what i had witnessed. till this day i don't know what to think of that night. what the hell could that thing have been? i wonder if it was a moving meteorite or a forming star or something. i just remember the distinct color and orb-like appearance it had. i had completely forgotten that my little sister had tagged along with us for another boring fishing night so it didn't even cross my mind to ask her if she saw it. when i got home i ran upstairs to tell my mom what i had seen and all she could say was \" you and your sister are crazy\". my eyes widened when she said that because i had completely forgotten that my little sister came along. she had witnessed it too!!! i went to give my little sister a kiss good night that night and she was like \" i wonder what that thing in the sky was?\" i was like chelsea, i don't know but whatever it was, i'm glad you saw it too so i'm no fool.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15710,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":24.9242943,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02242009-0024","longitude":-80.6278364,"occurred":1217487600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

evening, tuesday, feb, 24, 2009.  i was in my pickup, driving south on hwy 183. i was approx. 3 miles out from cisco, coming in from breckenridge.  i happened to notice through my truck window, a grouping of very bright lights in the sky, approx. 30 degrees up from the southern horizon, which would put the object(s)at an elevation of about 800 to 1000 ft., just east and south of cisco, south of i-20.  i noticed one particularly bright white light, with several smaller amber lights clustered around the white light.  there appeared to be at least 5 amber lights.  i ruled out a normal aircraft, as i've never seen a plane, jet or helicopter with that particular configuration of lights.  i could not tell exactly how far the lights were from me but they appeared to be close to i-20, so maybe 5 miles away when first spotted.\r\ni managed to get a really sharp, detailed look at the lights, then i drove past some trees to my left, which briefly obscured the lights.  it took only a second or so, to pass the trees but by the time i had a clear and unobstructed view of the object(s), it was gone.  i looked at my clock radio, which showed 7:15 p.M. i made good time and drove on through cisco and headed south on hwy 206.  as i crossed over i-20, i again noticed amber lights in the distant sse.  the lights appeared to flash on and off.  this was at 7:28 p.M.  when i looked up from the clock, the lights were gone.  i headed on south on 206 for 5-7 miles and again saw amber lights in the sky, at approx. 20 degrees above the horizon and again, sse.  they were heading due south.  the lights seem to have traveled a good distance in a matter of minutes.  as i drove past the cutoff to nimrod on 206 and headed sw, i noticed the lights had again vanished.  i made it to my destination and did not see the lights again.\r\nthe lights would appear, flash quickly several times and disappear, only to reappear further south, then disappear again.  the lights appeared to be headed for, or near rising star, tx. total viewing time, approx. 15 seconds.  i was driving and did not have time to take a photo but am including a depiction of what i saw.\r\n\r\ni might also note that train tracks run north and parallel to i-20, just east of cisco, then travel through northern edge of cisco, in route to abilene and the lights were observed hovering over woods and

amazing light that was jumping all over when she looked at it with her binoculars.  i went outside with my binoculars.  with my naked eyes, i could see what she was describing.  it was a very, very bright, light low (approximately 30 degrees from horizon) in the northwest sky.  this was an incredibly clear night, the sky filled with stars.  i looked through my binoculars.  it was an amazing sight.  this light appeared to look like a fat, short, snake - like object that was dancing and moving about in circles, figure 8 motions, very fast.  i was talking on the phone at the same time to my friend, describing what i saw.  as we were speaking, 2 more snake-like objects came into view and began to dance (for lack of a better description), moving in circles and darting up to each other.  after approximately 5 minutes, the other 2 dancing, snake - like bright shapes disappeared, leaving one moving snake in the sky.  the bright snake disappeared briefly from my view, than re-appeared then after 5 minutes it was gone. the light show ended around 9:15 pm.  i could only say to my friend while i was watching \"oh, my god, this is amazing \" over and over.\r\nthis sight made me happy.

time estimated around 9 pm, during twilight.\r\nsky visible from balcony. the sun was setting and this was in the twilight period.\r\n\r\ni noticed a point of light above me in the sky,  projecting a diffuse, dim beam of light at a 45 degree angle toward the ground. this point of light was very discrete and definite and clearly visible as being only about 20 feet above me, and perhaps 8 feet forward of me, the  way i was facing. thus. 8 feet from my building, horizontally. \r\n\r\nthis point of light was stationary. it did not move or pan. it appeared to be about 3 inches in diameter and round. it appeared exactly like looking at the lense of a flashlight, if it were pointed in your direction. it was as though i was looking at a handheld flashlight hovering 20 feet above my head in the sky---but with one major peculiarity: only the lense of the flashlight, and the projected beam of light, were visible. no housing or metal enclosure was visible. the best way to describe this effect in words would be if you turned on a flashlight, then painted the handle and housing with a paint that made it invisible. in other words, only the light it shone was visible.\r\n\r\nthe beam of light coming from it appeared in every way like a modern incandescent flashlight beam. diffuse and yellow-white, just like an incandescent bulb. not a linear laser-like beam. it spread out in a cone---just like a flashlight or search light. \r\n\r\nthere were no aircraft below the cloud cover in the night sky at that time, and this point of light was obviously, clearly, and unmistakably at most only 20 feet or so above me. that would put it at an altitude about 30 feet above ground. an obvious search light. but not attached to any building--just hovering in the open sky.\r\n\r\nafter puzzling about it for 10 seconds, i saw the projected search light appear to pan up, as if the searchlight were being pivoted skyward. it was a smooth, mechanical change in beam angle, not erratic. as if a searchlight were being retracted up into something. once the beam pivoted to about parallel with the ground, it appeared to 'fold-p' into some invisible object, or just to disappear. then the point of light and the beam of light were just gone. folded up into the sky. no sound, no wind. that ended the event.","distance":"20 Feet or

explanation. the physics were such that nothing else on earth, from this time period anyway, could explain what it was. there is nothing to this day, thirty years later, that can move so swiftly and precisely through air. nothing. the only potential witnesses i saw was a car driving in the road in front of me, about 1/4 mile in the valley below. i am unsure that the car saw the craft because the ufo was above them and back behind a tree line, but their car appeared to be moving very slowly on a road where people drive like crazy, so i have reason to believe they may have witnessed it with me. they did not stop, and continued westbound on route 30. \r\n\r\nit is difficult for me to tell how large the craft was, maybe 50 feet long, but it was definitely disc or saucer-shaped, made no sound, stopped in mid-air on a dime, and sped off faster than i could move my eyes. at the time, i was not frightened, but more alive than i'd ever felt. in my mind, i felt like it was a privilege to witness it, because i know that most people never get a glimpse of something like that. my instinct was not to run off and hide behind a tree, but to stand and stare straight at it. i stood motionless just watching it, and thinking perhaps it was showing itself to me to prove that it exists. there were no lights that i could see, and the sun was mostly up anyway. it didn't seem particularly shiny, but certainly grey-ish. after it left, i stood there, chuckled to myself, and thought, 'wow, hot damn! i just saw a ufo!' i finished my paper route and made it home, as i had to shower and head off to junior high school. i just felt it should be business-as-usual.\r\ni wondered who to tell, if anyone, but when i got home, as i walked into the dining room, my mother and father were both there, my father about to leave for work. i decided to tell them what i saw. my mother looked at me like i was joking, my father said nothing. i smiled and said (rather callously to my beloved parents) 'i don't care if you believe me or not, but i just saw a ufo. and you can ask me 20 years from now and my story will be exactly the same, because i did see it'. i went to school but i don't think i told anybody, not even my closest friends. as the day passed, i wanted to tell more people, and was soon wondering if i possibly could have been hallucinating or daydreaming. a few days later, i was in the shower getting ready for school, when my mother started shouting for me to hurry up and come into the kitchen. i asked why and she said to hurry up. by the time i got dry and something to wear on, my mother was standing in the kitchen next to the radio, smiled, and said that people have been calling in kdka radio in pittsburgh and reporting that they saw a ufo in greensburg a few mornings earlier, the same day i saw mine. i said, 'see? i told you i wasn't lying, i saw that thing!', and she said 'wow, i believe you.' we never really spoke about it again.\r\n\r\nover the years i've told noone but a few sceptical friends, and the memory threatens to get hazy. but it was such a shocking, exhiliarating experience, and so simple to remember, very crystal clear and cut for me.\r\ni never wrote anything down for myself for posterity, but i do have some trouble with the exact date. i know for sure that i had the paper route in 1979, and maybe earlier, and i remember it could not have happened in july or early august as i was not in school for those months. i vaguely remember wearing a short sleeve shirt, no jacket, that morning, so it must have been anywhere from may to october. \r\ni don't remember seeing any tv reports locally, and i don't remember seeing any reports in the newpapers (ironically, the tribune-review, the paper i was delivering the morning of the experience). i know i'll never forget what i saw, and it's kept my life wonderous knowing that i was witness to something people don't know about, let alone believe. i just always laugh when i watch shows where such buttoned-down professorial debunkers throw around ridiculous hypothesis for what ufo's people see, i.E. weather balloons, storm sprites, ball lightening, zany cloud formations, etc. there is more to this life. i don't know about gods, and religion, but i do know that ufo's exist.
