neighborhood is called willshire terrace in the terrell hills area of san antonio.\r\n\r\n this neighborhood is roughly 2 miles from downtown proper. the cross streets closest to this neighborhood are austin hwy., rittiman rd., and harry wurzbach rd.\r\n\r\n the thing that makes this most interesting is that fort sam houston army base borders this neighborhood and is almost literally a stones throw (about 2 blocks) from the fence of this base.\r\n\r\n i was standing outside with two other friends, it was about 2am. as we were talking, a bright white light lit up the sky and the entire yard. at first i thought that someone had taken a picture, there had been a photographer with us earlier in the night, but this lasted too long to be a camera flash. all three of us quickly realized that this light was coming from the sky.\r\n\r\n i happened to be in the position where i was looking directly at the object when we looked up in the sky, my two friends were looking at me and had to turn around when they looked up, whereas i just had to raise my head. the object was directly in my field of vision.\r\n\r\n needless to say i got a pretty good look at this, and it was intensely bright. as i'm looking at it i'm trying to process everything about it. i was expecting this to look as if it was a falling star or a heavy meteor but it wasn't any of those things. \r\n \r\n i noticed that this light had a somewhat definite geometric shape. it was square with pointed corners. the edges of the square were slightly concave, just a slight bend which didn't make it look like a traditional square.\r\n\r\n the object seemed to be glowing all over. which made it seem more like a light than something that was being lit up. the best way that i can describe it was a rapid flickering not unlike a strobe light, but whereas a strobe has a brief pause between flashes this has no pause. i might even go so far as to say it was twinkling.\r\n\r\n this square also seemed to give off a corona or halo of light around it as it moved, not unlike the corona you would see around street lights after being in the swimming pool for a while. also, the corona around the object still remained fixed and did not seem to spin, which is exactly what one would expect of an object immiting light\r\n\r\n the square light seemed to be spinning as it fell out of the sky. the spin was in a counter-clockwise rotation. the angle that the object was very steep in relation to the horizon, so i knew this quickly would rule out the possibility that this was any kind of aircraft landing nearby.\r\n\r\n also there was no noise whatsoever as this object rapidly descended from the sky. the object also seem to fall in somewhat of a diagonal and downward location to the left, which at that time i attributed to its counter-clockwise spin. \r\n\r\n the object was very low in the sky, so low it seemed like it was going to scrape a rooftop or that if i had thrown a rock i could've hit it.\r\n\r\n  as i watched this square fall from the sky i noticed that it seemed to be generating a kind of trail behind it. this is somewhat of an internal debate with myself as to if what i saw was pieces of this object trailing off as debris behind it, several smaller objects falling behind it, or simply  the ocular, or visual flare, a \"trick of the eye\" so to speak; since what i was looking at was very bright and it hurt my eyes a bit after looking at it so intensely. but i will describe it as i saw it initially that night:\r\n\r\n what i saw trailing immediately behind the first square were two to three smaller sized squares and a red circular light, which seemed to flare yellow in the center.\r\n\r\n this entire object and its trail or flare, whatever the case may be, descended in the aforementioned diagonal downward direction below the treeline in what i could best judge at the time to be southeast towards the army base/downtown area. although the easterly inclination of fall would best lend itself to the area of the base or the i-35 n./loop 410 interchange.\r\n\r\n i remember thinking that this is not any kind of star or meteor i've ever seen. i grew up in a rural area and have spent a lot of time camping. i've seen falling stars and meteor showers. this was too low in the sky to be any kind of falling star. this was right over my head. \r\n\r\n this object didn't seem heavy. it seemed very light. i remember thinking to myself that this object seemed to be floating out of the sky rather than falling. however, i also thought to myself that this didn't seem to be the natural state of this object, that something was wrong and that is was in distress. the emotion of it just seemed akin to watching a plane fall out of the sky, rather than watching a falling star or meteor.\r\n\r\n at the time i saw this i remember thinking that i should really observe this thing. i had been hearing some talk of recent sightings of lights over the texas area, and also of a recent satellite collision. i remember processing this in my mind and asking myself, is this debris? is this a light of an aircraft? is it an aircraft?  i remember thinking to myself to look at the sky around the object, that maybe it was a light attached to something bigger. as i did this i looked around for a split second but the sky seemed normal around it; however my eyes were somewhat strained from staring at the light. when i refocused my eyes on the object it was just in time to see it disappear below the tree-line.\r\n \r\n i asked my two friends if they had seen this. \r\n\r\n one of them told me that it looked like a darker, bigger square or perhaps a triangular shape was around it. i believe he was insinuating some form of craft, but i did not see this. however, you must remember, he had to turn around to look at this, i was staring right into the light. it's entirely possible that he got a better look at the sky around the light than i did before he saw the light itself. so i did not dismiss his observation.\r\n\r\n the other friend told me that he had just seen the light. he turned around a bit slower than the rest of us. i think he might have thought it was a camera flash and looked around the yard first before noticing we were looking at the sky and then turning around to look himself. as i said it came right down into my field of vision as i looked up.\r\n\r\n there is one more addendum to this story.\r\n  \r\n two days later a friend of mine mentioned to me that he had seen \"something like a falling star\" that same night. i hadn't told him what i had seen yet and i asked him to describe it to me.\r\n\r\nthe following is what he told me:\r\n\r\n he was driving south on bandera rd. towards the direction of downtown. he was on the road in an area that is roughly 10-15 miles north/northwest from where i was.\r\nhe told me he was looking at downtown when he saw a streak of light fall from the sky over and to the left, but in front, of the downtown area. this would place the light close to my area. this completely surprised me because i didn't expect that anyone else might have seen this. i asked him what time he saw this light. he said he couldn't quite remember, he told me it was after he had spoken to me earlier that night. i looked at my phone and saw that his call was shortly before midnight that evening.\r\n\r\n i asked him if he could make out a shape or anything from where he was. he told me no, that to him it looked like a streak of light, but that it didn't start high in the sky, it started lower to the horizon. \r\n\r\n i told him what i had seen but he told me from where he was he couldn't make out any shape. i didn't expect that he would be able to from the distance he was, but i was more interested in the location of where he saw it. that it was definitely over the downtown area, was in front of the skyline, and lower in the sky than the stars.\r\n\r\n that is the end of what he told me about what he saw.\r\n\r\n now if you're wondering about the person seeing this thing. i must tell you, i take a skeptical approach to my belief in ufos. although i do enjoy reading of ufo sightings and such phenomenon, i don't lend myself to mass hysteria. i don't know if what i saw was a craft of some sort, it definitely was not what i would say would be the \"classic\" definition of a flying saucer. however, it was not something i was familiar with ever seeing in the sky.\r\n\r\n as i said before, i have been in rural areas with lots of stars in the sky. i have seen \"shooting stars\" and meteor showers both close up and far away. this was not like anything of that sort, and i was in the middle of the city, not many stars, even \"shooting stars\" can be seen through the street lights and haze.\r\n\r\n i have lived in this city and seen many different types of aircraft fly in and out of the military bases and airport here. this was not like any aircraft or aircraft lighting that i have seen. also there was no sound, military aircraft are noisy even flying high over the city, at the altitude this object was, if it was any type of aircraft the noise would've been deafening.\r\n\r\n i am in my mid-twenties, i am an educated and i would say fairly intelligent person, and i have no reason to think that me seeing this was any trick of the mind. i have two people who were with me that night and a third who was not too far away from the area see the same thing at the same time. i'm sure there were more people out there who must've seen it as well. the were a lot of people who would be on the road at about that time on a saturday night, also a military instillation close by, so the chances are not too slim. the one thing i wish was that i would've had my video camera, or that i would've been able to getout a cell phone and snap a picture or something. the whole incident happened so fast, literally in about 10 seconds, so the was little time to react in such a way.\r\n\r\n i walked inside afterwards and told the photographer whom was there that evening that they missed the best shot of the night.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1

seas. the night was very black. at the time of the sighting, we were patrolling the bearing sea north of the alaskan peninsula, bearing north at about 20 knots. \r\n\r\ni was on watch at the starboard 20mm gun, second deck (galley deck). it was around 2300. my gun turret was above the deck house and there were no obstructions hindering my field of vision, allowing me to have a clear 360 degree view of the sea around the ship. there were four of us together at the starboard gun (i can get crew names and captain���s name).  \r\n\r\nthe attention of both port and starboard gun crews was drawn to a row of red lights off the port side, traveling parallel to and slightly forward of the bow. i did not see the lights when they first approached so do not know the direction from which they came, or if they came out of the sea. there were at least eight lights in a row, evenly spaced, canted at about 15 degrees to horizontal. i would estimate the lights were no more than 100 yards from the ship. the lights held their relative position to one another throughout the sighting, and appeared to be about 10 feet apart. i would say that the light closest to the water (the lights were canted diagonal to horizontal at approximately 15 degrees) appeared to be about 30 feet above the water. \r\n\r\ni estimate that it would require a cantaloupe held at arms length to cover a single light. i could not see a structure associated with the lights as there was nothing but blackness between the lights. the lights were a very deep red and did not cast a beam.  the lights moved parallel to our ship, holding their position relative to the ship throughout the entire sighting. \r\n\r\nthe lights continued to pace the ship as i watched. this continued for at least one hour. i was relieved from watch at 2400. when i went below the lights were still visible. i was too tired to stay on deck and went below to sleep. the next day, the midnight gun crew said that the captain turned the ship and ���tried��� to chase the lights. i don���t know the outcome of this maneuver. i don���t know what the circumstances were when the lights disappeared. but i do know that i have not seen anything like this before or since.  \r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

see the christmas lights on the bluff.  my friend noticed an orange-ish or amber, fuzzy, pulsing light (smaller one nearby) which waxed and waned slowly behind the display/over the lake in the vicinity of chicago, and she wanted to see it better.  so we drove down to the beach. i thought it may be a plane circling o'hare going in and out of clouds which would explain the pulsing flare type light, but couldn't understand why it was amber colored. it didn't move but i figured we would be too far away to see the actual circling movement. the smaller was to the right of the big one (more toward milwaukee)and would phase out totally then come back. the big one then started to move toward us, now with white strobe lights (no longer an amber,fuzzy pulsing flare). the smaller one just disappeared. we then drove as fast as we could to the top of the bluff to see it better overhead as it came across.  at one point i decided to look under the lights instead of at the lights and thought i saw a humongous cigar shaped object, which struck me with fear, but i can't be sure about that because it was dark against a dark sky and its strobes were bright.  it strobed steadily, somewhat slowly, and made no sound whatsoever, over the vicinity of cleveland and hilltop roads in st. joe.  then it stopped high in the sky and looked like any star.  it \"sat\" there so long we finally gave up and went home. i was fascinated and alert during the experience and only felt fear when it was overhead and in front of us (when i thought i saw a huge shape). my friend neil also saw it that night, originally from his home's picture window, then from his car.\r\n   living by lake michigan and liking the beach (day and night), this hasn't been the first unusual thing i've seen. 2) in july or august of 1971 a friend and i saw two white lights (looked like stars) coming from the milwaukee area over the lake at about 11:30 p.M.  they bobbed side-by-side as if two pilots were having fun flying, when suddenly they darted across the sky at great speeds and at sharp angles.  3) also, in fall of 1973 at about 9:30 p.M. i was driving down the then-remote west q avenue in mattawan, mi, going toward 8915 west q, and felt i was being followed by an object in the sky (no other cars were around), but thought it just seemed like being followed since they may have been using i-94 (nearby) as a guide.  i didn't get creeped out until it was directly over the top of my car with a bright light lighting up my car. can't remember what happened after that. 4) a fourth incident was with my dad and i driving down a freeway on a sunny/totally blue sky day, somewhere in northern indiana (can't remember). we saw a very shiny (sterling silver shiny) silver disc-shaped object hovering in the sky. he saw it but denied it was a ufo, even though it hovered, was not a helicopter, had no wings, and was way above the power lines (he didn't want to have to deal with what he was seeing i guess!) 5) i've never seen anything up really close, but have 3 friends/acquaintances  janie and rose (one incident), and roberta (another incident) who did and both said it was the size of a football field.  one probably wouldn't talk about it to you (husband thinks she's nuts!) but the other probably would. keep up the investigations...This is for real, have seen enough to know it can't

had lights on it. i could see no people, but this plane flew at probably no more than 500 feet above the ground, at a speed too slow to sustain flight, made no sound, and flew on directly west until it was out of sight.\r\n\ti stood in awe of what i had just witnessed. what was that? why was it flying here? why so low?  why did i see it? what in the world was it?\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to the left of venus (but the same size - bigger than a star) as i headed south. i quickly realized the orientation of the two lights (unknown and venus) were changing. i stopped the car briefly to make it out. i confirmed this new light - the same size as venus but with a slight bluish tint was moving. i turned east unto woodcock cove so the light was now moving slowly but at a constant speed directly towards me. i stopped the car and got out to make my delivery keeping my eye on the bluish tint light. i realized it was much lower than i originally thought and while the light was the same size as venus now lower and to the right of it, this light was fairly close to me distance-wise. \r\n\r\ni also noticed that stars would vanish behind the light like they were being swallowed up. as i stared to make sense of it, the light cleared the neighboring tree branches giving me a totally unobstructed view. i could see the outline of a circular object that appeared to be roughly the size of a dinner plate with this light on the front edge. stars along the edges helped to make it distinctly stand out. at this point, the light stopped moving and this object hovered stationary for approximately ten to fifteen seconds. the bluish tint disappeared and it glowed solid white now - neither i nor it moving. the customer came to the door and i took my eyes off of it to make the delivery. the process took no more than 75 seconds, probably closer to a minute. when i was done with that, i looked up again. the light and circular outline were gone. i quickly checked both the direction it had come from and the direction it was going, but it had disappeared. i ran to the middle of the cove and did a full circle slowly to see if maybe it had simply changed directions but it was no where to be seen. \r\n\r\nmy sense of it was that it was pretty close to the ground - within 50 yards maybe. hard to say for sure with the lack of light, but that was my sense of it. it made no sound at any time. while i wish there had been more light to more clearly distinguish distance, i played a lot of football and soccer growing up and i feel quite comfortable that this object was 50 yards or less up in the night sky making no sound. it was moving east and stopped when i stopped to stare up at it. i should point out that this address is at the top of a hill, that the object had just cleared the top of the hill before getting to me. perhaps my distance perception is inaccurate given the apparent smallness of the object. all i know absolutely for sure is that it was above the trees and below the stars.\r\n\r\ni check the sky regularly during deliveries. i want to know when clouds are rolling in so that i don't get drenched without having taken proper percaution. venus is huge in the night sky right now so i stare at it four or five times a night. my initial thought was this was a second satellite (we have a total of five planets we can see this year). i then noticed the second light was moving after i stopped because the objects orientation was changing while i was moving, i couldn't tell if both were moving or just one and which one at that. by stopping, i could immediately tell that the new light to the south of venus was moving. once i saw the circular outline, my first thought was that it was nearly the same size as a helicopter appears to be when it is doing searches, but this was circular and silent. once it stopped and i could stare at it while stationary for several seconds, i realized it appeared to be very close to me - above the trees but not by much. when the light became brighter, the thought crossed my mind that it was staring back at me. i watched it move about six to eight inches in the sky over a ten to fifteen second period, but it was gone from view roughly a minute later. either the light went out and i missed the circular outline, or it moved much quicker once i stopped watching it. the only odd thing afterwards was that i developed a dull headache in my forehead within five minutes of viewing this unidentified flying object.","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"     i was at my cousins house, it was 2:05am, and i couldn't sleep. it was storming outside, and there were a few lights on in the hallway. there was a large, square fan across the floor from my bed, with a sliding glass window facing a dirt road and woods. the fan was on, and then, with a flash of lightening, and a boom of thunder, everything turned off, and became quiet.\r\n     no crickets, no fan, i couldn't even hear my cousins breathing. the power had turned off, and i felt something was wrong, so i looked at the window, and saw a faint glowing/shiny white light. getting up to investigate, i crossed the carpeted floor, and stood to the left of a large, dusty wooden bunk-bed, with the fan that had previously had power on high, now on my left side.\r\n     as i watched, i saw to orbs shoot out of the woods, and leave a trail of light, sort of like the aurora boreas, but they illuminated two trees that they had passed. they started to come up to the window, and quickly, not knowing if it was a dream or not, i looked around for what i could look for when, if i woke up, as evidence of this encounter.\r\n      placing my right hand on the dusty bunk-bed, i made sure to leave three distinct fingerprints in the thick layer of dust. assuming it wouldn't be enough, i grabbed the fan, and turned it diagonally to the right, while moving the switch which still read high, to off. all the while seeing the two orbs hovering outside of the window.\r\n      i darted a glance to the road, for headlights sometimes came up it at night, but there were no cars, when suddenly i heard a strange melody. it was almost like a humpback whale's song, only more soothing, like a lullaby. it filled my head, making everything seem like it was coated in a soft, white haze. my confusion sort of melted away, leaving a peaceful calm in it's wake, but my heart sped up so fast, it felt like it would explode out of my chest.\r\n      the orbs just hovered, but slowly, unwittingly, i felt myself pulling away from the window, but i wasn't done quite yet. there was a camera on the table that held the fan, and quickly i grabbed it, but as soon as i did, they left, swinging in a brilliant arc upwards and back into the woods, leaving that trail of light, like a comet of sorts.\r\n     quickly i went back to bed, the melody still ringing in my ears. the next morning, i woke up with the song still there, but this time it was words. they were of a foreign language, one that i had never heard before, but i remember those words, so strange, yet still understood: \"'watch for the red jeep'\". before anything else, i got out a pen and some paper, and drew a picture of what i had seen, and took time to check my markings. \r\n      everything was as it had been when i had moved it the night before. only, there were two burn marks on the glass. not dark, but still visible, they were placed where the orbs had been. we had taken a picture, but no matter what the camera, the marks didn't show. they weren't there, only visible to the naked eye.\r\n      i told my cousin of the events, and she laughed and threatened to put me in the hospital. i told her husband, and he was indifferent, but offered to have me show him the evidence. he studied the burns, and then we took a trip to the wooded area, where the lights had shown on the bark, there too were burns. he wasn't sure what it meant, but he then believed me.\r\n       to this day, i often see them outside of my window, on a dark, stormy night. they still have a melody, but every time i hear it, it means something else. they visit me on the exact same day and time as the did the first encounter. as to the jeep, a few days later i had a dream about one, which proceeded to become true while my family was driving. my mom hit a red jeep, but i had told her to hit her brakes before i really knew what was going to happen. they don't seem aggressive, actually, they seem like they are trying to communicate, to get help.","distance":"20 Feet or
