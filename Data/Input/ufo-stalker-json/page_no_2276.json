a bright white spotlight shinning on an abandoned building to the left side of the street. the spotlight was moving around randomly and then crossed over to the right side of the street. at first i thought it was from a helicopter and out of curiosity i stopped the car and pulled over to the curb. after the spotlight was turned off, i could see a very large flying wing hovering just above the trees on a side street to my left. once my eyes became adjusted to the light, i could see that the craft had no vertical surfaces and had orange lights around the perimeter of the wing. i could see a large window area in the center area with a grid like window muttins like an old b-52 wwii bomber and a consol with a silohete of a person moving around inside. there was incandecent lighting in the cockpit area. the structure was flat black with a rough surface like graphite with rivets clearly visible on seams. i could see the spotlight on the bottom center in a ball like socket. the craft was silent and made no sounds. after about 5 or six munutes, it started to slowly turn towards the north and fly off in that direction.It took about 3 minutes to pass overhead and i would estimate the size to be about 300 to 400 feet with a thickness or height of about 15 to 20 feet. i tried to follow the craft in my car but got stopped in traffic. i thought it would be on the news but nothing was ever said about the craft. i thought it might be an experimental lighter than air craft. i have reported this to different agencies over the years but never got a response. this was not just a light in the sky, this was something close and very visible. i served as a radar techician in the army and  i know how to identify aircraft. all though this occured quite a while ago, i can still see it it

northeast corner of 6th and reed streets,in philadelphia,pa. talking with my uncle leon, and neighbor moe{both now deceased}. it was early evening we were standing there shooting the breeze,when all of a sudden a ball of light streak almost right above our heads, it was very large,bigger than the size of a tank,and less than a quarter of a block away, facing south on sixth,it seemed like directly over gerritt street, which is the next little street south of reed street,at a very very low altitude, flying parallel to the ground, from west to east,my guess is at less than a thousand feet high.\r\n the whole incident for me lasted about 5 seconds. this ball of light changed colors faster than my mind could register, red, green, blue, silver, yellow, in no order.It flew so low that, when it passed to the east of sixth street,i couldn't see it for the houses blocked my view, and they are only three stories high.\r\nthe next day when i went to work i read in the newspaper that many people had seen it and called into the authorities, and that the ball of light, landed or crashed into the atlantic ocean about a mile from resorts international casino hotel. which is about 48 miles from where i sighted it. what is a coincidence or not is that the incident happened very close to the grand opening of resorts casino in atlantic city. either the day of or the day after, not sure, i also went to the main library in philadelphia to look up this incident in the newspaper archives, but didn't have much time and was unsuccessful finding the article.\r\nalso i was asked to report this sighting by ken pfiefer one of your field agents.

with my life. sometimes i think the mayan theory and 2012 could be the second coming of christ execpt i want to move on with my life and go back to college. someone please please write me and tell me what this thing is. it is the first light you can see in the skies at sunset along with the moon. it is bright very very bright. it is always no higher up than a usual airplane. it moves across the sky as like the stars do, but much much faster. it goes from the south west hemisphere to the northern and dissappears every sunset. ive also seen other stationary lights but i will sit still on the porch for 10 minutes and the lights will go from one side of the tree bracnh to the other side very noticeable within 10 minutes. please help me move on with my life because i am now suffering from schitzophrenia and bipolar depression and it is turning me into a heavens gate like disaster although i am tame. i want to put this issue to rest. i need youre help so study this picture and email me

wormhole in the time of evening sky. it slowly went forward towards the arkansas-oklahoma border in the evening sky, the ship was very visible even at the altitude of no more than 400 yards this vessel was huge about 2 city blocks wide.  it was like it came out of a wormhole or something as i stood on the porch and looked up and and over my right shoulder.  wow there it was i called out to my mom in the next room and at age 70 she was as much in shock as i was eek!..Ohh my god i said to her there it is i told you guys as i had told my family many times at night i had seen strange vessels cruising the skies. i hurriedly walked out to the street corner for a clearer view as it went over my head towards the northwest. as it went out of my view the evening suddenly the sky went from evening to almost dark, and felt very eerie as the night went to a lighter shade dusk lighter than the left top photo sample. i have tried not to tell too many people about this even, so i feel i must speak out via the www. this even has really traumatized me in many ways as i hardly sleep nowadays. let me just tell you my life has completely changed after viewing this event, i also have had two other encounters with alien visitations, and it had taken me years just to try and recall those events, so what i always knew existed in my heart has become very real to me not only in the visual sighting, but subconsciously as well....\r\n \r\ni just left my elderly mother standing there as i ran from the porch to the corner of n 8th and q street, i stood there in awe under the street light as it went over my head, and yes i was very afraid at first but for some reason i had to get a closer look at the event.  something else very unusual occurred to me several days later this sighting, i began to itch profusely on my skin, and did not know why i began to itch, just did not pay much attention to it at first but this until several weeks later it got worse.  maybe, possibly i was exposed to some kind of radiation or something i'm sure what an i hope not, however; i'm still feeling the effect of the exposure from this event. i sent a report about this to art bell at a radio program called coastocoast.Com featuring mr. george noory, and i've received no response from them to this date feb.07  a few days later a strange thing happen to my computer hard drive when i tried to boot up to windows and i simply could not, i later found my hard drive had be completely erased by something or someone. all my e-mail's has been deleted as well, shortly after i reported the sighting.  so if anyone can help me possibly help me better understand what has happened to that evening, and since the sighting of this vessel.  you can e-mail me if you can with any helpful information that you may have and thank you very for your interaction, \r\n\r\na web-site rendering of the ufo event can be seen at this url:

florida, north east of highway 98 along the st. marks river. at 8:22 pm, feb.19th, 2009, we had just finished dinner when we walked outside and noticed a very bright object hovering at about 45 degrees, above the tree tops. at first i thought it may have been the bright runway lights on a commercial airliner going into tallahassee regional airport, but realized that was at least 25 miles away. this object remained almost stationary for a few min. then started moving slowly to the south. i was unable to determine how far away this object was due to the object changing in size, brightness, color and density. \r\ni want back to my camper, picked up my digital camera, and jumped on my 4-wheeler. i was determined to find a clear point of view and get some still pictures, and at present location the trees were obstructing my view. the two other witnesses remained at camp and kept a visual while i took the nearest logging road, which obstructed my view for a few minuets but was able to see this bright object threw the trees shortly thereafter.\r\ni saw that it was moving slowly south to south west, and followed for aprox. 3 miles until i was able to get a clear view and take a few photos, which did not turn out well due to the delay and flash. i then turned the camera on video, and shot apox. 4 video's ranging from 1-2 min each. after about 30 min. the object remaining on a south to southwest path, lost visual due to the trees, so i returned to camp. there i met up with the other two witnesses, and told them of the event. i was then informed that they had continued to witness the object over the entire duration of my absence, but in a north to northwest directons. it was pointed out to me once again but only visable for a couple more minuets before completely dissapearing. we then determined that there was infact two objects and i had taken after the second one while the were watching the first one. when i uploaded the video, i was surprised to find that once i turned the 4-wheeler motor off, that the audio picked up some sort of signal from the object during filming which i was unaware until the volume was turned up. each time the object morphed, it would give off a strange sound which can be heard on the video. i inhanced the photo's but was only able to blow up what looked like a globe with a cloudish texture, unlike anything i had

unbeliever\r\n(meaning he has not personally seen anything he could not identify until tonight) but now he is not so sure, after what he witnessed.\r\nhe was leaving our side road which leads to the highway from our house going to work. he had just called a friend he works with and was almost to the highway, coming to a stop at the stop sign when he saw a huge black object traveling over hwy 9. hwy 9 & i-44 intersect about a half mile from here. the area has those turnpike lights along the highway so the area is fairly well lit up. he immediately got off the phone with his friend & tried calling me as he had only gotten a mile from home. but his cell phone wouldn't work for some reason. he sat at the stop sign & watched it until it went over the trees which was over hwy 9 by now. his discription was, at first thought, it was a low flying commercial airplane but he could not see any wings anywhere on it.  it had 5 or 6 lights across the back, red & amber colored, in a straight line. the lights were flashing in a sequence of four then would pause and resume. it did not make any noise at all. he said it was about 1000-2000 ft in altitude, flying or gliding at a slow speed & it was huge. it was traveling south to north over the bridgecreek area. he said from the time he first saw it, the sighting only lasted about 2-3 minutes. we live in the general area where the couple had a sighting back in early jan. he is not what you would call a believer in ufo's but he said this was definately something he could not identify. if anyone else saw this thing tonight, i hope you report it on here.

(i am now 49) somehow, i was able to know how the flying saucer worked.  it had something to do with a force of energy which pushed out at the bottom of the craft, along with a corresponding force which sucked in.  it makes me think of what a hover craft is like only with much more force and no sound.  this was what was broken on the craft and the janitor had taken it inside to hide it while the entity was repairing it.  there was another little man somewhere in the room who was injured from the \"crash.\" i have no recollection of him except for the sensing that he was there and that he was hurt.\r\nmy mother recalls me coming home from school and talking about mr. swann and the flying saucer, (mom was concerned about me being escorted into the basement of the school by the janitor, but after asking me several questions was satisfied that nothing inappropriate had occured). but i never mentioned the little man.  something tells me i wasn't supposed to remember the man until later in life.  because, i did not remember the man until i was 29.  my school friend only remembers the craft, and described it as having no bolts or rivets (she grew up with a dad who flew a small plane and would know those terms to describe a plane).  she has no recollection of a \"little man\" but then again, she had fallen asleep when he appeared!\r\ni've told this story to friends and family only, for fear of being ridiculed.  my children are in this school, and it's been remodeled.  i have never asked anyone at the school about the craft or dear mr. swann.\r\nhe's got to be in his 80's now.\r\ni sure wish i knew what the little man was referring to when he said they were here to remind me who i was!","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15642,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4498948,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212009-0014","longitude":-79.9871764,"occurred":-84384000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-84384000000,"summary":"I was in 2nd grade and saw a jetson type craft and and little gray man talked to me.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/15642_submitter_file1__scan0001.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/15642_submitter_file2__scan0002.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:262343"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Dixon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i was seven years of age, a \"giant\" red fireball was observed late one night while lying in bed looking out the window at the stars above (most likely in the summer of 1965) near dixon, missouri. \r\n\r\nthe hugh red fireball appeared to be much larger than our house and i thought that it was just barely over tree top level. it traveled very slow for a metorite (maybe the speed of a small plane flying over, or slower).\r\n\r\nthe fireball was covered with and trailing red flames as it flew slowly by horizontal to the ground and not making a noise.\r\n\r\nexpecting a nearby crash from this giant ball of fire, i covered my head with my pillow awaiting the impact that never came.\r\n\r\nthe next day i heard on the radio that a large metorite was seen falling in the area the night before and a search was underway to locate it. i never heard another word about it. \r\n\r\nbeen watching the skies for many years now, and have never seen a anything flying across the sky this large, low, or slow covered with red flames of fire. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15641,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.9917061,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212009-0013","longitude":-92.0937783,"occurred":-147459600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-147459600000,"summary":"Huge red flame slow moving horizontal flying fireball.

when i noticed,what i thought was a slow moving \"jet\". it was headed east which is the normal flightpath for a lot of the lax air traffic. i then noticed a comercial airline traveling east bound that was higher than the object i was observing. also, there was a private airplane traveling east and banking left (a wide u turn) to head for the santa monica airport west, wich was much lower than the craft. it was moving so slowly that it couldn't have been a normal aircraft.  so i then thought it must be a blimp or baloon.  that's when i really noticed the shape of a triangle.  it was like a burnt-orange or ox-blood color and had some type of markings at the tip of each corner.  the sun had not set yet, so i could not tell if the markings were lights or what.  i've lived in the area for over 18 yrs. so i'm familure w/ the \"normal airtraffic and flight patterns of the lax and santa monica airports.  i urgently started looking around for someone that i knew to show them, but there were only random strangers about.  so i began asking different adults and teenagers to look at the object too. not wanting to plant suggestions of any kind, i was saying things like \"excuse me, i don't see that well, could you tell me what that is up there?\", pointing to the object, which had now stopped and was hovering almost straight above.  everyone i asked pretty much had the same initial thoughts that i had had...\"that's a jet...Oh..No...I think thats a balloon...No... it's...Uh...Hell i don't know what that is...Hey! you guys! look! what is that?!  i then thought, \"maybe i

went in the house and began telling him, \"man, there's a ufo hovering straight up, right now! he headed for the front and i was headed for the back door and told him,\"come-on, we can see it right

police helicopoter observer with the pasadena police department and flying night patrol.  the pilot was {pid1}.  in the n/e area of pasadena, very close to the foothills, we observed what appeared to be a militar sikorsky helicopter hovering very low over a residential area.  the helicopter was turning it's landing light off and on.  as we got close, it gained elevation and started heading wesbound.  being curious we started to follow it.  we were approximately at 1,000 ft. agl.  the military helicopter then appeared to lose altitude quickly as if it was going into autorotation.  then about 300 meters past it we saw what first appeared to be a large object looking like bunch of big balloons tied together.  the object was going at our exact airspeed, which was about 60 mph.  the object was round and appeared to be rotating.  i saw no lights on it. pat began yelling over the intercom that he was seeing a ufo.  i immediatley shut off our running lights so i could activate our \"nightstar\" search light.  the running lights were shut off becuase there would be too many amps going through the system with all the lights on and pop a breaker.  shutting off the running lights to power up the searchlight was s.O.P.  pat questioned what i was doing and when i told him i was going to \"light it up\", he said, \"no\" and turned the running lights back on.  we had a short argument about doing this or not but he got the final word becuase he was the pilot.  we watched the object for a few minutes and it flew abeam us going west.  we then noticed that there was some fog coming in in the l.A. basin, which was a signal for us to fly back to bracket field in pomona, where we hangared the helicopter so as not to get caught in the fog.  as we approached the west end of the city near the rose bowl, this object gained speed and in just a few seconds accelerated towards the l.A. skyline and disappeared out of sight.  the speed it went was faster than supersonic.  we were both amazed at how fast it accellerated.\r\n\r\nwe came back to the hanger and immediatley started making calls.  pat called lax to see if they had any such object on thier radar.  he got a \"negative\" from them.  i called jpl in pasadena to see if they had any kind of experiment going on and they said no.  i was taken back by the repsone i got from them becuase the person i spoke to sounded like this was an everyday occurance.  we both wrote an incident report and turned it in.  i kept this to myself until one day, about 2 weeks later, the police chief saw me in the hallway and yelled, \"hey al, did you see any more giant frisbees?\".  since that time i have told this story to people but never made a big deal about it.  i also never found out if anyone forwarded that report or investigated it further.  i left the pd in 1979 to join the san luis obispo county sheriff's dept.\r\n\r\njust thought i would tell this story to someone who would enjoy hearing it.  {pid2} passed away some time ago but i'm sure there are plenty of people that will remember tha story from the old days.\r\n\r\ni have attached a picture of myself with {pid3} taken around the time this happened.

winter of '87/'88 - i think it was about nov.  it was cold and the shore was a ghost town with no one on the dark two lane road through the pine barrens.  growing up in the usaf i had been around all kinds of planes and was used to seeing them with quite a bit of knowledge.  while talking to my date i was watching the c141 sized objects in a line just over the tree tops and they were slowly catching up to me. i was doing 55mph.  i thought nothing of it being used to seeing military planes all around the area. when the first one reached just outside my window about 180 yards away i realized they were going too slow and would fall out of the sky so i asked her to roll down her window and there was no noise at all as they all started to pass us.  she became terrified and they slowly made a large turn over the pine barrens and i just lost them.  i witnessed them for about 25 min.  i saw no objects since then the road was unlit.  the lights looked similar to a jet and were a large spacing the size of a c141.  after about half an hour we were on the deserted beach and suddenly the sky lit up with military action.  jets were everwhere flying low and over the ocean and forest inland.  they were so low that we ducked one time.  i knew they were looking for something.  then they just disappeared and stopped.  the next day my mother told me that a small military jet went down in manahawkin bay and that was right by where i was.  the pilot was rescued by a fishing boat.  my father knew nothing since he had already retired years before. what did i see?  \r\n\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\nc141 sized but no noise and flew 60mph very low - can't happen\r\nmilitary action just afterwards - why?\r\nplane down in area - coincidence?\r\n\r\ni've told very few people over the years and often wondered what i saw.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15631,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7263889,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02212009-0003","longitude":-74.8944444,"occurred":563961600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

(2-20-09). we were driving south from aurora, il to oswego, il and my 9 yr old watched it for the entire \r\n15 minute ride. i thought it might be a bright planet. when we stopped in oswego my 9 yr old, 5 yr old and i got out of the car and looked at the bright object. it was a glowing bright yellowish color and looked as though it might have rings around it. it was extremely large and stationary. i thought it was much larger than when i saw jupiter at it's brightest several years ago. \r\n\r\ni went inside and checked on www.Earthsky.Org to see if maybe saturn or another planet was visible tonight. well, saturn will be in march but it will be dim. venus is visible but it is dim and we saw it tonight. there were no reports of other planets being visible. \r\n\r\nso then i saw the ufo examiner website and saw the photo at the top of the page http://www.Examiner.Com/x-2363-ufo-examiner~y2009m1d26-bright-lights-in-the-sky. the object we saw looked just like the photo but not as flat. \r\n\r\nmy 9 yr old and i looked outside just before 9 p.M. to see it again but couldn't see it from the house. so at 9 p.M. we took a quick walk outside to try to find it and take a photo. the sky was clear full of stars and venus, but we did not see the object at all. it was gone.  the sky clouded over when we checked again at 9:34 p.M. and the stars are no longer visible. we're planning to check again tomorrow but snow coming into the area might keep the sky cloudy.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering
