to this date i have noticed lately an odd presence in our canadian skies particularly that over the ottawa valley. i was taking a stretch outside having a cigarette in my small rural town with very few lights to mask the skies with. since i was young i always had a stark interest in the skies above, especially at night, where its prime viewing where i live as its the highest point in the ottawa valley. i was walking along the street which has no street lights of any kind and i noticed a moderately bright light oscillating and changing colour.. red,green,gold,blue pulsating. to catch a better viewing angle there is a hill within a local park within walking distance of my house known as mckendry park. i stopped by my house picked up a pair of binoculars and thus proceeded to the point of interest. at first i was skeptical of even traveling to this place as it gives off some very eerie vibes and to make my paranoid self even worse there was clearly some sort of craft in the sky which i am supposed to believe is the work of pure science fiction the sort of stuff you see on the 6 o'clock news that your father has to mock in the close minded sense he lives in. i myself am respectably open minded seeker type so to speak, i attempt to wrap my mind around a lot of things people just disregard which is a waste of a life in all honesty especially in the times we live in now. i give my apologies in advance to those who just want some hard evidence and not a retrospective gonzo piece. i was standing on the top of a beast of a hill that was constructed to my understanding for kids to slide down in the winter its about a 50% grade.\r\n\r\n the sky was full of what looked like police cherries toned down except for one. i counted twenty-three and stopped so i could study the one that was the most intense, some of them were in a staggered line formation (i do have some military knowledge) i tried to work out possibilities in my head as to what they could be but really couldn't focus as i was always looking around at my environment not just the sky. i have read quite a few ufo accounts but i never felt that i would be writing one of these \"ever\" the lights were to the north-east and west just above ottawa. i could gauge that some were higher altitude than others due to light intensity. i figured it was probably military presence as barack obama was in ottawa the 19th. but this was not the first time i witnessed these lights, though not in this great number, during the month of february on a clear night one can look out their window if they're in the proximity of a suitable location and see what i have seen to some extent. for reference of time, first contact about 2:20am, on the hill roughly 3:15 due to the extremity of climate that i live in i was only there for about 30 minutes it was about -20 that night. i hope to see more accounts of activity over ottawa possibly on the news, though that usually turns out to be bad press so i doubt anytime soon though its a shame really i witnessed something amazing yet the only evidence is my word and i stand by it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15616,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.4311696,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-02202009-0008","longitude":-75.6879931,"occurred":1235030400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

(the police usually deploy a eurocopter). but from visual and audible clues i estimate that the machine was at 150 feet, half the normal operating height in this area, due to a number of tall transmitter towers. if all the lights were on a single helicopter it would have had to have been chinook-sized, and about  50 yards from me. however, the sound was not that produced by this particular type, nor did i experience downwash. if the lights were on two separate craft then they were flying in a perilously low and close formation above a densely populated area. this 4i observation may or may not be of significance. (4i = insufficient information impedes identification). but i thought i would report it to you, as there have been incidents in wales, birmingham, and brighton. where constabulary aircraft have encountered/pursued/recorded anomalous aerial phenomena.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15612,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.628611,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-02202009-0004","longitude":-0.748229,"occurred":1235105400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1235105400000,"summary":"Unusual event.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"High Wycombe, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:263122"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Austin","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"If you haven't heard of the \"fireball(s)\" that streaked over austin around noon on sunday, 2/15, then it's your lucky day. i was sleeping late on sunday when my bed lurched far enough above my bedroom floor to wake me up.  i sat upright and called for my wife.  she was downstairs in the kitchen when the \"lurch\" occurred and had lost her footing.  we have two dogs and they both freaked out when the \"lurch\" occurred and jumped over a 6ft fence and i've only found one of them.  all was quiet until around 4:00pm when continuous sonic-booms echoed over north central austin.  i thought i was hearing fireworks which is not unusual in my neck of the woods as some new shopping center is celebrating a grand opening weekly -- but the frequency and intensity of the reports -- not to mention the fact that they were happening in the clear light of day, struck me as odd.  \r\n\r\nyou can go to www.News8austin.Com and watch the video for yourself.  cnn has already purged it from their files which is odd as as they were the first to pick up the video and report it globally.\r\n\r\nif you see a pug that answers to babette, please let me know.

(it was definitely not a helicopter and this is the second time i have spotted a white morphing changing shaped white object in this vicinity over dia).\r\ni had my variable powered binoculars with me, so i was able to get the object in view at 20 power.  it was very slowly drifting north , so i increased the power setting all the way to 80 power.  what i saw was quite strange.  it was basically a white spherical object that seemed to be changing shape, and perhaps rotating, and continuously morphing into an oblong shape and then back into a sphere about every second or two.  i watched this object for about 5 minutes and realized it was moving against the prevailing surface wind and seemed very high up.  while the object was in view, i was startled by the appearance of another dark object that zipped by so fast in the field of view that i could not tell what it was.  (slim chance it was a bird, but i got the feeling that it may not have been).  i also noticed a kind of glowing mist surrounding the white object, and what appeared to be a dark surface circle embedded in the middle of the white object that reminded me of a bathysphere like appearance.  i am reporting this event because of the strange morphing and changing shape plus the somewhat glowing mist like appearance surrounding the object.  if anyone knows what this tiny white sphere like object changing shape with a surrounding mist could be other than a high altitude weather balloon or a true ufo, please respond.  i will be watching the 20 latest reported sightings for the next few days.  thank you.    \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":15608,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5527344,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02192009-0021","longitude":-104.9662856,"occurred":1235072700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1235072700000,"summary":"Small white sphere changing shape with glowing mist surrounding it.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Highlands Ranch, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:263126"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Casa Grande","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Two fireball colors of an obeject in sky. one lit up and streaked across and another one lit up and follows the other and went out, then one lit up and kept bursted 4 times about 150 yds apart, and went out. approx 5mins later 2 lit up and bursted across in the sky and went out, another lit up on the other side of it.

(the nearest military instillation being ft. hood some 80 miles away). we both continued to watch the sky hoping for another glimpse. suddenly there is a brilliant flash, very much like a camera flash going off on the other side of a stadium. this was near where the first two craft had vanished. i had never seen, heard, or been educated about anything like this flash before. perhaps an explosion? so now we were set on observing the sky. this is where it gets freaky. i was in no way prepared for what we see next. my grandmother's home is the flightpath of incoming and outgoing dfw traffic. there was a northbound 747 passenger airline. we could not help but to track it too since it was in the same vicinity of sky we were already watching. suddenly there was a very large, and bright star-like orb directly tailing the plane. my stomach literaly sank. i feared that this thing was going to harm the airliner. it followed the plane for nearly five minutes, matching the planes airspeed and appeared to be at just a slightly higher altitude. it then sped up to the plane at intense speed and vanished over the tail section of the plane. at this very moment another one of these objects appears from the same spot as where the object we had just seen vanished, first appeared. it shot directly over our heads, causing me to fall backwards. it simply vanished overhead. i was in a state of shock. these things had interacted with a passanger jet and now with us. about an hour later, at sunrise, my friend says he watched a star i had also observed, just after i had gone inside to wake up my family and scan the news channels for any coverage, vanish. in his own words it was as if a light was just switched off. the star was brilliantly bright, producing the same amount of light as the morning star. i went outside, it was still twilight ; the star, gone. i am a first responder in the state of california, a volunteer cival air patrolman, and another observer of the real unknown. i've expierianced near post dramatic stress symptoms since the sighting. i believe that at this time, on this planet, we ( humans ) do not possess the flight computer tecknology, propulsion, or ability to create the appearance these things had. hope this helps somehow, and good look to those still hoping to have the truth revealed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":15590,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2046465,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02192009-0006","longitude":-96.6379522,"occurred":1192444800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Fireball,  Flash,  Saturn-like,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1192444800000,"summary":"Aereal phenomenon; 4 definitive ufos, bright flash, and a dissapearing star.","tags":["ufo","flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"McKinney, Texas","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:263139"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2277}
