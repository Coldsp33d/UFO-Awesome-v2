night i went on my usual walk with the dog around the race course and noticed a small man standing about 200 meters away from me. i didn't take notice at first , but then as i got closer he started to wave. i walked up to the 5foot man and started talking about the weather , he then asked me if i had seen any shooting stars in the night sky tonight. i looked at him puzzlingly and he started laughing as though it was an inside joke. i told him that i regularly see them on my nightly walks. as i threw the ball for my dog to fetch i noticed a shiny blue/silver object over the other side of the lake , possible a craft?\r\nshortly after noticing the craft , the small 5 foot man , who looked just as human as you and me , threw the ball for my dog. i kid you not the ball went about 500 meters and my dog bolted off after it. i looked at this small man with shock and said to him \"dam , you've got a good arm mate\" . he laughed and said thanks. we talked a little about dogs and then the strangest thing happened. a thick layer of fog started to engulfed us making it impossible to see where my dog was (specially because hes dark black) and the craft like object was covered by fog aswell. at the thought of losing my dog i ran in to the fog looking for him yelling his name. \"max! max!\". after a few minutes he came wagging his tale and i was relieved. i turned to walk in the direction of the 5 foot man but couldn't find him. i searched around for about 5 minutes wondering where he could of went , because he could not have gone far. i walked over to where the craft like object had been and noticed it was gone , but where it had been was folded/crushed grass. it dawned on me that this guy and his craft might have been extraterrestrial ...\r\n\r\ni didn't think much of

bright objects so i started to get in the habit of looking up before i enter my home. take note that i never saw anything before that i would consider a ufo. anyways, i looked up a couple of times as i walked to my home. i then noticed a bright object far up in the sky, too far to tell the shape of it, which shot across the night sky going in a direction away from me. it had a long bright exhaust that seemed to blast out and disappear as fast as the object was visible. it lasted about one second. in fact, if it weren't for the bright exhaust i probably wouldn't have noticed it. the exhaust didn't gradually stretch out or gradually disappear. it was like a quick lightning flash behind this object. when the object left, the exhaust left, which was only one second. \r\n\r\ndon't believe it to be a shooting star because it didn't seem to gradually get farther away in the distance. it seemed to have shot off so fast that it disappeared from sight. and it didn't seem to be something i saw in space. looked to be in the sky but high up. it went in a straight direction, level with the ground. \r\n\r\nnow i heard about military crafts that can fly at classified high speeds. perhaps this is a government vehicle?\r\n\r\nwell i continued to look up at the sky for a few minutes after i saw this. didn't notice anything else so i went into my home. \r\n\r\nas for how i felt, i was excited but

shape and seemingly close to the trees.  they formed roughly a rectangular shape and moved in formation, like a flock of birds caught in the wind or the waving of a flag.  as the front moved up and back down, the rest followed.  these \"stars\" shot up from behind the trees up into the air and back down.  they did a sort of back flip, soared back into the air and moved in a wave like pattern.  imagine aladin on his magic carpet riding in the sky doing flips.  that is what these \"stars\" did.  as they crossed the street, still suspended in the sky, they went back down to my right and kept on moving towards the south.  i turned right at the three way and attempted to follow them until they got out of sight.  the total time from when i spotted them until they disappared out of sight was maybe 20 seconds or less.  after a little further investgating, i discovered the \"stars\" came from a corn field.  i have yet to figure out what they were.... and unfortunately i was not able to get

yet), but my job consisted of driving around the county all night checking on things. one night when i was stopped at one of my stopping points, i noticed these unusally brite lights in the sky, there were two of them. at first i thought nothing of it except that they were strangly brite and moved very little, if any. well, i began seeing these things every night. i noticed they would come out over a tree line at about the same time every night, (between 2:30 and 3:00 am). they would always be the same distance from me, (between 1 and 2 miles). at first, for several weeks, i couldn't tell anything about these (craft) except for their really brite lights. then one night as i was approaching the area where they always were, i came upon a four way intersection where one corner had one of those really brite street lights. well, being used to this from driving the same area every night, i knew that tipping mt hat would keep the street light out of my eyes,(as this helps to see the intersection more clearly). but when i passed through the intersection and lifted my head back up i was still being blinded by a extremly brite light. i quickly hit my breaks and pointed my search light toward the (craft),(as my job required one on my truck). when i did this, the (craft) turned its light off. there, not 100 feet from me, and no more than 30 to 40 feet high, was a flying (craft). this craft was no more than 12 to 14 feet tall, and 5 to 7 feet wide at both ends. i say, at both ends, because it was in the perfect shape of an hourglass. it just sat there a few seconds then took off paralell to the road. i took off and sped up and we stayed side by side for about a mile untill it shot across the road and met back up with the other (craft). once there, it turned its light back on. just to see what would happen i again turned my search light on the object. when i did, it would turn its light out again. every night after that they would still come out at the same time and every time i would spotlight them they would turn their lights off. as soon as i turned mine off they would turn theirs back on. this went on every night all summer long. one night i seen them take turns flying through a violent thunderstorm. one would wait motionless untill the other came out, they would flash their lights at each other like they were communicating, then the other would fly in. one would always wait on the other to come out before entering the storm. i wish now i would have contacted someone with the proper equipment to videotape these (craft), but at the time i was afraid of ridecule. not to mention i was still having a hard time believing what i had seen that one night and was still seeing every night after that. i know of one other person who seen one of these objects. it was at the 4th of july fireworks display. they said that one flew over the display and before they could tell me the shape of it, i said, let me guess, it was in the shape of an hourglass. their eyes became wider as they ask if i had seen it to. i informed them that i hadn't just then but i had been watching them every night for some time. they asked what they were and i said, you tell me. i know this story sounds to wierd to be true, but i know what i saw and would take a polygraph test for anyone at anytime to prove it. i finally decided to get this off my chest and let people believe what they may. i'm stepping forward know because i've recently been watching, ufo hunters on the history channel. they taught me that theirs alot of other people out there thats seen strange objects also, and for that i would really like to thank the gentleman. i'm planning a trip back to the sightings this summer, (as its not very far from where i live). with any luck, since they were indeed there all summer, maybe they will be back. if so, then hopefully we can prove to the world that there is something strange in our skies, especially at night. oh, before i go it might interest you to know that i do not believe in life from other planets, but there is strange (craft) out there. one last thing i would like to note. just like we've all heard before, these (craft) were completely silent. even as close as i was to the object that night, i heard nothing. not even when it accelerated away.","distance":"21-100

afraid.  i was not even interested to be honest.  it's just the second time i have seen this object and i cant explain it.  i have been leary to tell anyone about it for fear they would think i was

of me about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon i noticed several white objects moving toward me at an angle. they were grouped pretty tightly and not in any kind of formation. i started to run through what they could be, jets, birds? then it got real weird. they dissapeared and then reappeared whithin a second or two.At this point they were almost above me and i pulled over as soon as i crossed the dam.I got out and looked above me to the east.They seemed to just appear suddenly.It looked like about 7 objects white, and at times round but then angular and more elongated. as they moved they would glint in the sunlight.I was wearing polerized sunglasses and when i lifted them to look they wernt there and then when i put them back on there they were.This could have been just the glare from the sun but i thought i would mention it.They moved slowly and changed direction often and quickly, at times they just dematerialized and then reappeared again.After five minutes or so they dissapeared and i didnt see them anymore.I did notice two jets flying close together right were i had just seen the objects, they were smaller and lower than airliners, like a leer type jet maybe.Also there were two chinook helicopters in the area around the lake at the same time.I am near fort hood and seeing helicopters is common but i thought it was worth a mention.I got in my truck and headed down the road bewildered by what i had just seen.\r\n     about one mile or so later i spotted these things again, but on the west side of the road and heading east.I followed them with my eyes until they seemed to dissapear again.As soon as i could i pulled into a church parking lot and got out. i scanned the cloudless sky for them but saw nothing.And then suddenly there they were coming toward and over me.I got a really good look at them.They seemed to change in number, some appearing and some dissapearing randomly, also they seemed to change shape and not be very defineable.Most seemed to move together in unison but some would do there own thing moving at angles and in circles.At one point they seemed to be descending rapidly and then they continued on to the northeast and just vaporized in seconds.\r\n    i have tried to rationalize what i saw but what could just dissapear and then reappear.I feel these were not material objects, it felt like i was seeing something unreal if that makes any sense. either i am totally nuts or i saw something bizzare.If there is an explaination for these things i wish i knew.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path with directional

capehart rd, i happened to glance east and noticed an unusually bright \"star\" sitting at the 10 o'clock position, approx. 60-70 degrees off the horizon.  i have been avid astronomy for over 25 years and know the brightest stars that occupy this area of the sky to be sirius and procyon.  i���m also fairly certain it was too early for regulus or alphard to be that high above the horizon and they aren���t as bright.  i estimate it was magnitude 0 at the peak.  the object caught my attention since i knew there shouldn���t be another star that bright in the area.  it was also changing brightness levels.  i don���t believe there were any clouds to cause the brightness fluctuations and the weather history for that date verifies this:\r\n\r\nhistory for omaha offutt, ne\r\nmonday, february 16,

lights as found on normal aircraft.  there were about 3-4 other jets in the sky that all had the normal strobes and lights on them.  this object then seemed to vanish after about a minute, so i pretty much forgot about it as we were approaching our exit onto capehart rd.  as we got to the exit ramp, i noticed it had returned.  a commercial airliner was flying east in the same section of the sky and this object almost seemed to make a maneuver to avoid crossing paths with the jet, then settled into a steady glide in a west-northwest direction.  i had pulled onto the shoulder and asked my passenger melissa to take a look and she saw the exact same thing.  we were both very intrigued that it seemed under intelligent control, i.E. it didn���t simply streak and fade, or have any sort of greenish trail like a meteor.  after watching for another 30-40 seconds, the object made a banking maneuver north in a deliberate fashion and then slowly faded from view.  a very impressive event for us!\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

so i'm guessing that was west.  first noticed the object moving across the water from my ten o clock.  the reason it caught my attention was because of the speed of the object.  the lights were so close to the water that at first glance i thought it was a boat, but i had never seen a boat that size move that fast.  then i got to thinking it might be a helicopter, possibly military/drug enforcement, especially when the craft moved about 200 yards from shore.  from what i remember the craft hovered in place for about 20 minutes.  i'm pretty sure it was at least that long because like a mad man i ran to the hotels front desk asking for binoculars and tried to explain to the concierge that i wasn't crazy nor a pervert.  after running to our room to tell my parents about what i was seeing i ran back to the beach to see if it was still there.  i observed the craft for about ten more minutes, during that time it was still stationary.  i saw a greenish light emitting from underneath the craft and illuminating the ocean below.  from my vantage point it appeared as if the light from the craft was either moving up from the water or  pulling water to the craft.  i've never seen anything like this so it's hard to find the words to describe it.  once it started moving out towards the open ocean is when i knew it was an airborne craft just due to the speed it was displaying, nothing like gone in an instant, but moved out towards the horizon within a ten second range.  it's something i'll never forget but due the dark skies it's hard to know for sure if it was a helicopter.  i also remember making absolutely sure that what i was seeing was what i was seeing, because for a few minutes it kind of freaked me out.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15570,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":25.06544,"location":null,"logNumber":"BS-02182009-0007","longitude":-77.33618,"occurred":857116800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":857116800000,"summary":"Three

looking closer, the lights at first appeared to look like small planes.  but then i noticed that they were flying really low, so i thought they were helicopters.  then one would shoot up really high, higher than a helicopter could go.  several of them would fly close together, then shoot apart.  they were triangular in shape and had at least 3 different colored bright lights, red, white and either green or blue.  they were also silent.  they appeared to be coming from the sw direction to ne.  there is a hill that they would disappear over and that area appeared to be illuminated, although we can't see down to that valley from our house.  i had my mother come out right away, and she saw the same things.  by the time my husband came outside, they had already started to disappear.  it then seemed that there were either helicopters or several planes flying around, more than we'd normally see, but they weren't the same types of crafts as we had seen 15 minutes before.  i did call the township (radnor) to ask if there was anything going on near either the androssen farm or the highschool, and they didn't have any events noted.  i told him about what i thought i'd seen and said that i've lived in this house for 12 years and hadn't seen anything like it before.  he asked that we call back if it continued.  \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw them i was amazed, not worried, just sure that it was something unique.  when my husband came out, he was trying to sign a bright spot-light we have on them, but that didn't illuminate them, it just made it harder to see them.  i'm not sure how long they were out there before i came outside, but they flew around for about 10 minutes, then just disappeared over the hill and too far away for us to see.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

moon was in opposite sky then i thought maybe skylab or meteor or something the light was very bright and blurred it had a fog like cloud coming off the bottom the sky was clear with no clouds that night the fog was moving randomly around no solid edge i tried to shield my eyes from the glare to see if i could focus better by holding my hand up was then i could see a light coming down towards me almost like 3-d that's when i went inside to get my cell phone to try to get some proof of what i was seeing i went back to same place as before held up cell above my head an took a picture i then moved over about 15ft and took one more while i was standing there i looked at the light on my phone screen to see if it was moving any seemed to be in same place not moving so i walked back to my original spot i was standing looked up again the light seemed to be coming right for me pulsating like 3-d then i got a very bad feeling something was wrong that i should go back inside it was a scary feeling that came over me that i only get in life threatening situations emergencies an such i sat back down to watch tv started feeling very sleepy next thing i remember i woke up about 1:30am my eyes were burning as if i had flash burns from the sun my pillowcase sheet and front of my shirt were wet i removed them put some ice on my eye lids and went back to sleep i awoke at 6am to get up my eyes were normal again just slight stinging by tear ducts i don't know why i feel asleep so early was'nt sleepy was waiting on a tv show to come on at 8:00pm that made me wonder what happened that morning i looked at my pictures when i zoomed the picture in was amazed of the shape the light turned out to look like solid shape of some type of craft while looking also found a small ball of light coming from the light that when zoomed in has a image of a face of some type of rodent looking face with large eyes everyone that has seen the picture says it gives them the creeps and they are amazed this is the best that i remember that happened wasn't expecting anything unusual that night all took place pretty much like i described have the pictures on my cell phone not sure how to load them for your viewing. thanks","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

appeared out of no where this time about 9:15pm and looked star-like but got really bright and was stationary for about 10 minutes.It slowly moved west,and i mean slowly,and made its way past the front of my building.I looked at it through binoculars most of the time and it changed colors from half of it green and other half red when it was stationary.When it moved,it began to blink andthe lights on opposite ends would blink.1 red,1 green 2 white on the middle of each side would not blink-also yellow like.The craft looked rectangular or diamond like in shape,very drak in color.Very unusual craft.It obviously has good control over what it wants to appear to look like.My husband saw this also-he couldn't figure it out but he didn't see it with binoculars either-'cos i was so
