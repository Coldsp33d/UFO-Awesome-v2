stars. we were getting tired so we were heading in. we were going down my driveway to the house when we saw a yellow glowing oval object to the south. it came up from behind the trees but like when something comes over the horizon, so not directly behind them. we stopped and watched it rise up. when i put my arm up it was about the size of my pinkie nail. it came up about a thumb length and just stayed there for about a minute. then it began to flash. it did this for about a half a minute. then it completely disappeared for about 10 seconds then it came back but not as the glowing\r\nobject but as flashing lights. the lights were red, blue,green,yellow,and white.It stayed in the same place for about half a minute the started to move to the left or east of our position. it moved very slowing at first them went very fast and went the same distance in half the time.\r\n      at first we saw it we thought it was a hot air balloon or some sort of fireworks. we were very interested and a little cautious. i thought about getting my camera but didn't want to miss it. \r\n      then we got a little scared because when it got to the point when it was almost straight east of us we looked back at the place in the sky that it came form and saw another one it came up in the same fashion but took less time to flash and turn into the flashing lights. the one that was flashing turned into the flashing lights and went in the opposite direction of the first one and disappeared. \r\n     while the second one was coming up and flashing another two came up in the same way and went off in opposite directions. when they were all gone we went in the house and called my science teacher. he didn't know what it might be and told us to contact the local authorities. i called the none emergency center and reported the incident. they told me that they would send a person out the next day. they never came or called back.\r\nwell that is my ufo account.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

for the night. we were both looking up at the stars and constellations when suddenly kim exclaimed, ��� look at those lights. they just suddenly turned on. all of a sudden they just came on.���  while she was talking and pointing i looked and saw three bright lights that had the appearance of powerful mercury vapor lights, which emitted a yellowish-white-orange color in a downward direction as if mounted underneath something. i was surprised at the sight because i think i have seen most aircraft light configuration, but this was strange. she said that it must be an airplane. it was moving toward us, but it was too large to be moving too slow. i told her to keep watching while i went for the camera. when i returned within ten seconds it had moved almost straight above us at about 10 -11 o���clock angle. as i started to take a shot it began to dim, and i told her that it was going to fade out��� but it:  brightened again for 2 to 3 seconds, went out for a couple seconds, came back on for 3 to 4 seconds, went out again for a couple seconds, then a very dim red and green light came on and stayed on. then i was totally confused because no. 1) this object is moving even slower than an ultra-light plane.  no. 2) the on and off light sequence was atypical of common air traffic in our area.  no. 3) the sudden appearance of these ominous bright yellowish lights at less than a mile away. and lastly, the fact that it had red-and-green navigation lights, not to mention there was no sound at all. kim and i both concluded that the behavior definitely was not that of an airplane. maybe it could have been a blimp at low altitude, but it is a violation to navigate without lights. \r\n\r\ni snapped off four pictures but my digital was set at 400 iso and the lights smeared leaving them totally useless. i resolved to believe that it was an airplane until i decided to see if any like sightings had been reported. bingo, i found one on mufon submitted 2-17-2009 from ohio, which has a ���craft.Jpg��� illustration. it appears to have the same lighting and behavior that we witnessed. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

summer and i'm almost positive i was between 6 and 8 years old. probably closer to 8, so around 1990-1991. \r\n\r\nmy brother and i were outside in the yard and noticed what at first just looked like 2 early evening stars until we saw them move closer together. one of them was still, almost like it had been there and waited for the other to get there. and not only were there no stars in the sky yet, but the objects were perfectly round and the light was pure white and uniform in clarity and brightness. no flickering, no fading. after a minute or two or three of not really thinking twice about it, we noticed the lights directly over us/our yard. we jumped on bikes and rode through the neighborhood to see where the lights would go. the lights followed and stopped directly above us in the middle of a cul-de-sac. after a couple minutes of watching, we could hear planes and within about 30 seconds we saw the planes come up over the tree line in the direction of the lights. and i can't remember how many planes. i believe as few as 3 and as many as 5. \r\n\r\nonce most or all of the planes were in plain sight(a few seconds), the lights took off. from hovering still to a speed at least 1.5 times the speed of the planes in the blink of an eye(though maybe closer to 2 or 3 times the speed of the planes). like the objects defied any kind of law of acceleration or aerodynamics. the objescts disappeared behind a treeline adjacent to where the planes had come from and that was the last we saw. \r\n\r\ni wish i had reported this earlier, but am glad i found somewhere to do it now. i'm also very curious as to whether anyone in my area saw the same or similar lights that day/evening.\r\n\r\nthanks so much for your time and i apologize for a somewhat clowdy recollection of

to have been spring  a friend and i were in my room and funny we were talking about ufos from what i can remember i had just gotten into them and something told me to look out the window and when i drew the curtain back there right not even a foot above a telephone pole was a silver shaped disc no sound at all and it was just hovering over the pole i looked and looked again  and i asked my friend to look he got excited and so did i and we went running into the dinning room screaming to my mother to come look she got excited and wanted to go around the back through the back yard to look at it i can't remember if she looked out the window and then we went or she took our word for it ?\r\nby the time we reached out of the back door and on to the patio there it was over our neighbors roof these were one story houses and very close together and we just kinda stood there watching it hover it looked like liquid sliver not bolts or seems no doors or windows anywhere on it i remember looking very carefully for those things. then we stood there for about 5 min just staring at it i could have thrown a rock and hit it thats how close it was the day was bright and clear as a bell.\r\nthere were 4 of us my mother , little brother and my friend from across the street \r\nmy mother went over and climbed the fence we had a over lapping wooden privacy fence she climbed it as this was going on i noticed that it had lights pulsating around the middle they were on and slowly going round it it was slowly very slowly turning but yet looked almost at a stand still just floating about only a few feet from the roof peak and kinda at a tilt .\r\nas my mother climbed the fence she reached out to it why i don't know she never has said but,as she reached up to it as she did we (the three kids just stood there at that point silent watching )\r\nthen i don't know why it started turning faster like picking up it's rotating speed but not real fast and the lights picked up their rotation speed at this point i guess it hit me my mother is right under it and i remembered from either reading or something just told me to and i calmly called over to my mother if you don't bother them mom they wont bother us she then turned her head and looked back at me and realized what she was doing but i still don't remember being that scared really just cautious maybe i don't know she ran back to us kids and because she did so i think that scared us more then the disc being so close did and then we ran back into the house just into the door and stopped for like a second then then my mother and i looked at each other and smiled real big like we can't miss this call us crazy we ran back out to see what it would do next by this time it was hovering over our back yard but by this time it was up higher in the sky and it just stayed there hovering for a few minutes like it new we were coming back out and we looked up and started to wave at it we new it was leaving at this point don't ask me why and all of a sudden it shot straight up into the sky like a bullet and disappeared  into the sky  and thats my first encounter we didn't take a picture because we didn't have film at the time and decided not to report it cause back then you only had as far as we knew the police or the military to reported it and i told my mother not to call them \r\ni am now 43 years old and have seen many since then day night time not as close but with in the area i have lived within a 10 to 12 year period basically 4 more since i'll never forget it ","distance":"20 Feet or

backyard, whenever my family and i see these paticular lights it is usually around the same time each time between 6pm and 6:15pm and ends around 11pm and 1pm or maybe longer. this light is very brilliant and i have ruled out that it is a planet or some type of satelite etc; we see this brilliant beautiful sparkling light that changes colors and appears to move just slightly. please note this is the 3rd time we have seen these lights and each time, especially tonight, we saw multiple planes/jets flying near and around its path, once planes got closer the object seemed to disappear before, but tonight we decided to do a little more investigation and we wanted to get in the car and drive to get a better clearer look, when to our surprise once we got into the object was in the front of our home instead of in back, we were assuming before that it was disappearing when in actuality it was moving to the front as soon as the planes attempted to get closer. also tonight was more amazing than the previous times we had seen the object, because we actually saw the object do a zig zag type of movement when the planes/jets get closer. never in my life have i seen at least 4 planes/jets near each other trying to get near this thing!!!! it was so hard to believe we were actually watching this happen. then all of a sudden another light came from behind the trees and appeared to be rising and we thought it may be another jet but it was going so fast and rising from a very low point. it was going at a rapid speed and i tried to follow it with binoculars but couldn't keep up. but what i did see was a bright light gliding up and it didn't have any type of wing span and then all of a sudden it just too off!!  i want to cal someone so bad to ask what is going on with all these planes surrounding this thing, but i don't know who to contact to see if in fact the planes/jets are chasing something or trying to get a better view of what is going on, but i have no idea who to call about this at all without sounding crazy, any suggestions? it seems like the objects are coming more often now, and there is still the mystery of the strange footprints that were in our back yard

january.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"07:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":15541,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.5714409,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02172009-0003","longitude":-72.6488888,"occurred":1234836900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,

head for about a minute then moved out over the pacific.  it disappeared in the distance while looking toward this direction:  21.248582, -157.859373.  it moved slowly at first but must have picked up speed because in the distance it became a small dot at about 45 degrees from our vantage point in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n5. it didn't look identifiable but i felt it was close enough where i'd be able to identify anything i was familiar with. i could have at least narrowed it down to helicopter, fix wing aircraft, etc.  i went for the camera after it had started moving west.  it floated straight out into the pacific. it seemed to stay stationary as it became smaller.  i realized that i captured it on film and more shots wouldn't be amy better since detail would be worse.\r\n\r\n someone on

traveling for another .5-.7 seconds towards the treeline behind the water tower.\r\n    the trajectory appeared to be heading into the east side over charlotte, and from my astronomy background appeared unusual because of the relative speed and color. i seemed about 1/2 the speed of most meteor objects and the duration of visibility after burning also lasted for a longer period. the color was an intense white light that would be a magnitude 5 times brighter than jupiter ( which is visible just after sunset in the east currently around 7 pm).\r\n    this could have been a very large meteor that did not burn completely, and the remains may have reached earth east to south east of charlotte. this however appeared to be at a slower speed, possibly close to a speed of a visible manmade satellite. [there has been recent news coverage of a  2 satellite collision last week (maybe around tuesday- wednesday). also there has been coverage of close range asteroids that were found last autumn, and several large objects that entered the atmosphere last october-november 2008. also, i saw one of these on 10/31/08 at 2:58 am and the color was yellow amber with a faster speed and longer visible

saw it, when i went outside to watch my brother leave my house to go home. i live in a 'bad' neighborhood. as i was standing in my driveway, it was a clear night and i could finally see some stars, so i looked, and saw this bright orange non-blinking light moving across the sky.\r\nmy brother was just into his car and was warming up his engine, i guess, but i pointed up at it, not knowing if he saw me or not (it's dark here, atm...) i also looked around the sky at that time and saw *2* other 'normal' aircraft with blinking lights, in 2 different directions...\r\n\r\ni called him a little while later and asked him if he saw what i was pointing at, and he said, 'no', he was doing other things at the time...\r\n\r\ni lost sight when it was behind one of my neighbors houses... the whole view

a cigarette.  i had seen a strange light in the sky for more than an hour, but assumed it was an airplane as we are in the flight pattern of indianapolis airport flights.  after i went back out and noticed it was still in the same location, i thought maybe i should look closer.  i came into the house to get my hd camcorder and returned outside where my wife joined me.  we proceeded to film the object and within a minute of starting to film, the object shot off further into the southern/southwestern sky at a very high rate of speed (i.E. in the blink of an eye).  we both observed this behavior through the viewfinder of the camera.  the object then slowly started coming closer to us again as you will see in the film.  during this time, it changes from a fiery object into a dim diamond.  \r\n\r\nwhen we saw the object shoot off at a high rate of speed, we knew we were not looking at an identifiable terrestrial craft.  this caused us to come a bit concerned, but we did not feel threatened.  after i came into the house to find a tripod, i returned outdoors and the object had disappeared completely.  please take a look at the video.  it is not clear to me what images might be created from chromatic aberrations or other digital video artifacts, but it is *very* clear that the object moved at an extremely high rate of speed.  i do have the original footage recorded at 1080p.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=trc-60lpvuc\r\n\r\nbest, l","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

first saw it last tuesday as a really bright light in the western sky over our mountains.  it starts out high in the sky at around 6:15.  it slowly moves closer to the horizon, occasionally adjusting it's altitude every once in a while.  the first night it was the only light in the sky because there were alot of clouds and very bright. my husband went outside at maybe around 7:00pm, he immediatly thought it was a ufo.  we looked at it through binoculars and could see a metallic craft.  we watched it until it went behind the hill in our view, around 8:21.  it was pretty easy to see because it was the day after a full moon.  after it went behind the hill, we got in our car and drove into town.  we could still see it, we drove toward it until it turned out it's light and it was gone.  every night since then, it has reappeared faithfully at 6:15. it is very easy to see because it's still pretty light at that time.  we watch it with binoculars until 8:21.  the first few nights, it slowly moved down, but the last few nights it has been moving all over the place when it gets close to the horizon. it goes side to side up and down and does a wierd little circular movement as it moves sideways.  we did take some pictures but our camera isn't that good.  have tried to get better pictures by friends who have good cameras, but they are not wanting to believe our story, so we haven't found anyone to take any good pictures.  i have been keeping a detailed journal for every night we have been watching it since it started. my husband reported it to our local newspaper, but he felt they didn't take him seriously, he also called the police the first night, but again felt they didn't take him seriously.  we can see it with binoculars, it has been there six nights in a row that we know about.  we feel it is kinda crazy that it's right there in plain sight for such a long time and no one really seems all that interested. i have watched it for a total of 12+ hours now.
