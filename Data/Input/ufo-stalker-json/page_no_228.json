southwest. we both commented that it was strange weather to moving in that direction. i started staring into the clouds to see if i could visually tell that they were moving away in a southwest direction. all of the sudden a dimly glowing orange object entered my field of vision, from the east headed west, as i stared at the clouds. i asked my husband \"what is that?\" as i pointed at the object. he did not have a guess as to what it was. as we watched it fly through the lower thinner clouds it became very bright before disappearing into much thicker clouds. we could hear the sound of a plane/jet during the approximate 30 second siting but saw no aircraft through the clouds or below the clouds. a couple of minutes after we heard the sound of a second jet/plane possible headed west from the east but did not see the air craft though or below the clouds. given the sound of an aircraft and the sun setting in the west i wanted to write it off as a jet or plane but i am unaware of any aircraft that would reflect the sun so brightly and vibrantly across it's entire

a beautiful hot day so i decided to go out in the hot sun and sky watch. i watched as many passenger planes passed over head i didn't see anything strange so then decided to focus my attention on planes in the distance. i spotted a passenger plane and began to watch and hoped to see something out of the ordinary, with that i spotted an alien craft that was moving up along the planes contrail towards the plane. once the alien craft was near to the passenger plane it matched the planes air speed and began to follow the plane. these alien crafts are checking out more and more passing aircraft's over this airspace. it is as if they are looking for someone or something. the mind really boggles to why they are so interested with our planes could some of these planes be carrying something else beside passengers? i continued to watch the plane and the alien craft as they flew across the sky. then after a while the alien craft seemed to lose interest with the plane and broke off it's pursuit and then flew off into nearby clouds away from prying eyes. the alien craft was oval shaped and was near enough the size of the passenger plane. another interesting thing to note is that there were also other smaller objects flying around in the sky. these objects were black and appeared to be spheres and were ejected by to the larger alien craft. it's truly bizarre. the

were taken at 1:31 pm while photograph three and four were taken at 1:44 pm. having witnessed many ufo on the same flight path going back and forth it leads me to believe that there must be an alien base somewhere in the vicinity. the area from where this ufo are emerging seems to be decoy country park. decoy country park has a very deep lake that was once a clay quarry. ball clay was found at decoy in the late 19th century and the clay was both mined and quarried at the site from 1850 until 1965. when the quarrying ceased the pit quickly filled with water and became the deep lake that we see today. i believe that these objects are going in and out of this lake undetected. i know for a fact that these alien craft have the ability to cloak and become completely invisible to the naked eye, furthermore they have the ability to enter the water without making a splash or any sound. i believe that there could be an alien base or a portal at the bottom of decoy lake and i also believe this is were the alien crafts are emerging from. decoy lake would be a great place to hide and be undetected. two years ago while investigating this area for any evidence of this i had an encounter with a pleiadian being. for me this is proof that aliens are in this area and that there is a base in the vicinity.

5/23/2017. \r\ni realize this is very old sighting but we can look and see if any other sightings were reported in the surrounding area.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nmy two brothers and i were walking home in the woods at about dusk, on a path, single file. we looked up and saw the most beautiful green orb flying very slowly over us towards the west. it made a crackling sound like electricity and the green was colored like the inside of a kiwi fruit. it was almost dusk, so we could still see light and there was no moon. we panicked and ran for home. i don't remember how i got home, but i beat my brothers home, and mom was mad. it was fully dark. my two brothers came running out of the forest a second or two later. it seems we lost time since the moment we saw the green orb and started running. \r\nthe trees we ran through were at least 30' high, and i don't remember seeing the orb disappear. \r\n\r\nmy family was working the bean fields outside stayton, and we worked for a family named red and anna stanley. \r\n\r\nmy brothers and i never talked about it until recently and i asked them what they remember. one brother said i wasn't with them and the other brother said i was with them, but they remember the green orb.\r\n\r\ni heard a man on coast to coast talk about being abducted and how he thought he had an implant in his hand. a three dot mark on his right wrist between the thumb and wrist. \r\nthat sounded familiar, i have had the same mark since i was six years old when i saw the green orb.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

perplexing. i find it very strange that some of these objects are using stealth technology to blend in to the sky and hide away from prying eyes while other objects are lit up like christmas trees and

and across the street from the 360' free-standing microwave tower at the intersection of hanley and manchester roads. i wanted a good picture for a power point presentation. the next day i was editing the pics for clarity by zooming in. although my eyes had seen nothing but clear sky the previous morning, in two of the three pics there was a star-like image above and just right of the tower top. the three pics were taken 2 seconds apart; the image was not in the first pic but in the next two (see file 1). so within a 2 second time frame something wasn't there and then it was there for 2 seconds. seemed strange. noting that the second two pics were taken at 10:20am, i returned to the exact photo spot in the industrial park south of manchester rd. on may 7 at 10:30am and took a series of 12 tower photos spaced 2 seconds apart: the first pic had nothing but tower in it, however in the next 11 frames there were a total of 22 points of light. i have included frames 5 and 6 (files 2 & 3) where you can zoom into two lights directly over the tower in #5 and two seconds later in #6 they are gone but now there are two lights considerably right of the tower. i returned on may 9 at 10:20am and took a series of 10 pics, 2 seconds apart. seven of the frames had 9 lights.  i have included frames 1 and 2 where the light(s)  has a fuzzy quality (files 4 & 5). i returned at 10:20 on may 21, took 10 more pics and caught 4 more lights.  in summary, on 4 occasions i took a total of 35 pics and zoomed into 38 points of interest. my first inclination was to think in terms of the sun reflecting off of aircraft coming in and out of lambert international, 12 miles due north of the tower. however, i couldn't account for the now-you-see-it and now-you-don't aspect of the pics; these two disappear and two seconds later two appear somewhere else. also, on very deep zooms it seems there may be a distant light or a light that is coming into focus.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

went inside to grab my 17 yr old daughter (i figured no one would believe me). we went to the front yard and she immediately saw the same shape trying to cloak itself in the clouds. we watched as two large birds flew toward the ufo and changed direction to avoid the shape. it seemed as if they had not been aware of the ufo until they were approximately 30 ft-40 ft away. after around 20 minutes total it sank down into the puffy cloud and dissipated. we took a few more pictures from the front yard before it disappeared. i felt really sleepy immediately after going inside, but after a 30

 at about 2:50 pm on a clear day with not much or any wind, i noticed a small object over i-70 from a distance that initially looked like a plastic grocery bag that had been kicked up above i-70 by the wind.  as i move closer, i realize that the bag is floating and not loosing or changing altitude.  i also realize that it is much larger than a small plastic bag and it appears to be a large 15 to 30' oval or rounded rectangular shaped (but not perfectly shaped almost shaped like a smooth irregularly shaped oval floating brown rock) object floating at a consistent altitude and rotating slowly clockwise with a slight wobble. the object looked to be dark brown rather than black, with no markings, windows or lights.  the motion was very consistent with rotation and motion slightly faster than the traffic (15 to 20 mph).   the traffic slowed down as i got closer to the object.  when i got closest to the object, it was on the south side of i-70 moving westerly, slightly faster than the traffic was moving.  five to six lanes of traffic on i-70 bumper to bumper and other people must have seen it and must have reported something to someone.\r\n\r\nat 2:58 pm i took my samsung s7 active and turned on the video.  probably the worst video you have seen.  i was driving in the far left lane with cell phone held out of the window. i did capture the object briefly a couple of times during the 32 second video which you will see as a small spec on the screen.  it looks like a small spec on my cell phone and i was just today able to get the video off of my phone and will attach to this report.  i assume with this accurate a location, time, date and the amount of people on i-70 west bound and east bound, there must have been other reports or photos.  was not a plane, bird, drone or insect.  may have been some kind of large balloon filled with helium except for the fact that the rotation and movement west was so smooth and even.  i finally lost sight of the object as it moved west out of my sight.\r\n\r\ni was a little bit amazed that i was seeing what really looked like a ufo or some kind of controlled craft (not being blown by the wind).  i tried to use the video on my phone but had a difficult time while driving in stop and go traffic.  i wish that i had fought to get off of the interstate and used a nicer camera that i had in the car but it seemed to difficult to get over from left lane through 6 lanes of traffic to the exit and it may have been gone by the time i made it.  the traffic lightened up or speeded up and i just lost sight of the object in the distance to the west of me and on south side of i-70.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

the object's outline, it's coloring (dark grey) and rectangular shaped lights spaced equally around the perimeter of all of the objects, blink sequentially. one of our neighbors called the police, who came out. they called local airports who said nothing was flying over our area at that time. they said they would file a police report, and they called more police officers out to see the objects. several people stood there watching these objects, staying totally still and silently hovering. then, after 30 to 40 minutes, they all just disappeared. they didn't take off, or fly away, they just disappeared. we all stood there for a while after they left, to see if they returned, and several people said that even though we could no longer see the object, they \"felt\" like they were still there, maybe just hidden somehow. during all of this, my neighbor was recording with an old vhs camera. the next day she played the tape, only to find the screen was snow, but you could still hear
