county line into eastland county. when we both noticed an object in the sky that we thought was a plane. what caught our eye at first was that it was flashing a white light, like a strobe light, but slower in intervals. we watched it for a minute at the most then on it's last flash it tilted upward then vanished. \r\n\r\ni slapped my room mate on the arm and asked him if he saw the same thing. he agreed. it was one of the few that we have seen. mostly we see them at night but this was special because it was blantley during the day light hours. there was no sound, we waited for the 'boom' incase it was an f-16 going super sonic but none. we looked in the sky further to see if it had gone to another location in the sky but it had not appeared again.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe motions of the object was smooth, floating but moving very fast towards the south. it wasn't far up in the sky couldn't have been more than 1500 feet up.\r\n\r\nwe spoke about it for a few minutes, both of us were shocked but not surprised that we had finally saw one during the day. then we started talking about the other ufo's we had seen. and we thought we should report it and most likely will not be the last report we make. \r\n\r\nthanks for your time.\r\n\r\nj  &  r","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

usually do and saw a object spinning  in a clock wise way.  it was almost directly over my head. it was very bright white light.  it was spinning really fast in a wobble type fashion. it was at arms length about ,1/2 the size of a dime.  i remember i could not believe what i was seeing, it was moving faster than anything i know of here on earth. i had forgotten my lighter just a few feet inside the door of the patio, i went in to grab it and came back out in a few seconds and it was still there. spinning, i remember being filled with a great feeling of excitement.  i was alone though..My elderly parents where asleep in side.  i decided i had to find some one to help me witness this.  i went in and shouted to my mother and father. they were fast asleep.  i came back out it was there still. i grabbed my cigar and just stared at this fantastic thing.  it was at this time that it began to move out of its spinning circle and started to fly in a south western direction. it was moving very fast, it was at this point that as i followed it heading up and away that it must have been up pretty high because i feel it  was being illuminated by the sun the whole while. i followed it as it became dimmer and smaller and head toward a arching direction  into outer space and then it was gone from my sight. \r\n\r\nthis object was insight for well over five minutes to my best estimation.\r\nit was a bright white light, i would think metal or made of some shinning properties, it was disk or round shaped.  it was spinning and wobbling in a way that it looked very different

rest during the day. we had worked for a few hours and decided to take a short break. we were laying on the hood of his truck when i noticed a light going across the sky (deep sky, space). i said \"look, a falling star!\". we both watched waiting for it to burn out but it never did. it disappeared over the southern horizon (estimated). we kept watching the sky for something again when we noticed it had reappeared from the northern horizon again. i began counting... 1001, 1002, 1003... it was gone again over the southern horizon. wow! that was fast. i assumed we were seeing something in orbit that had a good reflection. we were now watching the northern horizon... several seconds later it appeared... 1001, 1002... it stopped dead in the middle of the sky. it just blended in with all the other stars. after several seconds, it made a series of zigzags going back and forth across the area in the middle of the sky, cris-crossing at times a previous path. all at the same speed it had originally traveled only stopping at starting without any affect on it's speed. it stopped in the middle of the sky once again... for several seconds... then went back the way it had came from the northern horizon... 1001, 1002... it was gone. we never saw it again! but i still remember all the details so well! i have always wanted to calculate the speed the it was traveling but never have.\r\n\r\nthe cover of popular mechanics this month is about ufos. i am a very analytical person. straight a's in school, no drinking, no drugs, very logical! if i had not seen this myself, i would be skeptical also, but i did see it, and know exactly what i saw! seems that the person writing the article has never actually seen anything like this. what i saw was no weather balloon, reflection from another object, or some other craft from earth. i know that the technology for this didn't exist in 1975, doesn't exist today, and will likely not exist in another 100 years on earth. to be able to travel that speed, cover thousands of miles starting and stopping with no acceleration or deceleration, is technology out in our distant future.\r\n","distance":"Over One

and talking, i had been noticing an engine - like sound that i thought was a train in the distance. it was a slow rythmic intermittent sound. it was deep and low almost quiet and i never would have thought about it, but for some reason it hit me that it was closer than the train tracks. \r\n\r\ni got up to look out of the window after several minutes of hearing it and i saw a solid circle of light above the trees over a nearby park. i think it was yellow light (im colorblind) but travelling along the circle of light i could see a long patch of green light running the length of the circle. the green light seemed to go along with the sound of the engine. every time the light passed on my side, i could hear the engine and feel it vibrate the floor and windows. i could feel it in my body too. i could not see the actual shape of the ship because the night was very dark. if had to put a shape to it, id say it was a disk like shape from the lights it had. the park was only half a block away and this thing was alot larger that any helicopter i have ever seen. it covered almost the entire park.\r\n\r\ni told my friend to get up when he asked what i was doing and he saw it too. we stood there at the window together, excited to see such a thing. it had individual red, yellow and blue lights in a group at its top that took turns blinking and i think white lights on the bottom of the ship. the ship sat above the trees over lyons park for about a minute or so, then the green light began to move faster around the yellow ring and the engine noise sped up. when the engine became a constant hum, the ship took off to the north east, then switched sharply to the north west. the ship moved so fast that it went from looming huge in the window to a pinpoint of light in the sky in about a second and a half at most. it left a trail (kind of like a sci fi movie) of light behind it that faded in a few seconds. \r\n\r\nwe were excited while it was there, but i remember feeling panicked after it left. and for some reason, the next thing we both remember is being in the kitchen afraid they were coming for us. we both remember jumping out of the second floor window to go to the convenience store, but we never went to the convenience store. i remember running into the badminton net and falling over and laughing histerically after leaving the house. \r\n\r\ni do not remember how we got to the kitchen that night, or how we got back into the house. but we did not go to the convenience store. ive never felt like i was abducted, but everything was normal that night until i saw that ship.\r\n\r\nwe didnt talk about it for a long time, but we do occassionally bring it up to each other, just to remind ourselves that it did happen.\r\n\r\nive never reported this to anyone other than friends before, but i have always wanted to.\r\n\r\ni am going to join mufon tonight, feel free to contact me through my email if i need to clarify anything.","distance":"101-500

old and he was ll at that time.  it was a clear evening and the sun had set below the horizon.  our house was located on the east side of a paved road.  to the west of us across the highway was located a plowed field about 300 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long.  the length of the field ran parallel with the highway.  on the other side of the field the terrain was raised and was a pasture for the farmer that lived on that side of the road.  a very few trees grew in that pasture so we could see to the west of us and had a good view facing west across the highway viewing the sky at about a 15 degree angle with little obstruction.  since the sun had set below the treeline and the sky was not yet black, we had a very good view of the event.  we observed a spherical to cylindrical orange to red object that seemed to float overhead that was approximately 1,000 feet in the air that appeared to come from the northeast at a speed of approximately 20-30 mph.  the object was totally silent.  the object appeared almost straight overhead of our position and moved to the southwest over the neighbor's field and pasture before finally disappearing over the treeline.  the sky was perfectly clear and their was no wind.  we had an unobstructed view of this object for approximately 30+ seconds.  we went into our house and reported what we had seen to our parents.  i remember this event like it was yesterday.  i can see the object in my mind as it floats across the sky and i can see my brother and i standing their watching the object.  i remember the conditions of the day and the absolute quiet of the evening.  i went to a family gathering this past summer and mentioned this event and my brother mentioned he too remembered this event and described the event as if i was reporting it.  i am level headed and  am skeptical of many things.  i served in vietnam as military policeman and am used to hostile situations.  this is my story.  my brother is a

passenger window of the car at first thinking it was a planet that was visible. it wasnt one color the more you looked at it it appeared to be multi colored sorta rainbow like. it seemed to follow along the road and seemed stationary till i realised we pulled ahead of the light. at that point i had to look back over my shoulder to keep a fix on it. it was very very bright and even tho you couldnt see any other stars in the sky it stuck out almost looked like an airplane tower but there are none in that area. i watched it dim till it disappeared then gradually get brighter again it was hazy not cloudy and there were no other obstructions to block it. it did this on two different occasions. i watched this object for about 15 constant mins. till finally the trees blocked it out. we got home around 9-930 that nite and the sky was clear you could see all the stars but i could not find what i was looking at earlier. and we are not really that far geographically from where i seen this object earlier. i looked online to see if there were any planets visible that nite and the only one was venus but it would have been crescent shaped and this wasnt it was starlike. i dont know what it was a saw but it was very intense more then any other star or planet i have ever seen in the nite

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At the time, i was making a routine delivery in downtown belleville, il. i stopped at the address, and after exiting the vehicle, made a quick scan of everything i could see from my position to the end of the street. it was probably around 9-10pm. the street in front of me ended in a t intersection. there was a home centered at the intersection point, on the far side of the intersecting street. there was a man and a boy in the front yard of this home. above the home i witnessed a triangular oject performing horizontal figure eights. at first i believed i was witnessing a kite with lights or a radio controlled toy. as i watched the object perform the horizontal eights, i began to grow a bit disturbed by the appearance of the man and boy tendning to something in the yard, with no visual signs that they were aware of the object that had at first appeared to me to be part of the scene, small, and assumedly over the house which i had a good estimate of the distance towards at the time. i realized that the object was no toy. it was a black triangle with white lights at each corner of its underside and a red rectangular light on the underside also at about a 2/3 mark from the tip to the base which had been flying this horizontal figure eight pattern with the underside and the lights facing towards me. it came out of this pattern and faced in my direction with its tip pointed towards me and made a very smooth lurch forward. the object was angled upwards a bit, and i could see that the rear of the triangle had a soft inward sweep to it. i began to feel that the object was fairly large and closer than i wanted it to be, but still maybe further away than i originally thought. the object was completely silent. the object proceded to stand straight up in the air, (i.E. a floating silent triangle facing me horizontally rotated its tip backwards until it was perfectly vertical exposing the now perpendicular underside). the object then began to rotate on its lowermost right corner, rotating clockwise, as if someone had affixed the very tip of the craft to a point in space and rotated the entire craft perfectly around that point. it made full revolutions in probably each each half second or so. the craft then angled itself back down to the approximate position it had been in before the manuvre, lurched foward, then back, then made shorter movements left, then right then back to center. i lost sight of the object as it descended behind the treeline which was in the rear of the house and which ran behind several of the neighboring houses. as the craft descended, i had a little better perspective on the size of the craft and the distance, as i could see the lights through its descent below the treeline. it was closer than i had previously thought and maybe a little smaller, as i had assumed it had a higher altitude, but was still quite large for its distance. through the whole thing i couldn't help but feel that i was being watched, or that it was simply observing the ground in its area. i remember at the end standing for a moment and just watching but there being nothing visible of the object. what followed were approximately five black or very dark helicopters flying in loose formation, performing fairly quietly and the lead of which at least i remember as having a massive searchlight on towards the ground. they were flying left to right through the same field of vision, just slightly higher than where the object had been, and passed the scene completely. i wondered later if the craft had moved elsewhere at a very low altitude, turned off all of its lights and hid or camouflaged itself somehow on the ground, or ascended again with its lights out while i was distracted? as strange as it sounds, after the helicopters had passed and there was no sign of the object, i still had a job to finish, so i made the delivery and headed back to work for the next. it took me a while to absorb how anomalous this occurance had been. i thought about reporting the incident to scott air force base but soon thought the better of it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then

leaving the office and move 2 steps toward the edge of the sidewalk into the schoolyard, i started to watch in the sky 2 falling objects, approx. to 30/40 degrees towards the north (having as a reference point runway 09/27 of the international airport of tijuana \"abelardo l. rodriguez (tij / mmtj) and a height not very well defined, but taking as reference the ground had an elevation angle of 60/70 degrees . objects were fireballs and had a trail of red /orange in color with no change in the tail aproximate size of the tail was 7 or 10 times larger than the object and not leaving a visible trail of smoke. at about 25 seconds of having initiated the sighting objects slowed down, immediately after it was observed that from the right hand object another object appeared being same size and color, almost inmediatedly after that objects changed course and speed, at that time i rushed to the second floor to get a better view because the objects were very near the tree top line and i was gonna loose then, i saw the third object was brighter than the other two, i moved towards one end of the building to get a better view but at that time the objects were in the tree top line and lost them. besides me, several kids of the school (it is a junior h.S. type school) and a couple of teachers saw them, one said that the third object suddenly disapeared. \r\nat first i though it was a couple of meteorites or space junk falling down but when they slowed down and changed course that idea went into the tube, i also thought they were skydivers with flares but later on at night while listening to the news on the radio it was reported that the san diego police dept. or the sheriff office did not knew also what was in the sky at that moment.\r\nend of
