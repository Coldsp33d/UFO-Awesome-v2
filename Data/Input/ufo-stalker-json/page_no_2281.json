isn't much to see but i began to see blinking red lights in one direction. its hard to pinpoint how far,but it seemed to be coming from around the other end of the property,in the back of my house.   they are always there only at night. i decided today that i would investigate and find out just where those lights might be coming from.\r\n    there are very many trees here, mainly oak and some pines. anyway, the lights,vivid red have been blinking for several months. then today in the day time, i rode around my block and look for something, like christmes lights, or any other lights that appeared to be simular in appearance. i couldnt find anything.\r\n      tonight about 11:40 pm,i went out of my back door and saw the red blinking lights dart about about from their usual place and go higher into the sky,but not too high. there is only one red light darting here and there, left and right,up and down. i dont know what it is, and im the only one that goes out to smoke at night. this is a sparsely populated area and i am concerned and curious at this time.\r\n    i have been going out side to smoke for several months now and those lights have always been in the same area. tonight for the first time,they changed and moved away and up and down.They are still back there as i write this narritive.\r\n     i do not have a camara or film to take pictures of the blinking red lights.

when we looked up and saw what we thought was a plane.  as it moved toward us, however, we noticed that there were no position or navigation lights (strobes or red/green) on the object that are required on all aircraft flying at night.  instead, the object had a single orange-ish light that pulsated, that seemed to be rotating.  we were unable to discern any shape.  it moved at about the speed a plane would along a straight path, with no erratic movement.  we watched for about another minute more (we had pulled the car over to the shoulder to continue watching) and and at the end of

planes and hawks passing overhead. also, as usual were very high altitude planes leaving quantrails. airliners pass low overhead on their downwind leg for lax. \r\nthen, to the north, 30 degrees up from the city lines horizon, i caught sight of a star like object way up high, then perhaps immediately, two.  the sky had many clouds, but they were well apart from each other today. the two stars came close together but were on different courses. then, one changed direction. their speeds from this vantage point was slow but steadily moving. the brighter. no.1 was coming my way south coming closer overhead now about 35 degrees up. still well downrange. the lesser was fading out moving north. periodic. the brighter now seemed to be hovering, motion not apparent, too slow or stopped. now i was ruling out aircraft.  but over several minutes i concluded it was moving my way. i had called a friend over, he saw it too. then a third object, same but brighter  with a metallic shape attached to a star appeared from the south heading north. 15 degrees west of right overhead. faster than the first two, still fairly slow. brighter. like a low satellite at night. my friend saw this too. i purposely did not mention the metallic look just forward on the star, he did, confirming my see.  then, ufo 2, the lesser, had remanifested to make three at the same time. friend confirmed this too.  ufo 3 approached 2, number one still crawled now heading east, much higher now. not brighter. ufo 2 faded out again to the north, 3 went on to the same  direction, fading off in the distance. just no. 1 was left 80 degrees up now straight in front of me, passing off the the right and fading out. \r\nsunlight was very bright throughout, these star ufos were not reflective or flashy but constantly bright like a planet. speed of no. 1 had changed from slow to very slow, direction had changed but so slowly as not to be noticed except over time. hovering at that altitude rules out helicopter. no quantrails on these. speeds too slow on no. 1 and 2 to be aircraft at that altitude, though 3 could have been very high plane. but i dont think so. my first sighting of such ever. i have taken one report before that i had not seen, had looked for years, but until today, saw nothing i could call unexplained. i see satellites regularly at night, these resembled such except for daytime visibility, apparent interaction, and changes of direction and speed of the first two. balloons are apparent too sometimes in the bright sun, but tend to flash as they turn in the light, and are too low compared to these three. these were very much comparable to the star ufos i see on youtube clips, but were much slower. \r\nmy friend has agreed to write up his version of what he saw seperately.

hilltop campground, because it was higher up, and out of the way. after setting up our tent, (it was dark, around 8 pm by this time) a woman (the only other camper in the area due to the time of year) appologized for bothering us, but asked us to come toward there camp site so we could see something. we walked up away from our site, were we met her husband. they pointed toward a distand mountain. what me and my daughter saw was unexplainable. a very large \"glow\" was \"floating\" over a distant mountain, illuminating a large section of it. there were three or four of these objects, floating, illuminating, seeming to just float and move with no set pattern. they were orange/ yellow in color, and there size seemed very large, as the mountain in the distance was beign illuminated in sections. i could not make out there shape, because they just seemed to be large floating illuminations of bright light.  after a few moments   they just seemed to \"turn of\", and there was nothing. after watching for a few, they all vanished. after a few moments of talking with the couple, one came back, followed by the others. they just seemed to appear again. one seemed to be coming closer to the area where we were staying, and i admit, it was a very \"uncomfortable\" feeling. we continued to watch again, and the distant mountain was ulluminated by the objects that came back. we also watched one of the objects seem to get closer to where we were. it wasnt close enough that we could make out any definitive shape, yet it was closer, and seemed to move in our direction.  the feeling of being uncomfortable was growing stronger. because we were both uncomfortable (it was not a feeling of fear, nor anything other then a strange feeling that i can only describe as uncomfortable, hairs on your neck rising, the same feeling you can get when you feel that someone is watching you yet you cant see them) to pack up. the objects were still there when we finished putting away the tent, and we watched some more. over head, not far off, i saw 4-5 fighter jets, flying overhead, and toward the direction of the objects. i assume these jets were from nellis afb, which is in las vegas. the jets flew quickly and in formation straight toward these objects. the objects did not go away when the jets arrived. deciding it was time to go, we got in our vehicle, and headed out of the camp ground. the couple who originally came to get us to see the onjects had went into there camper and were nowhere to be seen, so we headed out. once we were on outside of the camp ground, and on the road that travels around mt charlston, we saw many vehicles driving towards kyle canyon (it was approx 11 pm at night, so the vehicles where very out of place as the road only goes towards a closed down ski resort and in the direction of the objects). \r\n\r\nwe never reported what we saw as we had no camera, and saw nothing in the news, nor did i ever see any report of the incident. we have talked about what we saw on numerous times the past couple of years, and i have still been searching for something similar to what we saw in reports, news programs etc. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501

of town. i proceded to go 4 miles west, and pulled onto an approach and killed the lights and engine. i was facing west so i could brace the binos on the steering wheel to stabilize the image.What i saw through the binos wasn't one, but two objects in close proximity with a connecting beam of light between the two. both objects were circular in shape overall, but  made up of seperate points of light.About 7 or 8.(because of the binos?) the object to the right in my field of vision was partially obscured by the beam of light which appeared to sort of wrap, partially around it. the two objects moved back and forth toward each other and away from each other slightly. i watched this for a few minutes,until the windows started to fog on my truck. i started the vehicle and headed back toward town. i could still see the objects in my rearview mirror appearing as a really bright star until i got into town and i had to pay closer attention to my driving, than the objects. by the time i got back home the objects were no longer visible. it was extremely clear last night 16 degrees 77% humidity wind was nw @4 mph. i hope someone else saw this! i wish now i had stayed until they went

also saw an ambulance driving south on the frontage road with it's lights on so i figured it had something to do with the helicopter with it's spotlight on. as we got closer i suddenly saw that the object was not a helicopter but a triangular object. it was hovering by the radio tower and it was at least a hundred feet in length from corner to corner. it also had lights on each othe corner althouhg i don't remember what color they were. my nephew was asleep and my father was too busy driving in the heavy traffic to notice. i didn't say anything to my father about it because i guess i was in awe not understanding what i was seeing. i wasn't really scared but i felt funny about it. i later thought that if i had told my father about it he would have pulled over to get a closr look and i don't think i would be comfortable with that. i know other people driving that evening had to have seen the same thing as i. later down the road maybe thirty minutes later i looked back in the distance and could still see it hovering above the tree line miles away. i told my father about an hour later and he just laughed at me. i seriously saw a large black triangle with lights on each corner that day and and do not doubt others that have seen the same.","distance":"101-500

fm 587\r\nviewed by ronald laduque\r\n\r\ni witnessed a ufo light show at 7:25 p.M. while i was about 12 miles west of deleon, tx, and traveling almost due east on fm 587; thursday, feb. 5, 2009.  the light show began near ���duster��� (highway 679 & 587). prior to the light show i observed a very bright, large yellow star or satellite in appearance about 30 degrees above horizon and about 30 degrees south of highway 587. as far as the color and intensity of this large light, it could be compared to a rural farm light of the sodium vapor type. the large ufo light observed would be similar to the large size farm light viewed from a distance of about three miles.\r\n\r\n\ti noticed this large light in the eastern sky about 7:10 p.M. as i was driving toward it. i was approximately 20 miles west of deleon when i first observed the large, yellow light. as i was driving due east, i watched this light from time to time as it was so bright and large and it drew my attention. the light was positioned close to my rearview mirror so it was easy to \tkeep an eye on it as i drove.\r\n\r\n\tsuddenly about 6 or 7 smaller lights, perhaps one-half the size of the bright light, appeared one-by-one to the left of the large light and remained lighted for a few seconds; then all of the small lights turned off simultaneously. these smaller lights were to the left of the bright light and turned on progressively in a south to north direction. these small lights turned on in sequence at about the rate of one per second.\r\n\r\nafter the small lights had been gone for a few seconds, the same phenomenon happened a little closer to the bright light and south of the first set of small lights.  again, turning on progressively but this time from my left to my right, i.E. north to south. again they all disappeared after all 7 or 8 were turned on  for a few seconds; they all turned off simultaneously.\r\n\r\nnext, the same sequencing of small lights occurred again but the farthest away from the large light than either of the first two appearances. these lights were again to the north side of the big light. however, peculiar to this set of small lights, this time the last three or four lights turned on in what appeared to be a curved direction heading back to the south; again all small lights disappeared simultaneously. this string of lights came on in a south to north direction, just as did the first set of lights that i observed.\r\n\r\n nothing reappeared for the next few minutes but i then noticed the large light began to get weaker until it was very dim and then disappeared completely. this noticeable dimming process lasted perhaps for 5 or 6 seconds. it is possible that this dimming effect was due to the large light moving directly away from me at an extremely high rate of speed.\r\n\r\ni traveled a short distance farther and pulled to the side of the road, turned off the motor and listened for any airplane noise; total silence. i took my field glasses out of the pickup in case the lights reappeared. there was no noise and nothing reappeared. i did not even observe stars at this time. this entire lighting exhibition lasted approximately one minute or less. i noticed how clear the atmosphere was and there was no visible cloud cover in the area of the light show.\r\n\r\nthe large light and each of the three strings of smaller lights were on a more or less level, horizontal plane  and were about 30 degrees above the horizon. the large light was approximately 30 degrees to the south of my direction of travel; i was traveling almost due east.\r\n\r\nthe first string of smaller lights was approximately 15 degrees south of the easterly line of my travel; the second string of lights was closer to the large light and about 20 degrees south of my line of travel. the third and final string of lights was the farthest away from the large light and approximately 10 degrees south of my line of travel.\r\n\r\nthe ufo providing this light show was certainly not concerned about whether or not it would be observed over this populated, rural area early in the evening on a perfectly clear night. perhaps the ufo wished to be observed for some unknown reason. these lights definitely were not flares and could not be any type of aircraft known to the average person.\r\n\r\n���unidenified freaky lights��� fill the sky: february 8, 2009

a movie.\r\n\r\ni was seated in a chair that faces south-west, while my husband and daughter were seated in chairs facing approx. north.\r\n\r\nwithin the living room is a large sliding glass door that allows exit to the backyard area. the door also faces south-west and overlooks the tucson mountains with an unimpeded view since there are no homes in that area adjacent our home.\r\n, \r\ni turned away from the television and glanced out through the sliding glass door. my attention was immediately drawn to an object approx 200 to 300 feet south-west of our backyard. \r\n\r\nalthough i don���t remember seeing the object moving at that point, i got the impression that it was moving south to north. \r\n\r\nthe object was complete with two (2) red lights, (non-strobing) one in the front and one in the rear. although it was dark out i got the impression that the shape of the object was oval. i estimate its altitude at approx. 150-200 feet.\r\n\r\nholding my hand stretched out in front of me, with fingers pointing up, i estimate that from light to light, the distance between these two lights would have spanned my hand from little finger to thumb.\r\n\r\nas i watched and only a second or two later the object appeared to ���explode��� with a blinding white light, (the size of the explosion would be about the size of a pie plate held at arms length) the object then accelerated at an unbelievable rate of speed and departed, parallel to the ground, in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nthere was no noise at any time emitted from this object.\r\n\r\nbecause neither my husband nor daughter was looking in that direction, neither saw the object.\r\n\r\ni alerted them to the object and we all ran outside looking for any sign of it.\r\n\r\nafter about 10 minutes of looking, we all three gave up and returned to the living room.\r\n\r\njust as we began to sit down once again, my husband stated that he heard the sounds of helicopters coming in.\r\n\r\nall of us went to the back yard once again and watched as two helicopters, moving from the north-west and proceeding in a south-east direction.\r\n\r\nmy husband who is former air force identified these helicopters as military types. although it was dark and the outlines of the choppers were indistinct they were both about the size of blackhawks, maybe larger.\r\n\r\nwe could see that as the helicopters approached in tandem, they flew directly over the area where i witnessed the object  ���explode���\r\n\r\nthe helicopters were moving very slowly (estimated speed of perhaps 50 miles per hour) and i would estimate their altitude at 200-300 feet.\r\n\r\nthey proceeded to pass our house just to the south and continued flying south-east.\r\n\r\nalthough there is much military air-traffic in this area, and we have witnessed many helicopters in flight, we have never seen them fly this route, nor at this slow of speed, especially during the night.","distance":"101-500

moving above the tree tops in the sky. but then it slowed to a stop and hovered there and slowly moved in a circular pattern in the sky while slowly moving down or away. the light never changed brightness. i asked my fiance to look and she took a breif look at it and went back to watching tv. i continued to tell her how the object continued to float around the same area in the sky. i opened the window to get a clear view and when the object moved lower in view below the tree tops and became more difficult to see. i went outside at 8:30pm in the back yard and continued to watch it slowly move down or away, i also took a few pictures. at first i though it was moving away but the brightness of the light did not change. i saw planes flying all around and it seemed like the object was huge and should have been visible to the planes. the object continued to move down in my view into the tree tops so i tried to shine a light out at the object to get it's attention but it seemed to have no response to the light. it was around 9pm by this time when the object disappeared behind the trees but i soon saw it again lower near the forest floor which is when i realized the object may be much closer and much smaller than i initially thought. i looked out using binoculars and saw a yellow light that pulsated and then went out. it came back on and went out a few more times. i made a mental note of where exactly the light was in relation to two trees and my viewpoint out the back window so i could look out again in the morning to see what it was. i also took a few pictures. i looked out another window and it appeared to be on constantly but may have been blocked through the first window by vegetation or was facing another direction. at that point i started to wonder if the light was from someones house. around 6am this morning i looked outside and i still saw the yellow light in the same spot which still made me suspect it is somehow someones light. this morning around 8am i looked outside in the same spot using binoculars and i could only see the forest floor. i thought last night i may have been looking at someones backyard but now it seems i wasn't. i will attach a few pictures i took last night and the same spot this morning. the night pictures are not great since i had to set my camera to \"starry night\" which takes a 15 second exposure. i tried to keep the shot as still as possible but i was not using a tripod. i took a few pictures of the light in the woods by holding the camera down against the window sill to help stabilize it. i have more photos than the ones attached. i would like to remain anonymous for as far as my name and address since this happened in our backyard and we don't want people trying to run around in the woods behind our house.

had went in the house for a couple min. when my brother dan yelled at me to come back out on the porch to see this weird light just over the trees to the west of us.  at first i thought it probably was a bright star, but as we studied it i could clearly see diffrent shape changes and diffrent light flashes with diffrent colored lights at time.  it did'nt take long for both of us to realize what we were looking at was a ufo.\r\n    \r\n     i went into the house and got my camera and proceeded into the yard and then into the street where the object was'nt blocked by trees. the ufo was moving very slowly to the north from where we first saw it, i started my video and as i was filming the object it changed coarse and headed directly west at a straight angle.  i video taped the object for about 10 min. that was more than enough time to get the best ufo show i think i've ever seen  of a night sighting.  \r\n\r\n     the ufo started as a very small super bright light than it would expand to diffrent sizes of spheres, sometimes looking like a ball with a dark stripe in the middle and times it appeared to get much larger and looked like the moon, then in an instance it vanish back into the super bright light, then, while doing all these things it would burst into beautiful huge orbs of light, sometimes orange, sometimes green and red.  after filming this for about 10 min.  i knew i had enough footage, this baby had done it all, what a light show this was!!!\r\n\r\n    after turning off the camera i continued watching the object continue westward over cushing ok. and still going west at a very slow speed for about another 10 min. then i returned to the house to view the footage via camera to t.V. the whole family could'nt believe their eyes, the video is spectacular, and with no dought in our minds that we were looking at a ufo.  guys you have got to see this video.  now the bad news, i barely know how to send an email so i do not know how to download my sd card video and then send it as an attachment.  if someone wants to call me and give my wife instructions on how to do this, that would be great!                                     \r\n

this mountain pass at least 4 times a week at night, once i reached an elevation of about 2800' and cleared the trees i noticed something quite out of place, this object was definetly not a plane, it wasnt moving. definetly not a star, as the circumfrence was too large, but you could still tell the object was at some distance off...It was just, this bright, spherical/star type object just sitting stationary to the wsw of my position. i pulled over at the peak of the moutain (3500') to get a better view, i obserbed the object for roughly 5 minutes. in that time frame the object seemed to move ever so slightly to the south. whatever it was, it was quite massive. i guestimated the altitude to be about 14-18k ft.\r\n\r\njust continued on home after the 5 minutes, too cold at that elevation.
