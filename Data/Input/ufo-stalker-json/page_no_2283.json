plane enroute to korea. i have had this photo for some time and showed the photo to an air force  airman and he took the copy of the photo and would not return it. i have also been in direct contact with and enity  who not only presented himself to me but also has visited me in dreams and shows me things that will happen in the future. this photo is an daytime photo of an unidentified object that appeared on the photo after development of the film. because of the nature of wierd occurances and the airman directly telling me to not show the picture to anyone i have decided to come forward because he did not keep his word on returning the photo. he said that he  would make the image bigger using sophisticated military equipment and return it. the photo also shows 2 ebe because of the reflection of the window from the plane they appeared. when i studied the craft along with the images in the photo ihave for many years been in fear of my life. i was in the army for 10years and was certified as an armor crew member. i studied vehicle identification in fort knox, ky. i will only show someone face to face the photo. if you are trying to find the most solid information, this photo get alot of attention. the ebe that visited me was about 4' 0\" and he wore a black skin tight suit. also had almond  shaped eye's. ever since this visitation. my clocks in my house and car would always make a static sound and the clocks in my house would flash 11:11, and 4:44 as well as my watches. the clocks would be unplugged and would still make the noises and flash 11:11. i have been visited by these things for some time now but was afraid of what people would think of me. please help me disclose this photo as well as the information that i have on what i have seen and learned. this is not an hoax i am for real. i was an staff sergeant in the army, a tank commander served 2 tours in iraq, an army recruiter. i am no longer afraid to tell the truth! if you are serious about finding the truth call me  or write me and i will get you this information. i will also submit to an polygraph. i believe i also know why they are visiting more now! god bless, and i hope to hear from you soon! by the way the reason i took the photo outside the planes window is because the cloud outside the window looked like a mans face as you will see in the photo. then i discovered the ufo after development.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Insignia,  Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

right hand side of the driveway.  my three children (ages 3, 7, and 11) and i turned into the driveway and had stopped at the mailbox, which is towards the beginning of the driveway, to get the mail when we saw some extremely bright lights at the far end of the field.  it lit the far end of the field up as if it were a football/baseball field.  there were no beams of light, it was just ommitted from the lights on the craft.\r\n\r\ni got out of the car and noticed it was moving slowly in a circular path.  it was triangular in shape, with 3 extremely bright white lights at each corner.  the edges of the craft glowed with a dull, yet still bright, silvery light.  it reminded me of the neon lights you see under cars.  in the center was an extremely large red light that was noticable but it did not appear to cast color around it or on the craft itself.  the craft appeared to be a dull silver/gray in color but i could not really get a good look at the color due to the bright lights.\r\n\r\nit began to move slowly across the field and over the far opposite end of my driveway.  i grabbed my phone out of my seat and quickly took a picture as it passed over the woods on the left side of the driveway.  after about 45 seconds from when we first saw it and about 5-10 seconds after i took the picture it disappeared.  it did not shoot off, or leave any trails of light because of moving quickly, and did not go behind any hills or trees (there was nothing to obstruct the view).  it simple just disappeared.  my two oldest could verify the exact experience to my husband when we got to our house a few seconds later, so i know what we saw.  hopefully, when i download my picture to my computer at home tonight i will be able to zoom in and have it enhanced to better make out the objects shape.  right now, the picture looks like a massively bright glowing object/ball, and you can see some metal at the edges of the light.  as soon as i have the picture i will email it to your sight asap.  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with

deer (just one didn't walk right)going back and forth.Me terrified her rational i.E.Helicopters from air base.Possibly va hospitol we drove back.(6 min @ most)the lights were still visable (the static still continuing) we could see the va,the red lights from cell tower?Yet the bright lights were still visable from moon roof.Scared and excited we left and called another carrier to see if she was in the area. as i spoke to her that itching reaccured and each street light went out as we spoke.My car did not stall but my lights went dim.I saw a red sky above us.As thou sun rising or bright moon. then when the light left one by one lights turned on.Same way they went out.As i hung up phone my partner returned to the car.She put a paper on a porch. an owl (grey one color)flew out of thin air and landed on the porch roof of the house we delivered.What strange is it was staring at us and flew directly in front of my head lights.We watched for @ least 2 min. we were waiting to see if it was hunting or what.We left first. the static feeling followed us through the next 20 min of our route.The sky would light up.At another condo the spot lights on the four corners would turn off one by one then when the static lifted the came on the same way they went out. this has never happened in the four years we delivered papers. when we got home the sun was just rising in the east.Yet i saw the same red in the west.After that night i developed 4 huge boils on my skin.One on my thigh,one in the center of my chest,one near my lip, the last was on my side between my hip and breast. besides the one on my chest all were on my right side.My dog who is prone to allergies itched so terrible i made an appointment @ tufts dermotolgy.(not putting events together.By the next week me and the dog cleared up.We returned next week to the same location. we could see the lights of the va hospital and cell tower but not those bright lights. my partner will not go on record.She does concur on the

aircraft,next city that would is toronto,1 hour car drive away.Bordens near a great lake,20min drive to wasaga beach.As attached video shows,those who captured the ufo's,was over a great lake as the

stationary, but was noticeably bright and steady with no flickering.  i stopped to chat with a new aquaintence who was sitting on the beach.  after some interesting conversation about hawaii and the state of the economy, i mentioned to my her that i had been seeing this light recurr during the past several weeks. it starts about 8pm local and disappears before 10pm.  she remarked that it was \"just venus\".  so i teased her into a bet that it would not be there after we talked for a while.  \r\n\r\nafter an hour or so, i checked that part of the sky and it was gone.  as i pointed out to her that it must not have been venus.  she remarked, \"it must be back in waikiki again!\"  curiously, i laughed and asked her what she meant.  she told me of an event that occured about a year ago where her and a group of friends were up on their condo's top floor.  she said it was around 3am and as they were talking, she noticed an object that was lower than their roof top recreational area, just floating in between some buildings.  it was only several blocks away.  as they looked down on it, she estimate it to be about 30ft across.  it  had an arced shape like you get when you place your index fingers together and touch your thumbs together, as she demonstrated the design with her hands. she said it had a small dome on top, was dull grey, totally silent, and just floated in between other high-rise buildings, finally disappearing between some buildings.  she said they watched for another 30 minutes, thinking it would fly up or out the waikiki area, but it was not seen again.","distance":"Over One

it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15399,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.7686816,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-02082009-0018","longitude":-94.4834824,"occurred":1234147500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1234147500000,"summary":"Star

a bright white light started to shine and i screamed out loud what the hell was that. at first i thought it was a plane but when i realized it was not moving,i quickly ran and grabbed my binoculars to see what it was. it is shaped like a sphere and very ,very bright. it seems to be fixed on one location. my fiance told me to grab my camera and start taking pictures. i took a total of 20 or so pictures. as we speak we are looking at it and it seems to be moving  west into the sky. it is currently  8:56pm and it is no longer visable in the sky.","distance":"Over One
