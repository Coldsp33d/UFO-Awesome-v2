springs, sd which is in the black hills.  four times over a period of the last 2 1/2 weeks i have seen a long rectangular (ruler looking in shape) object with windows, the windows had white lights that appeared to go from dim to bright from the inside.  there were also red lights that seemed to move through the windows at a less consistent rate.  there were two dimmer lights in pale green on each end, with one large orange light randomly coming on in the middle of the object (not appearing to be a window) lasting for two to three seconds.   i did not see this object every single night, but on the 5th and 6th of february, i did see it both evenings.  it did not appear to be in the exact same location each night that i have seen it (i would estimate that it may have moved a mile to a mile and a half in location). \r\n\r\nwhen i saw the object on feb 5th, i called the fall river sheriff���s department at approximately 8:00 pm.   shortly before 9:00pm he arrived on my land to look at the object in question.  after looking at it, he was unsure of what it was and left to check it out.  about 40 min later, i saw what appeared to be two helicopters flying over the area 3 times within 20 min.  it seemed as if they approached the areal slowly and then turned around and flew away faster than they went in.   about 15 min later, the sherriff called be back and said that he believed there was a construction site on the other side of the mountain and i was seeing lights from the equipment at that site.  right after his call, i decided to go see this construction site for myself.   i drove to the area beyond the mountain and there was nothing there!   after that, i drove south to the hot springs airport, it was closed, but hovering 1-3 feet off the runway with the lights on was a helicopter inside of the fence of the airport.  i tried to get their attention, but they would not come talk to me.\r\n\r\ni have never seen anything like this before and would normally consider myself to be a skeptic, but after seeing this four time in 2 ��� weeks, i am beginning to think something is really going on here.    i tried to take pictures of this, but my camera is not the best and could not zoom in very far.    if you contact me, i am willing to try to share the pictures i���ve taken but i am not normally a ���computer user��� so sending these things are

land.\r\n\r\n#4 - descriptions of the event is above.\r\n\r\n#5 ��� the first time i saw it, i wrote it off as nothing because i figured it was a house being built, but is did seem strange to me that

to go get a hair cut. so i borrowed my mom's car and headed out. it was between 7-8 in the evening. it was dark too. the first thing i noticed as i was driving along was the unusual amount of lights in the sky. there were a number of planes or helicopters all over, but not close enough for me to hear or identify them. \r\n\r\nas i traveled west on sycamore in pasadena, tx, i came to t interesection and stop sign at beltway 8. i believe its called e sam houston parkway now. back then it was not a toll road. i looked to my left and saw the traffic was stopped down at the spencer hwy intersection. i turned right and headed north. almost immediately i looked over to my left and saw something that grabbed my attention.\r\n\r\nabout a hundred yards across beltway 8 from my location (i measured it on google earth) there is a field with 2 bill boards on the north and south side. hovering above the field was a large black shape. it was between the bill boards (at least appeared to be so). it had no lights on it. i slowed down to almost a complete stop, turned off the radio, and rolled down the window. there was no sound coming from the object.\r\n\r\ni should have stopped the car and gotten out so i could get a really good look, but i was so surprised i didn't really think about it. within a minute from me sighting the \"craft\" it began to slowly ascend into the sky. it was quite large, but i could not see any detail because it was blacked out. i am not sure if it was a \"saucer\" shape or not since i was looking at it from the side. but it was not very thick.\r\n\r\ni circled around at the u-turn on pine as it slowly moved upward. when i was under it on the opposite side from where i started i could tell it was quite wide. i circled around back at spencer and watched it float high and higher, and i ended up at a light down by pasadena blvd/red bluff intersections. at some point the dark shape lit up into a ball of light. i'm not sure how else to describe it.\r\n\r\nthen suddenly it flashed northward toward me. when i say it flashed i actually mean it flashed. it moved so fast that it left a trail of light behind it. as it came toward my location it did a 180 degree change in flight and flashed southward toward the gulf of mexico and did a zig zag. again, it moved so fast that it left a light trail behind it. it looked to have slightly ascended in its trajectory as it took off.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with
