learned so much about . . . evrything that it almost relegates my sighting to nothing. however  - it is my greatest desire to be hypnotisised and have someone get all of the  . . .Info  . . .Out of my head. i am tired of what i have seen and what i have since learned. \r\n\r\nas far as the sighting. you will find many other peopl have had the same sighting as myself. it was nearly or more than a decade ago. \r\n\r\ni was heading west on lower roswell rd away from azalea it was after timber ridge road and up a hill i passed the affluent neighborhood of  - oh heck - i can't remember it now. it has all sorts of nice homes. after lower roswell rises from the river it makes a sharp turn to the left,  it then turns sharply to the right. kind of like a long angle iron. \r\n\r\ni was on a pizza delivery and came up lower roswell rd and turned left with the rd i could see that,very far ahead of me above the trees in the distance, where the rd turned left that there was a triangular black craft hovering above the trees where the rd turned west again. \r\ni have to say that i was shocked but i had a job to do. i kept heading toward it. this turn shoulod be easy to find on a map it's one large z.\r\n\r\nwhen i was nearly under it - you want to know what the lihgt arrangement was. okay i was so scared that all i recall remember was that there was one very bright light at each one of the 3 corners. i do seem to rememmber that there was an accumulation of lights at the center but i t honestly say that the one in the center was red but i have this feeling that it was. \r\n\r\ni was headed straight for this object and then of course the road changed and i turned to the right -  and so i made a right turn  - at this point the stationary aircraft moved along side of my car and kept pace with me until we approached the nearby lights and then it veered south or left. \r\n\r\ni have seen this same aircraft twice since then and other sightings. i am an accountant and not a crackpot.

side  and see if i can get a glimps at  the lights.\r\nshe says that there are 3 huge white lights in the sky .She lost sight of them when she made the corner of our road.  when she made it to the house she asked me if i had seen anything, and i replied no.  so we procrastinated for a while looking into the sky.  out of the east i see a plane, i thought at the time.  out of the north i see another plane, commercial liner.  we was focused on the commercial plane when we notice the first obtect wasnt a plane.  while approaching it looked a plane with the landing light on there for we didnt think anything of it.  when it got completely over head we could see that there was a triangle formation of red lights.  1, 2, 3 of them.  the flew right over the commercial plane. the 3 objects was  giving off some much lighe around them that we could actually see the air plane and its vapor trail. it was like daylight when they passed over the plane.  the flew in a straight line at a rate a bit slower than the plane. we tried to follow it to get pics but was unable... camcorders sux at night.  so we lost sight of them.  we looked for awhile then gave up.  we got back to the house and as soon as we got out of the car we spotted 3 more red triangles of lights.  this time they were in  a triangle pattern.  they where coming from the southeast, and appeared to be heading to the direction the first group went.  it was about 7:30 pm then.  we take this seriouse because after the sighting  the jets started patroling the  skys. there is an airforce base about and hr and a half from here. and we always notice the jets are coming from that  directions.   the base is barksdale in shreveport la. and im sure the commerial plane is out of  the airport there.  so if anyone wants to do some

notices a bright light hovering above the high school football field. he picks me up and tells me to check out something  and we go over  the hill on iowa avenue  and   he says \"look\"  i see it right over what i can say is either the field itself or over the center of town.  it is a bright white light and sitting there , i think is this a helicopter  coming dead on at first. i roll down the window and no sound and so sign of red or blue lights ?  so we turn the corner and shortly after the thing begins to pulse and turns from white to  a amber color  with a white streak to the left  and is gone! we are looking in the same area and then look and see it way off to the south west of town but dimmer .    it is in the direction of the mall , now we begin to trip out !!! now this is where we are not sure it is the same thing or another craft . so we head towards its direction and this thing moves to the north west and then hovers over from what i can tell is the tree line and descends in a fielded area where mostly corn fields should be .  i have portions of this footage on my digital camera and him on his cell phone  during half the chase. unfortunately i did not record the footage from when we first saw this thing at it's brightest. i will say it was as intense as the moon but smaller hard to say what size it was. it clearly was not a conventional air craft , planet , and performed excessive speeds. \r\n\r\nthis was not a chopper a plane or venus this was a moving object that traveled in 4 directions and changed color and defied what we know.","distance":"501 Feet

parking lot where we had a clear view out to sea.  we could not understand what this object could be nor could we make out what this light was.  we asked ourselves what could be out there this late at night on the ocean waters, perhaps a fishing boat with bright lights?  do any boats go out this late with bright lights to fish for something?  if it was a boat fishing why would the light vary in intensity and with that particular color (orange)?  could it be a boat on fire?  the light was firelike in intensity and color as if it was on fire.  even though it was dark, i figured it must have been a few miles south of santa catalina island and a few miles west off san clemente.  we stayed there for several minutes watching this light glow and change in its shape.  at one point the light dimmed to a point and then returned to its large intensity.  we decided to leave and go home still puzzled.  we must have watched it for around 15 minutes from point of seeing it to end.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving home from my brother's house when i first observed a single, very intense white light 20 degrees above the western horizon (observation point littleton colorado).  the object was directly west, and appeared to be over the pine junction/bailey area in the mountains.  i kept in sight as i drove home and stood next to my car after i parked it.  the entire time it was under direct observation (approximately fifteen minutes), it did not move at all.\r\n\r\ni first thought it was an aircraft or helicopter.  however, the object absolutely did not move, not even the tiniest flucutation in position.  i was using the mountains below as well as a tree to keep track of its position.\r\n\r\nit was larger than any star or planet (probably double the size of the largest star in the sky), and because it did not move even a hair during the period observed, it was not a helicopter or an aircraft.  it was a circular light source of brilliant intensity that never shifted or fluctuated.\r\n\r\nthe light was brilliant, almost a \"pure\" white light, and the intensity was so strong there is no way it was a reflected light; it came from an artificial source and never changed in intensity or in color or position.\r\n\r\ni first noted the object because i tend to look at the passing aircraft a lot, and there was moderate air traffic in the area during the sighting.  what brought it to my scrutiny is that the light (object) never moved.\r\n\r\ni went inside to find a telephone number to make a report once i determined that this object was unidentified per my forty years of intense aviation interest.  i first left a voicemail message with the noise complaint hotline at buckley afb in denver, then called the command center of the 140th wing of the air national guard at the same base.  the female sergeant who took the call was very polite and asked very detailed questions regarding the sighting, then placed me on hold while she spoke with \"her boss\".  she was back on the line in about two minutes and said that her boss had the object under observation, and that mine was the first call they had received about it, and i jokingly responded that \"well, i'm sure that someone in the command structure is already aware of it.\"  knowing that us air force personnel had the object under observation, i retired for the evening.\r\n\r\nduring the entire fifteen minute observation period, i used the mountains and the branches of a tree (there was no wind) to ensure that it did not change position.  the intensity of the light never fluctuated, and the object never once moved, not even slightly.\r\n\r\nmy feelings and reactions were first disbelief, trying to classify it as an approaching aircraft or a hovering helicopter, but as the object never moved, i realized that it was something that needed to be reported officially.  my reaction was rather clinical and analytical, trying my best to find any way to identify what i was seeing.\r\n\r\nthis was, in now way whatsoever, an aircraft or a helicopter, and in no way was the intense white light a reflection off a shiny surface (the object would have been far too low to catch sunlight as the sunset here is about two hours earlier than my sighting).\r\n\r\nthank you for taking the time to read my report.  i cannot classify this sighting as anything but unidentified.","distance":"Over One

object, but too large to be a star, hanging in the sky to the west.  it did not appear to be moving like the planes that were flickering red all around it (we���re near sky harbor airport).  i headed south walking down drinkwater blvd toward osborn.  the object was on my right, due west, the whole time.  at various times i would stop to get a better look at it or try to figure out its size or location in the sky relative to a landmark.  it was lower than telephone lines and trees lining the street.  i continued past osborn, and then turned onto 74th street toward earll.  the object was still there and had not moved at all that i could tell; it stayed directly to my right until i turned east onto earll.  \r\n\r\ni kept turning around to look at the object even though it was now behind me.  i saw a woman walking her dog partway down earll and asked her if she saw what i was looking at and what she thought it was.  she said she had thought it was a star, but i pointed out that it was rather large and too low.  i also told her i saw dark green and red in the middle of the white rays coming off it.  she said it was also blinking.  i think she meant the whole thing was flickering in a star-like way; the red and green parts did not appear to be blinking at all to me.  the woman said she thought it must be a light on the top of a tower, but i didn���t see anything it could be attached to.  i told her if that were the case it (the light) would still be there tomorrow.  i told her i thought it was following me home.  she joked with me that a beam might come out of it at, and then we parted.  \r\n\r\ni continued down miller, turning south and crossed thomas, still keeping an eye on it.  walking down past the residential streets coming off of miller, i could see that the object came below street lights and barely skimmed over the tops of the one-level houses there.  i stopped across the street from an alley where i could see that the light was on a level with the top t of the second telephone pole going down the alleyway, which gave me an idea of its position in the sky.  if i stepped slightly to the side, it vanished behind the pole, which gave me an idea of its size.  i walked on about 20 feet, but then turned back to my point in front of the alley.  that was when i noticed that the object was now slightly lower in the sky because it wasn���t being ���framed��� in the same way by the second telephone pole as it had been before.  if it were a light on a tower, it would not have the ability to move up and down on a vertical plane.  \r\n\r\nat coronado high school, the light was lower than the highest parts of the school, but higher than the lower rooftops.  i then turned east at the boys and girls club on murray lane to head for home.  at that point, it was around 9:20 or just after and i was unable to keep track of it.  i will follow up tomorrow and walk the same route around the same time to see if i see it again.  if i do, it���s part of a tower or something; if i don���t, it���s unexplained.  i will update mufon then.  unfortunately, i do not have a camera phone and so i wasn���t able to get a picture of

approximately 10 miles south of portland oregon my wife saw a small, red satellite size object moving southwest at what she described as to fast for a plane and too low to be a satellite. the object was then joined by a second object fitting the same description coming from the same direction as the first as if in an effort to catch the first one she saw. the second object then joined the first object and they both formed one large red object and then vanished from sight. my wife and myself are regular sky watcher's and take many trips outside the house every night to view the stars when the sky is clear. i/we know what stars are where at any given time and have a little knowledge of the movement of the stars and the position they hold in the sky at different times of the year. on this same night, 02/02/09 around 10:30 pm pdt as i viewed the sky i looked to the southwest and said to myself \"well who are you ?\" i was looking at what i thought was a star out of place and figured being winter in the northwest it was a star i had yet to see, i was wrong . after my wife informed me of what she saw i put two and two together and realized i had seen something that was not a star. it was not red or moving, more of a light blue and quite large. the object was east of orion from my location (beaverton oregon) at the same level as the three stars that make-up orion's belt. i began to search the internet this afternoon 02/03/09 to see if anyone else had seen the object/objects and bingo ! what follows is the original posting that i found..... craigslitst, portland oregon,... \"ufo sighting no joke (gladstone)\"......\"i filmed a ufo from my back yard in gladstone the other night and it freaked me out, im a beleiver,i even filmed my dogs unusall behavior. everyone i have showed is freaked out by it and says i should try to sale it to national inquirerer or something. it changes shape and changes colors. its about 5 or more mins long. i think im just going to turn into fox 12 or channel 8 news but if you have any ideas on what i should do with it, let me know. my email\". you can find the original post (above) at \"craigslist\", portland oregon, \"rants and raves\".\r\ndate: 2009-02-03, 3:04pm pst. i would like to share with you why my wife and myself watch the sky. six years ago my wife and myself were camping at clear lake just south of mt. hood oregon. it was around 2:00 pm pdt when i noticed an object that looked like the inside of an abalone shell that was stationary in the sky but pulsating as fluid moves, kind of like the outside of a soap bubble when the light is shinning just right on it. i turned my head away from the object to get my wife's attention, (i was around 25 yards from the shore, in the lake fishing) to show her the object, (my wife is laying on a blanket on the shore).Then, when i turned my head back in the direction of the object and pointed it out to her it came right down on top of me, within 100 feet or so as if to say hi or i/we see you also. i had the feeling it/they/them? knew i had spotted it/they/them? it was as if it/they/them? were making an effort to remove all question from my mind as to what i had seen or was seeing ?, or to acknowledge our meeting ? for some strange reason this is what i felt. i was as if it/they/them? had me \"in the sights\" per say. a strange kind of focus feeling came over me, it was as if the object and myself were on/in/at someplace else. it was about half the size of a school bus, and like i said, \"fluid abalone\" in nature. i have no idea how long it was above me, it was as if time stood still. the next thing i remember is everyone around the lake, more than 50 people erupting in a roar/cheer like you would hear at a football game after a touchdown. i had the feeling that no one around the lake really knew what we had just seen, as if a state of shock overcame everyone, nothing more than a animated \"man did you see that\" and a few people looking at me with a big smile and a very tight hug and a wow ! wow ! wow ! from my wife. i could sense a feeling of peace among the people/campers around the lake, as if we had all just been given something very special. i would like to add that a taste of some kind lingered in my mouth for a couple of days, as if the fillings in my teeth had been oxidized . i can still imagine/taste the taste when i talk about the experience. \r\n\r\ntom ","distance":"21-100 Feet, Unknown","duration":"00:01:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

the sky, and saw a strange looking silver color disc shaped object moving across the sky making no noise of any kind. i am not sure how high in the sky the object was or how big it was due to it being in the sky directly above me with nothing to reference it to. it did seem to be very high in the sky though. \r\n it was moving at what seemed to be the same speed that a normal jet liner would travel with the exception that is seemed to be moving forward and then it would leap or jerk ahead.  then it would resume it's normal pace and repeat this leaping, jurking maneuver several times. i observed this object for about 30 seconds and then it just disappeared while it was heading in a north west direction. \r\n we have aircraft traveling over head all the time making their final approach to sky harbor airport in phoenix, so i'm very familiar with all the different types of jet aircraft that are in the skies over mesa, arizona. i also was in the us navy for several years and i was stationed  aboard an aircraft carrier, so i am very familiar with military jet aircraft as well. it really made me stop and wonder what it was that i was looking at, and one thing i know for sure, it was not an

looking at all the stars and activity in the sky.  one star, i presumed was a star; was awful strange looking to me, like it had appendatures with lights running up and down it.  i thought to myself this must be the space station or something like that.  i was joking around and talking to it and asking it to move and it did.  from my point of view in relation to the sky looked like it moved about one inch.  i'm sure i seen some kinda pulses come off of it several times....Maybe orbs.  anyhow, i went back inside and watched a movie pretty much dismissing it.  a couple  a hours later i came back out and it was still up there, flashing different colors up and down its spines. i went out and looked at it several more times the last time being about three am. i wanted to go to the shop and get my telescope and probably should have; i just kept thinking ...This is the skylab or a sattelite or something or if i go to get me telescope it will probably disappear. the last time i looked at at three in the morning it had moved to the western part of the sky, as i'm facing south it put it right in between my tree branches; it got really vibrant, the light's were really strobing out.  i enjoyed watching it and laughed a little..Figured if i was seeing it so were other people.  i don't know what it was for sure but the one time it moved that's for sure..It was a definite movement the rest of the time it seemed like it just floated along.  i went to bed. i will watch for it again tonight.
