an extremely bright star, or an aircraft of some sort. as i watched it i noticed it was changing colors from blue to red to orange to green.... then it went completely bright white, then would start with the series of colors again. i stood up and walked to the edge of my porch to watch it more intently and noticed that it looked like it was going from wide to thin , wide to thin, almost like it was rotating. it never moved closer or further away. it stayed in the same spot almost hovering. i watched it for about 20 minutes, while calling a friend on the phone, and calling my son & husband out to see it. finally, i walked inside to get my son's telescope, and when i came back out it was gone. this was a duration of less than a minute. as i was standing outside looking to see where it had gone i noticed something that looked exactly like what i had seen before, but in a completely different direction, and further away this time. a plane or jet could not have traveled this distance in this short amount of time. it was putting on the same light show that the first object i had seen was. then, i called a friend again to tell them what i had seen, and about 7 minutes into the phone call a bright light streaked over my house. it was like a shooting star, but it was one long string of light and much brighter than any shooting star i've ever seen. it zipped across the span of the sky in a second or less. it was faster than the anything i've ever seen, so fast like i said , that it was just a streak of very bright light, like a lazer beam. i finally went back into the house about an hour after all of this began, and the second object i had seen further off in the distance was still there, putting off a brilliant light show, never moving from that spot. i have never been interested in ufo's or payed much attention to claims of sightings, but i know i've never had any kind of experience like this before, and i hope i don't ever again. i just wanted to tell this story in the hopes that someone else will have reported it also. i can't have been the only one to see it. it was there for too long. anyway, thanks for listening.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15291,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.4704745,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032009-0014","longitude":-86.4522366,"occurred":1233634500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

something that made no sound, \"floated\" over from the far end of the field and hovered directly above us. we were all in sleeping bags at the time and looking straight up. i remeber asking \"do you see that?\" and everyone agreeing that they were in fact staring at somthing that we could not explain. i have often wondered why we were not at all scared. seems strange. anyway, the next thing i know i'm waking up, still in the same place. not sure why or how long i've been sleeping, but the object is still there and all of us had fallen asleep and woke up again at the same time. (is it just me or does that seem kind of strange??) we continued to look at the object for a short time (few minutes?) then the object began to \"float\" off, continuing in the same direction that it was headed when it stopped to hover over us. when it had traveled about 100 yards away it stoped and hovered briefly, and then abruptly \"shot\" up and disappeared completely. the next morning, i mentioned the encounter to my mom and she just kind of laughed and thought i was joking. one of the strange things about this encounter, is that us kids never again talked about what we had seen. it has been a lot of years since this happened and although i know what took place that night, because we never talked about it, i have always had a 1% reservation about what i remembered. i have wondered \"did i just dream this??\" \"did it realy happen??\". i recently became a member of facebook, the online comunity and was contacted by one of the other people that was there that night.(i have long since lost contact with everyone that was there)  it was interesting that he made it a point of asking me what i remembered from that night. i now have no reservations about whether this realy happened. over the years, one of the things that has gone unanswered, regarding this night, was whether or not there was any \"loss of time\". when my friend contacted me, he was able to provide an answer: yes, he had glanced at his watch prior to falling asleep and then again after we all woke up. according to what he is telling me, he believes that we lost about an hour. this is about all of the info that i can provide, regarding this episode at this time and hope that perhaps you guys could provide me with some feedback regarding this. i'm wondering if you have had any other sightings from this area? does any part of my description of events match what others have seen? any information you could provide would be great. now that i am in contact with one of the other four who were there, i believe that with a little bit of effort, i can probobly still locate at least one more of the people who were there that night. it will be interesting to see what he says, if i can find him. two more things really quick before i go: my grandmother had an encounter in the california desert, at verry close range, as well. i have wondered if these two encounters are not some how conected?? i also have something just under the skin of my right fore arm that i have also wondered if it may have been \"put\" there. it is my hope to convey my sincerity regarding everything that i have told you. this realy happened. thank you.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":15290,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.3019759,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032009-0013","longitude":-122.6416445,"occurred":312796800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Square,  Rectagular","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":312796800000,"summary":"Silent hovering craft directly above (aprox. 150 ft).","tags":["contact"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/15290_submitter_file1__Nolan0214090001.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/15290_submitter_file2__Nolan0214090002.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/15290_submitter_file3__Nolan0214090003.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Oak Harbor, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:268730"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"Petersburg","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"For many years i've wanted to express my observation of an incident that i've never come to grips with.  i'm now 65 years old.  the incident occured, i believe the summer of 1966, four miles south of petersburg, north dakota.  late one evening in the middle of the summer about 1:00 a.M. three of us guys were driving south of petersburg.  as we crested  a hill about a mile from my friends home, we seen what appeared to be a flashing red light.  our concern was that there may be fire responders at my friends place.  after a moment or two we realized that the red light was in fact pulsating-- not flashing.  we accelerated to reach the light which appeared to be in the middle of the road.  as we approached the light (within 1/4 mile) it disappeared and reappeared one mile east on highway #32.  we continued south to the section line and headed east to observe the pulsating light.  again within 1/4 mile it disappeared and reappeared approximately one mile south on highway 32 and continued to pulsate. we realized then that we would never catch it and if we did, what then.  the pulsating light disappeared and reappeared at 90 degree angles ( 1 mile increments ) in the snape of a finger.  no sound was hear.  why did the pulsating light reappear for us? was it decoying us away, like a killdeer bird from her nest?  were these multiple units or just one?  i believe it was one unit of unknown origin.  my first thought about the incident had to be related to being within 40 miles of the grand forks air force base.  we were also only 2 miles to the closest minuteman missile.  another site was about 4 miles and the third about 8 miles.  my friend told me that after this incident that he and his family seen pulsating lights the following nights appear just south of the buildings.  these sightings have been on our minds for over 40 plus years.  what did we see?  why didn't we communicate the sightings to authorities?  i never said anything to other people, i think because i was in the rotc program at the university of north dakota and did not want to jeapordize my future with the air force.  we have many questions and no answeres.  we do know that we seen something unexplainable.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":15289,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.0111052,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-02032009-0012","longitude":-98.0014884,"occurred":-110653200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North Dakota","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-110653200000,"summary":"Pulsating red light.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Petersburg, North Dakota","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:268731"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Highlands Ranch","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This is my 2nd early morning sighting of some type of ufo in the last two months. since 12/19/08, having seen and reported a very up close ufo, i���ve felt almost paranoid to be truthful. i���ve found it best not to say too much to too many people, as they are justifiably skeptical.\r\n\r\nsince, my husband and i have been constantly looking to the skies over highlands ranch, co.\r\n\r\nthis morning, 01/03/2009, at 05:42, i was in our bedroom with the lights off. the skies were pitch black as i could see stars, and to the north, airplane���s lights approaching dia.\r\n\r\nlooking out the window, in a southwestern direction, toward the mountains, quite a ways out in the distance, i saw an extremely bright light ���falling��� straight down. at first i thought it may have been a comet (however, the light was ���brilliant��� and there was no trail) and then it stopped...Just stopped...And the brilliant white light suddenly disappeared and a horizontal strobe of varying colored lights came on the object.\r\n\r\nstill not certain of what i was seeing (i thought it may have been an airplane that had a close call and perhaps the lights were on wing tips as i was admittedly trying to talk myself out of what i was seeing) when suddenly a very long, diffused looking white light shot straight down from the object for about 2-3 seconds (the light was about 1/3 the distance between the object and the horizon from my viewpoint) and then that light went away.

it,who do you tell?---knowing there'll be no definitive answer.My wife thought i was seeing a plane but this wasnt a plane because of the way this thing moved.After a while sitting there trying to

for about ten minutes and then i asked my mother to come outside to see this. that is when i remember to get my video camera. i was able to get some footage of this event before it blinked out. this is not like any plane i had ever seen before at first i thought it looked alot like military illumination that i have seen many many times being an ex sailor who was with the marines for quite a few years. but then it would suddenly flash a really bright red then go back to a yellow light. now my video isn't very good not really used to using the darn thing and lost it a couple of times while trying to zoom in on it but the video plainly shows it blinking bright red then it just blinks out and it was gone after about ten minutes. from my vantage  point it looked star like but again i was a long ways from the object. if you like i will send in the video for you to look at and analyze. please feel free to call me i am home most of the time. i would attache the video if i knew how but it is on one of those small tapes that you have to plug into your television or vcr. i know when an airplane is approaching you it can appear to stay in one spot, but this thing was there almost twenty minutes total then it blinked out.","distance":"Over One

happened and she said her room was shaking and everything was rattling on the shelves and making noises. she also said later that she felt herself spinning and felt dizzy and nauseas. i assumed she'd had a bad dream and tried to calm her down. she asked if she could sleep in my bedroom and i,of course said yes. we were lying on my bed in the dark chatting, when suddenly through the tiny crack in the curtain, a really small thin laser,very thin but really bright light hit me in my left eye (it did not hurt at all but i now have a small spot on my eyeld since)i immediately thought 'what on arth was that, as i do not have any lights outside my windows, being on the 4rth floor of an apartment block and overlooking the garden. i ran to look out of the window and could not beleive my eyes. directly in front overhead was the brightest ball of light ive ever seen, it was snow white. it was as bright as the moon but much larger and much lower, did not make a sound or did not move at all.I ran to tell my husband as i was very excited but he seemed very odd and did not even take a look. i ran back to my room where my daughter still was, and remember observing it for about 3 minutes. next thing i remember it was almost morning and the sun was almost up. i remember the object turned a glowing yellow color and simply disappeared. i realised then it was 6am. i only had one thought in my mind and it was' i watched it for 5 hrs. i do not recall my husband coming to bed and i do not remember if i went to work or anything really around several weeks after that. neither of us could remember anything else. in fact i forgot about it for several weeks until something jogged my memory at work and i remembered the incident. it was very strange because my husband loved photography and we had a camcorder and several cameras in the house. it did not even occur to me to take a picture and i know i definitly would have wanted to.","distance":"101-500

(i lived in a busy neighborhood)  bright lights appeared above in the distance just past the tree and house line.  a huge, very slow moving object came closer in our direction.  one by one we outside noticed it.  then people ran into houses and told neighbors and family to come see.  many people came out and joined the street to see it. everybody watched it drawing closer, many thought it was a blimp at first.  as it passed directly over us it was absolutely silent and by the multicolored lights moving around it's side we could see it was a wide oval, almost round.  the lights did change color and seem to flow around its perimeter (like a blimp, but it's shape was not a blimp).  the lights were yellow, red, blue, and white.  they seemed to change places randomly and in both directions

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was having study/prayer group and a friend who provides my transportation and i were driving like we usually do along k-7 homeward from the meeting. on my side (the passenger) i noticed the moon and made comment about a large star 12 degrees above the horizon and about 7-8 degrees to the left of the moon. i began thinking to myself that must be either saturn or venus. it was too large to be saturn and it would have been last month and december for that... i spoke out loud, \"that must be venus.\" then i thought that can't be right. so this time when i look the object was closer towards the moon maintaining altitude at about 4-5 degrees away. \"that's not a planet\" i said, \"it's moving!\" it looked far too large to be a helicopter and too far away or we would have heard it. the driver's eye's opened wide dropjawed. i turned to look at it again and it had picked up pace. now k-7 was veering right and the moon us and the object were getting close to conjunction when suddenly the object zigzagged left and right across the road and over again the moon drivers side by now the object was on the right hand side of the moon about 10 degrees all the while maintaining platform altitude. k-7 was still veering away so we turned onto 63rd and genoa following the object. we made our way into a small subdivision passing 67th and turned into 67th terrace heading straight at it. unfortunately, that was a culdesac so we parked and got out for a clearer view. now the object remained motionless for ten minutes after the first five my driver friend called our hosts that evening to come out and see it and to bring a telescope or some binoculars. just before they arrived the object permeated slightly or pulsed off and on and drifted slightly side to side and downward when it did so. now the object was only about 6-7 degrees above horizon 10-11 degrees to the right of the moon and froze there for another ten minutes after our hosts had arrived. my driver and i were quite excited about all this so our male host peered at the object...He said, \"that's no star that i've ever seen and he handed them to me. the object shrank on the lens and lost it's shining starlike aura. it appeared perfectly sphere like but was surrounded perfectly by a band of stark red very cutlike. it was chilly and i couldn't get a stable view as i would have liked trembling. our hosts counterpart couldn't even locate the object using the binoculars my driver did but her eyesight with glasses was poor. so both parties decide to drive to the object. they got in their truck we in our car and headed along 75th until that ran out and we then made our way onto 85th the object motionless the entire time. at some point before 75th my driver friend called her son excitedly explaining some details. later that evening her son said he was called at 9:20pm. so, we're following our hosts truck when the object maintaining altitude began losing us moving away above the road. our hosts with not as keen eyesight as mine lost the object and parked we beckoned them to follow us. we drove faster along k-10 now and the object smaller now and further away once again stopped. there were a few misturns along the way it took some work to make it to the inject through rural neighborhoods. now we were just leaving from desoto kansas on 95th and gaining quickly half way to lawrence kansas. after a few minutes 95th began to veer left away from the object a gigantic huge bright shining orb about a half mile or 2/3rd's mile away about 300 yards in diameter twice the width of the quarter crescent moon. appearing about 30 degrees above the horizon since we were positioned underneath it more and 25 degrees away from the moon still and to the right. we all stopped and parked getting out of our vehicles. suddenly the bright white shining light turned off and what remained was a ring composed of lit multicolored square panels that flashed off and on with various different colors perhaps even rotating...The flashes made that somewhat confusing though. it held that shape for only 5 seconds or less and then the flashes stopped and suddenly the object was square shaped or perhaps looked square front light white left side red to yellow pulsing blue light right and green light tail. the object moved along the horizon away from the moon dissappearing over olathe. at that point anyone would pass it for a plane.
