1:50 am), i notied it was back. this time it was much larger (therefore probably much closer) than in previous sightings. it looked like an oval (dark in the center) with lights like fireworks shooting all around the craft. the lights would be distinctly green, then distinctly red, then distinctly white, blending into a  mixture of all three colors. \r\n\r\ni'm not a good judge of distance, it we could clearly see the shape of the craft surrounded by these \"fireworks\" lights. as i look out the window just now, the object seems to have pulled away quite a bit. it's about half the size as it appeared about a half hour ago.\r\n\r\nof course (i just saw your questions to the side here), at first we thought it was a planet -

high, almost 45 degrees up.  it appears to be moving upward, and toward the south, maybe south-east. at first it looked kind-of like a plane, but there were no flashing lights, and it looked just a little bit orange-ish. something about the light just looked different from the lights of a plane.  as it rose up higher, moving away from me, a few seconds after i started watching it it just became dimmer and dimmer as it moved away, until i couldn't see it anymore.  not sure if it's because the light it emitted got dimmer, or the object was just moving away really fast.  the whole sighting lasted about 30 seconds or so.  after seeing this, i of course began watching the sky even more closely, and i spotted another light that looked exactly like it to the north of me.  the same thing happened as i started watching it, and it got dimmer as it rose up in the air.  it was the same color, no flashing lights, and may have very well been moving in the same direction as the other one, from my perspective.  this one was lower to the horizon, maybe only 25 degrees up from the horizon.  at this point i'm pretty sure that what i saw was something moving out from somewhere, and dimming itself as it rose up. it didn't look like it was moving away at super-speed, unless it was really far away.  it was definitely moving faster than other aircraft in the area that i see flying around.  i continued to watch the sky for awhile after that to see if they would pop back up somewhere along the trajectory they seemed to be traveling, or if i could spot any more of them, but i did not.  i could tell by the intensity of the light being emitted, and the lack of atmospheric distortion that these things were not extremely high up like a satellite, and more at the level that other aircraft fly at, or at least the second one was.  i think the first one i saw may have been pretty high up, though.  the first one i spotted i almost mis-took for a really bright star or a planet at first glance (as the planets were very bright this evening), of course until i did a double-take and realized it was traveling.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

stationary for appox 5 minutes when i went inside for less than a minute and brought out a pair of binoculars. i watched the object for a few more minutes when it started getting larger and flashed brighter than it made a 90 degree turn to the left contrary to local air traffic. it was low to the horizon tree top level. it sped up got brighter still flashing and headed out in an east south east direction until it dropped behind the trees and i lost contact. the time was 10:18 pm est when i lost sight. i watched ofr 5 more minutes but it was gone. the speed it was traveling was much faster than normal aircraft, but it looked like it was mush lower in the sky and i am not that good at estimating air speed but it was much faster than any aircraft could travel.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw it i just knew it was not a normal object, as i am well versed in the sky at my house, being a meteor counter and just enjoy the night sky i can tell the time of night by the position of the constellations, and know the flight patterns of the commercial airlines fairly well. when i see something out of the norm i will watch it and see what i can.\r\n\r\ni had no \"feelings\" of dread or surprise etc i calmly watched and made good mental note of what happened. this was a good end to the superbowl as it happened just as it was over. it was not a rocket, weather balloon nor swamp gas, just an unknown fast moving flashing object that deviated from the norm.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

adjusted to the darkenss, about 5 minutes, i was able to view the stars through the trees. i quickly located one of the 'moving' stars, and began to watch it. as it started its path up (moving from western sky towards vertical my relative location) i noticed there were two others flanking it slightly behind, in a standard 3 flight formation. the two side lights moved to parallel, they began to move off at 90 degrees (one north, the other south). they quickly faded from view, while the center one seemed to stop, and remain stationary for some time. having seen something similar the night before, i was more relieved then concerned, as it reinforced the sighting i had the previous night. i am able to state that the objects did move, as i have several bare branch trees to use as points of reference, and could see the lights moving in relation to the trees.  i did not report last nights sighting, as i was unsure if i had really witnessed this,or was suffering from fatigue. i currently take wellbutrin, but do nto feel that this has any bearing, as i take 150 mg once per day, to help with a stop smoking program.  i will report any other sightings here, and i am willing to

years later it still has not hit me. i had a daylight sighting at rose valley lake ten miles north of williamsport, pa. it was about mid may 1986. i was with a fried driving up to the lake to kill time before we went out. we stopped at the lake to watch some fisherman and take in the nice day. we were parked facing south with the sun setting to our west. we were noticing the high amount of air traffic and how well the visibility was that late day. i was locked in on a smaller commercial jet flying lower than the others heading west to east.                                                                            now at this time the sun was nearly blocked by the small mountain to the west. the sky was very clear and it had only a few scattered feather like clouds. thats when the show began. we must have both seen the disk appear at the same time. we both said at the same time something like, \"look at that\" or \"what is that\".                                                                            i seen a disk simular in size to the jet. at the time i only new of the new mudic cd disk to compare it to. it is still the best decription until today. it was round and about the same width and length of the jet. it was perfect looking. it was gluiding like behind the jet. it had no exhaust, or vibration like the jet. no sound. it was closing in on the jet at a slow pace. it seemed a long time but it probably was less than a half minute and it just vanishes.                                                                          we remark again at the same time at its vanishing. after a short time it pops up again at the front right of the jet. it seemed to travel at the same speed of the jet to its front right. the pilots must have seen it. it does this for a short time and suddenly takes off directly from the earth at an obvious unearthly speed. it was like it did that on prupose to show off.                                                                            i vividly remember this event and me actually waiving to this disk at one point to let them know i see them. i had a feeling they knew we were watching. this sighting left no dout in my mind they do not belong here. to me now it is why are they here. i have keep this quite for the past twenty of the almost twenty three years.                                                                              the only reason i am telling this story now is out of guilt. i always felt bad that one of those pilots might have been brave enough to report it. i could have been the ground witness to support their sighting. i tried to use any resources available at that time but it was very limited.                                                                             it is so strange to have absolute knowlege of something and not be able to share it. i have been around this country and lived next to air force bases. i have been to my brothers work when he was doing welding inspections on f-16's. i know the skies. if you would ask for a ufo show to leave you no dout, this was it.

explain what happened earlier \r\nthat year in missoula montana. i have been interested in watching shows on ufos and looking at videos on you tube of possible ufos, but  until august 2008, i have never seen one personally before.  in a few videos i have seen- like the ones from the us space station- i noticed how they were very bright and can appear and disappear. so i have been looking up at stars and watching for winking etc.  \r\none night  in missoula, mt in june or july 2008, i was having a few beers and relaxing and looking up at the sky, i saw  a bright light moving across the sky like the bright headlight of an airplane/jet. but there where no blinking red lights at the back like they usually have. all of a sudden the light goes out. i told my self, well it was probably a plane and they went behind a cloud or something. but a few minutes later or maybe even a half an hour later a very bright light- in the same part of the sky i had seen the previous light- blinked on then off, then on  then off again and then was gone. it was vert bright. i wondered to myself, hmm, was that possibly something more than an aircraft. but i wasn't convinced enough one way or the other. but it got my attention.\r\nlater that summer in august (2008) i was camping at  a public camping site( i forget the name) near squamish , bc. it's one or two exits out of town when going north, you make  a left and then drive down a road and you can park your car or set up a tent. it was about ten or eleven pm. i was having a few beers and sitting in my lawn chair gazing at the stars. i was looking way up at the stars and trying to see if any of them were winking on and off , trying to see if any of the stars were acting in a different manner than usual, i was toying with the idea that i was seeing stationary craft and was counting them off, when i saw it. way up there, it was a glowing white light like the white glow that a full moon gives off. it was weaving back and forth in tight circular motions very fast.  at one moment, i could see it from the side and it was thin and curved like a bent plate or a frisby shape.  i now have no doubt i have seen a ufo. it was not just a bright light in the sky. i saw this thing really doing fast weaving manuvers and i saw it from the side glowing white (like a full moon) but thin and curved. i have seen one video on you tube of a craft that was flying just like this one and it was bright also, but the you tube video was taken in the daylight. this was at night. it didn't last long, probably less than a minute and i went to bed.\r\n\r\ni am confident i have either seen an alien spacecraft or an advanced craft operated by the us or canada or ???\r\n\r\ni was not afraid, i thought it was cool and graceful, then it was gone.\r\n\r\n          ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Path with directional

belongings in my '67 chevelle.  i was somewhere in arizona (not much arround for miles) , it was late in the evening, and i was wanting to find a town where i could spend the night.  i noticed a circular white light facing me out the passenger window.  i could not determine the distance, but as i would look in the rearview mirror, it would appear behind me in a matter of seconds. it moved to an area distant from my passenger window and back behind my car at least two to three times.  there were no other cars behind or ahead of me..On this two-lane highway.  my first thought (upon seeing the light (singular) beside me, was that it may have been a train, as it remained steady, not going up or down.  but it seemed like the light was facing me.  once i saw it in my rearview mirror (in seconds)...I ruled out a train.\r\n\r\nduring the experience...I did think it could be somekind of ufo...I was a bit uncomfortable during this experience. after the sighting...I recall just being very tired and wanting to get to the next town.  the light just stopped after a matter of a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nlater that same night (i'm not sure how far i traveled) , i noticed my engine dying. i was not out of gas, and i was able to arrive at the outskirst of a town (i do not recall the name of the town), but i remember pulling off the road to park near a service station to rest and await sunrise. i thought it was a very fortunate coincidence that my car died where it did.  i was very tired and decided to sleep for a while while sitting in the front seat next to this service station. (my back seat was loaded with belongings).  i'm sure i slept for a while.\r\n\r\ni don't remember further details, but i recall replacing one of the electrical components in my chevelle the next day. i don't recall which one. \r\n\r\nplease note, i may have posted this account previously, as i typed this account on a ufo-related website within the last two years.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":15237,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0586781,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01312009-0017","longitude":-111.0879111,"occurred":132562800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":132562800000,"summary":"Circular white lights moving rapidly beside and behind my car as i was driving.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"CMS/sg n/a, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:269541"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Acworth","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving to my friends house and i saw a huge bright yellowish/whitish kind of like a headlight star shaped circle in the sky.\r\nafter ten seconds, in a millesecond, it dissappeared.  i saw another when i got home, and it stayed for about 5 minutes, my mom has seen it for the past 3 days coming and going.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15236,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0704329,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01312009-0016","longitude":-84.6680396,"occurred":1233458700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Georgia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1233458700000,"summary":"Bright huge yellow light.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Acworth, Georgia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:269542"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Salt Lake City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We took a picture of my friend trevor.  and in the top left corner of the picture the object is seen. we never saw the picture with our own eyes only in the picture.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15235,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.7638293,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01312009-0015","longitude":-111.8900274,"occurred":1229288400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Utah","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Disc,  Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1229288400000,"summary":"A saucer like object.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/15235_submitter_file1__l_51a80afb7e4848bc8722253c5c700aef.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Salt Lake City, Utah","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:269543"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Irvine","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was as brighter than an star it was two close together, i want to know if anyone else have seen this object also.\r\n\r\ni was driving my car on irvine blvd when i saw this object it was far off in the distance toward the radio station on the hill way up toward the 241 mountains.\r\ni do not what they were but it caught my eye's it was at 5:20 am exactly\r\ntoo early for jet aircraft because john wayne is closed at that time.\r\nplease help me if you could i would like some more information ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15234,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.6931473,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01312009-0014","longitude":-117.7873042,"occurred":1233062400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1233062400000,"summary":"It was a light star like not a star it looked like two stagered close together.
