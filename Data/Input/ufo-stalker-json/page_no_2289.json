store to wait for my ride home.  the air was thick with smoke and the sky was in a complete haze.  later, i was told that this was the result of fires in broward county drifting southward.  so thick was the haze that stars were not visible it was reflecting the ambiant street lights.  at the time i was speaking with my wife over my cell phone and was staring out over the store's parking lot.  then, suddenly, through the trees, roughly south-south east of my position, i saw a solid orange dot appear and swing down a few feet in an arc like motion and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  except for the arcing motion, i'd almost guess it was a shooting star except that it was appeared in front of the haze in the sky, rather than through it.  also the shape of it was puzzling as well.  i've seen shooting stars before but...  this looked like a hard orange dot.  no lens flare, no shimmering, nothing of that sort.  it was just a hard orange dot.  not sure how else to describe it.  as if you used a hole punch on a piece of orange paper, i guess.  the sighting lasted only a second and the object never reappeared.  it could've been a shooting star but the peculiarness of it, i thought warranted reporting, if nothing else to see if anyone else saw it

earth is that?  it's too high up to be a ground-bound electric light and it's too bright to be an airplane.\" it made me think of a giant football field light only it was 'way up there in the sky.  to my astonishment, the orb then suddenly expanded and completely vanished without a trace.  i was dumbfounded--i didn't know if my mind was playing tricks on me or what.\r\n\r\nbut at exactly the same moment that i yelled out, the other 2 occupants of the car also started shouting, \"what was that! did you see that???  did you just see a bright light explode and disappear????\"  the other 2 in the described seeing exactly the same light that i saw.  i commented that i didn't think it could be an airplane exploding because i thought a plane would look like a 'gasoline explosion' with orange-burning parts falling away from it.  this was pure bright white light, and it was a perfect circle, even as it expanded and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nwe also noticed that the car ahead of us slowed to a dead stop midway on the exit ramp, as if its driver too had seen something that distracted him from driving.  i was tempted to jump out of the car and ask the driver if he had seen the same thing but i didn't.\r\n\r\nremember that 'ufo' simply means \"unidentified flying object,\" nothing more--the term 'ufo' in itself does not mean 'alien spacecraft.'  all 3 of us, including my

when it's dark and there out until sunrise.  the first night i saw the craft i was looking throught the garage door window when i saw what i thought was a plane with it's landing lights coming down.  there was blue and red flashing and i realized it wasn't a plane when it was staying in the same position for over ten minutes.  the one i just described is the lowest one there is and there are well over 20 crafts scattered all over the sky at a higher altitude that i can see with my binocualrs.  the crafts flash blue and red, green, amber, yellow, and the most beautiful color purple that i have ever seen.  it appears to move from town to town also.  around 6:00 i will look towards the town of folsom with the binoculars and i can see the craft and the colors on it.  then around seven i can see it above the near town of citrus heights and around 7:30 or 8pm it's in front of me in my town of antelope where it moves a little more but it stays with us for the remainder of the night.  also, the latter in the evening it get's the more they move around like if they were dancing up and down and side to side.  there's also one more craft that is different then the others because this one i thought was a planet until it starts to dance around like the others or dashes way out of view when a plane or helicopter comes towards it's direction.  this one move's more around when it first comes out unlike the other ones that dance around later in the evening.  there's a video clip of the last one that i described.  i don't know how to copy and paste but if you go to google and type in sacramento news 10 ufo you can see the news chopper and it's crew chasing the object.  the news station did a follow up to the story and it was explained away as a light sign being towed by plane which is an out right lie.  it hovers in the same spot for over an hour until it starts slowly moving toward the next towm.  ever since it's been said it was sign i havent' heard another about it.  it was all over the morning news radio and everyone was talking about it every where.  know, i haven't heard a word about it any where for since the news story.  i'm a little uncomfortable with all of this going on right above my house.  i also neve lose any sight of them unless i go to bed or it'd raining or cloudy.  even when there's rain or clouds there always a break in the clouds for a few seconds and you can see that they are still there.  i also believe this has been going on well before the first night i saw them.

very bright white lights in the sky above the fields northwest of fredericktown, ohio.  it was a very dark, foggy morning, and driving was difficult both because of the fog and other drivers��� headlights following closely behind me.  i was on ohio state route 13, headed north, at about the point where the highway narrows from four lanes into two and curves, first to the right and then back to the left, juse north of fredericktown, when i first saw this horizontal line of six or eight white lights (i don���t remember exactly how many).  they were very bright, equally spaced apart, and seemingly stationary.  it was impossible to tell whether they were very close to me and low to the ground, or very far away and high above the ground, but from my vantage point they appeared to be about 300 feet above the ground and maybe a half-mile or so distant.  they did not move, or change position in relationship to the ground or to each other as i followed the road around the two curves.  i lost sight of them as i traveled further north on the highway.  i do not know if i lost sight of them because of the fog, or because i had traveled past them, and they were now behind me, or because they were no longer there.  because of the traffic behind me, i could not drive much slower than i already was, or pull over to watch them.  as i said, it was very foggy, a low, patchy ground fog, and these lights appeared to be well above the fog.  the only rational explanation i can offer is that it was the landing lights of a formation of two c-130 aircraft from the air national guard (or perhaps a single aircraft, given the configuration of the landing lights on the wings of that aircraft) going to land at lahm field in mansfield.  as a pilot, i have seen the landing lights of large aircraft when they are at a great distance and headed directly towards me, and they appear to be stationary for a time, but eventually they will disappear because the aircraft turns or goes behind a cloud layer.  these lights ��� if they were aircraft landing lights ��� appeared very much brighter and larger than i had before seen on distant aircraft, indicating that they were very close.  but, if they were close, i should have been able to see the red and green navigation lights on the wingtips, and the flashing red beacons or strobes on the fuselages, as well as movement.  i thought at first that it might be a blimp ��� the goodyear blimp is stationed nearby in akron, and i see it fly by several times a year, on its way to cover a football game somewhere ��� but i cannot think why one would be flying cross country at night, or in this weather and at this time of the year in this area.  furthermore, i have never seen this arrangement of lights on a blimp, and a blimp would also have red and green navigation lights.  besides that, both c-130���s and blimps are noisy aircraft.  the thought occurred to me that it might be going to attempt  a crash landing on the highway, so i put down the window so i could see more clearly and so i could hear whatever it was, but there was no sound besides that made by my own tires on the road.
