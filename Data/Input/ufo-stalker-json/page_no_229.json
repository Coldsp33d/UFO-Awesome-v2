States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I would first like to state that this is not my first nor my last experience with ufo's. they have been following me most of my life and have been seen by both of my parents at our home. this is the first time however that i have been chased down the street by one which is why i am choosing this experience to post since it was the most concerning. unfortunately i did not bring my cell phone with me at that time so i have no footage or pictures therefore this is just my personal testimony with only my dog as a witness, though my dog has since passed away. i walked my dog down the street in a western direction and did not notice anything (but to be honest i wasn't looking). as i crossed the street heading the 1/2 mile walk towards my home going in an eastern direction, my dog was \"doing his thing\" and it wasn't something i particularly wanted to watch so, as i tend do, i looked up into the sky. the sun was barely setting and it was still bright out but i noticed a bright dot in the sky above me. i just assumed it was a bright star beginning to show. my dog was ready to move to i walked about 10 feet and he \"did his thing\" and i looked up in the sky again. i noticed a bright \"star\" directly above me again. i thought that was weird and looked towards the west as that was the direction i was when i first observed it. there was nothing over there. now i remember from school that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. there is no way that the \"star\" i saw 10 feet behind me could have moved in the eastern direction i was walking. that goes against that principle of the earth's rotation. my dog and i began to walk again but this time i did not take my eyes away from the \"star\". it followed me down the street. i became very alarmed and though my rational mind was trying to think of something other than what i knew it to be, i wanted to be sure of what was happening. so, my poor dog along for the ride, i began to move around in various directions. running under trees and instead of going straight i'd turn around and quickly run back to where i was and it continued to follow me. when i would run i would see it actually change shape. it stayed a bright white color the entire time but when it would move fast it would change from a round object to a round object but with a point and quickly change back to a round object. i would walk/run up and down the street, even crossing the street and it continued to follow me. as i got to the corner before crossing a major street towards the street my house was on, i just stood there watching it. i noticed in my peripheral vision that an airplane was flying in a southwestern direction by towards the object. i waited wanting to know what it was going to do. as the plane got closer, and i did not even blink, the object disappeared. it didn't jump or fly away quickly. nope, just plain ole: \"now you see me, now you don't.\". i stayed there for a couple more minutes looking around and didn't see it reappear. i crossed the street and headed towards my home. i continued to watch the sky looking everywhere around but didn't see anything. it wasn't until i was about 5-6 houses away from my house that i saw it. it was hovering directly over my home, as if it knew where i live. which, considering how many sightings there has been over my home, i wasn't surprised but was a little pissed off to be honest. as i was getting closer to my home it didn't move. it wasn't until i noticed my father walk out of the house that the object did that disappearing trick it did before. i have not had that type of experience since but my dogs have passed away so i don't walk down the street much anymore. however, as i have stated, there were many more experiences afterwards. majority happen at night and yes, there is always, always black helicopters following about 10-15 minutes later, in the direction the objects would fly. i did inform my parents of this incident, my dad has had experiences with ufo sightings before so he believed me but my mom, at the time, didn't. it wasn't until she actually saw one for herself, the exact way i would describe to her that they would fly over our house at night, she believed me then. and even more so when 10 minutes later, we watched as the helicopter fly in the direction the object went. i am also concerned of possible abductions but i just don't have proof nor memory recall and i don't know how i could recall the gaps in my memories that i do have. but this incident i remember with perfect clarity as if it just happened its just taken me awhile to decide whether i wanted to report it because i just feel alone and crazy in it but realized, that's probably what many people feel in this type of situation so its time i just put it out there and see what happens. thank you for your time.","distance":"Over One

seconds) to the south of sandia peak (east of my location). had my camera with zoom lenses and was able to capture several photos of the object. object was an estimated 10 miles from my location but could easily be seen. at first it was ascending below mountain peak, and i wondered if perhaps it was a reflection of the sandia peak tram (however, this was the wrong location for the tram). it was also much too large to be the tram. as object pulsated (perhaps it was spinning slowly), i attempted to capture photos of the craft. stopped other hikers and pointed the object out to them also. object quickly ascended above the sandia mountains, continued to pulsate. after several minutes, it's altitude lowered - or perhaps it was moving east and merely appeared to be at a lower altitude. object suddenly disappeared. i am attaching a couple of photos, including a few i applied filters to. several are zoom shots; i have the originals should you like to have them.","distance":"Over One

( satelites o ovnis ? ) despues de muchos dias de intentar rastrear doble orbitales, hoy se vieron con gran brillo y actitud orbital viajando hacia el norte \", la aparición de los mismo se dio, apenas grados mas arriba de sirio, en pleno cenit del cielo. aqui los primeros cuadros de 2017 con trv sony ; infrarroja cuadro via salida analogica . expongo este pequeño teorema aqui, sabiendo que , esta fenomenología celeste, existe afirmativamente ( una confirmación quiza mas a sabiendas de tantisimas mentiras y fantasias y sin embargo este fenómeno se repite en los años, y es extraordinario. ) suele generar elipses y trazos orbitales, en nuestros cielos \" nunca se los ve al atardecer, en verano\" , los meses de invierno son su temporada. donde? en plena vertical/cenit, eso es lo que lo hace llamativo y misterioso ( parece re/entrar ) , nunca en varios años de monitoreo , se los observo prescediendo, la aparente orbital , cubre visiblemente, siempre un cuarto de nuestra media esfera celeste, que nos corresponde de ver. porque aparecen solo en la vertical ? porque el brillo es tan extraordinario ? ( de -1 a -5 ) segun la ciencia mas rigurosa , pueden ser una pareja tandem x ( dos satelites pequeños, a 250 mt, uno del otro, y a 500 km de altura ) segun estas observaciones, puede que no se trate de tal cosa . aqui reporte entonces las primer aparición , este invierno y desde buenos aires.\r\nvideo here https://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=myxr5jaquzs&#65279;","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Insignia, Wings, Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":83897,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-34.5958144,"location":null,"logNumber":"AR-05222017-0007","longitude":-58.376849099999994,"occurred":1493666820000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Buenos Aires","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1495429574000,"summary":"Triangular trayning of lenticular u.F.O ( orbital and lenticular points of light) ","tags":["video","uso","light"],"timeZone":"America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires","timeZoneName":"America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires","tweeted":1495444639859,"urls":[],"weather":{"history":null},"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":20,"locationName":"Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13465"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Tempe","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Looked up to stars and saw grey object shaped like a boomerang flying in the air moving very fast. it made a turn and disappeared. the whole thing lasted about 13 seconds. there were no lights, no sound, just an object cruising incredibly fast through the night sky.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:28:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":83896,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.4313104,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-05222017-0006","longitude":-111.93630540000001,"occurred":1495324800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1495425263000,"summary":"Grey boomerang flying through air","tags":["sound","lights"],"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles","timeZoneName":"America/Los_Angeles","tweeted":1495440139820,"urls":[],"weather":null,"zipcode":"85281","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":1,"locationName":"Tempe, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:13466"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"500 Feet or Less","city":"Concord","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" i live in contra costa county, california and while visiting a friend in concord, ca., who lives adjacent to a small airport (buchannan field), we witnessed a very bizarre object in the sky between 10pm and 2am on september 30,2005.  my friend lives in a mobile home park and she had gone outside to put out her garbage... a few minutes later she comes running back inside and grabs her binoculars and says, \"come out and tell me if you see anything !\",to myself and another friend. so we follow her out as she's telling us that she suddenly felt compelled to look over toward a large \" hangar/ aero bldg.\" by the airfield, (approx. a half mile away.)  she thought she saw \"something\" in her peripheral view as she glanced over that way...But looking straight on she saw nothing. she described what she thought she had \"glimpsed\" for just a moment as a \"huge spinning light orb just above that building, that seemed to have a kind of electrical communication on it \".   not sure if she really had seen something there, and being unable to see it as she continued to look straight on in that direction, she decided to come inside to grab both of us and her binoculars.  here is where it gets truly bizarre!.....Looking over there with the binoculars it could clearly be seen!  but we could see nothing with the naked eye!!!  by now, two of her neighbors had come over to see what we were looking at, and they too could see exactly what we had, but only with the binoculars! \r\n  here is the best description of this very bizarre thing that we all saw .....A huge spinning sphere ( appearing like a kind of hologram ) that was lit as if from below and then up its sides ( although at one point the light switched for approximately 15 minutes, as shining from above, toward the lower left quadrant, then returned to being lit from below )  it looked like a giant ( appearing from our distance away, which was approximately a half mile, to be approx. 100 ft in diameter ) holographic sphere that was hovering just above that building ( that building being along the ne side of the airport grounds ) and it seemed to be spinning slowly clockwise and vibrating, while a light source illuminated it, allowing  us to either view it lit from below ( looking like the bottom bowl portion of the sphere) ,or from above the sphere and shining toward its lower left quadrant.  when dialing the focus on the binoculars to look specifically on the outer edges of the sphere, you clearly could see what looked like an electrically charged stream that was filled with some sort of language/symbols ( unidentifiable to us as to it's type... completely unfamiliar to us ) travelling around the middle third of the sphere.  the transparent surface of the sphere was like a very faint translucent greenish, black, and molten gold like crust that seemed to be unsmooth like with tiny craters.  because it had a 3-d holographic appearance, we could see both the \"surface\" the symbols travelled across, as well as the inside of the far side of the sphere.   it is hard to describe it much better than that.  but what blew us all away was that we could see absolutely nothing with the naked eye, only with the binoculars! \r\n  all together we spent almost 4 hrs. watching this thing. two of us even got in my car with the binoculars, and drove over as close as we could get to the bldg. it appeared to be hovering above, but the closest we could get was approximately 80 yds away, as we couldn't get onto the airport grounds itself.  unfortunately, in this area there was far too much light, both from all around that building and many street and airport lights, as well as from the constant passing headlights from hwy. 4 that runs along that side of the airport and directly behind that building, so it was like looking at the stars when you are totally surrounded by street and city lights ,so we couldn't see it, even with the binoculars. \r\n  so we drove back to report this to our friend, and discovered that from her front yard, we all could still see this thing when looking through the binoculars.  my friends and i kept up the viewing until around 2 am when suddenly it just disappeared!  it was as if someone had just flipped a switch and turned it off ! just like that it was gone !\r\n  have you ever heard of anything resembling this?   we are mystified and want to know if this sort of phenomenon, or anything like it, has been sighted before, and if so, have there been any possible explanations for it?

was and it was not a consistent speed. at times it seemed to not be moving or just barely and i would describe it as \"meandering\" because while it did not change direction, it wasn't a completely straight line. it also appeared to be faintly pulsing.\r\nunfortunately we were unprepared for something like this and we only managed 2 photos and 2 videos. the object appeared much bigger than it appears in the videos. photo 1 best represents its apparent size and the glow that made me think it was mars. this occurred on a dark street which makes it hard to find a reference point in the videos but in video 1 to the right of the object is a telephone pole that should be more visible if you could increase brightness in the video somehow. the telephone pole helps you realize how it was drifting and travelling not quite straight. video 2 i had moved to a better position but has no reference point that i can see.\r\nto the naked eye, the object never stopped glowing, but picture 2 (taken on a phone with a better zoom) shows a dull, not glowing, round object with some sort of indentation. \r\nfrom the moment i noticed it in the sky to the end of the sighting was probably about 1 to 2 minutes in total. i asked my boyfriend to hand me my phone back at which point he looked down to hand it to me, i looked down to grab it and in that split-second that neither of us were looking, the object vanished. it was there, then it wasn't. it wasn't visible in any direction, hadn't left a trail, there was no flash or anything noticeable in our peripheral vision. it was just

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Solar craft\r\n\r\non sunday may 7, 2017 at 2:28 p.M. i was shooting a series of images of the sun with a new solar filter that i had purchased for the august eclipse.  i was taking images about every 15 seconds as i was trying varying shutter speeds.  when i began processing the images, i noticed that there were some dot-like objects which were surrounding the disc of the sun.  there initially were a white, a blue, and a red colored object all in different locations.  \r\n\r\nat first i wondered if they were stars.  but between the two frames in which i first noticed them, they were moving in various ways by the second frame.\r\n\r\nimage # 75 was taken at 1/125th second at f9, and iso 200 at 2:28:29 pm.\r\nthe next frame, image # 76 was taken at 1/60th second at same f9 and iso 200.\r\nin the first image, one will notice just beyond 6 o'clock outside the rim of the sun, a blue dot.  there is also a red dot further out near the bottom of the page in the left corner.  the blue dot is at 6 degrees to the left of center of the sun, and the red dot is at 31 degrees.\r\nby the next frame, the blue dot had moved from 6 to 25 degrees and the red dot from 31 to 38 degrees.  my first thought was that they could be stars.   if they had been stars--they would have remained basically in the same location from my perspective in 15 seconds.  they appear to be some kind of craft as they have independent motion.  for image #75, if one looks near 4 o'clock, a faint white dot can be seen, and on the second image, near 11 o'clock another faint dot.  there are actually 2 there when the image is blown up.\r\n\r\nwhen comparing the images, if they were stars, the distance between the red and the blue \"craft\" should stay the same from #75 and #76.  despite the different crop size of the images, when i account for the difference and mathematically account for the difference between the two blue and red dots, they change.  in the first image, that sun is 1.345 times larger than the sun in the second image.  so, the distances will also be 1.345 times different.  mathematically accounting for this or \"standardizing\" it allows us to compare what is going on between the \"craft\" in both images.\r\n\r\n1.  the distance between the two dots on a printout of the two pages...For image # 76 is 80 mm between the 2 dots.\r\n2.  the calculated distance of the two dots on the first image, if they were stars, would be the same.  they are not...The calculated distance between the two dots in image # 75 is 76.6 mm.  so, there was a change not only of angular distance, but also 3.4 mm between them. they were getting further from each other by 4.25%.\r\n\r\nthe 2nd image red dot is going away from the rim of the sun.  the change is 4.7% with the first red dot.\r\nthe 2nd image blue dot is going toward the rim of the sun.  the change is 11.5% with the first blue dot.\r\nthe distance between the two craft in the second image got larger by 4.25 %.  together with the angular change, these clearly cannot be stars. \r\nall together i took 10 images starting at # 70, and ending with # 79.  upon a cursory first check, images 73 to 79 all have varying numbers of these “dot” craft.  as mentioned earlier, they were all taken roughly 15 seconds apart as i adjusted the shutter speed from image to image.\r\ni next wondered if the solar heliospheric observatory (soho) images for the same day would show anything similar.  since soho is in space, it does not have intervening atmosphere, and had a clearer view of that white object, i decided to work on seeing if i could clean it up a bit. \r\n\r\ni have attached a soho image (the 4th of 4) taken 6 hours earlier than mine almost to the minute.  one can see something in the upper right quadrant that is not in the other three soho images taken at 13:00, 13:06, 13:13 ut time.  so within 19 minutes of the first image taken today, there does show something that was not there in the other three images.  after processing the image, i was able to detect a spherical silver colored shape with a red light above it, and a red light below it.\r\n\r\nnext i wondered if any of the four photos taken the previous day on may 8th might show an object.  of the four images taken by soho, the third one taken at 13:13 ut shows an object near 6 o’clock.  upon processing, that image appears to be spherical and silver colored, but without the lights.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:21","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface, Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

finish helping his dad tie their boat to the dock after helping bring the boat to the marina for the summer.\r\nwe were standing on the shore by some picnic tables waiting on james to meet us there. we were talking when we heard this loud screech, it sounded completely out of this world and after a couple of seconds, we heard another one, only louder and higher pitch than the first one. we looked around thinking we had heard an animal in distress and if it needed help. that's when we saw this large bat fly into our view. it was black and came from the direction of the bridge that holds up the lsd. it flew low and then shot up into the air as it came over the water. we noticed one of the coast guard helicopters was flying over the water at about the same time, but we're not sure if it saw this thing as it kept on flying toward the adler. this thing flew a large circle and cried out again and almost instantly it was joined by another large bat. these things were big and stood out against the sky. they flew figure eights around each other. it looked like they were dancing in a strange sort of way. it was actually quite beautiful, considering how freaking strange it was.About that time, my boyfriend walked up on us and scared the living bejezzuz out of us. both myself and my friend screamed and i think those large bats heard us. because they screeched back at each other and both flew down toward the water, it looked like they were going to slam into the water and at the last second, they pulled up and flew toward and i'm assuming under the bridge and out of sight. we ran toward the railing, to look down the river and saw nothing else. this entire encounter lasted about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. it was scary, only because we didn't know what the hell they were, but it looked like they were interested in each other and not us. we can't be the only other ones to see it as the riverwalk and the pier were full of people and joggers. are these things just giant bats or are they gargoyles or just people in those wing-suit thingies?","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),
