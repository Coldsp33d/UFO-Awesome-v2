standing in my driveway ) i noticed very bright lights coming towards me.I saw blinking lights on what i presumed were wings and instantly thought this was a plane althoug something about it did seem odd to me. this vehicle was very bright and the lights that were blinking on the wings were blue. i'm not completely certain, but i think the blue lights alternated with white lights. the vehicle flew directly over me and that's when i saw that the entire underside was divided into panels and every panel was lit up with very bright white light. in my head i was still thinking this was a plane but wondered what kind of plane has it's underside lit up like this one was. it was quite low, low enough for me to see the panel divisions. i heard noise something like a plane (not a helicopter) would make,but i was confused because of the altitude of this craft, i felt the noise should have been much louder. it was a plane-type noise but very muffled which put together with the lit up bottom, really caused me to question what i was seeing. this object moved at what i would call a cruising speed, not fast and not real slow. it maintained the same altitude the entire time it was in my field of vision from first seeing it coming from the west until it was out of sight in an eastern direction. it also remained abolutely brilliant (glowing) until it was out of my field of vision. this night was cloudy with no moon or stars visable at the the time i saw this. i saw no other aircraft in the sky at this time. the wind was not blowing.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

case someone else happened to see what i saw. \r\n\r\ni was returning home from school around 5pm, got out of the 157th street subway on broadway, was looking south straight down broadway and ahead of me saw what resembled most closely to a rocket spewing its fiery exhust as it climbed into the atmosphere. the spew was conical at the top and seemed to have two parallel trails that were very long in relation to the object that was doing the spewing. i figrued at first it might be a plane releasing its exhaust. however, those are usually white and have thin trail lines that dissapear gradually as the plane moves. this did not. it had a firery yellow and red spewing color, had very thick trails, and the object did not seem to climb very fast into the atmosphere, it climbed very slowly. also a plane happened to pass my view in front of the ufo, and from that perspective could see the ufo was very much further into the distance and was much larger then a plane. after only 2 min of watching this object, the spew almost immediately all dissapeared into the atmosphere, then reapeared at about half the original volume, then almost immediately quickly vansihed into the atmosphere, at that point whatever was spewing exhaust into the atmosphere was beyond my view. this is puzzling to me because, usually exhaust dissipates into the atmosphere gradiently from the trailing end first. the spew from this object dissintigrated all together and left no residue. \r\n\r\nalso to my south western view from that location, close to the crescent moon i was seeing the setting light blue sky was a small glowing object that almost looked like a star. which i alos found puzzling considering, 1 it's nyc, we dont see stars here, 2 it was not dark out yet, the sky was still blue, 3 it was the only non-moviwing glowing body in the sky. also it was not completely white in color like a normal star would appear, rather it had a bluish overtone around it. it was not moving at all, and stayed visible, yet at the time just figured it was a celestial body i didn't happen to know was visible to the naked eye that day. or maybee it was actually a ufo. i dont know, but at least it's on paper

father's acquantance from a u.S. air force squadron in the same group as my dad's ( i believe it was the 32th troop carrier squadron ) sent him a short dvd ( converted from 8mm movie footage ) shot in 1957 of a flight of c-119 cargo planes in formation.\r\n\r\nthe camera is pointing out the port side of one plane at two other planes. as a non c-119 is framed ( two separate shots in the same sequence ) an oval object (which is at all times changing it's relative position in a smooth way which seems to indicate it is flying and maneuvering with the plane ) appears first to the lower right of the frame and subsequently moves to positions in front of, below and above the cockpit of the framed plane.\r\n\r\nthe object seems illuminated by the same light and shadow as the planes and none of its movements suggest that it is connected to the interior of the camera or host plane.\r\n\r\ni believe the original movie footage is available for analysis but will need to get permission from owner.\r\n\r\ni have read extensively about ufos and recognized the unique nature of this footage as soon as it was viewed.\r\n\r\nat first i believed that a plane out of the frame was trailing some sort of objects by a wire ( for measurements of some kind ) but i think the objects movements appear to be too \"adaptive\" and less haphazard than they would be simply trailing the plane.\r\n\r\nthere may be reflections that establish the scale of the object which is my main purpose in submitting this report. it appears to me that the object is positioned at the same distance from the camera that the non c-119 plane is... which would make it almost the diameter of the framed planes fuselage.\r\n\r\ni have attached a graphic made from sequential frames from this film (going from left to right ) please let me know of you would like to examine the film footage.\r\n\r\nthanks, {pid}","distance":"101-500

when driving this morning, i notice, what i thought was an airplane just beneath the clouds. what captured my attention was that the aircraft appear to be falling from the sky. i said to myself \" my god! an airplane is falling!\" the problem here was the object dropped vertically with control, defying gravity. this is when it was clear to me to be a ufo. this object then climbed back up vertically, then traveled up in a 45��� angle and flew out of the sky at a enormous rate of speed. at this point i asked myself. \"what did i just see?\" for me there is no other explanation.....I witnessed a ufo! the object was a bright round glowing circle and was floating in the sky like a balloon (kinda like a light bulb in the sky). i was thrown back by the technology, this was not from this planet. i wasn't afraid, if anything i was amazed and impressed. i really hope to see this again someday. i don't have any videos or pics , the event lasted for about 7-10 seconds. \r\n\r\nif you

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was backpacking with a group of high schoolers in the yosemite backcountry during the first week of july, 1987. i was a chaperone. we hiked from tuolomne meadows up to young lakes and made camp at the first lake at approximately 37���56'16.47\" n 119���20'51.91\" w (view photo on google earth). at sometime around 10pm the students and the other chaperones were doing a group massage exercise. i had a slight case of altitude sickness and was away from the group lying on my back looking east at the sky. \r\n\r\nabout a half hour later, along the ridge of the mountains, a very bright white light appeared from behind and slightly to the right of a peak on the ridge (see aforementioned google photo at the leftmost peak near the trees). it was too large and too bright to be a star. at first, i thought it was an aircraft. but there was no sound and only the single light���no running lights. it was also too big to be a spotlight from a helicopter. as i recall, it appeared to be roughly the size of a pea at arms length from my perspective.\r\n\r\nit rose slowly at first, but as it ascended it picked up speed until it seemed to accelerate exponentially. it had a vertical trajectory. it continued to rise until it was as faint as a dim star, and then, quickly vanished.\r\n\r\nthe event happened so fast and i was so transfixed, i was unable to tell anyone while it was happening. also, the group was too far away and the exercise in which they were engaged required silence. none of them were looking up due to the nature of the exercise. and, of course, when i explained what i had witnessed to them about an hour later, i was met with disbelief. \r\n\r\nthe next day, we hiked back down to tuolomne meadows village. i was among the first of the group to arrive and was hanging out in front of the store when one of the students i told the night before came rushing over to me. she had met a group of hikers along the trail who were camping on the opposite side of the ridge nearly due east from our camp site. she was the first person they ran into on the trail; and immediately upon meeting her they said, \"you won't believe what we saw last night!\" she introduced us and we shared notes.\r\n\r\ntheir story was much more remarkable than mine. they had been camping next to the lake that feeds delaney creek (37���55'54.85\" n 119���18'18.13\" w) the night before. they built a makeshift sweat lodge from fallen branches during the day and were enjoying their creation that evening when suddenly, they noticed a bright light coming from the direction of the lake beaming through the holes of their lodge.\r\n\r\nfrom what i can recall from what they told me: when they peered out of the entrance of the sweat lodge, they saw a large spherical object that was hovering above the surface of the lake. they told me all they could see was bright light. they said it made no sound. then, a beam of light from the object scanned their camp site and soon pointed directly at them. they retreated back into the lodge until the beam went away. after that, they peeked out at the object and said it began to rise vertically and the rest of their description matched mine exactly save the fact that it was from the other side of the ridge.","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1

incredibly bright \"star\" that was moving directly over the direction of her neighborhood. at first i thought it was a plane or helicopter but soon realized it was moving way to slow for it to be as close as it appeared.  my mother's neighborhood is near an airport so it is common to see tons of airplanes everyday. this was different. when i got to my mother's house i ran in and grabbed my sister. we rushed outside with our cameras and got into my car to follow the slow moving craft. before we left the neighborhood we took a picture over a neighbors house. it was moving furthur west so we drove to the road that is the least lit by street lights so that we could get a better look at the object. we followed the object for about 30mins. we pulled into a county park where we took a few other pictures. the camera's are not super so the pictures are not amazing. the camera we used was a kodak easy share c513. when we took the pictures we noticed that the bright object was actually multicolored, flashing many different colors of lights however, to the naked eye you could not tell. i think it is because the flashing is happening so quickly in the night sky that we only grasp that there is light and see white (my theory only lol). well anyway as we are taking pictures the object begins to move back towards town, knoxville, and as it gets closer the few small street lights begin turning off one pair at a time. there was no sound to the object and it hovered in the same \"level\" in the sky, below the clouds. we got a bit spooked out and decided to drive home. you could still see the object in the back window as we drove home and then suddenly it dissapered, like it had never been there.
