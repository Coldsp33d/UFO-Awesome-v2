in the spring. so i pulled off the road and snapped a few pictures of a farmers field that i believe may have some potential as a future reference site on a book i want to write in the future.  after a few shots, i turned to get back into my truck and something very very bright caught my attention out of the corner of my eye, so i turned and looked. i saw a round,oval white light in the field where i had just taken a picture. i still had the camera in my hand and snapped another picture almost in the exact local of the previous picture.  i had no sooner taken the picture, (mabe 2-3 seconds at most), and the object i had photographed flew straight up at an amazing speed, so fast that by the time i brought the camera back to my face for another picture, it had vanished.  i stayed there for quite awhile after that hoping to see it again, but never did see anything else.\r\ni went home as fast as i could to download it onto my computer. it took me forever to do, because i'm not very computer savy and needed to download the program that would let me view the pictures. once i did get the pictures onto my computer, my son and i started to view them with the magnifying glass to enlarge them. what we saw, amazed both of us. in the first picture, you could see there were objects in the sky off in the distance, one being rectangular in shape. the second picture shows several objects in the sky, only this time closer than the first. one seemed to even have some kind of trail behind it. on the third picture, (the one with the bright object), you can see there are other objects above it.\r\nin the first two pictures i took, i saw nothing as i took them, (only later when i looked at them on my computer did i see the things in the sky). however i do know that before the third picture, i did see something physically emitting a very bright white light near the ground, at which time i took the picture. then it just went up so fast, it just vanished from sight. i have no idea what i saw, but i know it was something i have never seen before in my life. i still cant get over how fast this thing was. i have been feeling like i'm running on adrenaline since seeing the object. it's now 1:30 am of the 28th, and i still can't get to bed. please feel free to contact me about this sighting, as i am at a loss to explain what i saw. your help and insight would be greatly appreciated. i just want to know i'm not going crazy. mabe someone else has seen something similar to this, and i would love to talk to them if possible.\r\nthe other question you asked is : what did i think the object was when i saw it. i can honestly say in my 51 years, i've never seen anything like it, so i do remember i kept thinking,\"what the heck is that, what could that possibly

 to whom it may concern,\r\n\r\n first of all, let it be known that i am not a ufo \"believer\" per say.\r\n\r\n although this occurred approximately 27 years ago, i thought it's time to report to various ufo investigation organizations. i hope this is worthy.\r\n thank you.\r\n\r\n around the winter of 1980, january perhaps, i just got off work at 9:30 p.M. from the auto dealership. i was a car salesman at the time. i started driving towards the city of toronto, canada, on the qew (queen elizabeth way) eastbound to meet some friends at a bar on the esplanad (a street lined with nightclubs). i didn't have anything to drink and didn't smoke any pot on that day/evening. \r\n\r\nas i was driving, i noticed a string of lights slowly rotating counter clockwise over the city of toronto, at about the ten o'clock position from my point of view. this caught my eye because these formation of lights were very unusual. the lights were evidently in a circular pattern with about two thirds visible as the other third rotated out of view. imagine a pie plate with about 25 lights around the circumference of it. as this \"pie plate\" would revolve, a third of these lights would be hidden from view as if they were obstructed by a solid body. it was at night so all i could see was these rotating string of lights but they were definitely on a \"fixed\" platform as the lights were revolving in unison. \r\n\r\nalthough i've heard of ufo's and was curious, at that time in my life, i didn't really give that much thought about them. i've always been interested in nature and especially about the universe. i've seen all kinds of aircraft and advertising blimps at night before. i drove taxi's off and on for fifteen years on the night shift and have seen countless meteors, lightening, satellites etc. on two occasions i've even seen extremely bright, slow falling, green fireball meteors lighting up the ground, for a couple of seconds, as if it was daylight . i've read, in later years, were other witnesses reported green fireballs as ufo's. i chuckled to myself thinking how easily \"ufo believers\" can be fooled by natural phenomenon. \r\n\r\nanyway, these circle of lights were slowly descending and approaching towards me (westbound), while i was driving about 115 kilometers per hour on the highway (eastbound). these lights were getting closer and closer as \"we\" approached each other. i recall thinking to myself that this must be some kind of advertising balloon and those lights were letters. as i kept driving, i was paying more and more attention to this object because the closer it was getting, the more unusual it looked. i kept glancing at it, while driving, waiting until it was close enough to read what these letters were saying, still thinking it was some kind of advertising blimp. the closer it got, the more i looked at it. now at my nine o'clock position, the string of rotating lights appeared to started to bank left like an airplane would \"turning right\". actually it wasn't banking at all. it was dipping forward pointing towards the ground. at this point, i realized that these lights were not letters at all. they were different shaped, yellowish white lights. the reason these lights were different in shape was because they were \"inset\" into some solid body. when the lights were seen head on, they were circular. but as they rotated out of \"direct\" view, they changed shape like the different crescents of the moon. that's why they appeared to be all different shapes. \r\n\r\nduring the time when this object started to bank left, or i thought from my point of view, i was struggling with myself trying to understand whether this was a plane, blimp, or a balloon. it was flying too slow for a plane, yet, too fast for a blimp. also, it didn't appear to be flying or floating. the best way i can describe it's motion is that it looked like it was \"sailing\" in the sky. \r\n\r\nwhat's interesting here is that the human brain tries to associate what the eyes are seeing, to something already seen or experienced before. that's why i was at war with myself trying to decide whether this object was a plane, blimp or a balloon. every time i resigned myself to what i must be witnessing, i jumped to another conclusion. this jumping from one conclusion to another occurred during the whole experience. i was imagining all kinds of things. for example, if it was a plane, the only way these lights could have been positioned was in a circle because this plane must have had some kind of supporting structure in a circle from wing tip to wing tip. this didn't make any sense at all. i've seen advertising planes before. this was nothing like this. not even close. than i was trying to imagine a \"goodyear blimp\" with these letters going across it's side. this was nothing like it either. so here i was, trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. as i was driving, i started to slow down because i kept looking at this circle of lights more than the road ahead of me. in retrospect, i don't even know how i kept my car on the road because i was so awed by this display in the sky. \r\n\r\nhere is the killer. \r\n\r\nas the object kept dipping forward more and more, it eventually ended up totally perpendicular to the ground! the first thing that came to mind was a big ferris wheel rotating in the sky. at this point i slowed down to about 50 kph (30 miles an hour in a 60 mph highway for my american friends) and put my four way, flashing hazard lights on my car fearing that another car would crash into the back of me for going so slow on a 100 kph highway. \r\n\r\nhere is another shocker. \r\n\r\nas i was mesmerized by this strange looking object, a surge of adrenaline hit me like a ton of bricks. i didn't realize how big this thing was. at first i thought it was the size of an airplane fairly close. it was gigantic! at least twice the size of a football field, bigger than an aircraft carrier!!! i don't know what gave away it's size. maybe the reflections of light on the ground. the best way i can relate this sudden realization is like one of those illusions most of us have seen. you know, when you look at a pixel drawing with an image you can't see until you stare at it for a while? after a period of time, you make out the face of a women or something like that? that's kind of the transformation i experienced. at first i thought the object was the size of a large plane than suddenly i really saw it. it was huge!!! i yelled out loud to my self, \"holey f**k, it's huge!!!\". i don't f***ing believe it, it's f***ing huge!!!. i thought it was fairly close at first, than bang!, it was much farther away and larger than my brain first comprehended it. speaking about this surge of adrenaline. have you ever had a really close call having a car accident? when your heart rate skyrockets to about 180 beats per minute? that's what i felt when i realized how gargantuan this object was! i could actually feel my heart pounding like crazy. to be frank, it literally scared the hell out of me, when i realized how big it was. at this point, i rolled down my window and pointed to this giant \"ferris wheel\" in the sky to the other motorists, but it appeared no one seemed to notice as they screamed by me at regular highway speeds. i remember how cold it was when i rolled down my window. it was something like minus 30 celsius below zero. \r\n\r\nafter, i don't know how long, probably only a few seconds of rotating in this perpendicular position, this thing started to climb and right itself and \"sail\" back to the direction it originally came from. i rolled up my window, turned off my hazard lights, and started to speed up to chase it. still it seemed other motorists didn't notice this object. it still irks me to this day. as i was approaching the city limits, this object was in it's flat position again climbing over the city. then, all of a sudden, the rotating lights turned off except for a red \"aircraft like\" blinking light (which i never noticed before). after a few seconds, the rotating lights turned on again. it was like in the movie \"close encounters of the third kind\". the lights just blasted on. than after a few seconds they turned off again as it seemed to be right over the city. strange behavior. now i was exiting off of the highway on to spadina rd. i lost track of these lights because of the tall buildings. when i was on the street where i was going, i saw a cop parked on the other side of the road writing a parking ticked. i stopped in the middle of the road and ran over to him. he was quite taken aback by my seemingly aggressive approach. i asked him, \"how long have you been here?\" i forgot what he said, but i asked, \"did you see that big circle of lights flying in the sky? he said \"no\". after parking my car, i met my friends at the bar, \"baily's\", and told them what happened but they didn't take me seriously as they've already had a few and were more interested in the ladies. \r\n\r\nafter sitting at the bar by myself for a couple of hours i went home. i was living at my parent's house at the time, temporarily, so when i got home around 1 a.M., i called the police. i didn't know who else to phone at the time. they didn't take me seriously of course so after that, i phoned the toronto international airport and managed to get through to air traffic control and asked them if they had anyone call in with a ufo report. nothing. so i called the police again and convinced them to take me seriously as i wanted to make a report. they told me they can send a couple of officers to my house. as it was late and my parents were asleep, i told them i'd rather come to the station the next day to report. next morning, when i contemplated going in i decided not to, fearing they would think i'm some kind of wacko. \r\n\r\nas the days went by, scanning the newspapers looking for a \"ufo sighting\" to no avail, i started doubting myself. i was trying to convince myself that perhaps i was somehow mistaken. maybe it was something not out of the ordinary at all. maybe it was a balloon or airplane of some kind. maybe like thousands of others, i witnessed something that i misinterpreted for something else. \r\n\r\nand now the conclusion. \r\n\r\nabout a week or so later, on or about the tenth page of the toronto star, bottom right hand corner, there it was! a short article. \"dozens of mississauga residents reported a ufo as big as a football field!!!\" i don't recall the whole article. \"finally\" i said to myself. \"i knew it was real\", \"i knew i didn't imagine this\". i'll never, ever, doubt myself again no matter how much ridicule i'll be subjected to. i have only one regret however. that is i wish i had others with me to experience this. after about 27 years, i just had to let this out. \r\n\r\ntibor

houses and i noticed an undefined blimp like object with undefined shapes. it was extremly shiny metal object with a part black rounded undefined side or rear. the object came down on a low angle of descent with no noise and disappeared behind some homes. the weathet conditions were sunny with some very thin cirrus clouds. i tourned and walked the other way and tought it was just some balloon. then i tought that has to be a big balloon, relative to the distance and size of the object. i turned again and to my supprise the object started to lift slowly from behind the homes. i knew then that since the object came down then after 30-45 seconds it was lifting up straight at increasing speed and since it was slightly windy it did not deviate from it's trajectory it could not have been a baloon or small blimp. as the object was ascending it kept increasing in speed actually going beyond a thin cloud, then when the clod moved the object was a little shiny spec in the sky untill it disappeared. no noise of any sort was noticed from the object, no noticeble lights were seen, no shaking from the object was noticed and no course changes. the descend and ascent were dea center perfect! i do not know what this object was and i checked for any other reports in the area with the local police and nothing was reported. i was wondering if you could shed some light on this

do this because i liked how the sun set over the tree line that borders my neighborhood) and to my surprise, there was something i was not used to seeing. i was captivated by what i call my first ufo. \r\nthe object was silhouetted by the sunset and as a result was a dark grey/black-ish color. i could however discern that it was metallic as there was some reflection of the sunlight off of it as it hovered. there were no lights, no sounds, and no other physical signs of its presence besides that it was floating there. i pondered what it could be: the sky was clear so i knew it was not some kind of cloud or other weather-related phenomena.  however, it looked like a classic disk shaped craft i have so classically heard about being a ufo. this one had two unique distinctions: it had a tail rudder (similar to that on a commercial jet) and bubble canopy (or cockpit like structure). i knew it was not a jet or other aircraft however, because it was hovering (and it was not a helicopter because there were no rotors or moving parts anywhere on it!). i even considered the possibility that if it was a jet, it could be flying away from or towards me but i ruled this out because the craft did not shrink or grow in visible size as is the effect when something moves towards/from one's vantage point. then, unexpectedly, the craft turned in place!! what i mean by this is that it did not move its position in the x,y,z plane, but it banked (tilted to one side) and then rotated, in place, facing a different direction. i knew it was facing a different direction, because i could no longer see the distinct \"tail\" anymore. i called my younger sister over and she saw it for a brief second too. we turned to look at each other in confusion and when we turned back, the craft had vanished! there was no trace it had ever been there - no smoke, no residue, no sound. i have never seen anything like this before!\r\ni will include a drawing on ms paint but excuse the poor quality for i am no artist.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15154,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.247654,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01272009-0008","longitude":-74.8426472,"occurred":927253800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

fifty miles north of nyc.  i was about ten years old.  all of a sudden i heard a very loud roar coming from the sky.  i looked up and saw flashing lights that were moving on either side of what i at first presumed to be an airplane.  the flashing lights, (about six to eight separate shapes on each side), stayed higher in the sky than the flying object.  the spaceship, (i'll call it that), came closer to the ground and to me.   the noise was so loud i couldn't believe my mother didn't come running out of the house to see what was going on!  when the spaceship got directly over me it came down so low i fell to the ground.  it was gun metal grey and shaped very much like a rocket.   it had a band  or a wide piece of metal with holes in it, around the middle that turned and went click with each turn.  i had the very clear impression that it was taking pictures of me.  it hovered over me as this was going on and it didn't move.  then with a whoosh it took off and just disappeared it a matter of seconds over the hill.\r\ni just lay on the grass stunned for a minute or so trying to figure out what i had seen.  i ran in the house and told my mom i just saw a very strange airplane that didn't have any wings, that it came down very low and was very loud.  my mom was busy canning tomatoes and told me she heard it but she didn't have time for me and told me to go back out and play.\r\nit wasn't until i got older and heard about ufo sightings that i finally realized what i had seen.\r\n\r\nit scared me then and it scares me now because i have believed all of my life that \"they\" have pictures of me.  i am now seventy two years old and i would love to see some sort of resolution.   so many sightings, so much written and catalogued.   i would like to know what have we

it was after i got done watching tv around 2:30am est, and i went to bed in our upstairs bedroom.\r\nas i got into bed, as soon as i shut my eyes, i heard my cat jumping at the door to come back in for the night. upon opening my eyes, i saw this thing, hovering in the air, at the foot of our bed. it was black in color,with an oval shaped body,and billowy legs. it was attached to a black tripod, that was circular at the base. it measured approximately 2 to 2 1/2 feet in width, and 2 to 2 1/2 feet tall. i could see it quite clearly because my daughter slept with her ceiling light on , and the light from her room shown into our room, and made it quite visible.\r\ni just layed there in shock, i couldn't move. my eyes stayed fixed on it, till finally it started gliding across the length of our bed very slowly.\r\nthen it went thru the wall that the head of our bed was against.\r\nas it was going thru the wall, i could see it until the very tips of its legs were gone. my heart was pounding so hard, i thought it was going to beat thru my chest, yet i couldn't move until it was gone. \r\ni proceeded to get up to let the cat in, then i quickly got back into bed, and pulled the blankets up over my head.\r\nthe next morning, i told my husband and other people about what happened to me that previous nite. they all laughed at me, and they insisted that i must have been dreaming. but i know what i saw, andi know that i was wide awake when this all happened.\r\nit took me 45 years to get the courage to tell my story again, because of all the ridicule i faced the first time i told it. what i'm looking for now is to find another person who might have seen this thing.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15141,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.5834228,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01262009-0009","longitude":-71.8022955,"occurred":-173716200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-173716200000,"summary":"I

- per���, conozco la trayectoria de los aviones en el cielo, de los que despegan, los que aterrizan y los que pasan sobre la ciudad de lima.\r\n\r\n   puedo reconocer un avi���n desde lejos sin temor a confundirlo con cualquier otro objeto celeste u otro tipo de avi���n, las luces de estos y su velocidad son muy caracter���sticos para mi persona.\r\n\r\n  como siempre subi a mi azotea para refrescarme por el incesante calor, tipico del verano en callao-lima, meses de diciembre a marzo. siempre me quedo a la mitad de la escalera para que no me de el viento de frente. tengo una vista libre del cielo en un ���ngulo de 280 grados.\r\n  \r\n  siempre miro las estrellas ya que se ven estrellas fugaces y porque de ni���o tambi���n he tenido 3 avistamientos de ovnis. \r\n\r\n  eran alrededor de las 00:10 hrs. del 26.Ene.2009 y de pronto en direccion sur-este observo a los lejos una c���mulo de nube, fue mi primera impresion, la cual se acercaba en direcci���n nor-oeste a gran velocidad y esto me llamo la atenci���n. de un momento esta nube se perfile de lado/costado (es como tener una visi���n de un avi���n desde arriba o de abajo) y eran luces en forma de un ave fenix. las luces no son muy brillantes, son luces d���biles pero forman una muy definida figura.\r\n\r\n  para esto habian pasado cerca de 8 seg. luego de los cuales nuevamente el ovni cambia a direccion norte y puedo ver siempre de lado/costado, la forma de ave fenix que tiene. me quedo sorprendido y le paso la voz a mi esposa, quien ya estaba durmiendo, en un cuarto contiguo en cual tiene ventana a la escalera. le dije que suba rapido que hab���an ovnis. \r\n\r\n   estaba en ese momento en el dilema de correr por mi c���mara digital o la manual y tomar fotos. pero sabia que la observaci���n no iba a durar mucho y que la perder���a.\r\n\r\n   ya hab���an transcurrido cerca de 14 seg., y mi esposa me pregunta, si a���n se pod���an ver los ovnis, le digo que ya no suba porque estaban en direcci���n al mar. en ese lapso de tiempo que mi esposa estaba preguntandome sobre los ovnis, ���stos estaban cambiando ligeramente de trayectoria hacia el norte y luego de 1 seg. retornar���an a su trayectoria nor-oeste, de haber continuado en esa trayectoria norte hubiera pasado por encima de mi casa.\r\n\r\n   en ese momento el/los ovnis cambian a direcci���n oeste internandose en el horizonte y cambiando su forma de lado/costado a horizontal. en la vista del horizonte pude observar que estaba zigzageando de derecha a izquierda todo el conjunto de luces sin perder su forma.\r\n\r\n   lo curioso es que pasado 10 seg. de la observaci���n despego un avi���n desde el aeropuerto. al parecer en el aeropuerto no hab���an detectado en sus radares a este c���mulo de objetos, por ello me quede mas sorprendido ya que si el avi���n hubiera despegado 20 segundos antes, entonces el ovni habr���a tenido que esquivar al avi���n.\r\n\r\n   en total la observaci���n la estimo en 20 seg.\r\n\r\n{cms/jat/pid} text moved to narrative\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:20","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

oaks exit on the straight part before \"st. gabe's curve\" at approximately 10:07 pm with my 14 year old daughter.  the sky was clear and ahead of me in the sky was this very bright, low, pulsating or flickering object.  at first i thought it was the front headlights of a plane, but it was way lower and brighter than anything else in the sky including other planes and lower than i have ever seen a plane at night in that area. after a few seconds, i realized that it didn't seem to be moving like a plane and that i couldn't see the \"plane's\" red or green colored wing lights which i would have seen if it had been heading to phila. airport.  so i said outloud to my daughter, \"is that a really bright star ahead of us?\".  since i was driving, and there were cars ahead of us i needed to focus on the road and only occasionally glance up.  i asked her to look at it as we were approaching the \"st. gabe's curve\" and the object would be closest to us out my driver's window to the left at that point.  it seemed rather stationary and it was hard to judge the distance away that it was in the sky or what town it was directly over.  the closer that we came to it, it appeared to me to be sort of diamond shaped and pulsating or blinking continuously.  i think some of the cars ahead of me saw it too as they put on their brakes and slowed down for no other reason such as a deer crossing or road hazard.  my daughter told me that it looked like it had a smaller more faint light on the side of it, but that all of the lights were a golden color, not white.  she thought it was the space station.  i have seen the space station pass by at night and i knew that this was not the space station as it didn't move and it was much bigger.  we continued on our way home, with the light eventually getting behind us and out of our line of vision..  i can't get the vision of it out of my head.  i am convinced that i saw a ufo.  since that night, i heard on the radio and tv the day after my sighting, that there have been a higher than usual number of sightings in the county just north of me (bucks) and i started to feel like i wasn't crazy.  then i saw the video of the strange object over the inauguration ceremony and i wondered if that had anything to do with what i saw.  i sent in a post to the philly examiner as i read online at that site that the night before in silverdale, pa someone took a picture of what looked an awful lot like what i saw.  i kick myself for not pulling over and taking a picture of what i saw as i did have my camera with me since we were coming from the game.  i hope someone can validate for me just what it was that i saw.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15139,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.1317722,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01262009-0007","longitude":-75.4596319,"occurred":1232604420000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,

of sightings in bucks county, pa (which is the next county over), i looked at the sky again last night which was mostly clear.  in the distance was something that looked like a star at first glance, but it didn't stay still like a star, it sort of stayed steady, but then would drop a bit or move around a bit, but not much.  it also seemed to have colored blinking lights.  it seems to stay in the same place for a long time and i'm usually so tired i go to bed without investigating farther.  i can't tell if it's close or far, but i do know that it's about the size of a brighter star from my vantage point.\r\n\r\ni've seen this before on many occasions.  i even hold my head steady on the window so that my eyes aren't fooling me with a perceived motion of the object.  i need to get a video

by a sharply defined very black area. no light whatsoever appeared from behind this area. the moon grew smaller and smaller until it completely disappeared. it seemed very bizarre that such a bright moon had vanished completely. there were still a few thin horizontal clouds that were illuminated. then the moon began to emerge from the bottom of the black area again, visible only where it intersected with the illuminated cloud. i could see that the moon was also disappearing behind another black patch directly below the first. i grabbed my camera and took several pictures until such time as the moon completely disappeared again behind this second black patch. this had happened by about 4:00 am. shortly after the horizontal clouds dissipated and the moon did not return again. there is a mountain in this area, but the moon disappeared twice in an area of the sky much higher than this mountain. i will take a picture from the same angle when the sun comes up to illustrate
