first sent in my dad's report to mufon about 20 years ago.  after that in 1992 i had the opportunity to visit the site where he reported the ufo sighting at roosevelt roads naval station in puerto rico, and observed some items of interest that connected to his story.  in 2008 i was able to look at the site with google earth, which revealed more details to the story.  it is interesting how a sighting can become a festering, knawing encounter that must be told, even years later.  i am glad to see that a lot of old timers are finally posting there past encounters.  that is what has encouraged me to share this.  so here is my dad's account, then mine.\r\n\r\n3/31/1967: my name is {pid1}  i am a retired navy lt.  the following is an account of an actual experience that happened to me while i was stationed at naval station roosevelt roads, puerto rico.\r\n\r\nit was a beautiful warm tropical day, scattered clouds dotted the sky and a gentle breeze could be felt as i worked on the aircraft assigned to my squadron.\r\n\r\ni left my work area a few minutes early as i had finished the day's work sooner than anticipated.  i was alone, traveling homeward to the housing area a few miles away from the hangar where my squadron was stationed.  i knew my wife and children would waiting there for me to return from work.\r\n\r\ni had always been skeptical about ufo reported sightings and truly believed that all sightings were either swamp gas, temperature inversions, weather balloons, or some other explainable phenomena.  needless to say, i was shocked wh4en the following experience happened to me.\r\n\r\nas i road my motor scooter home, i followed the frontage road until i reached the main thoroughfare.  turning right i headed up the hill.  suddenly, and without warning, an object appeared traveling from the right to the left.  it cut directly across the road i was on.  my first reaction was one of astonishment and my second reaction was one of fear.  i immediately recognized the craft as something not of this time or place.  i had been a mechanic on u.S. navy aircraft for 11 years and i knew instinctively that no such flying machine existed in any service or out amongst the civilian community.  there were absolutely no familiar aircraft characteristics about this craft at all - except the fact that it was in the air and moving.\r\n\r\nthe total length of time i was able to observe the craft was very short, 30 seconds at most.  its rate of accelleration was remarkable.  i would liken it to dropping a marble in a perfect vacuum from atop a tall sky scraper: in other words it appeared to be accellerating at the rate of 32 feet per second, a guess of course.  its trajectory or line of flight was approximately 30 degrees above level sight and it passed through the astomsphere as straight and unswerving as if it were traveling on a tight wire that was anchored at both ends.  i continued to observe it until it was out of sight.\r\n\r\ni estimate that the craft was about 300 yards ahead of me when if first appeared coming from the side of the road.  i was traveling about 20 mph and did not let up on my accellarator as i was climbing up the hill.  the craft was out of sight before i could reach the crest of the hill.\r\n\r\ni tried to dismiss the encounter from my mind until the next day when the base paper came out.  as i glanced over the first page i was again astonished to see what appeared to be an exact visual description of what i had seen, only this time there were two of them and the view was from above looking down, an arial photograph.  the bold caption stated that roosevelt roads had been visited by strange visitors and the article made fun of the sighting.  further persual of the paper revealed that there were many other atricles that were written to be humerous and beyond credability.  it was then i realized what the was, april 1st or april fools day.\r\n\r\ni thought, my god!  the sighting i experienced was true beyond a doubt and the ship's travel newspaper article was planned to coincide with a time that would discount the credibility of anyone reporting such and incident, how clever.\r\n\r\nduring the next few weeks before my pending transfer, i found myself seeking more knowledge about ufo's.  as i poured through frank edwards book \"flying saucers serious business.\" i found several things that coincided with my sighting with amazing accuracy.  searching my mind i recalled my experience and took note of the similarities.\r\n\r\n1. the craft was a great deal like many of those documented.\r\n2. the color had an aluminized glow.\r\n3. there was a total lack of sound during its flight.\r\n4. the shape was definately saucer like from a side view.\r\n5. speed of travel was remarkable.\r\n6. length of craft was approximately 38 to 40 feet.\r\n\r\ni came to the conclusion of the length because the craft, when directly centered at the road, it overlapped both sides of the black top by 3 to 4 feet, the black top was right at 30 feet wide.\r\n\r\nduring my research, another startling fact surfaced.  it was documented that many times when ufo's were sighted they were near or in the immediate vacinity of nitrogen in bulk form.\r\n\r\ni, being an aviation stuctural mechanic, had numerous occasions to service the aircraft oxygen breathing systems.  aviator's breathing oxygen was always available but the nitrogen to purge the contaminated systems was not.  the by-product of oxygen is nitorgen and is always produced when the oxygen is being manufactured or produced.  inverably we were required to special order the nitrogen when systems purging was necessary.\r\n\r\nnow the oxygen generating plant was located very near where my sighting had taken place.  i knew the airman who delivered the oxygen from the oxygen farm.  i asked him why we could not obtain nitrogen from the farm ourselves when we needed it instead of having to order it.  he told me that the oxygen plant had not been able to produce nitrogen for over 2 years since that portion of the equipment was broken down and produced only contaminated water pumped nitrogen.  i asked him what happened to the contaminated nitrogen and he told me that it was just pumped and dumped onto the ground and left to disipate on the sight.\r\n\r\n                                ***\r\n\r\n6/21/1992:  my name is {pid2}  i was born in puerto rico in 1966 and had the opportunity to be stationed at roosevelt roads naval station while in the naval mobile construction battalion or sea bees and recalled from the reserves for operation desert storm.  during my seven month deployment there i was well aware of my dad's story about his ufo sighting 25 years earlier and i wanted to do some investigating of my own.\r\n\r\ni retraced his steps from where the hanger was, back toward the hill and up it.  i described to my dad where the enlisted man's club was and where the galley was and the female baracks.  we worked out the possible direction based on his description and confirmation of the building locations on the base.  one day i had the opportunity to be alone driving around the base to a job site i was working at the east end.  i drove upon a pond with a large building and many silver canistars stacked.  we figured this to be the oxygen farm that was also producing nitrogen.  this facility was right in line with the direction the saucer had been flying.\r\n\r\nacross the street was a dirt road that headed directly into the area the saucer would have came from if it were just taking off right before my dad saw it.  i decided to drive up the dirt road to see where it would lead.  i came upon a chain across the road and an empty guard shack.  i was startled when a recorded voice spoke over a loud speaker, \"you are entering a restricted area!\"  i decided i'd better back that 2 1/2 ton truck up and get out of there since i was due at the airforce barracks where rnmcb 16's delta company was working, and i did not want to get into trouble.\r\n\r\nduring my time at the base i also noticed several ships with teathered balloon type radar devises and most of the time they were just off the coast and within sight with those balloons extended.  i read in a book \r\nthat those can be used to triangulate and track flying craft.\r\n\r\n                                   ***\r\n\r\n10/1/2007:  i just discovered google earth for the first time and decided to zero in on the area of roosevelt roads naval station that i was investigating in 1992.  it is amazing to see nothing has changed on the map.  i noticed in the area i was told to get out of and just past that gate, there are many mounds of dirt and dirt roads leading to them.  it seems the area is a weapons storage depot, which makes sense.  however if you look closely there is a mysterious area just to the south that is in a heavily jungle growth type area that has an impression of a large unnatural square shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n  {cms/jat/pid1 & pid2} text moved to narrative

distance\r\nlocation: new tampa east of bruce b downs several lights north of the i75 overpass.  \r\n\r\n\ton the 22nd,  me and my boyfriend were heading to usf for my class that afternoon.  we were heading from our home down cross creek and traveling due south on bruce b downs blvd at about 45mph.  it was a clear florida afternoon with clouds only in the distant horizon.  upon crossing the tampa palms region my boyfriend had spotted something in the sky and was laughing about how normally people who see ufo���s depict an object which seems very unlikely to be a ufo at all making the whole possibility even more far fetched.  i looked up and saw an object in the sky just beyond the power/telephone lines crossing the road, and once we had passed under these i could clearly see the object without interference.  \r\n\tfrom the passengers seat of his suv,  the object appeared to be close to a 45 degree angle from the horizon, and about 5 degrees to the left of our car���s heading which looked to be just to the left of the center of the windshield from what i could tell.  the shape was horizontally ovular with more of acute sides on the left and right forming near points.  the texture seemed to be quote slick as the light  reflection from the sun and shadow underneath were relatively free of distortion.  the color of the object to the naked eye seemed to be silver hues or possibly a very metallic white,  but either way the surface had very reflective properties.  the top was very bright white with sunlight,  but the bottom were tones of silver and grey with shadows that looked like slight reflections of the tree line below.  \r\n\tbeing an aspiring scientist i immediately thought about all the possibilities and scenarios in my head and concluded it must have been a weird shaped blimp for an advertisement at one of the local stores near amberly dr.  i ruled out a plane instantly because it did not change size to indicate a northern or southern trajectory, and it did not waiver side to side in our view either.  for the clarity of the sky and close proximity to us,  i was able to rule out a helicopter instantly also.  the object made no sound,  had no impact on the tree line below, and no propellers or engines of any sort were visible. \r\n\tme and my boyfriend stared at the object while slowing down in our drive and i made the comment,  ���you know if this is what people seen when they reported ufo���s i can see how they make that assumption,   after seeing this blimp,  i would nearly claim it were a ufo if i had been startled or had bad eyesight myself.���   as we got a little closer i started thinking how weird it was that the blimp/balloon had no advertisements on it,  no personnel carriage underneath,  or no tie down to a building below.  we kept staring at the object as a full minute had passed with it in our sights and we still had no reasonable theories as to what it was.  \r\n\tmy boyfriend laughed and stated that it must be a ufo then,  and i agreed since it would be the simplest solution to the situation,  and right when i had said jokingly ,���yay aliens,  how neat!���  the object vanished right before our eyes.  as bizarre as that sounds,  i know.  it reminded me of those home movies where a kid holds up a ball and says, ���now it���s here���������..Now it���s not (and the camera recording breaks for a moment)���  then the ball is suddenly not in the kid���s hand due to 2 separate recordings being edited together.  it was a quick and abrupt vanishing act for this object.  now neither of us were laughing.  \r\n\ti continued watching, scanning, and searching the sky as we drove all the way to campus.  there were still no clouds around,  no chemical trails from an aircraft,  no noise of an engine accelerating rapidly enough to be gone that quickly.  yet the object was nowhere to be found with no trace of where it went.  it was gone before i could blink right before my very eyes and for the first time in my life i had no clues to lead me to any sort of conclusion.  \r\n\twe waited the last few days to see if any other reports surfaced in the news explaining what we saw,  but to no avail.  while i would love to have an alien encounter,  i���m not sure what it was we saw and am not entirely convinced it was a ufo,  i would like to put it out there for anyone who would like to find answers and put all these puzzle pieces together for us and the rest of the confused world.  thank you","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

thing that i've ever seen or has ever happened to me.\r\ni was driving from levittown to trenton nj traveling north on rt 13 with my sister we were on our way to meet up with a cousin we had planned on going out for some saturday night fun.\r\n\r\nthree ufo's (bright green luminous orbs)were flying in triangular formation from the direction of southwest to northeast.\r\n\r\nthey were very large orbs and with no sound at all, at a very slow speed about 500 ft above the ground. together they suddenly  had a burst of speed and then vanished into a lake that i had been riding along side of. i was friegtend but in my amazement i had pulled over to watch and see just what was going on.I knew that this was some sort of alien encounter and i needed to understand more. my sister was very friegtend and was pleading that we leave there immediatly.\r\n\r\nafter the orbs vanished into the lake all was quiet and normal in the lake and then after about a little more than a minute these three pillars of huge lightening type green sparks emerged verticaly from the lake and rose into the sky probably up to another 500 ft or more then as with the speed of light or a (warp speed)the three pillars of sparks traveled in the direction of southwest which is the same direction they came from. if i blinked i would have missed it the speed was that fast. \r\nfaster than anything of this world.\r\n\r\ni probably may have dismissed it as some sort of imaginary figmentation but my sister  was with me, she was very afraid and she did not want me to stop but she was there and saw it too.\r\n\r\nnow i'm not saying that i saw  little green men but i did see 3 big green silent orbs darting to and fro and hovering in the sky just above my head.\r\n\r\nafterward i called the police, i called the newspaper, i called the local radio station to ask if anyone reported what i had seen but the response was the same by all three it was \"no\" ...No one reported or saw anything.\r\n\r\nto this day i am still baffeld,amazed,and wondering.\r\ni'm glad to have had the chance to witness this extraordinary event, it was truly a once in a lifetime experience and it has opened up my mind to the possibilities or even realities of alien worlds.\r\n\r\ni am convinced that whatever it is that i saw that night february 24th 1979 definately was not of this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501

cigarette, as we have children to consider we smoke by an open window. after the first few puffs i noticed what i thought was a very bright orange star very low in the sky, such that it was slightly obscured by a tree in the foreground. i pointed it out to my girlfriend, who also saw, then commented on the fact that it was moving up in the sky. we watched it and dicussed the fact that it didnt look like a jet or a star (we could see and hear a jet in the sky to the right of the object, identifyable by red and green nav lights and white strobe). the object moved swiftly and in a perfectly smooth and straight path that appeared to be an upwards direction in the sky, until we realised it was getting larger. it proceded to pass directly overhead, at which point we could make out its shape slightly better. my girlfriend descibes it best as the fatter half of an egg at the leading edge with an orange aura, the back half was slightly unclear, and kind of looked like tentacles streaming behind it (trying to put some proportion to it - if the half egg shape part of the object was an inch long, the streaming tenticle part was also an inch). as the object went directly over head, we raced downstairs and out of the front door to observe from the front of the house as it passed over (i'd like to note that it was completely silent, we could hear and see a passenger jet in the distance at the time, but this thing was eerily silent). it continued at a constant speed towards the town of ramsgate, so in roughly a north easterly direction, it then gradually faded and disappeared as it went into the distance. in terms of altitude, its very hard to tell without knowing the size of the object, however there was what i assume was a passenger jet in the sky at the time. the jet was heading away from the uk so would have been in the climb. the object was certainly lower than that, deffinitely < 40,000ft. my girlfriend compared it's altitude to light aircraft that ofter fly over her house, so i'm guessing thats around 8000ft.\r\ni'm an aircraft engineer in the royal airforce, i've worked on chinook and puma helicopters, c-17 transport aircraft, and currently i work on tornado aircraft. in my 11 years of working in aviation i have never seen anything like this, including during operations in iraq and afghanistan (that got me to thinking, and the colour of the craft reminds me now of the orange flames of the oil pipelines in iraq).\r\n\r\nthoughts and feelings: during the sighting i would say disbelief. my mind was working overtime on finding an explaination, nothing i know of fits. i discussed with my girlfriend all possibilities i could think of. i didnt feel afraid at all, i was busy trying to find a rational explaination in my mind. i'm somewhat sceptical about visitors due to the physics behind travel, however i do feel that other life forms are existant away from earth. \r\nat the altitude im estimating, the object was moving at similar speed to the jets that fly around my place at raf marham in norfolk, but completely silently.\r\n\r\ni'm kicking myself at the moment as i had a camcorder sitting on the bed behind me, but it had no film in it! my phone memory was full and wouldnt let me take video of photographs.\r\n\r\ni travel back to norfolk tomorrow, when i get back and on to my computer (on a crappy laptop at the moment)i will sketch a picture and send it on to you, if you would be interested of course.\r\n\r\nalso interestingly, i noticed a report of an orange object in norway, a few hours after my sighting in the uk. this is pretty much the direction of travel my girlfriend and i agreed it was travelling.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s)","flightPath":"Straight-line

has a lot of glass windows. the view goes to the horizon and with a 90 degree scope. perth has daylight saving, so it was quite light and bright at the time with no cloud and the sun was behind the house. \r\n\r\ni was watching tv and a bright, travelling light in the sky caught my eye outside at exactly 17:00 +9gmt.  it was worth investigating so i quickly jumped up to the window to get a better view. looking in an easterly direction at approximately 25 degree elevation, i could see an object flying at an extremely fast pace in a northerly direction. (i can see perth airport and jandakot airport traffic as a common occurrence in this same view-point and the speed was easily 30-50 times faster). the object travelled in the northerly direction to then stop for about 2 seconds and sharply turn away (south easterly for 2 seconds) and disappear from view after changing to an easterly direction (directly away from me). \r\n\r\ni have seen thousands of aircraft fly in this area and no aircraft has either travelled or changed direction that fast.\r\n\r\nthe object appeared to be polished metal like composition as it reflected the light so well with no noticeable self illumination. \r\n\r\nthe whole event took around 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nquestions not yet answered:\r\n\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it? holy moly, that is absolutely moving and cannot be a normal aircraft. when it stopped (not turn as in an ark), it thought \"how can it stop that fast\". when it veered back and then change direction, i thought \"that isn���t from here!\"\r\n\r\n5. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. i felt in absolute awe of something that can move like that with an

eastern time because i had just called my friend matt.  i thought that the lights must have been a plane whose lights were pointed directly at us because they were very bright.  it was also traveling in a downward motion and to the west.  from our position when we saw this i estimate that the object was close to a mile or two away.  i also thought it was a plane that must have been making an emergency landing or was facing an imminent crash because it was lower and brighter than any plane i had ever seen before.  so before we turned into my neighborhood we proceeded north on kellers

eye out the object/plane through the trees and went through a small set of woods and then there was a clearing between that small set of woods and another north.  in that clearing we found ourselves to be near an unidentifiable object which i have never seen before.  we were slightly to the south west of the object.  it was above the treeline of the new set of woods, sitting there, hovering.  it did not move in any direction at that point.  it was just sitting there.  i estimate it was only 150-300 ft above the treeline, which is seriously low.  i have never seen any plane or object do such actions.  we slowly came to a halt and we were all dumbfounded.  this object appeared to be almost a diamond shape, and we were seeing it from the bottom, angled.  there seemed to be a dominant light on the front (which appeared the brightest) and two light on the side of the object.   those two seemed dimmer and less dominant. the way all the lights were connected made the object appear angular and almost diamond shaped. the car at this point was stopped.  i tried to make a video using my sister's cell phone but it didn't come out.  there was a distinct point, about 20-30 seconds after we were in awe looking at this object in which myself and annie (sister to my gf) both felt as though this object/plane, whatever had noticed us and the front light that appeared to be dominant began shifting itself towards us.  i freaked out and told april, my gf, to please just go.  i had a sickly feeling in my stomach and i had never, ever seen anything like this.  she hit the gas and we proceeded through the second set of wooded area and came out 15 seconds later.  as we were traveling through the wooded area i kept watch on the object which had a bright light on what i would describe the back of it.  at least as bright as the front dominant light.  (these light may have appeared more dominant because there were facing us more directly than the other two had).  my sister described the top of this object as having a spherical structure to it.  we proceeded up the hill which lead to deep run road.  we made a right and proceeded to try and follow the object, ended up being more round about of a road and by the time we came closer back to our original location, the object was gone.  i could not find it in the night sky.  the only object i could see in the sky were normal, blinking, red tinted planes.  planes i could identify normally.  this obscure object vanished.  i have no idea what happened to it, but myself and the three other people with me saw something we had never seen in our entire lives.  this object furthermore had no  engine sound.  annie described it as a buzzing, humming sound. after the incident i told many people and was informed of other sitings in the bucks county area.  please write back any inquiry or information you may have for us, or if others reported siting the same distinct object in the sky.  this testimony is 100% truthful, i want to know if others saw it, if this object was on a radar, whatever you guys do to figure this stuff out, please let me know the details of your finding.  you may contact me, ask me questions, etc.  i will fully cooperate and  i am intent on learning of what this was. {pid}\r\n\r\n{cms/jat/pid} text moved to narrative","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Appendage(s),

ground. i had just gotten a load of dirt and was heading the dump to dump my load. the that i was dumping on that morning was at about a 45 degree angle.  i was heading east up the dump ramp when i noticed 5 to 6 lights blinking off to the east sky. it was clear that morning not a single cloud in the sky. the thing that got my attention was there was no real pattern to the lights and the where really close to each other. i have seen planes at nighttime and these where not planes the movement was to fast for a plane or helicopter. i thought it might be something on my windshield so turned mt haul truck to the south and rolled down my driver side window to make sure i was seeing what i was seeing. so with the window rolled down i stiil saw the lights off in the distance. so i procceded to call another truck driver who was behind me if he saw the lights too. but he said he did not. i backed up to the berm and dumped my load of dirt. heading west leaving the dump i turned my truck around to the east and the lights where gone. that morning when i got home i told my wife about what i saw. i dont think she belived me. end of story or so thought. now a week later jan.23rd 2009 i was watching ufo hunters a series i record on my dvr player. they had a part of that episode where thay had a new sighting for 2009. the had video footage of the sighting in morristown new jersey. they showed the video and i was in shock. it totally freaked me out. i yelled for my wife and told her to come here and watch this footage. i told her this what i saw on the morning of jan. 15th. it was the same excact lights i saw on jan. 15th. the only difference was the lights i saw where white and not red like the ones in the video. i am still in shock to see something like what i saw out at the mine and then to see the same thing cauhgt on video. \r\n","distance":"Over One
