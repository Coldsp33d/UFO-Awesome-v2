29,(i have my ticket to proof) on right side of plane , window side.  while approaching mexico city valley area , we were flying north to south about 25 minutes privious to arrival we were to land and suddently i saw a shinning metal type of shpere through the right side, and i had my camara but while attempting to get either photo or movie, it tend to disappear (like if knowing that i was to record the event), i tried to call other friends, but they were on front on first class and attendents did not let me cross walking and if i told them i did not wanted them to think me as crazy.  well, we landed and i tried to look to the window while taxing to our gate, and there it was again, over mexico city aiport radar, and again i picked my camera and it vanised, on a next try i just changed from movie to photo and i thought i did not got it, but i captured,  i saw how it flew in an undescriptible speed.  i knew it was not an airplane or a meteorologic type of ballon.   i commented the incident to my friends, that was my boss and a technical guy from the company, i told them exactly what happened and when we got to hotel,  i could unload a picture and saw nothing, but while i zoomed,,,i could capture the round point!  i got it, without knowing that i did.\r\ni was kind of scared, but i thought in my inner feeling that that thing knewed that i was watching it.  its important to state, that that thing followed our flight and while i ovserved it over mexico city airport radar (you can locat it in front of mex city airport at penon de los banos hill on googl earth) it flew high over radar area,  east to west direction then stop a while that was when accidentaly i captured image without knowing exactly i did, and then vanished to the west side in an upward extreamly quick move.\r\ni compared it to videos found on internet, and the object is similar to the other ufos over mexico city during the past years...\r\ni am a very fan of astronomy and this is first time i had a view like this, i can state that i can distinguish a plane, and other objects in air, but this was a very good experience.\r\n\r\nnote: if you can download phote, you need to zoom

stars were shining diamonds against the cerulean blue sky. i can't remember exactly which summer month we were in, but we could not see the moon. \r\n\r\nmy father, cousin ryan, and i were sitting on

their for about 10 or 15 minutes when i noticed a very unusual star. i thought it was a plane, but a plane in the sky does not look like a star, it was to far away. then i thought ok maybe it is a satellite, but i have never seen anything like this before. it looked just like a star, but it moved over to the right, up, then down, up half way, to the left, and back up, then down half way and then just shoot across the sky, and covered great distance. that is when i was like ok im not crazy, i am seeing this, so i pointed it out to my cousin and my father. \r\n\r\nwe were just amazed by what we were seeing, trying to pinpoint what it was or what it could be. we watched for probably about 15 or 20 minutes, maybe longer. i believe whatever we were watching was about northwest, then my dad spots another star of the same behavior directly west. this one was only moving up, down, left, right, and not shooting across the sky, but i have to tell you this is only the tip of the ice berg... \r\n\r\nthe bench on the dock is facing west. the left and front of the dock is facing open water, but to the right is the opening to the cove of the third lake of little sebago. at about 2 o clock of the dock across the cove is a [dam]. behind us next to the dock is a willow tree right at the opening of the cove. im not good with distance or height, but i would say the willow tree is about 35 feet tall. \r\n\r\nafter noticing the second moving star, we were just baffled and utterly confused. about 5 more minutes go by and then...I heard this weird noise. out of my 21 years on this earth, i can not describe this sound easily. the sound was like a small fan i suppose. i said, \"do you hear that, that sound\" about7 seconds later, i noticed that they could hear it too, and before they could say anything there it was! it was not above the willow tree but beside it, more over the water, but right beside us! this craft was moving about 3 m.P.H! just floating in the air! going beside us so slow. i felt mesmerized totally focused. the memory that i have of that night is clear as day, but that moment, that exact moment, the memory that i have is like a dream... \r\n\r\nthis thing, craft, ufo, whatever you have it was as big as a suv or van. it was rectangle. it was yellow with some wide black stripes across it diagonally. it had what looked like big black tires around it with bright lights in them. \r\n\r\nwe were hypnotized by it and just speechless like we had no control of our bodies. we just watched it floating in the air, continuing with the bends of the shore, and it was gone around the bend. then all of a sudden we just relaxed and started to breath again. once in a life time i tell you, but there is still more to go... \r\n\r\nafter regaining our sanity. we looked once more to the sky. both stars were still there. then we heard it. the military jets flying up into the sky. two of them. the star moving in the north west was doing the normal, but a little different this time. it was like every time it finished its routine, it powered up, but this time before it shot across the sky it got so bright i had to squint my eyes. then it just took off. it was gone, just gone. the other one was gone as well. i wonder what the guys in the jets thought when they were forced to go back? \r\n\r\ni am not crazy, but i tell you i will not beleive your story. all the other stories out there sound like crazy people stories. well that is how i felt for a few years untill i met a guy named jason. his story was similar, but he was in nevada. his encounter was triangle. then this year on the history channel there was this story with the same kind of sighting like mine. \r\n\r\ni dont understand...Those ufos looked like a star...They were in outerspace...They could see at least half of the world...Why would one come to visit us in windham maine of all places on little sebago lake, on our little dock? why?

on an ���u.F.O?\r\n\r\nby {pid}\r\nwritten on december 30,2008 at 23:45 hrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non saturday, december 27, 2008, at 22:15 hrs. approximately, i was on an apartment terrace on {pid}  with three more friends.\r\n\r\nmy friends were looking in and i was the only one looking at the south sidewalk. suddenly, in the middle of the talk, i saw a huge object  similar to a diamond moving slowly at the twelfth floor of a building, from east to west. i stared at that object in silence without understanding what i was looking at. ���what is this ?, i thought and i paid attention to every detail, enjoying what i was looking at. i was not afraid though astonished.\r\n\r\nit was a device in a diamond shape with many windows. i calculate they were between 80 to 120 and they were enlighted by a very bright white light but it did not bother my eyes. it was 8 floor high. the lights were all on  but some of them twinkled. every light was white. the windows were square and i did enjoy the view, recording it well in my mind. ���it was a fascinating spectacle! it was huge and i couldn���t calculate its size but it looked like being between 100 and 300 mts. long. it was two or three blocks away so i would not be able to calculate it. i only know that it practically covered the distance between a building and a front building.\r\n\r\nas soon i could react, i said:\r\n-���look. ���that is a true ufo���!\r\n\r\nmy three friends who were talking, didn���t react. they didn���t give importance to it . they said without moving their heads:\r\n-\t���it must be a plane or a helicopter������\r\n-\t���no, i said. ���look! ���it looks like being a diamond!\r\nthey moved their heads but the object had hidden behind the second building. after two minutes approximately, it came back from west to east but most of the lights were off, remaining only 12 red lights on line on the top of the object.\r\n\r\ni said to them:\r\n������look, there it comes again but the lights are off!\r\n\r\nthen they got interested in looking. they did look it but they didn���t find anything special so they didn���t ask anything. they just saw 12 red lights on line and that did not attract their attention.\r\n\r\ni felt i had seen something extraordinary, something i couldn���t explain, and i felt i had lived a unique moment in my life.\r\n\r\nincredibly, i forgot the whole thing as if it were buried in my subconcience but now, three days have passed by, i mean, 72 hours and everything has come to my mind full of details. i���ve started assimilating it and now i can talk about it.\r\n\r\ni know i am not lying. i know i lived that and i enjoy remembering how wonderful that view was and i hope someone else has seen it too.\r\n\r\n\r\njanuary 15, 2009 ��� 1:30 a.M.\r\n\r\ni am writing again because i can���t help but thinking about what i���ve lived. during the day, mainly at night, when looking at the sky full of stars, i can���t help but longing for seeing again what was recorded so deeply in my mind. i don���t even know what it was for its huge size and how silent it was. it was like a zepellin in a diamond shape that moved slowly and silently, with all its windows in bright white light, some twinkling. it did not bothered my eyes.\r\n\r\n{cms/jat/pid} text moved to narrative   \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

bulgarian language. i was contacted, through the blog, by a witness with the request to help him with translating and submitting the report. the following is the translation of his first email to me:\r\n\r\nhello. my name is p.S., 41 y.O. from tryavna, bulgaria. on 1 october, 2008, at 2:00am something woke me up and i decided to look through the window. i opened slightly the curtain and was shocked. against the window, in the sky, i saw six orange colored ufo-s arranged in a triangular formation. each of the objects was with the size of a full moon, a little smaller. the objects were moving from east to the west. i looked at them till they arrived above the house. then i quickly left the house and went out, in the yard. there happened something incredible. the whole triangle turned sharply to the left. the six objects began to exchange their positions till they rearranged themselves again in a triangular formation and continued moving to the sought-west. i am interested in astronomy and astronomic observations since i was a pupil and i know that this couldn���t be a natural phenomenon. i know only that this could be operated only by intelligent beings. i believe in extraterrestrial life. since october, i make regular night observations and i believe that i���ll see them again. unfortunately, i am alone in tryavna and have no one here to share my views and experience.\r\n\r\nthe following is some additional information i received from p.S. in other e-mails:\r\n\r\nthe next day, on 1 october, i went to the police station and reported my sighting. i asked whether they had received other signals about this. they just looked at me and shrugged. probably they thought that i���m crazy, but they were three policemen there. after the police, i went to the editorial office of the local newspaper ���tryavna week���. they also didn���t have any information but looked interested in publishing my story in the newspaper. i refused because i���m a public figure and i was afraid they may think that i am crazy, on drugs, or drunk. \r\n\r\nyou asked did i make any photos. it was 2:00 am; i was dumbfounded and even didn���t think to take my cell phone to make pictures. all this happened very quickly, in 1-1.5 minutes. the objects were moving quite fast, but i was able to examine them well enough. there were no sounds. it was dark and quiet. the objects were moving smoothly and didn���t make any noise. while they were making the maneuver, i was paralyzed with fear because i didn���t expect it. when i saw the objects above the house, they looked perfect circles. when they moved away, to the west, they looked more like baseballs.\r\n\r\nafter i entered back in the house, i didn���t look at the clock because i didn���t turn on the lights. i briefly looked at the clock on my cell phone only when i woke up and before looking through the window. back in the house, after the sighting, i laid down but couldn���t sleep at all. 10 minutes later i gathered some courage and went out again. and this continued all night, walking in and out of the house. do i think that they ���saw��� me? yes, definitely. now i have this strange feeling like they are looking at me all the time. a few days later, i was searching the web and found on some american website a picture that looked exactly like what i saw. only that one was made of 10 objects. mine were 6. i was completely delighted to find out that other people have seen the same thing i saw. \r\n\r\nshould you be interested in receiving more information from p.S. or from me, please, contact us at the provided e-mails. three days ago i tried to contact the bulgarian mufon chapter with no success. \r\nthe attached are 2 drawings of the triangular formation made by p.S. daughter under his supervision. the photo shows his house on the left and was made later, from the spot, where he was looking at the objects. the direction is sough-sought-east and is the place, where the objects rearanged their positions.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

call from my uncle about something, well i don't get good cell service @ my house so i proceeded to my bedroom deck where there is better service. as i was talking, i was facing the river & out of the corner of my eye i noticed something flickering. i began to watch it and thought @ first that it was a star because of its glowing nature. then i realized, it then had three distinct colors that i could see with the naked eye. red, green, and a yellowish looking color, and it looked as if it was moving towards my direction. i went back inside and grabbed my binoculars and then it became clear that it was not a star, nor a plane, and it looked as if it was some big ball or circle that went into a point @ the top, but the interesting thing is that it looked like it was changing very fast from a point or like some triangle back to a round circle or actually completing back the bottome part of the circle to make a whole circle. i was pretty amazed and confused on what it could be. i went & grabbed my parents to let them take a look @ the object and they as well couldn't figure it out & were amazed as well that they have never seen anything like that. i took my dad's telescope and the pair of binoculars and got in my car and drove to my dad's church that has an amazing view of the sky. i picked my uncle up on the way as it was only about 2 minutes down there road to the church. we both set the telescope up & it was extrodinary, & unexplainable to both of us. we stay there about 2 1/2 hours & watched the object. it stayed still pretty much the whole time exept when i was on my deck @ the house, when it looked as if it was coming closer. after two & half hours later it started to move towards the left of our position, then with extrodinary speed, went the opposite direction, & it kind of remind me when someone sees a shooting star, i followed only for a split second and it was gone.
