probably traveling close to 200 mph. i watched it for several seconds before i lost sight of it behind some trees. my first thought was that it might be a meteor but i've never seen a meteor that looked like that. it was very large, very close to me and had no tail behind it. the intensity and color of the light remained the same the entire time. it was about the same color as a green traffic light. after traveling a few more miles i noticed a small airport in the direction the light was headed but i did not see any planes on the runway, and i do not think it was a plane because i did not see any of the other lights that an airplane would normally have on it. it was also only a couple hundred feet off of the ground and very close to some houses when i first noticed it. it probably was just a meteor or some other natural phenomenon but i thought i would report it anyway. what is really odd about this incident is the fact that i just joined mufon a week ago and this is the first ufo

inside and realized that i had left some items in the car. i went back outside and noticed a very bright light in the wsw above a nearby treeline. i kept looking at it trying to figure out what it might be. i live across the street from a navy helicopter training field, so i am very familiar with their sights and sounds, but it would have been too late for them to be flying anyway. it wasn't a plane- it had no blinking lights and did not move like one. it had fringes of red on the left and right sides and what appeared to be \"moonbeams\" eminating from it. it moved very slowly towards the south. i called my neighbors (to my west) on the phone and asked them to step outside and see if they witness what i was seeing. we stood in their front yard and watched it move away to the south. we watched it for approximately 10 minutes and they went back inside (since the temperature was around 30 degrees). i came back inside my home and thought about what i was seeing. i went back outside and it was still there, but lower in the sky. i went over to my neighbors (to my east), and they stepped outside into the street and also saw it. we watched it for a few minutes, and they went back inside their home. my neighbor (to the east) went online to see if there were any stars that were supposed to be visible, and i told them i would talk to them later to find out. i went back home at this point.\r\n\r\nat about 730pm, i went back outside to see if the light was still in the sky, but it had disappeared. i walked back over to my neighbors (to the east) to see if she had found out anything on the internet, and as i knocked on their door, i turned towards the sws, looking over the helicopter training field towards perdido bay. i saw three orangish-red pulsating orbs. two of them were close together, and the third was further to the west. at this point, i noticed that the orbs were fading out slowly, then would reappear in a different spot. they did this independently of each other. my neighbors came to their door and as we stood in their driveway, we all witnessed the orbs fading out then reappearing, moving westerly. they started appearing closer together. one would fade out, and then the other two would fade out. the whole episode lasted approximately two minutes before the orbs disappeared completely.\r\n\r\nwe noticed that air traffic in the area picked up considerably during both episodes- more than usual. there was a distinct difference between the bright light and orbs versus the planes and helicpters that started appearing.\r\n\r\nmy neighbor did say that scorpius would have been the brightest star in the western sky, but when we came out to look for it, it was no longer there- with no explanation where it disappeared. the bright white light was no star. the three pulsating orbs were not stars. i'm not sure what we all saw last night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

field was approx. 75 acres. i saw a ring of lights white and red maybe 400 yards above slowly descending to the ground.I was driving a tractor and pulling a plow. i stopped the tractor and watched as the craft lowered and landed several hundred yards from me. it set for a time so i headed my tractor in its direction to see what it was. as i got closer i was able to get a better view. it had a triangular bubble top that was lit up. the bubble set atop a dark circular base with red and white lights circling the bottom. the whole thing looked about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. as i got closer there appeared very large visions of black leopard type cats, hissing and making growling screaming kind of noises, surounding the tractor. i stopped the tractor and thought about running, when suddenly the cats dissapeared. i felt something at my right side and looked, it was a small individual. on tractors of that size there are small seats on each of the drivers seat. we were both sitting but i estimate him to be 3 to 4 feet tall. he was wearing a grey suit with blue seams. the suit was not like latex but more like what we now have called bubble wrap. his skin was the color of a caucasion that had not seen the sun for quite some time. he was wearing grey gloves and high top grey fabric shoes.He had a helmut but that was taken off quickly. i dont know but i really wasnt that frightened actually kind of relaxed. he was talking and i couldnt understand anything, he produced a platinum object about 7 or 8 inches long and had the width and depth of a domino. etched on it about 1/4 inch apart were symbols and what looked like letters. he handed me the object and i could understand everey word he said. i dont know if i was speaking his language or mine but we were communicating. he told me that the huge cats were used often to approach subjects while they were confused. of course they were not real but the visions were. i have heard of many ufo sightings and encounters over the years, but never have i heard of any visions of animals. yet he told me that this trick was used often. he told me that a log was kept on everyone that had ever been visited including animals. he told me that he was only one of a hundred ships that were sent out by the mother ship, which he pointed out to me. during day time the mother ship was hidden in clouds and at night it was high enough in the sky to avoid detection. he pointed to red lights that were appearing and disappearing in the sky an said those were ships like his leaving and returning. he would not let me get close to his ship but he showed me several things. like a flash light that could go around an object and continue its beam on the objects other side like the object wasnt there. i was with him for 6 to 7 hours because when he left dawn was just breaking. he told me that all visitants would be visited again from time to time, including me, and i have been several times. all i know is that i have never been able to father a child. my teeth have thousands of small pin holes at the gum line which causes me to have them redone every 2 or 3 years. a military dentist asked me if i had ever undergone high doses of radiation or had special tests performed by the military. it has been many years and i have told no body eccept my wife. if you have interest please e mail me. i have alot

two more times, with the last sighting seeming that the object was moving, the lights appeared in a trangular shape almost seeming like they were separated or it was turning. we even drove all the way to the base of the mountain, the frontage road to n.O.R.A.D. i have never seen anything like it before, and i noticed there was no air traffic in the air at the time, as soon as this object dissappeared i noticed air traffic

next to norad and pointed them out to my girlfriend and i. the lights went out almost as soon as we looked, but by that point we were curious and kept our attention directed towards the mountain. we also noticed that there were no commercial planes flying in that area, nothing in the air at that time. about 40 to 45 seconds later, the lights came back on, all simultaneously, and in a horizontal row. there were three lights, to the left of the mountain and about 3/4ths of the height of the mountain. they stayed perfectly still, and went off a few seconds later, all simultaneous. we have lived in colorado springs all of our lives, and there are three air bases here and a major airport, and we have never seen anything this big, especially with no visible faa lights, so we knew we were seeing something odd. i have also witnessed the military base dropping and firing flares, but these were much brighter, did not have the distinctive smoke trail, and stayed stationary in perfect unison. we kept driving south on the highway to see if we'd see it again, and just as we'd hoped the lights went on again. we were extremely excited, and i called my father who was on the east side of town to go outside and look, though he saw nothing. at this time, the lights were the same place and height in the sky, but it looked as if the craft had shifted or if we were getting closer because one of the lights was slightly lower than the other two lights. they were in the same place in the sky, just slightly angled, like points of a triangle. the lights stayed on for approx. one second and then went out. we continued driving south to see if we could see it again, even going so far as driving to about 100 yards away from the access road to norad, yet we never saw anything. we did notice though that aircraft flight continued around and above the mountain after that. we continued home in hopes of seeing something on the local news, yet saw nothing even mentioned.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15053,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.8363316,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01222009-0012","longitude":-104.8134534,"occurred":1232598600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1232598600000,"summary":"Row

keen astronomer i decided to a bit of sky gazing.\r\nit was quite frosty with a mainly clear sky and just a few small clouds.\r\nafter looking for about 5 minutes, i noticed to my left due west, a orange\r\nobject which appeared to be glowing,my first thoughts were, that being close to the aircraft routes to manchester airport that this may be an aircraft on fire, but as it started to move across my horizon left to right,  west to east it was getting bigger and taking the shape of a glowing orb.I have never in all my years of watching the skies seen anything like it,in the excitement of seeing the object, i called my wife to come and see it and she could not believe it either.\r\nas the orb passed in front of us at an angle of about 45 degrees it was seen to glow from orange in the centre to red on the outer fringes,the outer edges not seeming to be very sharply outlined but appearing slightly gaseous.It passed behind a small cloud and was still visible through the cloud and as it passed further to our right eastwards it still kept its shape and form.When it was at its highest above us it was about the size of my little finger nail, when held at arms length.\r\nthe

bensalem, pa.  as i approached the busy street road intersection, i was astonished to see two silent triangle-shaped objects hovering in the sky near philly race park. one was closer and more visible, the second further in the distance.  the objects were dark but their outline was clearly discernable - they weren't helicopters, stars, planes, or blimps.  i could not account for what these objects were - they were just hovering. the objects resembled the triangles of the belgium wave in the 80's (yes - i admittedly have a passing interest, and i'm familiar with the major incidents but wouldn't call myself a \"true believer\".) however, i was also amazed that none of the other traffic going east on street road was reacting to this.  (thinking back, it was probably because the objects were large and further than they appeared as you approached the intersection and could not see them if you were traveling actually on street road. it was difficult to tell, since there was no reference point, the objects proximity and size - if they were smaller and closer or larger and further away.) because of this, and because i have an interest in this phenomenon, i convinced myself this was a trick of the light, my imagination - or something.  i kept driving, but never entirely wrote the incident off, and can't say i fully convinced myself that this was an optical illusion or something i misidentified.  it stayed with me. \r\n\r\nnow, i'm reading that there are several incidents in bucks county around this same time and felt compelled to report this incident.  i can not claim that i saw ufos before, other than this incident.  i don't know what these hovering triangles were or if it is explainable but i simply can't account for them.  the time and dates are approximate - guesses, to be honest, at this point.\r\n\r\nplease respect my wishes to remain anonymous.

exact), when he tapped me and pointed to an object in the sky.  at first, he thought it was a helicopter or a plane, as we are very close to the airport.  as we approached our stoplight (the corner of murfreesboro road and nashboro blvd.) we noticed how large and how bright the object actually was.  it was obvious from how low it was in the sky and the area where it was that this was no helicopter.\r\n\r\nwe turned down our road, nashboro blvd, and the object seemed to almost hover in the sky, making a descent behind a massive abandoned house, and landing in what we guessed was an open field.  it was fairly close above us and it appeared much larger than a plane.  it was flat bottomed, noiseless, and, like previously stated, seemed to almost hover like a flying car might.  the lights were so bright, even from a distance, that it gave the impression of halogens.\r\n\r\nafter this, we drove around the area (down smith springs road, bell road, etc..) seeing if we could get a better view of the field.  it was very obstructed so we could not get a view from our car.  as we were driving down smith springs, however, my fianc��� noticed an object shoot up, at a strange angle, and seem to bolt across the sky.  i did not notice it until he pointed it out, very far from the field, where we assumed it had just been.  though we had not seen the field, the area seemed to be artificially illuminated by some outside light source.\r\n\r\nfor about 30-40 minutes we drove around, making u-turns and trying our best to follow the object when we could find it in our view.  we lost it a few times, but we seemed to always find it, hovering around the same general area.  to me, watching it hover, it almost looked like a search craft, like a craft looking for something.\r\n\r\non our final drive down nashboro blvd, it was the closest we had seen it.  the sensation was that of the craft moving towards us, descending so low as if it might just graze the car.  once again, we noticed a hovering, a searching, yet no sound.  it passed over the area, once again, and headed in the direction of the field.  my fianc���, with his head out of the car door, snapped a few pictures, as it passed by.\r\n\r\nthe actions of the object can only be described as smooth, fluid, and fast","distance":"101-500

the stars. looking in the direction of google map coordinates 38.273312, -104.667145, on the other side of pueblo blvd and on the other side of the river from where we were, we saw an orange light maybe 6-7 stories high. it was an orange sperical light that flashed on and off once. then a few seconds later it turned on again, then seperated into three seperate orange spheres, extending away from us and to our left looking out toward pmi. the lights then stayed on for about 1 second, fully extended and remaining absolutely still and perfectly aligned to each other despite the wind. then about 45 seconds later the three seperate orange sphere lights turned on, in the same direction and area as before, but one was closer to the ground and the other two were splayed out away from the other about 8 stories high, but each flashed on simultaneously and off simultaneously, all in a duration of 1 second. then a few minutes later regular aircraft with required faa lights flew over and kept flying over. the ufos were not seen again afterward, and we only saw them at a time when it seemed no air traffic was in the immediate area.\r\n\r\nwe had parked there because we had seen ufos there before and figured we might see on tonight. we noticed what seemed to be a bright, large planet out to the west. that planet had been in the exact same spot the night before, but tonight it began to slightly move around in every different direction, not staying stationary, and then it moved farther and faster from where it should have been in the sky. that's what got us to look in that general direction, and then we saw the first flash of the single orange sphere way to the right and close to the ground on the other side of the river. after the orange speheres, we looked back at

planes fly. maybe abit higher. i ran to get my mom and tell her to look at it. it was so bright and big it was like the size of 5 north stars but it looked like ahuge beam of light. for a moment a green meteor type tail of light was coming off of it. looked about an inch long. so i thought maybe i was staring to hard at it and looked away and it still had that beam very thin light coming off it from the top. i watched from time to time about every 15 mins. after about 45 mins it looked like it had gotten dimmer. i was waiting to put my daughter to bed and showed her it and when i looked at it again it had gotten even dimmer. i don't know why i didn't jump in the car to begin with but i did finally. i went out of the neighborhood in the direction it was going and looked to the right. i was alone and driving so no no one else was with me to see that just about 30 seconds down the road this thing was just sitting there and didn't move, just sat there. what i saw were the lights going around it on its sides not facing me the lights were facing to the sides in red and i think green and white. but this wasnt a plane. i saw it, it was huge and just sitting there as if it wanted to just sit. very weird. it was getting dimmer and the brighter area of white now orange shaded in color was at the top and bottom of it in a circle shape (the lights). i tried to get a better view and drove up and turned around about 1-2 minutes later. it was gone. i turned down the rode called my mom told her to look out the window and see if she could see it and i said it was gone and she said she didn't see it. i wouldn't normally report something like this but i want to know what it was and if anyone else had seen it. i wouldn't believe it if no one else reported it to the police. my mom and i aren't the type to call or report these things but even she said call the police department and see if they kknow anything. so i know she was abit nervous and she and i both know that for that length of time no way was it a plane or helicopter. we did see planes and helicopter around its proximity and they were nowhere near the size nor color. please contact me and let me know if any1 has seen this or if infact you have an answer of what it was. thank you","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

immediately noticed a flashing red light directly ahead of me.  the light seemed to be the size of a dime on the horizion which is much much larger than any other light i've ever seen in the sky.  at first i thought it looked unusual but believed i would recognize a familiar shape when i got closer.  the closer i got i realized the one large blinking red light was actually two lights.  i made a right turn on morris road at which point the object began to move parallel to me.  i was amazed at how large these lights were and the absence of any other light sources other than the two extremely large red flashes.  at this point i couldn't believe what i was seeing.  it passed within a few hundred  yards of me.  it appeared to be shuffling across the sky.  moving forward, then slightly backward, then forward ect. it moved towards lansdale and over the horizion, still clearly visible the whole time.  it did not make a sound but passed right overhead. i do  not know what this object was, but i can say that i am positive that it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp or anything else that i have ever seen before.  i really hope someone else saw this because it was the strangest thing i've ever encountered","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

2008, i was looking out the kitchen window waiting for my wife to return from work, at which time i noticed something very unusual, in the sky.  it was a display of red lights, in an irregular rectangular arrangement with no noticable solid form or mass.  there was no aircraft attached to it.  it hoovered for a while and also moved very slowly.  i went outside to get a better look and then it moved to the back of my house and disappeared.\r\n\r\n     shortly after, my wife returned from work and asked me what was wrong, as i appeared, to her, to be distressed.  i told her, \"i just saw the wierdest thing\", and proceded to tell her my observations.  at her urging, i called the local police department to report what i had seen.  i also asked them if anyone else had called tonight with a similar observation.  they replied, \"no.\"\r\n\r\n      i recently watched a tv documentary regarding ufo's sighted in the bucks county area (which is where i live).  this gave some credability to my story.  today, the trend newspaper, front page article features a story on        bucks ufo sightings, which further validates my experience.\r\n\r\n     \r\n","distance":"101-500

sky.  they were never there before and i was wondering if it was a tower of some sort because they were perfectly still.  i drove closer to see if they were in fact motionless to make sure it wasn't a plane, and sure enough the lights didn't move.  i stopped to gaze at it and the lights became more detailed and began to move towards my car, at that moment i turned off my lights out of fear.  after a couple of seconds i turned my lights back on and started to drive at a speed of about 25-30 m.P.H.  the lights flew right above me still heading towards me, but as a car approached the back of my vehicle, the lights started to turn and flew in the direction i was going rather than towards me almost as if they were backing off.  as it flew over my car, i was staring at it and could make out the faint outline of the body of the craft and it looked as if it was an airplane but not quite put together the same way.  i was more anxious and in complete disbelief that this was happening to me, i just really wanted to find out what his was.  i first thought it was a helicopter because of how slow it was moving but the positioning of the lights threw that idea out the window.  all of this happened in an instance, the thoughts running through my head, and as the craft turned it started to pick up speed and flew into the night.  the thing that made me believe that what i was seeing was unidentified, not of alien nature, was the speed of the craft.  the lights were motionless and then started moving towards me and then flew over head, very low i must add, too low for the planes normally flying around my neighborhood.  i tried to take a video from my car but couldn't make out the lights from my phone's camera.  one last thing, the lights had an amber glow to them, and i could hear no engine of any kind.  really freaky!","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

..I gave it a second look and since i was looking through a window i thought there may have been some sort of reflection..So i went out side and now there were 2 bright orange speheres in the sky..I wtched them for about 30 seconds and they just disapeared...So i went back inside and grabbed my camera hoping it may happen again..And dure  enough it did..So i video taped the speheres comming and going...There were as many as 4 speheres at 1 point and they seemed to be forming triangles and rectangles in the sky and then they would disapear..And then anothere one would light back up....I live in oceanside and camp pendelton marine base is just n miles north of my home wich is exactly where i saw the sphere hovering.....I called the military base and couldnt get any info....\r\n\r\ni have over 7 minutes of video of these bright orange spheres that looked like fireballs appearing and disapearing....I googled this and found a few other people have mentioned seeing the same thing in the same area .......But at different times than me.\r\n\r\ni really would like to know if anyone else has reported this ....All this is happeneing right around camp pendelton marine base......And this looks like absolutely no other light i have ever seen.... tried to rationalize and thought they may be high powered flares but they moved in an organized formation and held there position longer than a flare...I eveb have other planes that fly  by while im fimimng and you can see that the spheres are nothing like the planes.....When i zoomed all the way in with my camera the spheres appeared to be pulsating or flashing at a high rate i looked very similar to fire....\r\n\r\ni have vidoe of this and would be happy to share it if anyone is interested...Please contact me and let me know if anyone else saw this and may know what it is?\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One
