completely white.  once the object was leveled it remained in the sky for a second and then flew off at a great speed and disappeared.  the object appeared to stretch as it flew off.  when i had first spotted the object, i thought it was a shooting star until it started to descend.  after witnessing this, i asked my girlfriend if she had just seen the object and she said no that she had been looking out the other window.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

blinking red lights , apx 8 of them, shaped like a v < like a boomerang shape outlined by the lights, came out of nowhere. \r\nit was very clear and still light out, just at dusk and i was observing venus in the sw and sirius in the se , moments before there was nothing in the sky .. i'm sure because i was amazed at how clear it was. then suddenly this object was there right above me moving very slowly , i thought it was a plane at first but it was odd.. i couldn't see the body of it although it was right there about 20 ft above me and not quite dark , i couldn't see the sky or any stars through it either, so something was there but nothing i could make out.. it was like lights on a shadow. \r\n\r\ni couldn't understand what i was seeing the whole time for about 3 minutes  it was right there and moving very slowly but all i could really 'see' were the red lights blinking , i was stunned and frozen there but not really afraid , kind of in a daze .. no one was home (of course) to share this with .. it was moving sooo slowly , i kept trying to focus on it to see what it was , that's the odd part.. if it was a plane that close i could have seen the pilot or windows or something ! it took so long to move , 3 minutes to cross my yard (150ft) then  went over my neighbors house and then just disappeared . a plane would have been easily visible for miles going in that direction (east toward the ocean). there has never been a plane here that low or ever one moving in that direction and i look at the sky alot ! \r\n\r\nthere was a whooshing sound which didn't make sense to me , it seems that something that large and close would make a much louder and different sound. it didn't seem that the sound was actually connected with it.. very hard to explain.. thanks

the main red light.  it also shined a bright white light occasionally.  my wife, kids and i observed it for several minutes... the object started to move away north towards the mountains.  i decided to get in my vehicle to see if i can get a closer look.  i traveled north on milliken ave towards the mountains keeping the object in site.  as i reached the top of milliken the object was directly over the mountain and was shining some type of search light on to the mountain.  i could actually see the mountain side light up.  the craft's light at this point was white... i could make out three point of lights and the beam of light pointing down on the mountain.  it remained in the same spot for approximately 5 minutes.  the search light turned off after a couple minutes and the object almost seemed as if it had parked.  i then noticed another red light emerge to my right just a couple hundred feet to the east of the initial object.  the red light traveled to east slowly and then south.  i once again got in my vehicle to get a closer look.  i traveled south on milliken towards foothill but could not get a close enough.  i proceeded to head back north on milliken to see if the other object was still there... i could see it from a distance.  this time it was a solid greenish blue type color.  as i am getting closer towards the top of milliken it starts to travel east.  as i reached the top of milliken i was parallel with the object.  it couldn���t have been more than a couple hundred feet away and the object was flying really low to the ground.  it did not make any noise.  the greenish blue object was surrounded by blinking strobe lights.  i would say at least 8-12 different strobes.  the object traveled east then seemed to remain stationary for about 10 minutes.  i observed it along with 3 other similar lights for a good 10 minutes off to the east.  it was not moving.  i tried to get a closer look and proceeded east toward the city of fontana.  every time i would seem to get closer it would start to move away.  i traveled all the way to sierra ave in fontana.  the lights got further away so i decided to head back home.  at my closest proximity to the object on the top of milliken i would estimate the object to be no bigger than a goodyear blimp.  it was difficult to make out due to all the strobe lights around the greenish blue light.  as my family and i observed this object my sister in law and her husband viewed the object as well and traveled to the top of hellman drive and also observed the beam of light it omitted onto the mountain.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15032,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1116789,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212009-0008","longitude":-117.5899084,"occurred":1232513400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

outside at 4:00pm and soon saw a very high large dark colored jet (possibly a b-52) flying overhead heading east leaving a contrail. as i watched the jet nearly straight overhead, i observed what i thought was something dropping off the aircraft. the object that appeared to separate from the jet appeared to be a silver ball about 1/3 the size of the jet. the object appeared to be sightly lower than the jet and it���������s contrail and was stationary in the sky for over five minutes with a 5-10 mph wind coming from the south at ground level. i could not tell if the object actually came from the jet or just appeared very near it when i first observed it. i observed the object with 5x binoculars, and it still appeared to be a high altitude stationary silver ball. i attempted to videotape the object but i was not able to locate it in the viewfinder before it disappeared.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":15025,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.2450496,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01212009-0001","longitude":-93.2445599,"occurred":1230768000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1230768000000,"summary":"Sightings

7:15pm alaska time on jan. 20th, 2009.  i frequently go outside at night to watch the stars and i noticed this set of lights, which weren't supposed to be there.\r\n\r\nthe lights changed in intensity and changed position as if they were attached to something.  when i first saw them, they were a perfect triangle.  they moved to form an elongated triangle pointing east, then reoriented again.\r\n\r\ni didn't hear any noises.  what seemed to be the \"center\" light was brighter than the other two.  the center light was brightest when oriented head on, forming almost a straight line, then turned again, becoming a smaller looking triangle.\r\n\r\nit didn't move quickly enough to be distinct, if that makes any sense.  but they definitely moved quickly enough as to change the arrangement of the lights within 10-15 seconds.  \r\n\r\ni called my girlfriend out to see them, but all we could see was the center light.  then, they began to move again and the triangle was visible.  i called her back out and she saw it, too.  she said it was creepy.\r\n\r\nat first, i thought they might be helicopters flying in formation.  there were no other blinking lights, but they

do remember watching something on the science channel about triangular lights which behaved exactly like these did about a month prior to this event.  i don't think that influenced what i saw, but it definitely made me watch them closer.\r\n\r\nafter about 15 minutes of watching (it was fairly chilly), i came inside to check if there had been any reports.  i didn't really know where to look,

observing it for a few miles, it just seemed to disappear.  on moment there. the next moment nothing.  gone. it just vanished. i didn't see it speed off.  it just disappeared.  \r\n\r\nit blinked out just before i got to morrisonville.  it was disappointing to me because i was curious what it was and i thought i would get a close up view of it over morrisonville. i wasn't alarmed at all, i was just curious. \r\n\r\ni drove by the spot on my way home this evening during daylight hours.  when i approached the area where i had spotted it this morning, i looked all around for a microwave tower thinking that maybe i had observed one of them this morning.  these towers have a solid light halfway up and a blinking light on the top.  even though i didn't observe any tower structure underneath it this morning, i thought that maybe i could have still possibly seen a tower.  but after scanning the area on my way home, i found that there was no towers anywhere around.  so, i don't know what i saw!

1961, or 62, summer time. there may have been even a closer town other than san antonio. the place was called timber lake....I remember that much. it used to cost us five dollars for entrance, and we could keep all the fish we caught.  i remember it being a pretty run down place.....Trash everywhere, etc.  we used to roll out our bedrolls up from the shore line, under the mesquite trees, to stay away from waters edge at night because of the water moccassons. (snakes). on this particular night, i remember we were all happy because dad had bought 3 old army cots from the army/navy store, that my brothers and i got to use. we were excited that we didnt have to sleep on the ground, in our \"bed rolls\". (we were poor, and couldn't afford expensive sleeping bags.)mom and dad and the youngest brother slept on the ground, on a matteress. \r\n\r\nbut i remember laying there this night, doing what preteen kids do, when my brother and i noticed a light through the trees that just kept getting brighter and brighter, like lights on a car would as it got closer. it didnt seem to be coming from any one direction, but rather just kind of all around us. and all of a sudden, at the tree top level, there was this huge object that went racing by and over us, like a jet or something. the only noise we heard wa a \"whoosh\" type sound as it passed, but then all of a sudden again, a gust of really hot, hot wind rustled the trees like a hurricane would, and over tipped our cots. all 3 of them over turned, and we wound up on the ground. mom and dad were sitting up with dad saying what the hell was that....Or something to that effect, i remember.  they told us to go back to bed, and we'd go look for it in the morning.....So, we did. well.....We kind of laid there all night waiting for it to happen again. it didn't of course, but when day light arrived, we took off in the direction it was traveling to see if we could find out where it had crashed.\r\n\r\nwe didnt find anything, nothing at all. but it was so low when it passed overhead, we were certain it was going to crash somewhere. but, where the only noise we heard was that soft whoosh, and no explosions or anything, we thought too, that maybe it had just landed someplace. i know, my brothers and i didn't fish that next day, as we were out hiking around trying to find this thing. it was huge, and it was fast. once it'd past us, the light we'd seen at first just kind of followed it off behind it.\r\n\r\ni've been going to tell some one about this for years....I just didnt know who to tell, nor where to tell it. i guess mufon is the answer to both questions. my brother and i talk about this every now and then......Usually when some one says some thing about ufo's.  it happened....I'll swear on the holy grail, on the bible, to god himself....It happened.  some of the details are kind of sketchy now, but for the most part, thats how it happened. it was 61 or 62, in the summer time i'm pretty sure.....Whereas texas doesnt really have a winter, it very well could have been springtime, or even fall.  i'm just not sure of the time of year.....Like thats going to make a big difference?\r\n\r\nhonest to god fellas, this happened. i was 10 or 11, and i remember it well. like i said.....I cant tell you what we had for dinner that night, or what color my pants were, but it did happen\r\n\r\n[cms/pid/tg] -

it had 5 ��� 6 orange- yellow- whitish lights bigger than a plane and arranged in an odd pattern. it didn���t have any blinking lights the lights were on the front and back, 3 ��� 2 respectively. it was very big. as it got closer i said to my wife ���hey that���s not a plane what is that��� she said ���oh my god what is that thing��� as it got closer and passed in front of us you could see a very big octagonal shaped grayish metal big thing for lack of better words. \r\nat that point my wife got in the left turning lane to make a u turn to follow it, it was moving very slow but than all of a sudden a fighter jet blew by the thing a few hundred feet under it. this thing made no noise at all -- we had the windows open and were leaning out of van to see it ��� you could here the fighter jets engine scream by us - the jet was coming from the south east. at that point we made our u turn to chase the thing but it must have sped up dramatically because up to than it was moving very slow. the fighter jet must have made a u turn also because it went chasing this thing to the south east and it was moving i mean i didn���t even see the jet the second time i just heard the thing scream by our van -- my wife saw it because it was on her side of the van. we tried to follow for a mile or so but they were going to fast and we lost sight of them. \r\nnow i watch the ufo shows and believe in this stuff but this was unreal. i���ve seen lights in the sky before and have always identified them to be a plane or something normal but this was very frightening and just no way this was anything normal. you could see this was not a plane or helicopter or blimp you could see it was very big and all one thing not a bunch of little planes you could see it was a solid grayish metal you could hear it made no noise and you could see this jet could see it also. the reason i am telling you this is because i want to know if anyone else saw this. it was 7:00 pm lots of cars on road.  we see everything here you can watch the space shuttle launch from my driveway ��� nasa shot a rocket up just on saturday. military planes always flying around here. not the little fighter jets but those big ones like tamker planes so i know what all these things look like ��� wish i had a camera with me because that would have been a picture of a ufo not a strange light. one other strange thing and this is probably a coincidence ��� the whole neighborhood had a blackout (power outage) for 30 ��� 45 seconds about 15 minutes after the sighting.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -
