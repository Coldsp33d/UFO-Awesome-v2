ordianary plane. the speed is just too slow and the sound was just wind, or ground effect sound. also, the form seemed not fixed, maybe not fully solid. i also felt it was aware of my awareness of it.

and i was enjoying a smoke. i was facing north and looking at what i thought was orians belt but was amazed as to the size and brightness of the stars. i realized that orians belt would have been much smaller and to the southwest at the time. i saw three very bright lights at first i thought they were stars but they did not blink. they were brighter and larger then the brightest star that was visable (arcturus)which was slightly more to the west of what i was seeing. i also saw a jetliner traviling ftom west to east and about 300 miles anhour at about 3500 ft altitude. the lights i saw where higher and farthe away then the jet. the jet had flashing red and blue lights with one white strobe. when the jet reached the general location of the star on the bottom, the bottom star began to move to the west and at the same time the star on the top and the one in the center of the formation began to move in a synchronous motion the star on top moving to the west and the one in the center moving east while maintianing the same distance apart. when the two upper most stars stopped they formed a perfect triangle with the star on the bottom. after they all stopped moving the star on the bottom of the trianlg began moving up towards the center of the other two stars also while moving up the lower star began to fade as if it were going behind something. about two seconds after the center sar vanished the others made a slight flicker and then vanished into the night. abought that night, there were other stars out that night but none as bright and \"no stars were visiblbe inside the triangle\".\r\nabout me: i am 47 college grad currently in the computer field and have 26 years prior military service ranging from cav scout to power generation and i have served in combat. i know these lights were not flares, they were not helicopters or military aircraft. fort bliss and bigs airfield are about two mile to my west. whight sands testing range is 62 miles to the north by northwest and holoman afb is ruffly 75 to the north. \r\nhas anyone else reported this or seen this. i have gathered my video camera with night vision and am going to try and catch it on tape as this

started with an uneasy feeling, and escalated to a fear of the unknown. in the winter of 2006 while out side with my pups for their last potty break of the evening i happened to notice an object hovering above the pine trees n.N.W. or my home. my pups were uneasy and barking, i finally got them inside turned off the inside and out side lights so i could get a better look at what i had seen. when i looked again there were two crafts side by side now, they were long rectangular shapes or ovals, i'm not sure all i can remember was the lights.  they appeared to be opaque in color but bright. blue, red, and clear white. there could have even been a green one between the red and white one. they slowly moved off to the north over cookshammock grade towards the north. the feeling of fear seemed to lesson over the next few days to a week. as if something in the neighborhood had changed.  since thuis time i have started keeping a journal of events and my feelings as each events occurs.  these are just a few of the major events i can remember, sometimes i think my memories are blocked on purpous, it may be a day or two or longer before i think to record them in my journal.  a week or so before june 23,2008, i ranto the grneral store in cookshammock at about 11:30 to 11:45, on my return trip i noticed a smoky star at the  \"y\" intersection of carber rd. and cookshammock grade. it was above the tree tops at about a 45 degree angle or a little more.( i'm not good at judging distances) the star was larger than any other star i could see, the most prominant, it was whitish in the center, and a smoky color around the edges. i continued on home and thought nothing more of it.  on 6?23?08 i was on my way to gainesville fl.And i saw the same colored star only lower in the western sky. i could see it through the clear cur areas along highway 51 going north at 4:30 am. i checked to see if there were other stars, it was clear no fog no clouds, i obsurved the star for 11 miles into town. it did not arrear to be mocing or droping in the sky. i did have a spooked feeling. i slowed but did not stop. i lost sight of it ehen i reached mayo.  on 9?9?08 i observed a pure white orb through my living room window at about 8:45 to 9:00pm. it was only a flash, but long enough to tell it was an orb. a few minutes later(2-3) a low flying aircraft flew over my house, at 500 to a 1000 feet. it was skimming the tree tops.   on contacted mufon 8/28/08,spoke to b.P. and d.S. orlando fl.   second orb i saw a pure white falling star while out with my pups, last call of the night a few seconds later a perfectly white orb flashed through the trees accross the road from my home. about the size of a thumb tack. no reflections of light on trees.?????  waited for orb to go up in sky again but saw nothing. dogs were barking furiously, some one yelled shut up and every thing went silent. ti was cold but it suddenly became even colder. a jet was going overhead and i could not hear the sound of it after it passed by, which i thought was very unusual. got the pups back inside and continued to watch, but saw nothing else. then all of a sudden i heard the cyotes howling and yepping to the north of me, i went back inside and to bed. myself and the pups were sick for a few days after that. one would not eat(b) and(t) the other had a rash on his stomach. my cat smooth had a bald spot behind his two frount legs, and would not stay in the house for longer than to eat. i was sick to my stomach for about 3 days and could only eat saltines. since then i have had problems sleeping. the pups have been aggitated.This was 10-20-28-08contacted by m.M.Z. mufon10-29-08. since then i have had a continuous series of unexplained marks on my body. little marks on my collar bone like cat scratches, soar and irritated, small round, wounds above my ankle on my left foot and leg. strange dreams, feeling sick again,pups aggitated. where i had my tooth removed in6?23?08 a strange gray object worked its way out of the wound. unfortunately i threw it away.  but afrer an mri in december i had a boil appear behind my upper left(last)moler and now there appears or feels like some thing is wedged in behind it.  12-20-08 my son and i were returning from gainesville and my grand daughters graduation, we took a rural route home, on our home i saw a light through the trees, i thought it might be a hunting camp or tower of some kind, but it was not it is to swampy in that area for anything like that. i never minentioned it to my son as the road is rough aand we had a 45 degree turn to make up the road. it did how ever seem to me now thst it took longer to get home thsn it should have.   since then i have had a rash in and around my navel,small blood moles appear on my stomach, like some ome put wax  on my stomach and pulled all the hair folicals out. my doctor said they could be the results of an infection. i do not know if my son has had any side effects, he has not mentioned it if he has.  signing off for now bar.   ps the last orbe was white  round and had red and blue light changes in the right side. i felt no alarm, just a little anxious. we only passed one truck on the road, with like very bright hallegin lights that were above the hood of my sons bronko. the road is uneven, bumpy and no dividing lines, so we had to drive slow, for about 10 miles or so until we got to the newly paved road section. about the size of a regulsr marble.            since this time i have noticed the water that flows from my bathroom faucet sometimes flows to the left rather than the right.????????? i thought it might be some kind of seddiment on the screan so i cleaned it it still dose it.  pss went to family cemitary recently, when i arrived it was cool my pups like to run and play search for deer sents. they did not allert to anything but when i went inside the fince there was a wooshing sound like a low flying jet, only not as loud as a jet, softer more muted then a rush of heat about 5-6 degrees warmer than it had previously been a seconed ago. i looked up the trees did not move with the sound or the heat. there was a sound like a deer snorting his/ her alarm, a seconed or two later there was a more throaty sound.  maybe a bear made it. but that would not explain the jet sound nor the heat i felt. needless to say i gathered the pups up and we left. i felt very uncomfortable and anxious. and i have felt that way ever since. this happoned two or three weeks ago.","distance":"101-500

planes which appear exactly like ufo common sightings , out of the blue , remain silent when witnesses observe them , and disppear suddenly out of sight , however never dashing fast away as ufo s are well known for.\r\n\r\nthe question that arises here in the following example is to understand whether this apparently type of sighting should be considered that of an unidentified flying object.\r\n\r\nin short , as ufo s can take any shape at will apparently , why would they not be able to take the shape of a ww2 aircraft ? does this make sense?\r\n\r\nmany believe this to rather be attached to the ghostly paranormal activity , however it is difficult for me to understand how \"ghost\" could appear having built an airplane with the same material they would be made of should they exist?\r\n\r\ni d be very interested in any feedback about this very unique type of sightings ?Could they be classified as ufo, there are many witnesses including law enforcement officers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nghost planes of the peak district of derbyshire \r\n\r\nthe 24th march 1997 saw another in a long history of reported sightings of a propellor driven plane being witnessed flying low, in apparent difficulty and then seeming to crash on moors above sheffield. a rescue operation was launched but, as has happened before, no trace of any plane or crash was found despite a search involving 100 volunteers and police.\r\nthis latest incident was witnesses by several people who dialled 999 when they saw a plane in trouble. they were watching the pass of the comet hale-bopp on moors which are far enough away from the city lights and pollution to give them a good view of the comet.\r\ngamekeeper michael ellison and his wife who live at strines spoke of hearing an almighty explosion. a farmer has spoken of him instinctively ducking when the plane passed over his head. a former police special constable marie france-tattersfield has reported that she and her husband (a former pilot) saw a low flying plane plunge to the ground over midhope moors. they reported seeing lights on the wings. \r\n\r\nthe moors\r\nthere are several moors in the area but reports seem to centre on howden moors which cover quite a large area of the peak district to the north west of sheffield. nearby features are the derwent & ladybower reservoirs to the south of the area in question. this region has been the site of many plane crashes during and since the second world war. over 50 planes have come to grief in this area. more than 300 people have lost their lives in these crashes.\r\n one captain landon t tranner and his crew perished in the crash of their b29 bomber in 1945. two crashes at the end of the war claimed the lives of 13 airmen. on 18th may 1945, a royal canadian lancaster bomber of 408 sqn crashed at james thorn on bleaklow hill. in july 1945, a us dakota crashed on the same peak. a superfortress and another dakota have also crashed in the area. more recently (1993), a privately owned hawker hunter jet crashed on broomhead moor in a storm. \r\n\r\nghostly sightings\r\nin april 1995, retired postman tony ingle saw the sun blocked out by the shadow of a plane 40/60 feet overhead. he could see the propellors rotating but there was no sound. he saw it banking and then it seemed to go down over a hedge. when he ran to the field, it was empty. his dog, which he was taking for a walk at the time, now refuses to go into that field.\r\nron collier is a local farmer who set up a group to study the sightings. he is regularly contacted by people who have seen ghost planes. \r\n a group who used a ouija board obtained the names of the crewmen of the 1948 fortress plane and a message that they were not at rest where they were. this could be a reference to the fact that bodies are not always recovered from crash sites. the crash site of the privately owned hawker hunter jet is still the resting place of the body of the pilot wallace cubitt who is believed to be entombed perhaps 30 feet below the boggy ground.\r\na farmer picked up debris from one site and stowed it in an outhouse until his son saw the barn almost shake itself to pieces. the pieces were returned and the incident has not happened again. another man who recovered the ring of a crewman says that he has been visited by a ghost.\r\nsomewhere, there is a book which gives the sites of plane crash sites in the peak district. these sites still display the odd signs of debris at the scenes. \r\n\r\nre the 24/3/97 incident, an email has been received by this site, reporting that a local mp explained in the houses of parliament that this incident may be connected with an raf plane breaking the sound barrier that night and that it may have been flying low in relation to the moors. \r\n\r\nwe reproduce here also a selection of emails received on the subject of the above:-\r\ni remember visiting the hendon aircraft museum with my son many years ago. an attender came up to us and explained that there were at times singular goings ons in the exhibition halls after dark; strong winds and various sounds. he ended by saying: 'if you think of the way some of these young men died, it is hardly surprising.'\r\nthe correspondent pc does seem a bit scathing - mediums and physicists seem to agree that matter can soak up and lock in energy.\r\nyour sincerely,\r\nrichard robertson\r\n\r\nsirs,\r\nwith reference to the article on your web site, as an aviation historian & author on the subject of flying accidents, i thought i would just write to say that a few of the facts in your article : \"ghost planes of the peak district\" are incorrect.\r\nfor example. the b-29 bomber as described on page 1. was not a bomber, unlike its ww2 counterpart. but a photo recon` aircraft an rb-29a or f-13a. also it is mentioned on that same page that the aircraft crashed in 1945, when in fact it crashed on 3rd november 1948. the pilot was landon `p` tanner not landon `t` tanner. and the rumour that has persited that his ghost was seen near the crash site, i take to be utter nonesense, for it has been said, albeit not by you site, but local newspapers, that this airman, or perhaps an airman from the crash was roaming the moor. i might add that the crew of the f-13a were in a presurized cabin and there was no need for full flying kit. there is no such place as bleaklow mountain. there is a bleaklow, or bleaklow meadow. the place where the rb-29 (f-13a) struck is higher shelf stones, and the lancaster on james`s thorn is adjutant to shelf moor, where the c-47 sytrain, us military dakota crashed on 24/7/45. \r\nit says that another superfortress crashed in the area. it did not. the only other american fortress was b-17 flying fortress nr meltham. the other dakota was a dc-3 that crashed at wimberry stones, kinder intake, dovestones, nr greenfield on 19th august 1949 killing 21 of the 29 passengers & crew on board, including the pilot capt. frank pinkerton, a wartime lancaster pilot with 12 squadron raf bomber command. \r\nron collier is not a farmer, but a glossop aviation historian, he wrote the books `dark peak aircraft wrecks`.\r\nmy name, should you require any further info on the peak district aircraft, is david w.Earl. i wrote the books : `hell on high ground` volumes 1&2. \r\nregards.\r\ndwe. \r\n\r\ncaroline writes:\r\nmyself and my sister have seen a ghostly plane at calver 3 times in the last few years. it was an old war type plane with propellers turning but totally silent, it was so low it was practically touching the roof of the eyre arms pub then it went below the level of the houses of calver village. other people saw it too as it was on radio derby. we saw it here another night but in the dark it had all its lights on and again was low in difficulty but totally silent. the final sighting was again near calver but this time it was directly above me on the calver - baslow road it was again silent and so low only 30 ish foot it banked to the left and then flew past me over a field so low i pulled over and watched it but it was just not there all of a sudden other people had seen it too as they too had stopped there cars. i cannot explain how this plane is so low and yet silent i just thought i'd share my sightings with you.\r\ncaroline. \r\n\r\ndear mr day,\r\ni was asking about your web-article, ghost planes of the peak district, in order to discover the purpose for which it was compiled. seeing that every provable fact in it is erroneous, is it possible that it was intended as a spoof? on the other hand there is no indication that you intended it to be any other than informative. and that is how i shall regard it in covering the subject in a special section in (title removed), expected to published in december 2006. as i shall be unequivocally scathing about your article, i naturally wanted to give you the opportunity of defending such an ill-researched and puerile piece of work.\r\npc \r\n\r\npc came back to us in 2006 with another broadside (maybe \"broadside\" is the wrong term as we're talking aviation here; anyone know the right term?), possibly seeking some publicity for his forthcoming book, which we will not be giving in light of his offensive attitude. here is his latest diatribe -\r\ni had not anticipated coming back to you. but the manuscript of my (title removed) is now with the proof reader, which means that i have a final chance to ask if you have added any scholarship to your 2001 web article on ghost aircraft since i approached you on that head in march 2006.\r\nyou will appreciate that it is not your article's contention that ghosts -- even metal ghosts -- exist i find fault with, but the distortion of facts that are open to investigation. i have not, and have no intention of, revisiting your website -- which i hold to be one of those which so sadly devalues the web -- but, as before, i feel you should be offered the courtesy of explaining why you have ignored and distorted the facts; alternatively, afforded the opportunity of advising that you have put things right in the interim. my to-be-published references to your article are collated below:\r\nmore easily discounted are the vaporous utterances typified by the 2001 website, ���ghost planes of the peak district���, for these immediately disbar themselves by their overt sensationalism and duplicitous distortion of facts.\r\nthe fundamentally unsound ���ghost planes��� article purported to focus upon the broomhead moor search-and-rescue operation of 27 march 1997, mounted after a widely-reported moorland explosion. the histrionic spin the article applied, however, was to imply that the authorities had been mystified to find no wreckage; alternatively, that they had been misled by a ministry cover up.\r\n... also the longdendale valley ������the haunted valley���, as ghost planes��� associate votaries would have it. \r\ni shall consider adapting my piece should your reply indicate that you have now actually researched the circumstances; but beyond this courtesy i have no intention of entering into further discussion with you: after all, your style of signing off last time, vis 'roger wilco, over and out', was so revealingly indicative of your unsuitability to write about any aspect of aviation.\r\npc. dfm, author of (title removed) series ...

my first thought was it was a plane and was concerned because it was very low & the light was very bright & round. i kept watching it as i was talking and it just stayed in one spot (hovered).  i saw a red flashing light a ways away and decided that was an airplane and it looked like it was going to crash into the bright light, but it went under it and kept on going, but then later came back.  i saw 2 or 3 lights that blinked that seem to move past it.  i couldn't quit watching it because of it staying in one place and i was convinced it was not an airplance, star, meator, blimp, weather balloon.  at that time i never considered a ufo.  \r\n \r\ni had watched the \"light\" about 10 min and said something to my husband about the funny light in the sky.  before i could go on, he said he had been watching a bright light in the sky for about 30 minutes. he described it as i was seeing it, large, close,bright and never moving - there were no other visible stars in the sky and he thought it was really odd because it definitely wasn't an airplane.  so i continued to explain to him what i was seeing & we felt it could be the same thing, but how 180 miles apart? at the time i was sseing it he wasn't and had lost sight of it about 20 min before talking to me, but he said it stayed in 1 place at least 30 min when he was watching it.  i got the binoculars and what i could see i described as looking at a disco ball. round, bright and it looked like the sides were faceted. i probably watched it about 45 min and it did not move. i marked it's location by the point on the top of a house. towards the end of my watching it, it appeared to possible be turning around because the coloring changed - there were portions of blue and red on it. it was late, i was tired and decided i was being silly watching this \"light\".  i went back to watching a movie and came back about 20 minutes later and it was gone.  i could however, see a red circle farther towards the west,(as if it was moving in that direction - towards wells county.\r\n\r\ni feel my husband and i possibly witnessed the same thing only we were 180 miles apart. how could that be? things i do know: there was not one visible star in the sky that night, the wind was fairly calm, i have always watched the stars and have never in 58 years seen anything like this, it hovered in one spot 45+ minutes (not sure how long it was there before i saw it), it was round and as i said it looked like a disco ball, it was not an airplane or helicopter,i never considered a ufo as i have never believed or disbelieved but i can't explain the feeling i have that is could be a ufo.  i have researched on line other possibilities - weather balloon, meators, a new star, but can't come up with anything.  \r\n\r\ni would have thought there would have been some more sightings since it was in one spot so long?  i never considered reporting this but after researching felt it might be a good idea, even if there is a logical explanation - which i hope is the case. \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:45:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":14975,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.082573,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01182009-0004","longitude":-85.1333813,"occurred":1231994400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Indiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1231994400000,"summary":"Bright round light hovered 45+ minutes in the same spot, definately not a plane.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":"America/Indiana/Indianapolis","timeZoneName":"America/Indiana/Indianapolis","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Fort Wayne, Indiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:274439"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Arab","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"  a few days before christmas on my senior year in high school my couisin and i had just visited with a friend when we decided to take a ride on some of the dirt roads close to our neighborhood. at one point we reached a 3 way intersection where the dirt road we were traveling on intersected a paved road. across the paved road was a house sitting on about a 1-acre lot. my cousin was driving and i was in the passengers seat as we were turning around to go back down the dirt road i saw an object come over the tree line behind the house.  \r\n  at first i thought it was an airplane as it was a single bright light but as i watched it split into two seperate lights. as we got the truck turned around i continued to watch the object as it again split this time into four seperate lights. this object had come from the north and was moving alongside us as we drove back down the dirt road. i pointed the object out to my cousin as we continued to travel south along the dirt road and as we both looked at the object again it now appeare to have six to eight lights. the lights were different colors some were red others were blue and the rest were white.\r\n at this point we became a little frightened so we sped down the dirt road until we reached my cousins house where we watched the object from outside the vehicle. as we stood in his yard the object was almost directly on top of us and it was now stationary. the first though i had that suggested it wasnt just an airplane or a helicopter was that it was now hovering and made no noise. we watched it for a few more minutes before it began to move again. the object never rotated or anything it simply moved back to the north in the exact same direction it came from. \r\n  i cannot say for sure what i saw but it was silent and could hover and change directions without turning around. i have visited the site several times to try to logically explain this but as of now i have no idea what it could have been. \r\n   ","distance":"501 Feet -
