alabama myself and my peewee football teammates had just won the city championship game. approximately 6 to 8 of us spent the night in a neighborhood called carol villa. we sneaked out of the house that night at about 11:00pm to meet up with some girls on a dead end street just a few blocks away. we were all standing and/or sitting on our bikes underneath a street light when i noticed a disc shaped metallic craft approaching from the north at an altitude of about 150 to 300 feet and a speed of about 10 to 20 mph. the craft was completely silent in its approach and had an array of lights that circled its outermost edge. i would guess the disc was approximately 50 to 75 feet in diameter and maybe 15 to 25 feet from bottom to top. there were 2 rows of lights around its edge, the lower row was a lime shade of green and flashed in a clockwise movement around the craft and the upper row was orange in color and flashed simultaneousely in a counterclockwise movement. the 2 rows of lights were no more than a few inches apart from the other. it had a domed sort of top on it that was circled by windows from which an amber colored light eminated. from our angle on the ground i could actually see moving shadows being cast onto the ceiling of the craft from inside. the shadows moved and flickered against the ceiling in a curious and eratic manner. the craft moved slowly as it approached a point approximately 200 to 400 feet to our west over an open field. we all watched the craft and speculated aloud what it might be. i knew immediately that it was not any conventional craft that i had ever seen or heard of. this thing made no sound at all as it stopped in mid-air. the field was known as marshalls field and was inaccessable to us because of a dense briar patch that grew between the street and the field. we all were astonished by this event and as we watched the craft hanging silently in mid-air, it began to descend into the field dissapearing behind the bushes and briars that blocked our view. we began trying to penetrate the briars to see if the craft had actually landed but the briars were too dense. we discussed whether to go down a few blocks because we knew of a bike trail that entered the field from another dead end street 2 blocks down. one of our linemen (ken) only lived a few houses from where we were so he decided to sneak back into his bedroom window and get his camera. he jumped on his bike and dissapeared around the corner. we all continued to discuss running down to the bike trail to see if we could get a better look at the craft when suddenly it arose from the field and hovered again exactly where it had been before. about this time ken showed up with his x-15 land camera, dropped his bike and began to snap off a series of about 3 shots with a flash cube. on about the 3rd flash the craft went from zero to gone in a matter of 2 seconds back in the same northerly direction it came from. the weirdest thing about this event is that we never discussed it among each other, we didn't go back to the house and stay up talking about it, i don't even remember going back to the house that night. i had never talked about our sighting with any of these boys until about 2 years ago. i looked ken up in the phone book and found him living in a nearby town. i called the number and his wife answered telling me that ken was at work. i explained that i had played peewee football with ken and asked if she could have him call me back sometime. ken called me about 20 minutes later. not wanting to lead him on, i allowed him to tell me what he remembered about that night and it was uncanny how much his memory matched my own after 32 years or more. i asked ken if he had ever developed the photos he had taken and he said they had all came back solid black. nothing on the entire roll had developed. to this day ken is the only person there that i have contacted about this event. i guess i'm saving robbie, todd, steve, dale, davie, tim, dahl, leah, cheryl and nan and possibly others for some other day.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s),

wonderful view of the horizon looking south towards ashby ma).I was laying on the bed looking out the window watching the sky (between 10:00pm-11:30pm), when all of the sudden a green light or aura, with a inner red aura lit up the clouds not to far above the tree line(the reason i say \"aura\" is because the light seemed to completely surround the craft). inside this green-red aura was a cylinder shape craft standing up vertically, but immediately changed it's orientation from vertical to horizontal and at this point i saw that there was some sort of exhaust coming out of the back of it. the color of the craft appeared to be a copper color, but i'm not sure, it could be that the red aura was shining on the craft, making it appear that color. as soon as i saw this i yelled and my girlfriend who was in the same room right next to me looked out, but she only managed to see the green aura because it happened so fast (3-4 seconds). it appeared that craft turned on these lights so it could perform it's transition from vertical to horizontal positioning, but that's just a theory.I grew up near an airport and we sky watch regularly from this exact spot and find it very easy to

sighting was on jan.12,2009 at around 9pm. my father asked me to come and look at something in the sky, i thought maybe it was going to be a plane or helicopter but when i saw the object i could see that something was not right, i had never seen anything like it and i am 26 years old. my father is 78 years old and said he has never seen anything like it before. the object was bright orange and seemed to be stationary in the sky off to the northwest, there was no sound from the orb. i got my digital camera which has 10x zoom on it and began filming the orb. the orb changed colors from orange to red to green to white and back to orange several times, and even appered to rapidly change shape on a number of occasions. the second sighting i had was on jan. 15, 2009 at around 8:30pm. i was sitting at my computer and my father came in and said in a joking manner \"your alien is back\", i asked if he was serious and he replied yes only it is closer this time. i went and looked out the living room window and sure enough there was the exact same object only closer to my home and seemed to be directly above the local power substation on hwy.490. as i had previously done i got my digital camera and went onto the front porch and began filming the orb and captured the same results as the first night, color and shape change. the object remained stationary for approximatly 2 hours before moving off to the north west. my third sighting is my most vivid and well noted. i was at my friends home in london on the evening of jan.16, 2009 at around 9pm. i noticed the object back in the northwest once again. my friend filmed the object and we watched as it once again changed color and shape. the orb was a good distance from us i would estimate around a mile from our position. we watched for several hours as this object slowly made it's way across the night sky before dissapering behind the horizon. i will admit that i am a huge ufo skeptic however i have seen something that i can not explain nor can anyone else who has seen it. i have several credible witnesses including my friend who is a sgt. in the u.S army., his wife, her sister, her cousin, my friends uncle and aunt as well as my father and mother. i am not writing this as a hoax or prank or wanting any kind of fame i simply would like to know what i am seeing and should i be concerned.

really moving. i stopped what i was doing. due to the fact that i study u.F.O.'s in depth to an extent so i payed close attention to what was before me!!??! long story short i closely scrutinized the shape as best i could the moon wasn't predominant this night. i managed to make out the approximate shape of the object and i managed to be sure that it wasn't the average run-of-the-mill aeronautic objects that occupy our airspace everyday.I mean this thing was really moving i mean really,really moving.The few seconds that it would take to clear the space it cleared for a regular plane or secret experiment to clear it did it in a 1/3 of the time maybe less,maybe an eighth of the time.Either way this isn't the first time i've seen something that shouldn't usually be in the sky off&on since i was seventeen. i wouldn't have paid it half a mind if it wasn't going so [cms/pd/tg] fast it cleared a patch of sky the size of a large parking lot in no-time at all i mean fast!I didn't really loose sight of the object i had to get going to where i had to be and it was just going to where it (or they) were on their way to where they were going it was just moving so fast it didn't make any sense to be going so fast so low. it wasn't a plane of any raptor or other fighter. the military flies over brooklyn sometime on their way to where ever it is they're going so i know what fighters look and sound like!!! bingo that's the main thing that let me know that it wasn't something that belongs in the skies everyday or that is in the skies everyday. it made no sound at all!!!!!??! not one peep no vapor trail no heat line no wings nothing but two red lights and incredible speed and mainly no sound i didn't hear it before i saw it or while it was going by or after it went by due to the way sound

my parents flew over from france to their condo in florida with sisters for a vacation between beginning and mid february 1988 , i flew down from paris where i was studying to look after their nice villa as many burglaries were taking place at that time in the region.\r\n\r\nthe house is a 3000 sq ft villa with five bedrooms and bathrooms , nestled hillside on some rolling hills with a great view on the med from a distance.Closest neighbours are about 150 meters away on either side as primarily these part of the city consists of large estates.One private road brings to our house (this is some years back , 21 years ago).With a huge sheperd dog that would bark at any noise we were well aware of any person walking in the vicinity on the steet some fifity meters lower.\r\n\r\na friend came over i hadn t seeen for a while as had moved up to paris for studies six months before.It was about 6 pm on february 15 or 16 th 1988.We chat a while , had a few sodas and finally started cooking a meal which we ate , went to the local video store to view some movies that night.I recall those films being comedies as we liked to have a good laugh.\r\n\r\nthe house was a one story villa built hillside so living quraters were on first floor , except for an independent efficiency room and bathroom on bottom level.Rest of ground level is a three car garage and storage place with an communicating little storage room with the boiler and heating system in there (house had a fuel central heating system).Garden was a steep hill with many olive trees and umbrella pine trees very common on the med coast of france.House was surrounded by terrasses , a walkway around the back of the house and a swimming pool at te opposite end.\r\n\r\nafter we view the films , we decide to go to bed , my room was next to the friends room.Our dog was outside as usual.This was about midnight.\r\n\r\ni fall asleep and am waken up by bonnie , the pyrenean sheperd just howling and barking as never before.A big dog of about 100 pounds very gentle but known not to mess around with from strangers.\r\n\r\nas i wake up going to the window to see what was going on , as i open the steel shutters , i hear my friend yell and scream with terror.He was woken himself by the barking and as he opened his eyes , saw two red eyes glowing in the dark from outside.The shutters were closed , however even made of steel they had regular local style shapes with spaces between them like a french window , and one of them was broken at a height of approximaely two meters.\r\n\r\nthe dog stops howling and makes actually no more noise.Growls evey now and then.From the garage downstairs we both hear a door banging as if someone had been opening it with force then just slamming it a few times in a row.\r\n\r\ni take a 22 lr handy in this case of spooky happenings , thinking a burglar team is on the loose around the house and targeting my parents villa , open the bullet proof door (5mm steel covered it entirely and frame was reinforced and built in within the wall with huge steel rods every foot), a very secure home.I just got afraid for bonnie thinking these guys could have hurt her , so we decide to go outside , then all lights on (possible from inside at the entry with switches for all the exterior lights).\r\n\r\nfeeling secure with the weapon , we don t find any trace of anything and even less the dog.She must have run away.But that dog could defeat some very large dogs and had seen it in the past so we wondered what kind of thing could scare the dog.After verifying nothing was around the house on a check tour , we decide to go and see what was causing such tremendous noise in the locked basement/garage.\r\n\r\nthe door to the boiler room was definitely closed.Nothing to be seen.\r\n\r\nwe go back upu , tuen every light on in the house , and come to speak of the recent events.The corsican buddy was a tall six foot two courageous person , and i was all muscle and six feet , both of us practised karate at a higher level , and though hate to admit it , we had been in a couple of bar fights as young men full of testosterone do when they are teenagers.This corsican guy was strong and never backed away on those occasion.\r\n\r\nhere , he seemed terrified as what he d seen was absolutely beyond his comprehension.Two red glowing eyes at two meters high and he stated he d recall this thing seemed to see him in the totally dark room and see \"through him\" as in inside his mind.\r\n\r\nthe dog finally comes back.Two hours had passed it was about 2 or 2:30 am in the night.We thought of calling the police but they d certainly just do the same we did and make a statement and file it as usual with no real efficiency against the robbers that had ben storming the city for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nas we are talking , we hear like a converstaion between two invisible people in the living room we were in , but as if through a closed door , noise seemed attenuated.\r\n\r\nsoon after the door started banging again in the garage and as we went down , nothing , plainly nothing , door is shut , not a noise , noone to be seen.The dog did growl in the garage as we went down there again.\r\n\r\nshe had her tail between her legs since her return from wherever she had been hiding.\r\n\r\nthree last events happened that night:\r\n\r\n1 door banged again every now and then with an impression of the entire villa shaking or vibrating to a point i thought there was an earhquake.\r\ni verified the following morning and nothing of the sort took place around the french rivierathat night .\r\n\r\n2 before going back to bed i was in the bathroom and had a sip of water before going to sleep (if i could !!!) and had a clear vision of my step dad and sisiter at the airport in paris, some kind of clairvoyance .The following morning they called around 10 am to let me know they had both decided to come home earlier than planned for whatever reason and without letting me know or calling me from florida to let me know so could pic them up.This came as a surpsride and has never happened again.\r\n\r\n3 as i lay in bed , i feel like someone blowing on my face which scared the hell out of me.I idn t sleep at all if i remember correctly.Moreover the corsican buddy had felt the same blow on his face before going to sleep.\r\n\r\nhe never came back to sleep at that place ever again.And i did pick sister and step dad up at airport the following afternoon but never had an explanation on any kind on what this strange night was about or what could have caused it.\r\n\r\ni do recall another detail is that electrical power did blow and had to go to entry of property to reset the central electrical switch where electricity of france , the supplier had by law installed their disrupters.

d like to bring to you a fact i have kept to anyone but my wife and that is highly troubling me.\r\n \r\nlast week on the night from wednesay to thursday at around 3 am i had been working a helluva lot on my computer for all this alexandria project and sending out emails to french ufo organizations and decided to go and have a smoke outside as i am a smoker for a break to get my head off this stuff for a little while and as i had a stiff neck from all the time sitting bent over my laptop on my desk.\r\n \r\nthere is a place i like to go at night watch the sky in my garden while looking at a specific pine tree quite high in my neighbours garden and having at the same time a view on the stars , its very relaxing to me , and frankly the sky here is crystal clear when the mistral wind blows as it had the previous day , taking any cloud away.Chilly but relaxing and close to nature.\r\n \r\nthis area i like to stand watch is a footstep away from my back patio.While having my cigarette , i tell to myself turning arounf to the patio which is open to the outside and covered with a roof under which stands what french call \"a summer kitchen \" some sort of exterior kitchen (some kind of barbecue area for americans except there really is a gas stove , sink and all necessary stuff for cooking outside meals , and is bonded with a whole bunch of bric a brac stuff.So tell myself 'time to clean up this mess i will do it tomorrow\".Must have taken about thirty seconds.\r\n \r\ni feel something tingling and turn around and watch the skyright at that spot above the pine tree , a triangular ufo with four red lights under it forming a square , not blinking , just constantly lit appears or seems to appear as i hadn t heard it approach , nor seen it for that matter.It was hovering above the neighbours garden past the tree but seemed right above the pine tree from my standing position.\r\n \r\nsuddenly i feel panicked and observed , or simply noticed and run from patio to the front door which was distant about 15 yards away alongside the house , just a corner of the house to reach.As i arrive at the corner of the house , i hold on to a gutter which drains water from the roof to the sewaer directly and feel like paralyzed and my eye sight became blurry while i recall one thing before remembering waking up in my bed the following morning: i thought \"missing time\" in english.\r\n \r\ni usually think in french as i have been speaking french seemingly forever.The fact of thinking that term in english was awkward.\r\n \r\nas i woke up the following morning , i told my wife i had a dream that seemed just so realistic that i felt the cold , dreamed as never before as it seemed so realistic and colourful: i could feel absolutely everything had that been a dream.Suddenly i realized that the state i was in was similar to that of an operation i had at hospital last september when i was operated on my left arm and only shoulder was put asleep but as i was anxious , the surgeon had the nurse give me a product that just put me in an altered relaxed state of consciousness during lapses of sleep.I recall for instance being in a room at hospital , waking up with a bunch of people in beds as myself , speaking to a male nurse , him answering me and falling back to sleep , knowing this had ben real as i had spoken to that same nurse on my waking up after the operation had been done successfully.That operation had been the kind when you come in at morning and leave at night , french calling it ambulatory hospitalization for a day in short.\r\n \r\nthat episode at hospital seemed like a dream but was however a chemically induced antianxiety process which somehow disconnected me from reality.When i woke up , i was glad all had been well as i hate being operated on or simply in a hospital.\r\n \r\nthe following morning when i spoke to my wife , i recalled the episode but wondered how i d landed back in my bed and was just plainly puzzling me , and has since.\r\n \r\nwhen i d seen the uso from the yacht in the bahamas in 1989 i was very excited and flabbergasted about this experience which was quite something extraordinary.At the contrary , this one is absolutely mind boggling and i do not know how to react to it.\r\n \r\ncould you please give me some advice on this one.\r\n \r\ni have told to myself that working so long on ufo contacts , investigations and such on the past weeks for long hours everyday has made my brain \"see what i was reading\" or something like that , but i am still very anxious and no longer go close to that patio to have my smoke and feel uneasy when looking at that scenery now.\r\n \r\nthe craft in itself was plain rectangular and was wbout 160/ 170 degrees above me to the horizon and seemed not to move while i ran for the door.\r\ni was able to see it clearly as street lights nearby are lit all night long , and could see it s shape with the disappearance of stars in back of it.\r\n \r\nfinally , just thinking about this experience just makes me plainly sick and induces nearly panick attacks.I have never experienced anything like this and would like to have your feelings about this please.\r\n \r\nit comes at a moment where i am contacting quite a few people in the ufology field and have joined a large organization in same and trying to get comprehension of this phenomenon more global so as to advance faster in understanding it.\r\n \r\nafew years back , in a street adjacent to the one i live close to the med , a few inhabitants have seen a ufo hover arounf this area but descrition was different.And only flew above to disappear where here i have no clue to what happened afterwards as i was plainly pralyzed and tried to resist this power with great will before thinking missing time and waking up in my bed.\r\n \r\nthis to me is just absolutely shocking as i feel violated in my own home , that is the best i could express what i do feel.\r\n

nights, i began looking at the stars.  i was facing east, and something caught my eye to my left.  i immediately thought it would be a \"falling star\" but then saw what appeared to be five small, orange lights traveling at the same speed and in a formation.  \r\n  the object was silent and moving at a high rate of speed and appeared to be lower in altitude than normal air traffic. in addition, the object was traveling in a different direction than usual air traffic.  the object came from a nnw traveling ssw, whereas normal air traffic usually goes in a easterly or westerly direction.\r\n  the object appeared to be solid, yet it seemed to be transparent at the same time.  the orange colored lights were continuous and did not strobe.  the object appeared to be in a \"delta type formation\" but, one of the lights however, seemed to be out of place on the object, unless the object would have been banking or was at an odd angle.\r\n   i continued watching the object as the tree in my front yard blocked the view over the roof, but when the object emerged in the clear of the tree again, i noticed it began to fade in brightness and then disappeared completely.\r\n   the object made no sound whatsoever, which i found odd from the beginning. the temperature outside was -6 degrees, and the skies were clear.  i know from my time in the military, that sound travels easier in cold air and the craft left no contrails despite the temperature. \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      ","distance":"501 Feet - 1
