shot at and missed a few rabbits. we started to look at the items in the dump, the majority of the stuff was discarded air force stuff like old helmets and oxygen masks and what l thought was jet parts. at about 10:00 we stopped and had some water and a sandwich. suddenly a man appeared from nowhere he was just standing there in front of us about 10 feet away. there was nothing for him to be hiding behind or jump out from. this is what he looked like he was very tall, about 7 ft and almost skinny very slender and he had long reddish blonde hair, and a beard that was the same color.\r\n

there were numerous red lights visible from the lower rear three quarters degree view we had, so we were at it's \"8 o clock low\" from it's vantage. as far as the number of lights i cannot say for certain, i am now uncertain if they lined the forward leading edge perimeter, or were line abreast, across the bottom surface, (ventral) at right angle to the center line on the v. there was a reddish glow emeinating or reflecting off of the bottom, almost a shimmering, with some intricate fine detail barely visible underneath through the reddish glow i first attributed to reflection from the nearby forrest fire. there were no visible means of propulsion evident. i cannot stress the lumberingly slow movement of this object away from us and when it passed behind a neighbors leafless tree i quickly sped 30 feet out of the driveway to gain a better onobstructed vantage again, away from the tree, no more than 5 seconds, it was gone! i could not see any possible obstruction that could have prevented visual re acquisition. it just vanished! my girlfriend remembers being very aware then of numerous private and light commercial traffic in the sky, as there is always in the vicinity of the van nuys airport. i had this impression as well but feel it was a result of such intense target fixation observing the object then having no stimulus directly forward tends to widen your perception from the tunnel vison we experienced. we humans are preditors by nature with both eyes fixed forward for expanded depth perception, keyed to movement. i wish i could say i photographed my sighting, but there are seldom good cameras when you need them around. i did make a crude animated .Gif file the very next day to try and record the event to the best of my and my gf's recolection.\r\n\r\ni didn't come forward earlier because i have always scoffed and outwardly derided people who have claimed to have witnessed things like i now have. i didn't want to be,\"one of those people\" but i am now. i'm not going to pilgramage out to roswell or anything or claim abduction stories, but i will share what i saw, and know to be seen by at least me and my girlfriend. thank god she was there to back me up!

pasadena,california living at my uncle's house. ive always been a believer in ufos and ever since my first encounter ive been addicted to them.Two days ago at apoximetly 6 pm i was on my uncle's balcony gazing west at the beautiful view of the mountains when i noticed something bright in the sky hovering for atleast an hour to an hour and a half. i knew it could not be a plane nor a helicopter because it did not contain the blinking red lights that transmite their locations to the faa. with that in mind i thought it had to be a star. so i went to go and grab my camera, i have a \r\npanasonic pv-gs400 \r\nwhich features\r\n12x optical zoom with optical stabalizer.\r\n700x digital zoom\r\nallows manual controls over these features: focus, exposure, shutter speed, aperture, white balance, mic sensitivity\r\nleica dicomar lens\r\ntape format: minidv\r\nstill photo resolution: 2288 x 1728 pixels.\r\nive always let my curriousity get the best of me because ive always known that there's always gonna be something special at the end of it. what i saw next was unbelieveable because never in my life have i ever seen anything like what i saw. at first it looked like a pyramid with 4 dots on it.I then realized that my camera had the option of 700x digital zoom instead of the standered 250x i imediatly switched it to 700x, and what i saw next amazed me beyond belief. it seemed like it had a sphere camera in the center of it or an eyeball,as i kept recording i noticed my battery was running out and died withing the next 10 mins of filming. as i previously mentioned im here on vaction and my brother had left the battery charger back home in jersey. this upseted me very much because i knew i was not going to be able to analyze the video that i just recorded. so the next day i did some research to see if anybody had witnessed what i had by going on google and youtube and typing in blue ufo/pyramids i went through a good amount of websites/video's untill one caught my eye. it was a blueish type pyramid exactly like mine, i clicked on the video and was amazed yet again. it was identical to my unidentified flying object except that it was filmed in russia and that his camera might have not been as good as mine. i will include my video links with this video including the one the russian guy filmed. by the way the ufo has been showing up here every night

line it seemed at first, then i noticed it was arcing slightly more out to sea. the object seemed to be following along the coastline, going from north to south. it just seemed so high, and looked big from where i was. so to be that large from my position, it must have been very large.\r\n    so that is what was curious. what is so large, just round, would fly through the sky...Way to big to be a balloon drifting. that is what i first thought it had to be. but it was way to big to be a balloon. just perfectly round it seemed. and it must have been going at a pretty good speed too. not real real fast. maybe as fast as an airplane would look at the same height. but this was no airplane. the large whitish gray, very round, shape was very very plain to see. a huge round object, not a balloon!!\r\n   i watched it until i could no longer see it. it went down the coast a bit then headed out towards sea. very clear sunny day...Just a few super thin wispy clouds left by some airplanes

bright and pulsed and heading northwest to southeast, towards us.  the first one stopped, stood still for a few seconds and then heading west. there was a second one behind it, just as bright orange as the first. it was coming from the same direction. it then stopped in place. did a quick square flight pattern, and headed west(was gone pretty quickly once heading west).  the duration was about 2 min and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated w/ the ufo's, but yet they were close enough that if it was a plane,helicopter, we would have heard some sort of engine sound associated with it.  my boyfriend is very skeptical, but he said it was like nothing he has ever seen before. the color was just such a bright rich orange color and the flight pattern was very akward.  i have no

stuck on you clothes while walking through tall grass (http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/poa) but it had several longer spike like protrusions coming off the back of it about the same length as the main part of the object, as far as i could see there were no lights or windows on it, just a reflectionless black hull. it didn't seem to be changing altitude or distance to the plane. i told the passenger next to me, they looked and did not notice it. the closest man made vehicle i know of to what this looked like is the f-117 nighthawk stealth fighter but the object was too different to be an f-117. it stayed with us for quite a while, i eventually stopped watching and every once in a while i'd take a look and there it was right in the same place as last time but the last time i looked i didn't

thought it was the usual philly air traffic but this light bobed around like a balloon in the same general spot.  did not move like a stationary airplane.  first thing that came to mind was the skeptics good old chinese lantern except the orange glow was not inside something like that.  there was a light snow/freezing rain and the visibility was about 9 miles which put it in the direction of palmyran, pennsauken and cinnaminson, nj and philadelphia.  the airport is about 28 miles from where i am at and i could not observe any other air traffic like i usually do.  it was in the direction of the landing pattern but about 10 miles or less closer to my house (used visibility of 9 miles)  the flight pattern is further than that for the air traffic into philly.   i took out binoculars and the ufo/orb was clear in them.\r\nafter a couple of minutes it got smaller and disappeared. in my opinion this was an unidentified object.  i look up into the skies every day and night to train my eyes and look for abnormalities, so i am confident this was something out of the ordinary.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

out. the door faces east. the moon was just about full that evening. out of the corner of my eye, i noticed a strange ���������cloud��������� to my right. it was strange enough that i turned to look at it.\r\n\r\nit was moving from the south to the north very fast. it was about 70 -75 degrees off the horizon and dark grey. the shape is what first caught my attention. imagine an iphone lying flat but there was a large ���������dome shape��������� under it and in the middle of the rectangle. the ���������dome��������� seemed to have several lobes on it so it was not perfectly smooth.  in fact the whole object was about the size of an iphone held at arm���������s length. there was only one object.\r\n\r\nit did not make any sound. in fact i would say the silence was ���������deafening��������� in the same way it is quiet after a large snowfall. \r\n\r\nthe moon was quite bright and the edges of the object seemed to glow from the moonlight rather than an internal source. the object obstructed the view of stars as it flew by.\r\n\r\ni walked down the side path to the front of my house to keep the object in view. it continued straight north. the speed and altitude did not alter. i continued to watch it until it disappeared from view. there were no aircraft in the area at the time.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear that except for a few wispy, white clouds that are shaped more like long pencils. i watched the object fly under the clouds and noted that the object was not only moving in the opposite direction of the clouds, but it was going much faster than the clouds. it moved fast enough that i knew i did not have time to get my camera. plus it was dark enough that i was not sure the object would photograph.\r\n\r\nmy dog was outside with me and he started barking when the object was in front of me. \r\n\r\ni watched the object for approximately one minute before i could no longer see it.\r\n\r\ni was home alone. i am a mom and a business owner. unfortunately, i did not see any of my neighbors outside who i could ask to witness the object.\r\n\r\nthe next night i looked up at the sky watching the clouds move. i realized that the moonlight hitting the edges of the clouds was rather diffuse. the object i saw on january 8 was enveloped by moonlight that was quite bright ��������� as though the object reflected the moonlight. but the object did not seem to be shiny to me at the time of sighting.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line
