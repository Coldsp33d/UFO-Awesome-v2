other girlfriends, on our way from woodland hills to chatsworth when we encountered an unidentifiable air craft.  \r\n\r\nwe were heading inland on topanga canyon blvd when we approached a red light at the intersection of topanga canyon blvd and roscoe.  all four of us saw a very large craft hovering directly above the center of the intersection, just above the street lights and power lines.   the object was much, much larger than a helicopter and it seemed like it was large, deep and possibly rectangular in shape.  it was matte black in color and i don't recall the bottom having lights, but the bottom was also matte black with an angular, industrial looking pattern to it.  i don't recall clearly, seeing it arrive in the intersection, and what i do remember is that all 4 of us saw it, talked about it wondering what it was, and being perplexed as to how it was just able to sit above the intersection without make any noise at all.  \r\n\r\nbecause we were in a vw bug, we thought our vision of the entire craft was being limited by the small windows, so we rolled down the windows expecting to feel some sort of wind, but the air was dead still.  no wind, no noise and it looked huge like something we'd never seen before.  \r\n\r\nthis is where my memory stops.  i cannot recall what happened next.  i don't know who was in the car with me, i don't know how the craft arrived or left, i don't know what we did or where we went afterwards.  i don't even remember talking to anyone, not even my parents, about it for decades after that night.  i never lost the memory of what i've described, but i have no recall of everything else just before and after for several days.  in conversation with a friend, decades later in my 40's, the topic of ufo's came up, and i felt compelled to tell him my story.  it was the first time i spoke of it since it happened.  i do know that i always remembered the event, but it was as though it had been given a priority level setting of zero in my memories for all those years, until that day i had the conversation with my friend.  then it felt important enough to tell my experience and start thinking about it again.","distance":"101-500

home every once in a whle. i have never, before this, encountered anything more than a probably misidentified ball of light.\r\nneedless to say, i succeeded last saturday night.\r\n\r\ni was driving in a remote area of rural douglas county, somewhere to the north of elkhorn. when i first noticed the object was a disc of light in the sky off to the west. it disappeared after approximately 5 seconds. approximately 30 seconds later, my car was engulfed in light. almost immediately afterward, a large-ish (18-wheeler size?) disc of light similar to incandescent bulb warm light had landed in front of me.\r\n\r\nafter about a minute, a bright blue ball (then varying shape) of light (entity?) appeared in my car on the passenger's seat next to me. it was about 6 feet tall and an irregular shape. the being(?) constantly varied in shape, although more or less taking the shape of the seat it was on. however, it never was anything other than a blue light. \r\n\r\nabout 30 seconds later, my car overheated, stopped, and nearly injured me. as soon as the car began to become insanely hot, the aliens and light disappeared. the temperature, according to the meter in the car, reached 114 degrees. i needed to open the door, which was now possible with the lack of aliens.\r\n\r\ni cannot remember 1 hour before the incident. i am not available for contact.","distance":"20 Feet or

hike i had been watching various youtube videos about ufos..Something ive always been interested in..Anyway i had a strange feeling i would see something... a feeling that has since left me. so about halfway through the hike i came to a clearing i usually stop there and have a drink of water and a snack if i'm hungry. i decided to look up...Maybe id see something..I clearly was not expecting to..But it had almost become a habit, and to my surprise as i did a reflection caught my eye. so i took my phone out and started to record.. it looked like two spheres that were circling but maintained the space between each other almost as if they were connected but separate if that makes any sense.  if you can imagine holding a tiny metal bar with 2 basketballs stuck on each end and you just twirled the middle of the stick around that's the best way i could describe these 2 objects moving through the sky hovering. i didn't know what they were so i was talking a little bit through the video maybe they were weather balloon's.. i was going through different scenarios in my mind i had seen weather balloons before and these didn't look like they were.. i was trying to think of something that fit the description but i couldnt... near the end of the video you can see and hear an airplane or some kind of jet pass below.  after the jet passed i became the bit uneasy and i decided it was time to move on so i hiked the rest of the way about a mile...As i started looking over the video when i got home i noticed two other objects that were smaller and moving extremely fast. i screenshot these at 31 seconds and 44 seconds.  if you look closely you can see these objects fly through extremely fast... i've had the video in my phone and i decided to send it to you guys.. i'm sure you have equipment that's better than my phone :) you can zoom in and adjust contrast or whatever you guys do to clear the picture and video up to make it easier to see anyway...That's pretty much it. hope the video is as interesting to you as it was to me.  ps camp bullis military training reservation is a u.S. army training camp comprising 27,990 acres in bexar county, texas, usa,

from the airport. but then, i quickly realize that they were not airplanes. i saw the airplanes that were coming or going from the airport and they were very very clearly airplanes. when i started focus in on what i was seeing, i could tell that whatever they were were almost ovular shaped, but look as if they came to points on either end. they were  silver and white, very very bright and reflective, and almost looked as if they were shimmering. they were also leaving a very bright and vivid shimmering trail behind them. what made me pay attention to them immediately was the way they were moving in the sky airplanes do not move that way.  they were weaving in and out of each other but it was strange because they seemed like they were so far away from each other but they were met almost making infinity signs in the way they were weaving around one another as i kept driving forward i realize that there were many more of them in the sky than i thought i was only looking to the left and i counted seven.   when i started looking around me even more i noticed that there were what seem to be military aircraft along the outer edge of the area that i was in almost as if they were kind of in a circle around the area that i was in and that i was seeing the ufos. at one point if you have the ufos  circled around two of the military style aircrafts and then started circling back around one another. as i was looking at the sky and all, all of a sudden they blipped out of sight. it was like i blinked and they were gone. i drove a couple more feet to the next light , and then looked up again and they were in the sky wants more except they were all in a line no longer zigzagging or crisscrossing around each other and circular motions but they were in a straight line all going up. i blink again and they were gone.  the whole time the experience was happening i just felt very very confused. my brain literally couldn't make sense of what was going on, and i felt very foggy. as soon as they were gone for good out of my sight i was left feeling overwhelmingly shocked.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":90565,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":35.2369569,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-03042018-0022","longitude":-80.8369067,"occurred":1520184540000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"North

caught my eye near a large cloud formation because it was moving very fast. i pointed it out to my wife who also saw it. it seemed to be at an extremely high altitude and we wondered if it could be a satellite. i took out my i-phone and snapped a few photos. realizing that they were only showing what looked like a tiny spec of light, i zoomed in as far as i could and took a series of photos. the object covered a very large distance in a very short time, and traveled in a straight line. it appeared to be changing shape too. my wife noted that it appeared to be separating into two parts at one point (photo 3322). a lot of the time, i could make out a faint \"x\" inside of the circle which when i examined the photos later on my computers larger screen was very visible when enlarged.  while we watched it appeared to change into several different shapes, although because of the distance it was hard to see with much detail. when i reviewed the 40 separate photos i found there to be several distinct shapes; a perfect square, a 6 point star, a circle with an 'x' dividing it into 4 distinct and equal segments, an inverted upside down 'l', an odd geometric shape with 3 protuberances, and some other more abstract shapes as well. at one point a commercial airliner passed nearby and it looked like it was very close in altitude by comparison. within a few minutes, i could no longer get a good picture as it was too far away. it started directly overhead at my (approximately) high noon location became too far away to see well in my (approximately) 3 o'clock position. the whole thing lasted only 5 minutes.

facing back yard about 9:20pm on feb.24th when i looked to check the weather activity at that moment they came in from the east on sort of a converging path.The first one on the left never came more than an apparent few miles away from my position.It was similar to a medium bright star and was flickering, starting to dim then it pooped out this, i guess fire ball object that left a really long trail.Probably 80% the distance to the ground. it reminded me of the way an oil lamp burns in a calm room, a bit like how the flame looks almost too calm beneath a liquid ox rocket engine on liftoff. this flame was just as silver as you can imagine, very strange. while that was going on the second one was slowly receding and moving very slowly to the right. at that point i went in the house to find another witness. i wanted to stay and watch but i wanted be sure i wasn't seeing things. while i was collecting my witness we could hear the dog go nuts outside. when i got outside again the dog was barking and running around like she thought something was going on all over the yard at once. related? i do not know. by now this huge light comes into view from behind the neighbors fur tree witness sees it and says \"there it is.\" and i thought that's weird that's to bright and red to be an airplane. but not wanting to be made a fool. i told witness, \"no its bigger than what i saw\". witness walked away just in time to miss the show. this thing started to move toward me and to the left a little bit, stopped, hovered for a few moments reversed slowly, stopped  brightens or sort of flares up and shoots out a fire ball just like the other. it faded completely away in about 3 seconds or so and it was over. this last one was interesting in that it was close enough that some detail (very little) could be seen. it was large, the size of a 737. a large amber ringed with red light and apparent structure horizontally  connecting to another red light about a quarter of the size of the first \r\n\"\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line
