meu avistamento passa-se em portugal nos arredores da cidade do porto numa vila que hoje também é cidade, chamada maia entre 1978 1979,  não sei precisar ao certo. eu teria na altura unss 10 anos mais ao menos.\r\nnessa época eu vivia numa zona um pouco rural e meia deserta. minha casa ficava a 2 km da casa mais próxima e se situada entre um grande campo de cultivo na frente da casa e uma bouça nas traseiras. o sitio era muito fixe mas de noite metia um pouco de medo. tudo isto se passa depois do jantar, como não tínhamos casa de banho dentro de casa e a casa de banho ficava nas traseiras da casa e não tinha luz era uma vela que usavam os eu pedi a minha mãe para vir fazer xixi em frente à casa,  como tínhamos uma lâmpada logo a saída da porta eu podia estar sossegado. liguei a luz e disse a minha mãe que  estava na cozinha a lavar a loiça que ia fazer xixi... sai e quando estava de costas para a casa e virado para o campo ouvi um zumbido não muito fraquinho quando me volto fico perplexo com o que vejo a pairar por cima da minha casa, um objecto com cerca de três metros de diâmetro em forma de disco prateado e cheio de luzinhas brilhantes, ainda chamei a minha mãe para ela vir ver mas ela não ligou nenhuma. o objecto 2 ou 3 minutos mais como se me estivesse a observar e depois ganhou um velocidade incrível e desapareceu em dois segundos  nas estrelas .No dia seguinte como o meu pai trazia o jornal todos os dias depois do trabalho e como morava relativamente perto do aeroporto francisco sá carneiro, tentei ver se havia alguma notícia a falar de alguma coisa, mas não apareceu nada. na altura não tive medo mas passei a ver o mundo de outra forma e foi sempre acompanhado o que se vai passando pelo nosso planeta. durante o tempo que vivi nessa casa nunca mais voltei a ter outro avistamento, mas tive várias situações de me deitar na sala e acordar no quarto sem saber como e não sou sonâmbulo, mas também não sei se isso tem alguma relação. mas a melhor está para vir. hoje em dia tenho uma filha com 22 anos e o namorado dela aconteu-lhe uma coisa bastante estranha. a pouco tempo ele acordou de manhã com um golpe na cabeça perto da fonte, pegou e foi ao hospital ver o que era aquilo porque não se lembra de fazer esse golpe. conclusão os médicos no hospital disseram a ele que ele não podia estar vivo e não têem explicação. obrigado por poder partilhar

(everyone left about 1900.) after i finished closing the last one i was walking to exit on the north side door of the hangar when i noticed something move. i then stopped to look in the back at the hangar (west wall) as to what was moving and i noticed it was someone walking behind the aircraft in back of the hangar. so i stopped (east wall) to look at who was there and i saw 2 long skinny legs grayish green in color and could tell whatever it was is was facing my direction and i then saw it turn and  begin walking to the south wall and was a little nervous by this point and quickly was walking to my exit on the north side of the hangar. i knew there was an aircraft parked in front of me so a very quickly looked in front of me so i didn't walk into the nose of the plane and once i knew i was in a clear path to the door i quickly looked back to where i saw this being and it was gone. i then heard a loud bang in the back southwest corner of the hangar and knew without a doubt whatever i was looking at was moving extremely fast! so i picked up my pace towards the door and then directly behind me was a loud bang on the main hangar doors where i was just standing seconds ago! as i reached for the door handle whatever it was i knew and could feel it directly behind me!!Every hair on my body was standing straight up! although i was obviously startled by this event i did not feel any negative energy associated with it. i was just scared because i knew it ran around and came up right behind me. that scared me but i didn't feel threatened necessarily.  the next day i told one coworker what had happened and we walked in together and showed him where the event took place. the hangar is 150'x 200' this being made in around the entire hangar in the time is took me to walk quickly about only 50'-65'! we also walked back by the plane i saw it next to and decided it was around 9'-10' tall. i definitely saw the legs clearly up to probably just below the waist. the color was unmistakably grayish green and i could tell it was skin not clothing. the legs were long and skinny and they were the same size above and below the knee. i did not see torso/head or arms it was behind the plane. i did clearly see it walk and turn to the south and legs bending and stepping. i was more fixated on the legs and i could have seen the feet but i did not. it made no sound.\r\n weather was clear and no wind\r\n\r\n21 days later on 5/4/17 @ 0010:\r\nsame hangar while cleaning aircraft my phone that was playing music stopped after hearing strange talking on the other side of the plane i was working on. i walked over and nobody was there and the phone had full signal. so i thought ok pushed play on the phone again music started up and walked to the side of the plane again. i was pretty much in the center of the hangar at this point when all of this sudden the entire hangar started ringing exactly like a crystal meditation bowl!! it was so loud and i could actually feel it in my body so not only did i hear this i felt it! the sound was traveling around the hangar in a counterclockwise direction above me towards the ceiling atop the side walls of the hangar. it rang beautifully for about 20 seconds or so and then when it stopped i realized my phone was turned off again. so i turned my music back on again after that no more events that night and phone worked fine. after further investigation on my part i found the exact tone was f. the heart chakra note. so amazing i wish i could experience that again!\r\nweather: was clearing after storm had moved about 25-30 miles to the south. no wind\r\n\r\n12 days later on 5/16/17 @ 2035:\r\ntook portable speaker into same hangar and played the recording of f tone from a crystal meditation bowl and immediately got a very strong feeling of a presence!! again every hair on my body was standing on end as i walked around playing the tone on a speaker. for some reason i got the idea to play monks chanting om at 432 hz so i did and instantly my goosebumps went away and i never felt anything again that night. super strange! so i left the hangar without incident.\r\nweather partly cloudy and windy\r\n\r\n2 days later on 5/18/17 @ 2035:\r\ntook coworker with me into same hangar and both of us heard the f tone faintly. we both walked around and tried to find a source but could not explain it. coming from top of the hangar. \r\nweather clear no wind\r\n\r\n1 day later on 5/19/17 @ 2130:\r\ncoworker and i went in again and heard and felt nothing.\r\nweather cloudy and windy\r\n\r\ni sure wish i knew what was happening!!! can beings communicate using tones and vibrations?

some friends. i looked out of my balcony and noticed an extremely bright light in the sky, quite low. initially i had assumed it to be a star which was burning unusually bright. however, on closer inspection, i was convinced that the object wasn't outside the earth's atmosphere. it was very low, appearing below the clouds and also hovering at an altitude much lower than aeroplanes. also, i made a conscious effort to look for other stars and the moon, but this object was the only bright thing in the sky. i could not see any other stars and i could not see the moon. the object was so bright that if you looked at it for more than a few seconds, it would leave a blind spot in my vision. as i observed the object, i noticed tentacles or appendages that seemed to be made from frozen/static electricity. the object seemed to be a mushroom or triangle shape with a base. the object did not move, it hovered in a fixed position and i observed it for almost 2 hours, even as the sun began to rise. it was still visible in the sunlight but slightly harder to see. my initial reaction was curious, but when i became convinced it wasn't a star, i became fearful. i had honestly never seen anything like it. i attempted to message a couple friends so that i'd have some additional witnesses, but being 5am, everyone was asleep. eventually i went to bed (around 7am) and the object was still there, but seemed further away (it may have been the impact of the sunlight on my vision which made it look smaller). when i woke up a few hours later, the object had disappeared. i managed to take a few photos and a video, but being an iphone camera, i wasn't able to capture anything close to the amount of detail i observed with my own eyes. i also tried sketching the object but i'm not very good

clearly rotated on itself. the rest of the time, it \"built up\" even more mist, to the point when it appeared thicker than a cloud, after that, heading in a ne direction, it disappeared leaving a
