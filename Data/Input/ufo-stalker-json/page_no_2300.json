not an absolute distance). there is an old barn within ~200 feet of our home that sits in the southwest corner of the open field. as the object moved away from our property, it reached the area of the barn and hovered briefly. it then slowly moved away toward the northeast, and suddenly disappeared. it appeared to the girls that the object was approximately the width of 2 houses in size.\r\n at 2:08am, near the far east edge of the field, 2 similar objects suddenly \"winked on\" and moved around one another for a brief period. they appeared to be the same types of objects as the one that moved over our home. just as suddenly as they appeared, they seemed to \"wink off\" and disappear.\r\nat 2:10am, a new set of flashes were visible over the house, and they were similar in nature to the first set. as the girls watched, a much larger, and louder (humming) object moved over the crest of our home, following the same path that the first one did. this one appeared identical in every way, with the exception that it was so large that as it dipped over our home, the edges were not immediately visible. it had to move beyond the barn for the entire object to be seen. it was easily double or more the size of the first object. as it moved west to east, it slowed over the field, and then slowly seemed to rotate over a fixed area, and remained there for approximately 3-5 minutes. it was possible to see strobing lights on all 3 corners of the object, but the 3 lights in color were only visible on the ���back��� edge of the object. as the object sat in place, the 2 objects that had been sighted at 2:08 suddenly lit back up and began to move around, as if in response to the larger object close to our home. this continued for the last couple of minutes that the large object hovered. with no warning, all three objects just disappeared. it looked as though the smaller objects streaked away to the left and right of the large one, and that the large object lifted straight up, out of sight. the two girls described their thoughts and feelings as though they were transfixed and unable to really do anything but watch. they debated whether to wake either myself or my husband, but were concerned that they may not be believed, especially after time had passed and no more objects were visible. the one thing that they did notice was police sirens in the vicinity (i did hear those), and they wondered if they were in any way responding to the objects. \r\n the open field is sort of unusual in that it is sort of \"land-locked\". it has very busy roads on 2 sides, and has houses and suburbs on all 4 sides. if you didn't live next to it, you would not be aware that it is even there. considering it's size, that is really unusual. \r\n a very short distance from the field, near the south-eastern corner are at least 3 bar/club businesses and a bowling alley, all of which would have closed at ~2am. if anyone was leaving them (this was a friday pm/saturday am time period) they should have been within eyesight of  some or all of the objects. the only variable that i am uncertain of is the cloud cover/fog placement. even when the objects were above the cloud/fog line, the rhythmic strobing was visible. \r\n i have repeatedly asked questions of my daughter in different ways to verify details (and to a lesser extent her friend - she had to leave), and the story has remained consistent. i believe her - and that was before i had a chance to read/learn about all the other sightings near our area. we are very interested in verification of the sightings, and if anyone else saw anything similar. please get back with us if you learn anything, or we can do more.\r\n\r\n[please note - though we don't want it posted publicly, entering our address into google maps will show you the field in relation to our home. in the lower left corner of the field is the barn and a dark, teardrop-shaped pond.]\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface,  Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":14871,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.5227976,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01102009-0015","longitude":-84.3940363,"occurred":1231581900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1231581900000,"summary":"3-4 \"humming\" triangular crafts nearly at ground level in middletown, ohio.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Middletown, Ohio","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:278360"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Sheffield","country":"United Kingdom","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The object was viewed at c. 6.05 pm on by my wife and i.  we were walking our dog near the junction of folds lane and dalewood road in the beauchief district of sheffield, england, when we saw a bright, orange illuminated object pass overhead. it appeared to be silent, and was travelling below the cloud base on a south south west to north north east heading.  it wasn't possible to estimate speed but it appeared to be moving quickly at a uniform rate. it left no con-trail that we could see, although it was dark. the object passed out of our line of sight behind trees.\r\n\r\nweather conditions: cold (c. -2 degrees centigrade), clear, relatively low wispy clouds.\r\n\r\nthere was nothing specific that attracted our attention to the sky, we both seemed to notice the object at the same time.  we didn't know what the object was, but in the way that it moved it didn't resemble a fixed or rotary wing aircraft.  we simply observed it until it passed out of sight.\r\n\r\nmy reason for reporting this sighting is that this is the second time we have observed an object fitting this description in recent weeks.  the first sighting took place mid-afternoon on christmas day in the same area of sheffield as my wife and i returned home after walking the dog. on this occasion we were walking on dalewood road, roughly east to west.  the object appeared bright against the grey sky to the north west.  it appeared to move slowly southward, rising slightly as it did so. it then appeared to move slowly back and forth. at this point it passed out of sight behind trees as we walked, but in the seconds that it took to regain a clear line of sight, it had disappeared completely.\r\n\r\nweather conditions at the time were grey and overcast.

i never smoke in my house.  it was dark outside and there were no lights on, in or outside of my house.  however the moon was rather full so i could somewhat see my surroundings.  i was staring up at the moon which was in the westward direction and my dog was at the fence also in the west side of the yard.  i was about half way through my cigarette when i had the feeling that someone was watching me from behind.  when i turned around i could see the outline of what appeared to be a person standing by the corner of my house near the fence and he/she seemed to be facing me.  immediately the figure started to run away from my house towards the back of the property (only about a 15 to 20 foot distance) when my dog heard its footsteps and ran towards it.  thinking that it was someone that shouldn't be in my yard i ran back into my house through the sliding glass door but left the door open so i could attempt to call my dog inside fearing for his safety.  as soon as my dog reached the figure, it flew straight up into the air at a height of approximately 10 feet and then flew directly to the far back edge of the property and either landed on the fence or hovered directly over it for about 2 minutes.  i could see the outline of what appeared to be either wings or some type of a cloak.  i love my dog very much but was too scared to let go of the door in fear that the figure would come towards me.  after a minute i realized that i could turn on the back yard light and did so. as i did i could barely see the figure as it went over the fence.  my dog continued to paw at the fence as i called for him to come inside.  after about a minute of calling him he came inside and i went directly upstairs to wake my girlfriend and tell her about what had just happened.  i am twenty nine years old and for many years i have believed in the possibility of extraterrestrials visiting earth.  i only say this because i have often thought about how i would react if i ever had an encounter. every time i thought about it, i imagined that although it may be a little scary, overall i would be thrilled.  i don't know if this figure was from this planet or not but either way, i assure you that i have never been more frightened in my life.  i don't know if what was in \"my\" yard was there for a reason or merely by coincidence, but i am sure that i will be smoking my cigarettes in the garage from now on.  unfortunately my dog will have to brave the night time bathroom breaks with me watching safely from my house, but he doesn't seem too scared.  i know that this is not the traditional type of ufo sighting, but i didn't know who else to contact.  i don't wish for any type of publicity what so ever, but would greatly appreciate any feedback possible.

to me to be three dimensional.  i looked to the east and could see several planes flashing in the distance coming toward o'hare airport.  i once again realized there was no flashing of these lights,

(jan.7th 2009) at 6:23am. what i saw was very comparable to the 2 times that i intentionally planned and viewed the station over the last two years. the object was within the edge or just above the atmosphere and it glowed appx. 5 times more brightly than the space station making it very, very large in mass. it travelled north to south at tens of thousands of miles per hour as any object would at such altitude. it was easy for me to tell that it was within or just outside the atmosphere by the familiar glowing, hazy yellow/amber glow as apposed to a typical light emission in the troposphere. it moved in a line, steady and in pace with an object that would reside or travel many miles above the earth's surface. this craft was huge! i say craft because of it's intentional pace and direction unlike a meteor. i walked out to my car, eyes to the skies as usual���and there it was. i live on the south side of our town. the predawn starlight was brilliant and aside from a lot of atmosphere turbulence (twinkling stars are a good way to tell), it was clear to slightly hazy. the object was visible for about 30+ seconds. i ran and grabbed my binoculars and got a good glimpse of its circular shape. spherical or disk, i couldn���t tell for sure, circular for certain. i tried to work our expensive, zoom able camera and i could not take the shot. the camera turned on but it wouldn���t snap the photo. the object faded from sight drastically. i was about 20 degrees from being directly below it and when it came to a certain spot in the sky, it seemed to continue on horizontally as apposed to continuing on with the earth's curvature. i need to learn how to set it quickly for night shooting���it was operator error; i don't believe it was due to any other

angles (up/down, back/forth, hover, etc). after only a few minutes minutes, it traveled north (very quickly) and out of sight. from my vantage point, looking eastward from my second floor bedroom window, it seemed to be roughly following the delaware river. several days later i heard my sister's friend (a neighbor [16ish] from across the street) telling the story of her sighting to her

spherical white object the size of a golf ball in the southern sky moving in a northwesterly direction.  initially i assumed it was star, but upon further examination it was not that high in the sky.  i kept driving and the more i watched the object it seemed strange.  it was one solid light with no other lights around it.  i called my father to tell him what i was looking at because by this time i had been watching it for 10 minutes.  he started to ask me how big, how high the object was.  it was hard to say and then an obvious commercial airplane flew behind and above the object.  being a commercial airliner i assume that it might have been flying at 30,000 ft and was maybe 30-50 miles away, the object i would guess at an altitude of 5,000 feet and 5-10 miles away.  a size comparison if the airplane was anywhere from 80-220ft in length the object had to have been i guess at 50-100ft.  the object was still traveling in a northwest direction in the southern sky from my perspective, it seemed to be a moving roughly the same pace as me for 25 miles.  as i continued to watch and drive the object for several minutes appeared to be in the shape of a boomerang, i assume this was because of the angle i was viewing it from.  i was driving to burlington, ia so i exited onto 34west in galesburg, il.  for 25-30 minutes i had been watching this strange object and i felt compelled to call 911 not out of fear, but for the desire that if this was ���something��� i wouldn���t have been the only one to see it.  i pulled over on the highway and did call galesburg���s 911 and they did say they would send a car to check it out.  i continued to drive and was in between galesburg and monmouth, il heading west.  i pulled over again because the object was directly in front of me and was much closer than it had been before.  i got out of my car to see if i could hear any noise and it was silent.  i did also at that time call my father again and had him get a phone number for mufon from their website, i briefly talked with someone and told them what i was seeing.  the object at this time appeared it was maybe 3-5 miles away and maybe 2000-4000ft in altitude.  i got in my car and continued trying to get a closer view, but the object then increased its distance from me.  i arrived in monmouth and stopped at a gas station to view the object so i could have a stationary point of reference.   the object appeared further away and was either stationary or traveling away from me.  i started to question what i was seeing wondering if my eyes are playing tricks on me is it just star, so i went into the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  when i came out the object was still in the same place, i started to question myself again, am i just looking at venus or some other star.  i got back onto the highway again and the object appeared to come closer again briefly.   within seconds the object gained greatly in altitude and distance disappeared into the sky heading northwest and into orbit.  this sighting lasted overall 70-85 minutes. while i was on the highway of course there was traffic and maybe some other people saw it also, i hoped that driving 50mph when the speed limit was 65mph some people might notice the object also.  this was a very crazy sighting of something i can���t explain.

i know altiudes and types of jets. as i observer jet at 11 oclock high i noticed a flach out of the corner of my eye at 1 oclock. i turned to look and to my amazement this huge disc was just sitting up there. i know that it was above jet because its con trail went under disc. the disc was so large you could put 6 jet in its disc. hard to say how high above jet disc was. on size of disc on the

girlfriend. i had the first sighting about 8:00pm when i thought a police helicopter was coming over someone���s house we were parked in front of, my girlfriend was inside , my feet were propped up on the dash of the truck, and i saw the lights coming over the house. i got out the truck to get a better look, there was no noise from this light. i noticed there were two of them. suddenly they zoomed close as if going 1,200 mph and froze within several hundred feet ahead, and about one hundred feet above me. they had spot lights, windows, and bright. we got anxious, and left after my girlfriend saw them. later on that night at my brothers i began looking out the window, and found those glowing colorful lights as in the account recently posted on this site. we watched lights all night long. there were sparkles in the distance, there were red amber contrails passing right ahead of the house as if a huge glowing comet flew by, only inside the head it was shaped like a disk, but nothing there as if invisible, then was gone in a blink. we got in the car, and went to the river where it was very dark, away from the city lights. we watched many bright lights move, they look almost like stars. one especially we watched bob up and down, and all around behind the trees. we decided to leave, and the light followed us home. at this point we began flashing our car lights at the object and it responded with bright colors. after about 6:00am we saw a saucer object pass directly over our car, it had no lights on and disappeared in the distance, it made no noise. another object saucer shaped passed over the house at about 85 feet up in the sky, we hung out the dormer window and watched delta shaped lights blink from the back to front in repetition, it made no sound, and sped away very fast. there were lights everywhere that night, things that us three will never be able to fully understand, or explain. the last sighting was at about 7:30am, we were all upstairs, my brother peeking out of the dormer window looking for anything else. the sun was up by this time. he looked left ( due north) and said, ���what the hell is that?���. i looked out and saw a saucer wobbling, and hovering above the trees. we told my girlfriend to get up and look, and when she hung her head out, and saw it she closed her eyes and looked straight ahead stating that she didn���t want to see anymore, she had seen enough, she was scared, and at disbelief. me, and my brother continued to watch it though. it was silver, about 80 feet across, had two lights blinking on the top, orange, and red. the saucer wobbled as it moved, the outer part spinning as the center part was stationary. it moved up and down over the trees, and didn���t make a noise, it was approximately 300 yards away. the whole time it moved we heard shotguns going off, people were shooting at it, as hunting season is still in right now in statesboro. i estimate we heard gunshots non-stop for four whole minutes, they were either scared, or upset people, it sounded like a war zone. it finally vanished bobbing up, and down over the trees, at very low altitude, we don���t know where it went from there. the gunshots stopped and no one saw it again after it hit a open area (?), dipped down, and shot up at a high rate of speed is my guess, it was dead quiet after all this passed. we saw some triangle shaped objects the next night and some other strange lights, but nothing like monday night, tuesday morning. i���ve always believed in ufo���s and the fact we are not alone, but my girlfriend didn���t. she believes now, and doesn���t look at me crazy anymore. i���ll never forget that night. we keep our eyes to the stars now, they might not really be stars. i can���t fully explain the sights, and emotions we all felt, to really know, to see, the questions left in your head, feeling like you���re crazy. we weren���t drinking or high. you almost want to suppress it in your mind, it���s too much all at once.
