makes most things, including planes and stars in the sky almost impossible to see. the cloud cover was also relatively thick so in order for something to be as bright was it was says something about

maybe the size of an suv. i couldn't see a shape, just a white spotlight. after staring at it for 2-3 minutes or so it just started moving away (that's the best i can describe it's motion) in the sky

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was the summer of 1982.   i was 14, living in eliot, maine - a small town across the river from portsmouth, new hampshire.  our house was empty, as we were moving to alaska that week, and the movers had already taken our belongings.  it was dusk, and i was upstairs in my room, laying in my sleeping bag, listening to the radio, and looking out of the window which no longer had curtains.  suddenly i saw a black, geometric object zig-zagging rapidly in the air above the treeline of the woods behind my house.  its distance from me at this point was about 1.5 football field lengths away.  the zig-zag motion reminded me of an air hockey puck, with seemingly instantaneous changes in direction.  even weirder was that it seemed to disappear and reappear during its trajectory - seeming to 'skip over' parts of it's travel.  it was zig-zagging, but its general direction of travel was towards me.  the object kept its height in the air constant, about 5 feet above the trees.  i got up and kneeled at the window to get a better look, but could no longer see it.  the way it moved made the sight seem unreal, and i stayed kneeling by the window for a few minutes to try to see the object again, but did not.  i could not comprehend what i had seen. \r\n\r\nas i started to look away from the window to go back to laying down, out of the corner of my eye, i noticed the object right outside the window, perfectly still, and silent.  it was at the height of my window on the second story, and only 20 feet away.  it looked like it was made of metal, a dull gun-metal black, with no windows, lights, doors or seams of any kind, but it did have a few small protrusions which looked like instrumentation - giving me the impression the object was some sort of machinery, rather than just a geometric shape.  it was the approximate size of an automobile.  it's shape was a sort of trapezoid - a square or rectangle 'front' and a larger square or rectangle in the back, so the craft tapered from the back to the front. \r\n\r\ni had absolutely no fear of the object - only curiosity as to what it was i was looking at.  i got to observe it for about 4 seconds, then it left in an instant.  it left so fast, that i could just barely tell that it left in a direction, rather than just disappearing.  the object left in the opposite direction it came from.  and though the craft seemed to have a front and a back, it did not turn around before reversing its direction.\r\n\r\nthere was no electromagnetic interference or missing time, as evidenced by the music on the radio.  when the song on the radio ended, the dj came on saying that he was getting inundated with calls about some object seen in the air.  i called the radio station as well, and told the dj that i too had seen the object, but that was as much as i told him.\r\n\r\ni have never heard any other ufo report describing a craft shaped like this.  my whole life, i rarely thought about this experience.  not until recently, when i saw a show on ufo's describing the same flight characteristic, did i really start to think about my experience, and realize that what i saw was a ufo. \r\n\r\ni am an engineer now, and so understand that this craft displayed flight characteristics which defy our understanding of physics.  it had no wings or control surfaces of any sort, and was entirely silent.  it didn't need to move to stay aloft.  it seemed unaffected by gravity or inertia.  it had the ability to change speed and direction instantaneously, and it had sit motionless in the air. \r\n\r\nsupposedly, there were a lot of people who saw this craft and called that radio station that night.  i'm hoping that there are records of this event somewhere.\r\n\r\nmilitary bases are nearby.  there were no helicopters or other aircraft in the area.  weather was clear, light levels were still adequate to get a good look at the craft.  there were no smells or sounds, nor any pictures or video taken that i know of.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14815,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.1531427,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01072009-0011","longitude":-70.8000544,"occurred":392713200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maine","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":392713200000,"summary":"Ufo

it isn't debris.  i'll leave it to you, to be the judge on what these might be.\r\n1. where were you and what were you doing at the time?  riding as a passenger, going to a doctor's appointment in abilene.\r\n2. what made you first notice the object?  i didn't notice the objects until today, after i began looking at the photo.\r\n3. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?  first thought came to mind was \"balloons\" but i've seen balloons in the air before and though they could be, i feel that they aren't.\r\nas for the other questions, i can't describe what i never saw until now and my first reaction when i did finally look at the photo today, was, \"omg!\"","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":14810,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.4527864,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01072009-0006","longitude":-99.7238439,"occurred":1213193400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval,

half hour later at work, i happened to look out the window at work (i work on the 50th floor of a bld in midtown) when i saw that same object hovering in the direction of new jersey.  i looked away briefly to say something to the person next to me and it was gone when i looked back.\r\n\r\nshortly afterwards a helicopter flew from behind a bld seemingly much closer to me.  if there was something that was not supposed to be there, perhaps the pilot saw it too, and perhaps he or she is reading this now.\r\n\r\ni might have dismissed this had i not seen the same object again on the other side of

georgia. we pulled over to stop and have a cigarette break between two open fields of cotton, with a wooded area further up ahead of us beyond the road, and we were admiring the clouds. the weather forecast had indicated a front moving in from the northwest, and the clouds were moving very quickly across the night sky. we were catching quick glimpses of the stars behind the clouds as they passed by and conversing about the coming week of school for us. \r\n\r\nas we were watching, suddenly an orb appeared from the direction the clouds were moving towards, and began to slowly move against the wind, in the opposite direction of the cloud movement. it was rather slow, but gradually moved across the sky just above the clouds. we followed it as it moved from just above the horizon in the distance, until it was right above us. \r\n\r\nas we were watching this, we were all excited and bewildered. we thought it may be a type of plane from the local air force base in warner robins, a mere 30 minute drive by car. but we concluded it certainly was not a plane of any kind, and one of my friends [who is involved with aviation] assured us it was certainly not anything he'd ever seen before. we watched the light as it moved, and then i noticed that there were more of these spherical lights approaching. and sure enough, more and more lights, which were bigger than stars and kind of pulsating, moved in the opposite direction of the clouds in our direction, and then overhead and past us.\r\n\r\nwe watched, waiting for another break in the low cloud cover to give us a better glimpse of them all, and one of my other friends noticed the lights were moving closely together, in what appeared to be a perfect triangle. we got to see this better when the clouds broke for a moment, and we saw what appeared to be more than one perfect triangular shapes of light. we all were pointing out a separate triangle in the sky and were amazed at the quickness these appeared from the orbs we'd just seen. each one had a lighted orb making up the corner, forming a perfect triangular shape. and they moved together, still moving against the wind and the clouds. \r\n\r\ni thought about this rationally and couldn't come up with an explanation, as i could plainly see the stars in their unmoving state, while these objects were moving quite readily across the night sky. and then when the clouds broke and we all could make out the shapes, we noticed they blocked out the stars above them as they passed by. they were massive objects, perhaps even forming into a single giant formation or craft or something. but we all watched as we saw the constellation of orion slowly black out as this thing passed above us. \r\n\r\nat this point we were all pretty much amazed, and kind of freaked out that we were witnessing this as it happened. suddenly there was a small flash of what appeared to be orange light through the clouds behind the object we could make out in the cloud break. as we watched it, the lights pulsed and then quickly moved off into the approaching cloud cover. they moved much faster than they did before. we all heard a low hum followed by a type of high-pitched whining noise as this happened; and when the clouds cleared again within 30 seconds, there was nothing at all but the few stars we could see to the horizon. immediately after this happened there was a massive gust of wind that was much stronger than the previous wind we'd been experiencing. it died down within a minute or so back to what it was like before.\r\n\r\nwe waited to see if we could see anything else, but there was just the quickening cloud cover and the stars as a backdrop to a fleeting experience. we continued to smoke, and after a few minutes of not seeing anything else decided to get back in the car and head back to the dorms of our school. needless to say we all saw something, and we believe it may have definitely been some type of ufo. but we all witnessed it and upon thinking carefully and rationally about it can't come to a adequate explanation to explain what we saw.

in the cleveland metroparks south chagrin reservation. as i approached harper ridge picnic area, i noticed a very bright, white light in the west-south west sky. \r\n     i had originally seen and reported this same type of light back in june of 2008 but during that incident the light dimmed and within ten seconds or so was gone and did not return. \r\n     i thought to myself that it would be weird if this light went out like the light in '08 and just to see what would happen i shined the spotlight of the patrol car i was driving at the light. when i turned off the spotlight, the light in the sky dimmed and went out. i immediately turned around and drove into harper ridge, parked and grabbed my video camera, cell phone and binoculars. \r\n     for approximately the next ten to twelve minutes the light in the sky randomly dimmed, went out completely and came back on, all while remaining motionless. when the light would go out it would come back on in the same place. at times the light was so bright that it lit up the clouds surrounding it(like the moon on a cloudy night), although these \"flares\" seemed to be the exception rather than the rule; the light mostly stayed the brightness of a bright star. whenever it dimmed and went out there were no other lights in that area either flashing or steady. through binoculars the light appeared to have a definite center and did not look like a spotlight or diffused light from below.\r\n     after about ten to twelve minutes i decided to drive to a nearby golf course that provides a clearer view of the sky. while driving to the course, the light was out of my view and by the time i got there(about 5 mins), the light was gone. i stayed at the course for about another 30 mins but the light did not return. i called my wife and my sister to have them witness this event while i was at harper ridge but neither could see the object from where they were. \r\n     i was able to capture about two and a half minutes of video of this object. in the videos, the light is visible above and to the right of lights from the city of solon. even though the sky was not very cloudy and was bright that night, in the videos the sky is just black. also, the light starts to dim toward the end of both videos(after the first it stayed out for about 30-45 seconds then came back; after the second i drove to the golf course) but neither video catches the light coming back on. \r\n     just a note of caution, if the audio comes through you may hear some coarse language from me. if you're offended by that you may want to lower the volume on your computer.\r\n     ","distance":"Over One
