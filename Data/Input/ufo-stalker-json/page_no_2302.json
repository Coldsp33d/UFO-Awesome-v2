). as i opened the door to the van fast moving lights caught my eye and i looked up.  across the street from my house is an empty field with a treeline at the farthest end of it which faces my house. there were two very bright round looking balls of light flying at a very high rate of speed, one directly in front of the other. i looked as hard as i could to see what details i could see which was difficult because they were moving so fast.  i saw no blinking lights at all and looked for these intensely because there is a lot of air traffic in this area and wanted to be certain of what i was seeing.  also there was absolutely no noise being made by these lights which i am almost always able to hear on planes( sometimes the planes noise is heard before the plane is in sight and sometimes long after the plane has been seen ).  but i heard no noise from these lights at any time before, during, or after they were in my field of vision.  it happened so quickly and they were only witin my sight for 20 seconds or so.  i was trying to make some kind of sense of what they could be especially when i first saw them.At first i thought maybe they were flares of something \" fired \" by someone but it became clear that these objects were flying under their own power.  for the time i was able to see them, they stayed in their \r\nconfiguration one in front of the other until i couldn't see them anymore.I can't say how far away the were because i am terrible with measuring in this way, however i could show someone.  i went into my house and told my significant other and our friend what i had seen and described to them exactly what i had seen. the sky tonight is very gray and overcast with light snow falling. there are no stars or moon out tonight.  when i take my dog out i always look at the sky and have become very familiar with how it normally looks and what is usual to be in it.  these objects were not usual. i feel as though i have witnessed something not

(i had traveled this road many times traveling from yakima to see my father who lived in othello, after the my parents divorce.)  because of this straight road, i felt that i could put the pedal to the metal and remember going 90 mph.  i was driving my 1960 continental \"boat.\"  i remember thinking that if something happened and i was forced off the road, all i needed to do was keep the wheels straight and i would be ok.  i felt safe in this \"boat.\"  \r\n\r\nthe first part of this two-part memory was related to seeing a \"object\" in the air in front of me, just off the road.  it appeared out of nowhere and my first thought was that it was a helicopter, but the lights weren't right.  i sped up in order to get closer look, but the object stayed in the same relative position; just off the road about 100 feet to 100 yards ahead.  (it's hard to say how far without knowing it's size.)  the object was a \"cigar\" shape with light around the middle.  the lights seemed to be traveling around the center of the object , from left to right, instead of flashing like a plane or chopper would.  the lights weren't the same as an aircraft.  more like \"chasing\" christmas lights of many colors.  i can remember leaning forward and peering throught the windshield in order to get a better look and asking my friend bob, \"can you see that?\"  i don't remember his response.  suddenly, the object appeared to vanish although, i seemed to think that it instantly disappeared over the ridge to the north.  that's what my first memory consisted of.\r\n\r\nthe second memory happened in the same place at the same time, but \"felt\" separate from the first event.  in this memory, i can remember traveling at a high rate of speed, 90 plus, when suddenly my headlights went off.  that's when i felt that if i just kept the steering wheel straight and didn't over correct, we would be ok.  when the lights went out, i remember applying the breaks, not radically, but deliberately.  i breaked, and then somemore, when the headlight suddenly came back on.  at that time, i let off the breaks and must of decided to go on.  when i did, the lights again went off.  i then dedided that it would be best that i got off the road because without lights, another car may slam into me.  i didn't want that, so when the lights came back on, i looked for a place to get off the road.  when i did, i noticed a \"field access\" road to the north of the road that entered a alfa-alfa field.  my lights went off again, then just as we got to the field the lights came back on in time for me to drive into the field.  the lights worked perfectly after that.  i remember bob and i getting out of the car and feeling the immediately need to \"pee.\"  i can't really say, how long we were in the field, but seem to remember getting into yakima much later that the hour or less it should have taken us to get there.\r\n\r\ni have wanted to report this incident for many years, but decided to report it after seeing a history channel show on mufon.  i know it is a long time after the event, but wanted to add it to your database of sightings.  perhaps there were other siteings at that same time that would colaberate my report.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with directional

the sky that is difficult to explain.  i was on my apartment stoop smoking a cigarette when my neighbor, who was just coming home after parking his car in our complex���s lot, called my attention to something around the corner of the building.  i moved to share his line of sight and immediately saw an equilateral triangle composed of six red lights.  the lights shone at approximately -2.5 magnitude and covered an area of roughly 9 square degrees in the sky.  three lights marked each of the triangle���s corners, and three others were arranged outside around them, forming a larger triangle, equal in proportion and orientation to the inner one.  as i watched, the individual points were in motion with respect to each other, but the group appeared to hang motionless in the southwest sky.  at this point, the approximate alt-az of the lights was 160���(sse) by 35��� elevation.  \r\n\r\ni ran inside and retrieved my 6x30 image stabilized binoculars to get a better look.  the formation had shifted to an irregular lambda shape of five or six lights when i came back outside.  through the binoculars, the lights appeared as tiny points against a backdrop of clouds illuminated by nearby morristown.  they were clearly below the cloud deck compared to airplanes elsewhere in the sky at the time, and appeared to be separate objects in no way connected by a larger structure.  they moved steadily in ascending, lateral, and descending directions in a manner that seemed to display deliberate coordination, but there was no noticeable sound of aircraft.\r\n\r\ni returned inside again and readied my digital camera after waking my fianc���.  by the time i started collecting video, the visible lights had been reduced to three or four and had moved to approximately 130���(se) by 20��� elevation and the formation covered less than the area of the full moon.  by this time, eight minutes had passed from when i originally observed the lights.  my fianc��� and i watched them, with two of my neighbors, as they hung low in the southeast sky, flickering in a tiny triangle.  they shifted into a straight line before the individual lights began to rapidly descend beyond tree line one by one.  one or two could still be seen hovering near the horizon in the distance before they vanished, leaving only a solitary beacon remaining higher up until it abruptly faded.\r\n\r\nif the lights had not ascended during this event, i would have been fairly certain they were some kind of aviation flares, but i cannot confirm, as i am not familiar with that sort of thing.  \r\n\r\ni have attached two avi files enhanced to show lower light levels..\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

dog had alerted them to a formation of 5 red lights in the sky while he was out doing his business. the group of red lights were also in formation and when i saw them, but they dropped from 5 to 3 to 1 very quickly each shooting off in a separate direction. i have video of 2 of them together which i hope to upload and it is exactly like what event id 14785 described. they were floating like nothing i've ever seen. it looked like the lights of each craft were vertical with one light on top and one light below almost like a vertical bar with lights just at the tips. point of reference, i grew up 500 yards from a heli-pad and live 2 miles from the morristown, nj airport. i see normal air traffic all day and night everyday. these were not planes or helicopters or like anything i've ever seen.\r\n\r\nwatched one zig zag away with the solid red light occasionally going dark and then popping up elsewhere all lit up again. lights did not flash in typical aircraft fashion and they really did just \"float\" and not move in typical straight lines.\r\n\r\nthe event ended with one craft coming back over me and changing to all white lights. it shifted direction very quickly and jumped around a bit before going dark and heading west over giralda farms.\r\n\r\ncalled the madison,nj pd and they said they had some reports of \"something\" by the airport but had nothing else to say. parents called the morris township police who said they had received many calls. township police spoke to the morristown police who said they looked into it and said it was just someone playing a \"prank with flares\". \r\nmaybe it was somehow man made but it was still an incredibly exciting thing to watch.\r\nps\r\nspoke to a friend shortly after and after telling my story he said his brother

leaving a friends house in schuline il. i turned left heading north on chester road toward sparta. the  sparta country club is on your left right before town. as i was driving approaching the club. i glanced toward one of the holes. about sixty feet in the air and not even 150feet from the road. there was a craft plain as day hovering motionless and silent. it was a triangle 60 to eighty feet long per side.And fifteen feet tall. the craft itself was grey maybe charcoal hard to distinguish. once i realized what i saw i slowed down to about 15 20 mph. staring amazed how close it was . it had lights top and bottom. on the bottom there was white solid lights 3 of them. slightly in from each corner.On top there was a red light a third of the way in on one side. opposite of that a third of the way in from the other side. there was a blue light. both of them strobing toward the sky. center of the strobes there was a white solid beam. the beam traveled very high in the sky but there was a end in sight. the beam tapered slightly larger going up. almost like a tree  upside down. at this point i slow to a crawl. as i am about strait across from it. the beam and the strobes on top shut off. at this point i got scared and drove home very fast. i watched it with my head turned backwards as i drove away. my house is only a few blocks away.Untill i was out of sight of it the thing did not move. there is not many things that scare me. and i will be honest i am concerned. but that is not it i have another case. two days later leaving the same friends house. around the same time. i still had the incident in the front of my mind. i decided to go the back way into town on country club road. a mile down from his house i was driving home. and there was no cars behind me. i continue on and about 2miles from his house out of nowhere. a light apears behind me.It was confusing because there was no vehicles behind me. it was a single bright light. i thought must be a four wheeler or dirt bike.As i keep going i start to get annoyed thinking somebody is messing with me. the light is paceing me following about a hundred feet back. there is a number of hills on the road. so i approach one of the hills and when i left the objects sight going down the hill i punched it sped up as fast as my truck would go. thinking i would put some distance on the light.When i came up out of the hill to my suprise the light was the same exact distance behind me as before. now the light has my full attention. so i floored my truck thinking i will out run this thing once and for all. the faster i went the closer it got. now i am running from this thing and it is maybe thirty feet off of my bumper. keeping a perfect pace. nowthis is a rural back road with hills and curves not very wide. and i am running 90 or so and this thing aint losing a inch,and i can flat drive. i am staring in my mirrors and driving crazy looking at this light now i see it is 4to6 feet diameterfocused light. and here is what is really weird. behind the light there was a red almost pin like light appeared. kind of swirling back and forth up and down with almost a tracer effect. but completely in control.It would disapear behind the light and appear on the other side. almost like a eye looking at you. now this crazy ride lasted about 3 or 4 miles. at about the end of the road. there is a underpass or (vieduct?)this is kind of off the subject. but if you have ever watched in the heat of the night the movie and see the car chase under the underpass right before the fight in the turn style train house. that train house used to sit right on the same turn as the underpass.Well at that excact underpass right before it. the light dissapeared as quick as it came. not making a turn or slowing down. just dissapeared. now i dont what this crazy stuff is but it cant be for any good. these are actually not the only times i have seen what i think are ufo's. i have seen two ohter unexplainable sightings just no where near this level of stuff.\r\n  ","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

didn't have to point it out). we watched it travel in a smooth, straight, vertical line, at constant speed, downward, until it passed below the treeline. there was no ensuing flash, sound, percussion wave, fire, smoke, or anything else. it simply disappeared from view beyond the treeline.\r\n\r\ni saw the object for about 8 seconds total. (it took this long to move from the top of the acura windshield to the treeline.) my family saw it for about 5 to 6 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe object was round and bright yellow. it was approx. 10 times too big to be venus or a planet. it was like seeing an indoor/outdoor floodlight shining directly at you from a distance of 100 to 200 feet. it gave off light but not so much as to make you squint or look away. the light was yellowish. the object had no discernible features: just round and solid yellow. it did not change size or brightness and did not trail smoke, sparks, or debris. it was moving too slow to be a meteor (unless it was very large and far away). the motion was straight down, at a constant speed. i have no good way to estimate the distance. it had to be more than a half mile away, because otherwise we would have seen it hit the ground ahead of us. it could have been several miles away. i doubt it was more than (say) 5 or 6 miles away, because then it would had to have been extremely large and would have been seen by many, many people in the greater stamford-norwalk area, possibly even as far away as white plains, ny or the bronx.\r\n\r\ni've been a pilot for 42 years and consider myself an accurate, dispassionate observer of things airborne. what we saw was not a firework, nor (imho) an airplane or a piece of an airplane, nor a balloon, nor a meteor. it didn't seem bright enough to be any kind of flare (and trailed no smoke). but it did appear to emit its own light.\r\n\r\nafter it disappeared from view, we were stunned. we were saying things like \"oh my god, what was that?\" \"what do you think that was?\" when we reached our destination about 3 minutes later, we were still talking about it. we've seen no local news reports on it. it was a cold sunday at dusk with little traffic on the streets and we feel certain very few other people saw this, unless it was further away and much bigger than we think.","distance":"Over One

wife. we were seated, inside a gazebo, looking out over the water right on the beach and it was night time. we were looking at the moon way out over the water because it was very bright that night and the sky was clear, except for a couple clouds to either side. it created quite a neat effect. we had looked up at the moon several times admiring its beauty. my other friends got to talking and when i looked up again i noticed a bright reddish-orange orb to the right of the moon. it was round, very bright, no distinctive markings or movement. being the moon was about full from what i remember, this object seemed to be about one tenth of its size or less from my viewpoint. this object was way out over the water with no other lights, boats, city lights or anything nearby. then, to my surprise, a second or two later the reddish-orange orb appeared way to the left of the moon. it did not travel there, it just disappeared from the one spot and reappeared in the new spot. at this point my friend mark, whom i did not realize had seen this too, asked me, \"did you see that!\" we then watched together the orb appear once more to the lower right of the moon. after that it did not return. the distance/speed would have been incredible for the time involved. we looked for another hour but it never came back. our wives, talking a lot like they do, did not see this event and it happened so quickly. we did not notice any similar lights, boats, or anything else in the area again. there was an airplane that did pass by in the distance with its typical flashing lights shortly thereafter and moved just like you'd expect an airplane would. but not like the orb we saw. my friend later told me he had seen the orb at least one or two more times more right before i had. i had seen the orb three times, he at least four of five. i tried over the months to rationalize the event. the more i thought about it the more it bothered me. i have been to countless air shows and know what aircraft we have and what they can do, fire works shows, and know what powerful laser pointer lights can do too. this event was none of the above. i just can't explain it. there were no sounds and nothing can move at that speed. i finally felt compelled to tell someone just to get this off my chest. i know what i saw and i just cannot discount that. when this happened i was fascinated and very curious. i was not scared nor do i remember any other emotions. there must have been hundreds of people at that time that could have seen this as the beaches are located all along the coast with countless hotels that overlook the water. ideas????","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

evening, but by no means dark.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i had just parked up outside the leasing office of our apartment, in north east atlanta. we were returning home after a late lunch. as i was sat in the car about to get out, i spotted a disc shaped object in the sky to the north. i don't know how i spotted it or what made me look up, because it was virtually camouflaged. grey/metallic in color, against a dull grey overcast sky.\r\n\r\ni turned to my wife, who is somewhat a sceptic on these matters, and said \"ok, tell me that's not a ufo\". she couldn't see anything from her position in the car so we both got out and i pointed to the object in the sky. after about 5-10 seconds she spotted the object. we soon realized there were actually 3 objects, and moments later a forth floated out of a cloud.  \r\n\r\ni was excited to see something that i could not explain, but i tried to keep a calm head and take whatever measurements i could. first of all, there was no noise from the crafts, the were completely silent. i would not guess their size, but if you held a grain of rice at arms length, that's what size they looked in the sky. as for distance, they were very close to the underside of the lowest cloud layer, as the clouds would sometimes obscure them momentarily. they were floating slowly in an north/easterly direction. they moved in formation, never deviating from each other. each disc  wobbled slightly around it's center axis - kind of like if you slowly spun a plate on your finger, how it would wobble up and down whilst rotating.\r\n\r\ni took a picture using my iphone. you can just about make out 4 dots. it doesn't look like a whole lot because the objects were metalic/grey in color, and photographed against a dull grey sky. the phone's sensor isn't clean or sophisticated enough to desipher any major detail, and the fairly wide focal length of the camera makes the objects appear smaller than they were.  i've done some contrast enhancement in photoshop, which brings out the dots a little clearer. despite the image noise and cruddy optics, there is definitely something there.\r\n\r\nleaving my wife observing, i ran inside our apartment to grab my digital slr and binoculars. i was gone approximately 2 minutes. by the time i returned the objects had gone. according to my wife, they just disappeared into the clouds.\r\n\r\ni do not know how long they were in the sky before i spotted them, but we observed them for approximately 5 minutes.","distance":"20 Feet or

for valor in air combat over guadalcanal.\r\n\r\ndeblanc narrates an interesting incident of being guided by ground radar to a radar contact, a \"blip,\" as he flew morning patrol. according to what he'd written earlier on page 153 this incident would have occurred in the vicinity of okinawa where he was then stationed: \"finally we were ordered off ie shima island to okinawa, first to kadena airfield then to chimu. we remained here until the war ended.\"\r\n\r\nthe incident.\r\n\r\nchapter 26\r\nthe atomic bomb\r\n\r\n\"during the first sixteen days of august, there was a nightmare of vectors to \"blips\" on the radar screen which didn't make sense in 1945. i was on morning flight with my division and was to report as usual on station for the two-hour picket patrol over a destroyer at the seven o'clock location. i suddenly received a frantic call from control to buster (aviation terminology for \"full speed\") to a target at 25,000 feet. we were just climbing through 5,000 feet and i had to drop the full belly tank in order to climb rapidly to intercept the enemy. the vector was perfect and i arrived at 25,000 feet in seconds, but there was no enemy. the radar operators said my target was just a mile ahead. i charged the guns and rockets, looked ahead, but saw nothing. just then the radar operators said the target was pulling away at high speed and asked me to advance speed to intercept. the blip was off the radar screen in seconds. nothing we had in those days could travel the full length of a radar screen at that velocity. i laughed and told the operator to stop watching flies on his screen. i even suggested that he check for a leaky capacitor in the horizontal circuit of his scope. this was my first and last encounter with ufos. after august 16, we were not plagued with any more sightings of this nature. all vectors were normal and within the range and velocity of world war ii aircraft.\"\r\n\r\npage

to look to my right and noticed a bright string of lights in an obtuse triangle shaped formation motionless above the giant eagle parking lot. i kept looking back at the road and the object. i was thinking \"what the hell? no! no way! it can't be!\". i'm a real bad judge of height and size but i could tell that the thing was huge and close to the ground. the object was dark, it blended in with the night. as i was looking at it more lights started to appear on the edges of it and it was like the whole of the edges lit up with a flash and then went back to just the lights or maybe it was like light was reflecting off of the edge of it. i started to feel slightly nervous with a sinking feeling in my stomach. i told my friend that i had to go because of something, when she asked what i didn't know what to tell her so i just said \"something! i don't know, i'll call you back!\" i hung up and then had to take my eyes off of it to slow down for the red light and not hit the car in front of me. when i stoped and looked back it was just gone. i then got out of my car at the light and asked the people in the car next to me if they saw it too. they looked nervous and one of the passengers in the back (an older woman) nodded. the light turned green and they sped away. i got back in my car and and made a right at the intersection and parked in the small parking lot for a toco bell restaurant. i called my friend and told her about it and and we talked about what i should do. i made a decision to call the local cops and report it. after about 10 minutes an officer showed up and i tried to tell him about what i saw . he dind't really ask me that many questions. he said that there wasn't really that much he could do because there obviously wasn't anything there anymore. he
