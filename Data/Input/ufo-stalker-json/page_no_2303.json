the sky and was commenting to my wife that i had seen it. then a glow of light coming from the south to southeast moving north to northwest was coming over the hip our house. i said to my wife \"what is that\" and she turned and saw it too.. then it broke up into 5 objects in a somewhat v pattern but with one object not keeping formation but floating behind almost erratic. they were very high but not as high as the satellite, no sound at all, and looked very large for the altitiude they were flying in which many planes just look a speck. the objects had a large rounded front with wings that curved back and a very short tail, like a bump, and seeemingly glowing like angels. they continued to fly off over lake michigan in a northwest direction. it semed they covered the distnce from the indiana border to north of st. joseph, michigan in a matter of seconds, much faster than any normal plane i know.\r\n\r\nafter the sighting i checked a book of military planes i have and not one that matched the shape.\r\n\r\nsomehow i still think these may be military just because of the formation and shape. i saw a program about stealth planes that talked about a plasma shield or barrier that would evade radar, which glows. the part that still baffles me is the speed and no sound coming from engines.","distance":"Over One

wife and i arrived at the coast with our friends and children.\r\nas we were sitting out on the low hanging veranda sipping coffee and\r\ntaking in the smells of the ocean..It was exactly 8:40pm, my wife\r\ntaps me on the shoulder and asks what kind of lights are those? as i\r\nlook in the direction she is pointing...Not high in the sky as the\r\nveranda hangs low... we see two intense bright orange round lights\r\nlike asending up thru a few palm trees... we figured they were approx\r\n150meters away.. i turned to my wife and said (this is as the lights are still raising) probably the tides lodge trying out some fireworks prior\r\nto new years... then the two seperate lights,(which were not far apart\r\nfrom each other as i could see both thru the binnoculars) stopped above\r\nthe tree tops..(we estimated 100 meters above) what astounded myself and the others was the brilliant color..Glowing..Almost felt like looking \r\nat the coals of a very large bonfire..When only the coals remain..And\r\nyou fan them with a wind..Intense color, not an ordinary orange.  we\r\nsaw no other color at all..Only intense brilliant orange.. remember\r\nthis is a crystal clear night without any cloud and their was also\r\nno wind to speak of and no waves crashing on the beach..It is an isolated spot south of the city of tanga.  anyway, we watch these two lights\r\nand as they hoover momentarily i grab my binnoculars..Completely forgot about the camera and i had one too!  as we watch these two objects hoovering im looking at them thru the binnoculars..I have to refocus\r\nas these objects are too close..Middle focus on the glasses. i do not see\r\nanything other than the brilliant orange and let me tell you it was hard\r\nto even look thru the binnocs as the light was intense. back and fourth use.  they probably hoovered for 20 seconds then began coming towards \r\nus..Not directly but headed south south west at a very slow speed. as they\r\ncame over the house we were all amazed as we saw no reflection on the\r\nground and no sound overhead..We could only see the brilliant orange..Like\r\nlooking at two orange full moons on a crystal clear dark night up on the\r\ntop of a mountain...They passed over and continued in the same plane..Not\r\ngoing up or down...As we watched one just vanashed and the other continued\r\nalong until i could no longer see it in the binnoculars.\r\nnext day i asked people at the lodge if they had seen anything..No one had. they said people start their dinners at 8pm so no one was outside or\r\nat the bar.. \r\nin the afternoon i asked the house boy whom lives 100 meters west of the\r\nbeach house if he had seen anything..He responds with excitment..O yes!!\r\nand without me saying anything he tells me in the swahili language that\r\nhe and his wife ran into their house after seeing the first of three orange lights..I said, three? he says yes, there was one ahead of the \r\nlast two. he too said he heard no sound and was dazzled by the brillance\r\nof the color orange.\r\ni and my wife and friends had had no drinks except tea and coffee, we are\r\nnot beleivers in ufo's but what we saw on the 26th december 2008 was \r\nin all our opinion something completely out of the ordinary for each of\r\nus.  the first amazing attribute was its color..Was an intense brilliant\r\ndazzleing orange that none of us have ever seen in the sky.  was so bright\r\ni was sure there would have been some kind of reflection and so low and\r\nslow you would have expected some type of sound...Nothing!!  even looking\r\nthru the binnoculars i could only make out the brillance of orange..Nothing else. as we all walked back into the beach house i thought\r\nabout my camera..Too late!  next time!\r\nto answer your questions:\r\n1. we were renting a beachouse 40 kilometers south of tanga city.\r\n   a place called \"pangani\"  not commercialized at all. we had just\r\n   arrived that afternoon after a six hour drive from where we live\r\n   in the city of arusha, tanzania. \r\n   at the time we were just sitting on a chair with our legs up on\r\n   the short wall sipping cups of tea and coffee..The kids and our\r\n   other friends were also sitting around the outside dinning room table\r\n   that is under the veranda too.\r\n2. as my wife was sipping her tea the brilliant orange coming up thru\r\n   the palm trees cought her attention and thats when she tapped me on\r\n   my shoulder and said \"look\"\r\n3. the object was definately orange and round in shape. size a bit \r\n   difficult but we'd guess probably the same size as when you look\r\n   at a full moon on a clear night. at first we thought it was a \r\n   fireworks shooting up that was going to explode.. than when it \r\n   hoovered and did not expolde we were all amazed..Than the color\r\n   told us this was something unusual.\r\n4. the object was glowing bright brillant orange color, was round and\r\n   not like a disk.. was exactly like the sun looks..And moving like\r\n   that too.. like a ball moving thru the air...Its motions were slow\r\n   with no sound or shadow on ground and if i might say...When it flew\r\n   more or less overhead..It was in focus and i was not wearing my glasses\r\n   which i need for distance.. these two objects as bright as they were\r\n   and as low as they were should have had some sound and reflective light\r\n   on the ground ? again the motion was parallel to the ground when they\r\n   began moving in our direction. its actions were not threatning and \r\n   i or our group was not afraid at any time..We all were just bewildered\r\n   at the brilliance of these two objects. while it moved it stayed in\r\n   a straight parallel path neither raising nor decending and never\r\n   deviating from its trajectory.\r\n5. describe my feelings during and after:\r\n   we were not frightened and neither shocked at the event. just very\r\n   bewildered and amazed at the intense color.\r\n   our actions were to follow it out to the parking area from the veranda\r\n   as it was moving otherwise due to the low hanging veranda we would not\r\n   have been able to continue to watch it.  my action during the event was\r\n   to call our other friends and kids to see it and also to grab my \r\n   binnoculars which were close at hand sitting on the veranda wall.\r\n   feelings after the event: this was not a normal event.. we tried to\r\n   figure out what we saw but we could only come to the conclusion it\r\n   was a ufo.  i my self wanted to figure it out so i have talked to \r\n   many people since trying to make sense of the event. one of those \r\n   people told me to look on the internet as some people report these\r\n   events..So thats why im writting to you.  i have never done this \r\n   before.  after the event we all had a nice sleep and no one was \r\n   worred or scared this object might return etc..\r\n6. how did we lose sight of the object:  i lost sight thru the \r\n   binnoculars, one just vanashed as we watched. the other continued\r\n   in its same trajectory util i could no longer see it thru the \r\n   binnoculars.  the whole event lasted between 3-4 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14765,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-5.069489,"location":null,"logNumber":"TZ-01052009-0007","longitude":39.098759,"occurred":1230352800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tanga","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1230352800000,"summary":"Seven

i thought they were opened minded enough to understand me because we have eached experienced something individually in the past and shared about it, but the most recent paranormal experience was on 6-24-2008 which happened to me and i ended up making a fool of myself and reported to mufon what i should of not reported.\r\n\r\nbecause of that strong bond of trust i had with these two clown friends of mine, one of my \"old\" friends decided to play me with the story i told him, he then added to it and i included it in my report...  i then ended up reporting to mufon that there was an actual tangible alien piece in my posetion from my friend's encounter which i perceived to be the same experience as mine.  this guy, named \"alex\" gave it to me in exchange for a free pc repair on his laptop, which was rather simple.  anyway, he gave me this piece that look convincingly real, but was actually from a show called \"smallville\" which i never watched.  right after i told \"steve\"  that mufon was at my house, he came out with the truth.  he said that alex bought this thing on ebay and used it to trick me into fixing his computer for free.  well, after i found out the truth of it all, i kept his computer ;)\r\n\r\nnevertheless, i did tell my story about the blue light experiences i've had at my address and also about the separate times where i've had some kind of telepathic contact in my sleep with something that was not really from this world- that part was legit. everything is true in the previous story except for the alien octagonal piece.  considering that i had this episode twice (clunking noises in my head which made me feel relaxed) at two separate times, i bought into the hoax... my apologies to mufon for not reporting this event properly.  i really don't know what happened after the \"clunking\" noise in my head...  i just know it happened and that it was not a normal thing and my dogs really did go bizerk.  i am sorry i let us become a laughing stalk on the internet about this.\r\n\r\nlet this be a lesson to anyone reporting to this site: \"any witness to a ufo siting should report their own event and any additional information from another witnesses about the same event should be reported separately by the individual adding the details.\"\r\n\r\naccording to steve, alex paid off steve with a $1,200 professional snap shot zoom camera with all lenses in order to let me go through with this lie.  i then reported good information mixed with bad information to mufon.  mufon came to my house and investigated, i then told steve and the steve felt bad and finally tod ld me the truth about the hoax of that alien piece.  \r\n\r\nso after making a fool of myself on the mufon site, i decided to go ahead and clear the record once and for all about this because mufon will not correct the orginal story and they will not follow through with the investigation they did at my house- they took samples of dirt where grass no longer grows, samples of dried up twigs, and abnormal tree sap from my back yard.  i have never heard the results from mufon simply because of the lie told by my so called \"friends\". sorry mufon.  so i guess they figured that if my there is a flaw in my story, then they figued that the whole report was a lie.  apparently, partial, but whatever.\r\n\r\n\"i finally got this off my chest with the truth about this alien piece\"  sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, i did not stick to my own story.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14764,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0513649,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01052009-0006","longitude":-76.6321112,"occurred":1214290800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Maryland","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

move.So i move my flash light as i was shining it in the direction of this star like object and did a v shape movement and latter after it slowly imiated it in the sky very slowly.During this whole time you could her aipplanes flying by but this object didn't seem to make a sound.I'm kinda amazed and curious as to what it was because it definately was not a helicopter cause it had no runing

this object did not blink on and off, but rather \"pulsed\" very slowly as it moved towards us. it was below the clouds and therefore quite low to the ground. no shape was discernable other than the bright orange/red glow it gave off. the object moved directly towrds my condo building extremely slowly, pausing a bit, and then continuing eastward towards us. as it came directly overhead it slowed.

sliding glass doors. i happened to look outside and this extremely bright light caught my attention, it was almost as if it were a beautiful brilliant diamond sparkling. my chldren looked at it, and we couldn't figure it out, and then all of a sudden it completely disappears!! we were amazed and continued eating dinner and then it appeared again only to disappear after a few seconds, it seemed as if it was hovering and it wasn't too far up in the sky and it certainly wasn't a star. so this continued to happen and then we started freaking out because we have been trying for the life of us to figure out where these strange human size large & small footprints are coming from, we only have seen them twice and its when it snows.  we thought maybe a black bear but the way the tracks are its impossible, we tried thinking of every creature that walks on two feet besides a human or something else, its almost as if the creature whatever it is only either has one leg, or it takes extremely long steps directly in front of each other, because there is no side by side tracks like a human would have, we even tried to follow our dog around to see if she were doing any funny things in the snow and it was impossible, i also spray painted where the tracks are so we can track them, until the snow melts of course. what are these tracks that come from one side of the woods across our backyard into the other side of the woods in the exact same pattern each time it snowed?? we are at a loss and kind of nervous, so seeing these lights didn't make it any better, but it gets better. so after this has been going on for a few hours and is still ongoing as i type this to you at 12am, there have been numerous planes of some sort flying around the area of the light and then it seems as if when the planes get closer the lights disappear.....We even thought we something flash, like a flash of light as if something shot at one another. i kid you not, this is still occurring right now

23. as i approached the state highway patrol office i noticed what looked two strobe on either side of a third, central flashing light in the distance, beyond the tree line of cook's creek golf course. the two strobes would flash 3 times, then the central light would flash once. of course i thought it was a plane, as up and to the right of it were more lights that seem to be headed towards it's location.The highway curves to the right just past the golf course, losing sight of it because of the trees. as i emerged, directly ahead was the lights, sitting completely motionless. as i got closer to it the lights never changed or moved. i decided to turned off 23 and onto north court st. at 84 lumber and go through town and take st rte 56 home.  at this point i was now east of town and as i looked to the west i saw the lights, in the same formation as before. that had me even more suspicious, so i decided to head toward it. i turned onto tarlton rd. and headed west. the closer i got the more i could see that it was near dupont off 23 and was further away than i was willing to drive that night, so i turned south and went the back way home, all the while looking at the lights and they still looked the same from a s/se view point. but that is not craziest part. my best friend worked 2nd shift and did not come to work till 3:30pm. he had no time at all to talk to those that i worked with, as he worked in a different department. as i was about to tell him about it he turned and said \"dude, you will not believe what we saw last night\". he began to tell me that he and another of our friends who worked with us were headed north (from the south of circleville), coming from chillicothe, at almost the exact same time as me. according to him as they approached dupont they saw something over the factory. they pulled over to watch it and said that it began to come toward them. they described lights flashing 3 times in a circle under it with a central strobe light. this is one of about a dozen different encounters i have heard of in the same location.","distance":"Over One

seen any thing like it before, i watched it for a few minutes when it started moving towards the north very slowly. when it moved forward the lights started blinking slowly on and off again, then it

girl off i found that both my mother and sister had seen it also. my mother lives approx 1/2 mi. from where we viewed it. i first noticed the craft because it was enormous and seemed to be

reporting this as i was unaware of the existence of mufon until i saw a tv show about it just now.  oddly it was about numerous ufo's appearing in kokomo indiana on april, 16 2008, and it was very interesting to me as i was in that town on exactly that date.\r\n\r\nthis event happened at night, probably around 21:00 or so.\r\n\r\nmy wife and i were sitting on the front step of the missionary baptist church on blue lick road, in front of htp, just talking about our day.  i was staring at a star as my wife was talking and suddenly noticed i was \"mentally locked onto it\".  her voice seemed to fade into secondary awareness and the star became my primary point of awareness as though i were being hypnotized or entranced by it.  it was an unusual feeling that i have not had before.  then suddenly it began to move slowly.  i asked my wife if she was seeing what i was seeing and she said yes.  we both watched it moving slowly toward us.  i looked at her, and she asked if i thought it may be a ufo, and i said, \"it's not a plane, that���s for sure.\"  we were both very young at the time and i remember making a funny remark, \"if you���re a ufo then prove it.\"  we both just looked at each other and laughed��� but it suddenly stopped as soon as i had finished saying this.  it remained still for a moment and me and my wife looked at each other and just giggled even though we were a bit afraid and amazed.  then, moving extremely fast, it suddenly darted to the left and then came to a sudden and complete stop.  it then darted toward us, horizon to horizon, and just stopped again in less than a second���s time.  it did this again two more times, forming a perfect square in the sky and stopped exactly where it had begun.  we both were amazed by what appeared to be successful communication with it; and neither of us was laughing anymore��� we were excited and astonished.  it then began to move slowly away, and when it reached a certain point, boom it flew away so fast it almost seemed to have disappeared.\r\n\r\ni believe in my mind that there was something like a telepathic link between myself and the phenomenon.  first was the unusual feeling, as if it were getting my attention.  second, it correctly chose to make a square in the sky to prove that it was not a plane or meteor; which is exactly what i would have wanted and expected if someone wanted to prove this to me.  i suppose it knew this telepathically.\r\n\r\nthis is not the last time this event has occurred.  almost a year ago, on a construction project i was working on for a friend, at night about the same time, 21:00 or so, i was looking down at the ground, when i felt the same feeling.  i immediately recognized it and looked up.  my friend was there and saw this take place.  when i looked up, i saw the same thing i saw almost ten years ago, a moving star.  it was if it were tapping me on the shoulder and saying, ���hey, were still watching���.  i then explained to my friend how something very similar had happened to my wife and me years ago.\r\n\r\ni don���t believe or disbelieve that aliens, angles, or whatever it is are visiting us and playing mind games, but i know for a personal fact, from real experience, that the phenomenon is undeniably real.  my feeling, my opinion, is that they are not ���space ships��� but some sort of intelligent living beings.\r\n\r\ni���ve learned to keep this to myself, as others think i am lying or crazy.  words can���t adequately describe the depth of such an experience, and you simply have to see it to believe it.  so i never tell anyone anymore.\r\n\r\nif you want to ���see one���, all i can say is, they are real, they are out there, and i would bet that if you put the right effort into having the experience, you wouldn���t be disappointed.\r\n\r\nthere is a connection between us and them, and they are up to something.  i look for interesting things to take place in the near future.\r\n\r\ni do not wish to be contacted.  i just wanted to share the story with someone who could appreciate it.  if it happens again, i will write again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":14750,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.2615847,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01042009-0027","longitude":-85.7545557,"occurred":817794000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Kentucky","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,

dog. the time was somewhere between 8pm and 9pm. i looked up in the sky to look at  the stars and i noticed a strange object. the object had five lights in the shape of a boomerang.  it was hovering over a nearby house in our development. when i first saw the object, i wasn't sure what it was.  i didn't think it was a plane because it wasn't flashing or moving. it was just hovering over the house. i watched the object hover for about ten minutes. the object hadn't moved an inch. i then walked into my garage to let my dog in the house. once the dog was in the house i went back out onto the driveway to look at the object again. when i looked up to where the object was just a minute ago, it was suddenly gone. i looked all around the sky for the object and it was nowhere to be found. i was feeling a little spooked at this moment and i went back into the house. about two minutes later i went into my backyard to clean up the pool area and when i looked up in the sky i saw the object again hovering. i watched the object for about 30 minutes this time. the object didn't move and the lights didn't flash at all; it just hovered. i would have taken a picture of the object but my daughter is the only one with the camera, and i never know where to find it. i then went back into the house because i became bored of watching this object doing nothing.  after that i didn't see the object again until august. i was again outside walking my dog and i looked up in the sky like i do everynight to look at the stars, and the object was there again hovering over the same house. i ran back into the house to get my son and he came outside with me and i showed him the strange object. he had no idea what the object was, and he knew it wasn't a plane.  it was again just hovering there, not moving. we watched it for about ten minutes and then went back into the house.  i saw it a few more times in october and november doing the same thing, just hovering in the sky not moving and not flashing. i hadn't seen the object in about a month until just a week ago i saw the object hovering in the sky while i was walking my dog. i ran in to get my daughter who was home at the time and a minute later when we got outside the object was gone. the object seems to be extremely fast for it to disappear that quickly.  i then saw it again last night while i was walking my dog and i quickly went into the house to get my husband. he came outside with me and i pointed to the sky where the object was before i went into the house, and it was suddenly gone. my husband and i were searching the sky to find the object but it was nowhere to be found, again. it seems as though each time i try to show someone the object it disappears in a flash. each time the object appears it is around 8 or 9pm. it is truly the strangest thing i have ever witnessed. i wish i could figure out what this object is because it is truly something out of the ordinary.

(as in def not 10-20 and def not 60-70) it wasn't turning anymore, it was traveling east over hwy 80 up the auto mall \"valley\" - still with the two lights offset in height.\r\ni'd been watching it over the napa river bridge, through vallejo (on 37), past 6 flags amusement park.\r\ni lost sight of it while taking the 37 / 80 west offramp. behind the overpass. i caught a brief glance of it looking backwards on 80 - then i couldn't see the 7-8 dimmer lights between the 2 bright lights, but traffic was a bit hectic there.\r\ni took the first offramp and doubled back on admiral callaghan, i couldn't see it, but caught a momentary glimpse of a lighted spot 1000 to 1500 ft up on the valley ridge, right about at the target store shopping center.\r\ni'd guess that it was 80% to 90% of the way to the top of the hills (i could see the outline of the ridgeline). the lighted spot was reflected light, and i couldn't see any particular point of light, just a very brightly lighted area 50 to 100 ft wide up near the ridge.\r\ni lost direct line of sight behind the auto dealers and when i got to the top of admiral callaghan, i couldn't see the light on the hill anymore.\r\ni went down to auto mall parkway, turned right and kept looking up to find the lights again.\r\nnothing.\r\nin recreating my initial view, what i first had thought was \"downwind\" on rwy 24 at kapc, was wrong. the lights were over the northern edges of the town of vallejo, a few miles south of the airport, about inline with the napa / solono county borders.\r\ni'm 100% sure of the 2 non-directional lights, the 7-8 dimmer lights and the slow speed, the altitude and the light on the hillside.\r\nduration of observation, about 10 minutes.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This event occurred 17 september 2008 at approximately 17:00, on jamestown island, rhode island.  \r\n\r\ni was traveling west on route 138, and approaching the entrance to the jamestown bridge.  i looked up between the tree lines.  i observed a pale neon blue colored light approaching in front and to my left, just above the tree line.  i slowed to observe the object.  the light remained constant, and an object enormous appeared to float across the opening above the road.  \r\n\r\ni was approximately 100 yards from the entrance to the bridge.  i checked my rear view mirror and began slowing down.  there were no other vehicles behind me or approaching me on the east bound lanes.  i was able to approach within 50 to 70 yards from the slowly gliding object.  my observation lasted for less than a minute.  the object pass to my right over the tree line and soon was out of view.\r\n\r\nas the object began to float across the open area above the highway the event became surreal.   i observed no strobe lights, no lift surfaces.  the pale neon blue light was enclosed in a large vertically mounted rectangular housing on the front of the object.  as i watched the object, there were four such large vertical rectangular housings.  the object was circular with a vertical rectangular housing located at each quadrant.  the object traveled from my left to my right.  geographically the object was moving north.  it followed the water's edge on the west side of jamestown island.  \r\n\r\nthe object was enormous and floated just above the tree line.  the flight was extremely smooth and level.  i observed no exhaust, no strobe lights, no running lights, no markings, no windows or lights except the pale neon blue glowing light emanating from the large rectangular housings. when i lowered both my passenger and driver's door window, it was perfectly quiet.  i could not detect any  sound, other than my own road noise.  i also experienced no electrical malfunctions in my vehicle.\r\n\r\nthe object was perhaps 200 ft in length, about 50 ft thick.  it appeared to have a dark flat charcoal gray color.   the surface appeared to have a rough or splatter textured finish.  both the top and bottom surfaces had a slight convex surface, much akin to an inverted child's aluminum snow disc.  there appeared to be a ridge where the upper convex surface joined the vertical wall of the center section.  there also appeared to be the same type of ridge where the lower convex surface joined the vertical wall of the center section.  the ridge appeared similar to a rolled seam.  no doors or hatches were observed.  however a right angle discoloration, much like that of a shadows, were observed on the right rear quadrant.  \r\n\r\nthe top of the four rectangular housings were integrated into rectangular tunnel-like structures which radiated from the center of the top surface of the object.  the same is true on the lower or bottom surface of the four rectangular bottom, as they were integrated into similar tunnel-like structures which radiated from the center of the lower or bottom surface.  each structure or arm ran from the high point or center of the object, remained constant in width and height until reaching the rectangular housing.  there was one such rectangular housing at each quadrant of the object.   the object's travel was in-line and parallel, with one rectangular housing directly in front, and one in the rear.\r\n\r\nthree of the four vertical rectangular housings was observed.  each was orientated with the long axis of the rectangle perpendicular to the flat plane of the object.  the pale neon blue glow was recessed within each of the rectangular housings.  there were no flat surfaces or sharp corners on the housings.  the outside surface of the vertical rectangular structure rolled from from the outside edge to the recessed pale blue glowing surface centered within the housing.\r\n\r\ni was struck by the enormous size of the object, the lack of any lift surfaces and the smooth and level flight the object demonstrated.   as the object moved away from me and i observed the rear vertical rectangle housing.  the outer skin rolled over into the inside surface.  the pale blue light was constant and being emitted from a flat surface, recessed at approximately ��� the thickness of the vertical rectangular housings.\r\n\r\nafter the object passed out of my field of view, on my right, i began to cross the bridge and using my rear view mirror attempted to see the object.  i saw nothing out of the ordinary.  i did also investigate the dot webcams at either end of the bridge.  the field of view due to the current camera angle would not have captured the object.\r\n\r\nmy assessment is that the the four vertical rectangular structures were propulsion.  the placement of one vertical rectangular housing at each quadrant of the object made sense from a force generation  perceptive.  the shape, size, radius corners and surface of the vertical rectangular structures conceptually implied a housing for an induction coil or electromagnetic coil. given the azure blue, recessed inner surface, it occurred that it might be driven by ion propulsion. granted this is pure speculation, but based on my engineering background it just made logical sense.\r\n\r\ni am leaving the source of this report as anonymous due to possible repercussions.  sometimes, i wish this event had never occurred.  i am only reporting the event as i expect i will forget much of the detail in time.  i have not informed anyone of this event, and will continue not to.  i do not care who was behind the wheel, nor do i feel the need for others to believe me or not.  based on the manner of flight, and what i perceive the manner of propulsion to be, i do not believe the vehicle to of local vintage.

sitting on my front porch looking at the night sky,and i noticed three very bright stars. or what i thought were stars. i could not help but star at the brightest one. it was south west of my porch. it started out high above the tree line in my front yard and then moved lower. and then it was moving. i called my daughter to get my husband from the garage and look at this. he said it looked like a bright star is all. or maybe a helicopter or plane or something he looked at it for a second then went on with his project in the garage. \r\n\r\ni watched as it got lower. and then it started moving , like bouncing. up and down in a very fast rythm. as it got lower about 1 mile above the trees, two other \"stars\" appeared by it. my daughter got our spotlight for me and i pointed it at the light. i felt like this wanted something. like for me to notice it or something. i know this sounds crazy but it was like it was talking to me, and i asked it to come closer it got brighter... how weird is that... \r\n  \r\nthe color was a bright yellow then a red and a bluish orange color. it was bright then it was not so bright  i could see, when the light was dimmest,  the shape, like a disk or circle with a ring above it or something. the brightest one was bouncing and moving from left to right and up and down, just bouncing. it was truely amazing. \r\n\r\nthen i noticed my neighbors across the road had gotten out into the street and started walking in the direction of the light. it then started to slowly bounce and move to the west. i got in my car and tried to follow it. as i got to the end of the gravel road about 1/2 mile, it slowly moved away, it was probably 5 or 6 miles to the west of me as i sat there in my car and watched it, then as fast as a blink it raced straight up. and it was gone. \r\n\r\ni am convinced something was there and i will search for it again tonight. \r\nif i see it i will be back to share this with you all. i took one picture with my cannon when it was starting to leave it looks like a bright light in the sky. \r\ni forgot to mention there was a helicopter that came over my house during this time ... it was flying high but it went directly over my house.. \r\nalso as the circle was leaving i could see air planes going behind it they were farther off from it.

delivery, i decided to take a smoke break. it was late in the afternoon, i would say about 4:30 pm. i remember i was upset it was so late in the day and i was still working.\r\n\twhile standing on the delivery area at the side of the restaurant i was enjoying the view, there is a little lake behind the restaurant. on the horizon as i was looking i saw quite a few contrails. as i recall there were 5 of them all travailing in the same direction, i started to follow the contrails and saw they were converging. i then saw the three of the 5 jets creating the contrails, as i continued to follow the contrails, directly above me between clouds i saw a jet. i would call it a fighter jet, not commercial. it was a lot lower then the other 3 that were still quite high and the 4th was behind the clouds.\r\n\tthat is when i saw it.\r\n\tjust in front of the jet was an object. the jet was right on its tail. from the size of the jet it was no more then 5 lengths behind the object.  they then go behind clouds. it is very cloudy and i stood there waiting to see it come out from the clouds. i then determined it would not be visible  again for several more seconds. i ran into the restaurant and got several people to come out and look.  they stayed in cloud cover and i never saw again.\r\n\tnow to describe the object.  it was very light pink in color. it crossed my mind when i saw it that if it were to be as light a blue as it was pink, it would not be visible. it would blend in with the sky.\r\n\tits shape was very odd. i thought of it as an hour glass shape laying on its side with the ends pointed and the center not as narrow.  it flew point to point  on the horizon. i guess it could have been described as two tear drop shapes joined at the curve as compared to the points.  it had a very strange texture. it seemed more organic then metal.\r\n\twhat did i think i was seeing, a military jet chasing something.  i assumed it was a ufo. it was only visible for i would say 5 seconds before it went behind the clouds. of course i became quite excited. i had trouble comprehending what i saw.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\ti was deer hunting on the morning of the aforementioned date and it was still completely dark when i got to my deer stand. the deer stand is a 12��� tripod that has a 360 degree swivel chair and can be covered by a canvas; except the canvas was off and only the metal frame was around me. while sitting, at chest height there is a square bar that goes all around me and is connected to the floor by four vertical bars. four metal bars are connected to this chest high bar at each corner and extend up where they are connected at the top by another square bar. the very top has two bars that form a cross, connected to each other in the middle and topping off the entire frame. this cross of the bars forms 4 ���quadrants��� that i separated the sky with as i was looking at stars.\r\n\r\n\ti was facing the northwest looking at the upside down big dipper and a group of stars below it. the group of stars (i���ll call reference stars) occupied about the same space as the big dipper, but is shaped as such: two stars lined up on a horizontal axis between the ground and the big dipper at about the same distance away from the big dipper as the width of the top of the pot on the big dipper. the stars were as fr apart as the stars on the handle of the big dipper. two other stars sit on a vertical axis off to the right of this; the top star is underneath the second star of the handle from the end of the big dipper at about the same distance as the stars on the handle of the big dipper are from each other. the bottom verticle star is on the other side of the axis of the horizonal stars at about the same distance as the top vertical star is from the same axs. in between those vertical stars there appeared an object about halfway between them and to the right. the horizontal stars ���pointed��� right to this center object. again, the vertical and horizontal stars were the reference points i used to verify movement.\r\n\r\n\tas i was looking at the big dipper and seeing ���twinkles��� of stars and some shooting stars all around me, i saw the twinkle of the object that appeared to be a star. it was a brighter than normal twinkle that caught my attention. as i stared and focused on this twinkling star i noticed it was slightly moving in random directions, but maintaining its presence within a very small area. if you were to look briefly at the ���big picture��� it would just appear as a regular star. as i watched this object to continually verify to myself that this object was indeed moving, i saw another brighter-than-usual twinkling of an object just to the left of this one and another tiny ���star-like��� object appeared. it wasn't star-shaped, it was the same brightness as an average star. this object darted to my lower left in a straight line as a shooting star would do and slowed to a near stop next to a couple of very faint stars. it moved randomly as the first star was doing and then disappeared. i strained for a few minutes to see it, but it was definitely gone. \r\n\r\n\tat this point i was very excited and intrigued. as i looked back at the first object i identified i noticed that it was still moving ever so slightly in a random fashion, yet maintaining its presence in a very small area, relative to my eyesight. at that point i saw another twinkle in about the same place as the previous one and yet another star-like object appeared. i thought, \"oh my gosh!\" this object flashed as a twinkle and its glow went back to the same brightness as an ���average��� star. it then traveled in an easterly direction in a not-so-straight line. as i was looking at this object and looking back and forth at this one and the first one, i lost sight of the moving one because it picked up its speed, got very dim and then disappeared. i lost it when it got about the same distance away as the one that moved in the other direction from the point of their origin. several times i focused in on other stars and verified to myself that they were indeed staying still, and the objects in question were definitely moving.\r\n\r\nat this point i got my binoculars out; bushnell 16 x 32 (188ft. at 1000 yards). these are small binoculars so it was difficult to focus and maintain a steady position. at a couple of points i was able to focus in on the object for a couple of seconds to see what i would describe as a spinning ���ying and yang��� symbol. it was spinning counter-clockwise. i lost focus on the object and couldn���t regain focus because i was excited and intrigued so i leaned my head back and rested it on the corner bar behind me to get steady without the binoculars. i stared at this object for a long time, thought deeply about it and witnessed continual movement in an area tiny enough to conceal its movements; if i stuck my arm out in front of me and made a one inch square it would have stayed within that one inch square. it almost got out of alignment a couple of times in reference to the other vertical and horizontal stars, but still maintained its presence in a very small area. \r\n\r\n\tthis activity continued until it started getting daylight and i lost sight of all stars. i eventually shifted my focus back on hunting and later told my friend in camp about my encounter. i was talking with excitement and sureness of what i saw. it was as if these objects came in through our atmosphere in a flash all in the same general area, and then moved in their respective directions. so i just continued to look at the first object. it not only helped to have the stars as reference points, but the bars that crossed at the top of my deer stand also provided a stationary reference. the wind was calm, and the morning was absolutely clear. i had lasik surgery in my left eye about 7 years ago that vastly improved my vision. i witnessed several shooting stars that morning, but there is no doubt in my mind that what i witnessed, by definition, was several unidentified flying objects. it wasn���t a close encounter by any means, but it convinced me that someone or something is among us either as a hidden residence or as a visitor. i now believe and i will never look to the sky in the same way ever again, and i will always look at that general area to see if i can see them again.\r\n","distance":"Over One
