States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I saw what appeared to be the monolith from 2001 flying through the air very slowly, and with no lights or sound.  it was just after sunset, it was still light out, but getting harder to see.  i was just under the i-435 bridge at the missouri/kansas border on river rd.  i would go to this area to play with my wolf, at the time she was a 6 month old 100% timberwolf.  she began to freak out like something was there, but i could see nothing.  the weird part was she wasn't looking at the woods or grass, but at the road itself, and when i looked i saw nothing there.  my van was parked on the side of the road, so i began to walk her back to the van, but she wouldn't go near the road.  by this time she was getting pretty big, so when she wanted to, she could pull pretty hard.  she kept trying to pull me away from the road, and then she started yelping and shaking and wouldn't go any farther.  i couldn't figure out what was wrong with her, so i just dragged her to the van and put her in.  i then went around to get in the driver's side to go home, and that is when i saw the craft.  i completely forgot about what was bothering my wolf, because this thing was huge, and really far off so i didn't feel threatened at all.  it wasn't until i got home that i began to question what she might have sensed out there on that road.  what i saw was flying so slow, that it didn't make any sense to me.  it looked exactly like a flying monolith, that is the only way i can describe it.  after about 5 minutes, i watched as a much smaller, triangle shaped craft dropped out of the bottom rear of the monolith.  the monolith then sped away in an instant, while the triangle craft headed out over the highway towards kansas.  the smaller craft wobbled as it flew, like a frisbee.  the wobbling wasn't very dramatic, kind of like watching someone drive with an alignment problem.  i've seen this triangle craft before on a discovery channel program, so i know that this was a military craft.  they use some kind of centrifugal force to make tight turns and fly like a frisbee, and that is what this thing did.  the one on the show i watched was the exact same type of craft, except this thing had no lights on.  it's been awhile since i saw the show i'm talking about, but from what i remember, these triangle shaped craft have been verified by our military as being real.  the show had actual footage, not a recreation.  these things can turn on a dime, but can be explained.  what freaked me out was the large monolith craft, because it didn't make any sense.  i've seen a small predator stealth fighter before, here at the kc air show, and i thought that was pretty cool.  this thing beat that, and the fighter was doing flips around a stealth bomber to show off.\r\n\r\ni just watched a history channel show about the stephenville tx sightings, and although they don't match what i saw, what bothered me was one of the witnesses.  he said he also had a wolf, and it acted scared as well.  this made me remember how my wolf acted, and got me thinking that although these craft are silent, maybe they emit high-frequency sound the wolves can hear.  kind of like a dog whistle.  the craft was so cool, that i just didn't connect the weird behavior of my wolf to the object until your witness said the same thing happened to his wolf.  it was the old guy with the dark glasses on.\r\n\r\ni don't claim to be anything except a startled witness to something strange.  what i saw appeared to be military, although strange, it didn't defy reason.  what i want to know is if maybe a cloaked soldier could have been in the road, and that my wolf could smell him.  this would explain why she freaked out, because she could smell but not see them.  she could also have heard sounds made by the craft that i couldn't, because i never heard a sound from either craft.  i have ocd, so i notice things others don't.  if my wolf hadn't have been freaking out though, i wouldn't even have looked up i don't think.  you guys can either believe me or not, nobody else does.  i don't really care if these craft are military, just if they are alien tech.  i actually support my government, so if there is any conspiracy, i'm on their side if they want to keep their secrets.  i'm the kind of person that wants to know the answers to all the questions, then if the answers need to be kept secret, i wouldn't mind a bit if they shot me in the head after revealing it all to me.","distance":"Over One

the object. i stated it was a perfect 90 degree angle.I would say if a jet liner was low enough to the ground that the wing span looked about 6 inches across,that is how low it was.It took about 1 to 2 minutes to go across the sky and moved off the the nw. the object looked black against the  night sky. about 2 weeks later we were again sitting on the patio and an object came into view from the south moving very fast and very high in the sky. it had a yellow/golden color and it was the same shape as the first object we saw.It went across the sky very quickly. but, about 2 weeks after that, we saw the same object with the same color coming from the south west higher thanthe last object and this time moving so fast i could just tell it was the same shape. it only took a a few seconds for

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Ok, ive told the story a few times, so i can still remember how it happened. i was on a wildland fire hand crew, way up near the canadian border in washington state. the thing i remember most about the area was that is was very steep and heavily wooded. for me personally, the woods there had an air about them that made me feel a little spooked in a peculiar sort of way. i enjoyed it quite a bit. we were there for maybe four or five days, not too sure about that, but the whole time, i felt that way. \r\n   anyway, we were on the night shift the first night out on the line. it was a long dozer trail that ran sidehill up and down and all over the country. the trail had been freshly cut, and the soil was made of grey pumice, and there were a lot of big rocks just underneath the soil, and therefore littered about the trail, which made it very treacherous to walk at night, especially since we hadn't seen the place in the daylight.\r\n   after a long walk, the division supervisor, or whatever his title was, assigned us to spread out along the trail, 100 feet apart from each other, and hold the line. holding line is just making sure no fire crosses the fireline. well, there was no more fire where we were, so we spread out, moved a few times to adjust our spacing, and the call came down the line to take a rest. our crews position was just a precautionary measure, and another crew would space out beyond our location to secure more fireline. \r\nwe faced the green (the unburned area), as is the practice, and waited. we all had our backs to the ridgeline, which probably rose about 300 feet above our heads, and were all facing the valley below. i could make out the outline and some detail of the ridgeline above and to the right of me in the moonlight. after about 30 minutes, another crew passed behind us on the trail and continued down the line, just as we had done. i noticed that most of them were wearing glowsticks in their hardhats, a safety measure to make it easier to locate one another. \r\n     well, about 5 minutes later, i glanced up to the ridgeline into the burn area to see if i could see any glow of the fire, (which a firefighter often does) and saw some strange lights. my first thought was that the other crew had somehow made it all the way up to the ridgetop, and that i could see the glowsticks in their hats, but they were behaving in an erratic manner. then i thought that it must be fire, but i could see no orange glow, which is unmistakable in the night to any firefighter. no sparks, no flame. it lacked the hue and color quality of the light of any fire. my last thought was that it must be another crew with glowsticks in their hats up there, but by then, more had appeared, perhaps a dozen, and they all had moved into a direct line of sight, where i could clearly track their movements. i was standing up, viewing at a distance of perhaps 500 yards, and about 60 degrees up. i would judge each one to be about the size of a volleyball. they were swooping among the tree tops just below the leeward ridge top. their movements seemed conscious, as they were interacting kinetically with each other and the trees. they would change directions at probably 20 mph and follow strange twisted paths, kind of like they were dancing. they stayed close together, within a distance of probably 30 yards apart, and all the while changing hues from yellow to green to blue and red. the light seemed to morph a little and had the flicker of plasma, and i knew then that these were not the movements of people, and if they were, they were up climbing the trees and swinging on ropes! if they had been on the ground, the hill would have to be taller, and i would have been able to see the taller trees behind. later viewing in the daytime confirmed this, that the objects were in the treetops.\r\n  i watched the whole thing for the better part of an hour, and wasn't too excited about it at the time, but kept it in the back of my mind. i did notice when they became fewer, and then i finally looked up again and they were all gone.\r\n  an interesting note, i remember it started to get light early, around 5:30 am, and we were still in the same spot. the morning sky was very grey and structured. at around 6:00 am, i thought it unusual to see a lightning storm come from behind the ridgetop above us. i saw the first lightning in the area where i saw the balls of light, though i did not witness any downstrikes, just cloud to cloud. it is quite unusual to have a lightning storm at that time of day, especially in a cool climate. \r\n   later investigation in the area over the next few days revealed that there was no active fire in the vicinity of the sighting at the time, and that the area was in fact still green. the day after the incident, while taking a break, i spoke up about what i saw, and found that three others had viewed the same thing. we spoke about it for perhaps 1 minute, and that was all that was said. i still know two of them. i do not know if anyone else on our crew saw the lights.\r\n    so in conclusion, i dont know what they were. i put them in my strange file. they may have been atmospheric electrical phenomenon, but the way they were moving was so lifelike, i do not know, and i dont know what to make of the fact that a lightning storm appeared in the same spot, 5 hours after they were gone. take it for what it is, whatever that is!\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

wasn't an airplane or helicopter, wasn't a satellite or star, and was truly moving strangely [the eyes can play tricks on you if you stare at something too long].\r\n\r\nafter another 5-10 minutes i

to tell.  at one point i watched an airplane fly directly in front of it.  due to this fact, i would surmise that it was out over the ocean.\r\n\r\nmore about the movement: it moved left and right, up and down and, apparently, farther away and closer [it would grow fainter then brighter].  it would stay in one place for awhile and then move in an intermittent and abrupt manner.  sometimes it would oscillate back and forth or up and down, and sometimes it would zip in one direction and stay there.  it seemed to be heading in a general northwest direction [out over the ocean].  my wife probably

eastern horizon.  the sky was still completely black.  the (crescent waning moon had set long ago), so there was no celestial light pollution/distortion.\r\n\r\nthe object simply disappeared in the

constellations had \"moved\" since before i had gone to bed. the big dipper was pretty much right over my head. then i realized that one of the stars was moving. it was very small (as if you looked up at the stars and picked the dimmest one you could find) and it moved from just to the left of the north star in a due south direction. it was very slow and did not make a sound. as i stood there

watch the sky for shooting stars and satellites and generally admire the stars. on clear nights here in western maine we have an outstanding view of the stars. at first it appeared to be a star in the distance rapdily flashing white and trailing what looked like 2 orange tentacles of light. i watched it for a few minutes and then saw it move and thought, what the heck is that. it would move occasionally in rounded sweeping movements and i saw it move in a 90 degree movement downward and to a sudden stop. the best description i can give is that with the naked eye it moves alot like a kite would up up the sky. i took a couple pictures but it was too dark and the object is too distant. it appears like it is up over quebec somewhere. when i got my binoculars to look at it i was astonished. at many points it looks like a 2 disc craft with a central core connecting the two discs, mostly green halo surround the entire craft and rapidly flashing white light around the top disc with random bright reds flashing in the white area, on the bottom disc it is mostly orange and green lights, no red flashing in this area. when it moves (watching with binoculars) it spins rapidly almost like looking at a laser pointer being moved around a white screen. looping and spinning almost like my hands were shaking. so i stabilized the binocs and sure enough, it was not me. it rapidly circles when it moves then suddenly stops. i just went out to look and watch again for a few minutes before writing this line and it is still there even though the sky is brightening for dawn. one thing to note is there is an extraordinary number of shooting stars this morning, i have personally seen 16 so far. this object is not a plane, if fact one flew by in the general sky area, not too closely, i watched it approach and fly by and i have to believe they had to see this object, it is certainly bright enough and large enough. it is now somewhat lower on the northern horizon and more difficult to see. i did wake my wife at 5:30 to come out and look with me to confirm i am not crazy. she also sees it and because it is cold outside she went into the bedroom and watched from the window. i did too for a short time but the screen makes it less clear to see details. i am exhilarated by this experience and wanted to share it with somebody who would not think i am insane. one hour

where semi-new development, houses, were being phased in. we parked alongside a road that lead into the partially-completed development. it was dark out that night but not that dark, so we could see our surroundings clearly. \r\n\r\nas i popped the top off my beer (pull-tabs back then), i happened to look straight ahead to my left- something caught my eye. what i very clearly saw, 300-400ft away, i couldn't believe: it was a whitish disc (saucer-shaped) hovering above a house. by \"hovering above a house\", i mean like almost sitting on it- just right above. i would estimate 50-75ft above roof of house. the disc was smooth and was roughly the size of the house (if not a bit bigger���maybe 1.5 times as large), which was a decent-sized, upper-scale, two-story house. i remember thinking: \"these people in the house should still be awake at this hour.\" i thought also that maybe the saucer was \"picking up\" people from the house. i couldn't believe it was that close to the house- just sitting/hovering above it like that. surreal. \r\n\r\nin any event, the saucer was very clearly seen- it had a ring of lights, decent-sized and yellow or standard light color, which rotated or appeared to rotate clock-wise, based on which one lit up as the craft was stationary/hovering. these lights became brighter as the ���spinning��� effect (of the lights only- the craft itself remained ���motionless���) accelerated. there was no noise associated w/the disc. i watched this for about 30-40 seconds- the instant i thought to tell my buddy: \"hey, look at that!\", the saucer tilted as if on an invisible axis (it had been on a flat, stationary plane as it paralleled the roof of the house) and the lights started to get brighter and \"spin\" or rotate around at an increased speed. the lights were above the base of the ship, located midway on the disc/saucer- there was a portion of the saucer that was above the lights. so, as soon as i started to tell my friend, who was too busy/distracted opening his beer, the thing tilted on its side and took off. it moved very quickly, yet with no sound- it was if the saucer/disc was sucked up via a vacuum, like it ���displaced��� gravity. i believe it did. by this, i mean the visual image/representation (what i saw) of the saucer shrank very quickly as it moved upward. the rate it moved upward was nothing short of amazing, so the image quickly became smaller at a quick rate- this was interesting in that the image itself appeared to exhibit just a slight ���lag��� time as the craft moved away. most interesting- i have never seen anything move that quickly.  within a few seconds after i thought to tell my friend, the thing was gone. while it moved upward, it did not move laterally- that is what i mean when i say that it moved upward as if sucked up in a vacuum- everything was constant in terms of its position except the increased height. again, i have never seen anything move like this- extremely precise. to reiterate: it moved as if gravity was simply ���displaced��� around it. \r\n\r\nthis was a very close encounter, and the sense i got was that whoever/whatever was piloting the craft did not want people to be aware of it- so it fled. i also know that we must have initiated heat-based signature-awareness obvious to whatever was controlling that craft. i also believe that it (they���whatever was controlling the saucer) was able to pick up on the fact that i saw it (my thought patterns) and that i was in process of conveying that information to my friend. when people think, energy changes and is more visible with the right type of vision. in any event, my thoughts corresponded to the movement or actions of the saucer.\r\n\r\nduring the following week...After this ocurred...I was very tempted to drive back out there and knock on the door of that house to see what the people who lived there were like...Do a quick cursory to see if i noticed anything strange. i decided against that because i thought that this was, in fact, not a good/safe thing to do... but i kept my eyes open to see if any disappearances were reported in that area via the paper or the nightly news. i very-much thought that would be the case. i wonder how many people have seen a saucer sitting, hovering in the air, just above a house like that. \r\n\r\nwhat i have reported is the absolute truth- the saucer was unmistakably clear. if we had had cell phones w/cameras back then, i could have snapped one heck of a shot. so, this is what i saw back in the summer of 1977, as an 18-year old, in erie, pa.  \r\n\r\na funny thing i just noticed as i write this description/report- it���s as if the memory wants to take off- just like the saucer did- i noticed this as i started to write. very strange. another thing: when we returned to the party, we were greeted with: ���you guys were gone a long time.��� when i looked at my watch, i realized that it was a bit after 11pm. did't seem that long. to this day, i can still very tangibly feel the instant that the saucer/disc took off- that part is very resident.\r\n\r\nthis probably has nothing to do w/anything- but it���s interesting- my father was part of the apollo project in the late ���60s, so i have seen first-hand up-close pictures of some aspects of that project- what i saw that night in erie was much more advanced- the technology was not even close.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

o'clock traffic on i-85 in north charlotte, nc towards unc-charlotte campus. i was taking an exit ramp towards the university when i looked up in front of me about 150 yards away a rectangular shaped object was floating silently above the tree line. at first i thought it must be a banner being pulled by a plane but i quickly realized that wasn't the case. it was as large as a tennis court. the object was covered with encased reflective panels that were dark army green and may have been reflecting the trees below.\r\n\r\ni drove slowly and watched it in utter amazement for about 15 seconds. i had time to take off my sunglasses to make sure of what i was seeing. as the traffic crept down the road the ufo floated behind a tree line and i couldn't see it anymore. i didn't even think to look at other drivers to see if they reacted to it. \r\n\r\nas i got closer to the campus, i noticed two cars that were pulled off the road. i was kind of in a daze and was locked in with the rest of traffic so had to keep going. \r\n\r\ni've researched rectangle shaped ufo reports and find many similarities such as most witnesses having the initial reaction that it must be a banner being pulled by an airplane. in fact, another rectangle ufo was reported in charlotte, nc in september 2008, in the same area of town. seeing this object did change my life in that i know for certain now that

route home on hwy 169 south. it was approximately midnight when we noticed a light off in the distance. apparently we both noticed it at the same time, but did not know that until later. i saw it and said nothing. my husband noticed it and watched it for awhile before asking me if i saw it as well. once we realized we were seeing the same thing, we immediately looked for a rational reason to explain the odd light. *let me make a quick note. my husband is a staunch skeptic and i want to believe with the right evidence. this is important since it was my husband who actually commented first about the object instead of myself. i had noticed the object and simply not said anything because typically he shrugs off things such as this.  initially a plane was the obvious answer, but we noticed as we got closer to the object, it did not seem to be moving. we were drawing closer in the car going approximately 65mph and it was staying perfectly stationary.  we then reasoned, perhaps it was a tower with a light to warn planes approaching, but then we realized that was not possible. we  confirmed that by driving the same route the next night and there is no light in the same area. again, we ran through every reasonable scenario in our head and came up with nothing that matched what we saw. the object was triangular in shape with six points of light underneath it. five of the lights were white with the one in the center on the underneath side being red.  since we were traveling on the highway at a decent speed, we were upon the object quicker than i anticipated. i finally got over the shock of what i was seeing and reached for my cell phone camera. i took one very horrid picture that is not worth passing on. it was distant and extremely blurred since we were traveling quickly. about this time the highway veers towards the east, away from the object. we planned on taking the next exit off and backtracking. as i turned towards the back of the car to keep my eye on it, it seemed to simply dissappear. i could not say whether it accelerate so quickly that my eyes could not take in the experience quickly enough, or if it truly vanished into thin air, but it was no longer in view at all within a second. let me note here that my husband believes it took off towards the west. we continued to talk about the event the rest of the way home. it seemed to go by so quickly and yet in slow motion at the same time. to this day, we have found no one else that has reported seeing an object on that evening and have no answers about what it could have been.
