clear cold night in the low teens. the sky was clear because you could see the stars as well as the planes flying over head. there was no precipitation in the air. as we stepped outside my parent's home, the entire sky lit up for approximately 5 to 10 seconds, but it seemed much longer. the sky because a bright and brilliant blue. the shade was a very light powedery color blue much like the color of a robin's egg. i remember noticing a couple of vapor trails in the sky and thinking to myself...Where is the sound? part of me was thinking that something had quickly flown over head because of the trails that i noticed and i was also expecting an impact shock. but there was none of either. the experience was jarring enough to scare all of my children causing them to run back inside the home. \r\n\r\naround the same time, my wife was driving home from work and noriced a large bright white light on the horizon that seemed to hover. it was as large as the moon. the moon was just finishing the new phase so it could not have been that. the light appeared to originate from the same approximate direction as the source of the bright blue flash. she lost sight of the object as she turned around the corner.\r\n\r\na friend of mine noted a power flicker around the same time in the village of mt. morris approximately 10 miles away.\r\n\r\naround 11:00 pm, the power failed at the home for approximately five minutes.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":14702,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.802396,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01022009-0018","longitude":-77.809717,"occurred":1230688800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

clear and the temperature was around 10 degrees. at approximately 45 degrees over the horizon towards the southwest i saw a very bright object -- brighter than any object in the sky.  it appeared as a flickering stationary object with colour changes. i observed this object with the naked eye for a minute. i then got out a pair of standard bell and howell 1944 wwii naval binoculars i have. through these i saw that it had blue, red, green and yellow blinking lights.  this went on for about 30 minutes and then disappeared. it appeared to move backwards and forwards. this was an object that was clearly lower than the stars. there was no sound.\r\n\r\ni have seen this object twice since -- on january 1 at around 9 p.M. and january 2 at around 7 a.M. in these instances i could see it better. it appears to be a ball shaped object with a large light in the midsection and two rows of lights that run 90 degree angles to the center light. the lights appear in all cases to cycle -- the center light gets bright, fades, the lights in on both axis get brighter from the center, fade, and the cycle repeats -- on about a 3 or 4 second cycle. the object exhibits retrograde motion, going up/down/east/west before fading from view.\r\n\r\ni might add that we live on a flight path for an airport that services both commercial and military aircraft. in addition, my wife is familar with military aircraft. i also am an amateur \"naked eye\" astronomer so i basically know what to see from my house. this is not anything we have typically seen -- and we routinely see helicopters (military and civilian), light aircraft, commercial aircraft, and military fixed wing (c-130, f-14, f-18) at very low levels (under 100 feet) we have been to most major aircraft museums and airshows

event, and i didnt feel like i was in the air while i had the experience.  i was advised to report my experience here after posting on a forum because all i received there were crackpot theories and magical thinking where i was looking for serious feedback and comraderie by people who may have had a similar experience.  all the dates and times i wrote are very approximate, i only know it was around 5 am when it ended because i remember the image of my digital clock.  for the duration i just put two hours but i have no idea how long it lasted as i dont remember anything but sleeping before.  one night in july of 2002 i woke up and my first realization was that there was no blanket on me and my back was cold, like it was on some sort of cold metal (im starting to shake as i write this remembering it). my next realization is that i was not in my bed altogether, or in my room, but a small dull colored room (grey or black, i cant remember) with a few, two or three, figures standing over me. at first i thought i was in a hospital because i had been brought to the hospital for an asthma attack and once for a car crash, but it was different. there were no bright lights (only a dim sort of light like a dentists lights positioned directly over my face about two feet away, obscuring my vision of the figures), no door, and it wasnt a \"room\" per se. i couldnt see its beginning or end, only the ceiling and the fact that it was grey or another dull color, and my back was so cold. at first i thought the figures were human, and being extremely scared and not knowing where i was, i tried to get up and run (this was my first instinct), but i couldnt move. one of the figures placed a hand in the center of my chest and it was also cold, cold as ice, and slippery in a way, and it was also the same dull grey color of hte room. i also remember that the hand had long, long fingers that reached from the center of my chest where the palm and stretched outwards almost to my back. i was terrified and shaking but i couldnt physically do anything so i tried to look away, i didnt want to see who/whatever was touching me, but i couldnt even turn my head. all i could do was move my eyes. the one with the hand on my chest, he moved forward closer to my face, his face was maybe a foot and a half away (a little closer than the light). i saw then that he was not human, he (i say he, im not sure if it was a male or even if it had a gender) told me not to be afraid (not with words, he somehow put the thought into my head) but i was terrified. i didnt know what these things were or what they wanted me. i thought i was going to die. just the way they looked terrified me. the one face i saw then, the one that leaned in close and was touching my chest (which was bare by the way, as far as i remember i was naked, when i had went to bed in pajamas) was more oblong than a human face, the same color as the hand, no discernable nose and only a small slit for a mouth which i never saw open (it could even have been fused together), but the eyes were the scariest part. they were like black reflectors, big and almond shaped, and the head was large and circular with no hair. i saw the light reflecting in the corners of both of its eyes, like they were empty, and all i could do was lay there terrified. another creature then held my right arm (i know it was my right because there is a scar there) and \"told\" me i would feel a slight numbing sensation, and i did. i could not see what was happening. the next thing i knew, i awoke in my bed, uncovered by blankets (which were neatly folded in a triangular shape over the bottom half of my bed) but with my pajamas back on. i told my mother and father and they told me i had had a nightmare and for a long time i beleived them. it never occured to me to examine myself or look at my arm or anything, i am only 22 now and was only 16 then. maybe six months after this incident i began to hear voices and my parents noticed a steady decline in my school performance (before this i usually got straight a's but they were slipping to b's and c's) so they brought me to a psychiatrist who after a year or so diagnosed me with schizophrenia. for a few years i didnt beleive anything was wrong with me and didnt accept my illness, but at age 20 or so i finally did and decided that my abduction experience was perhaps the first symptom of my illness. but when i decided this i began to mull over the specifics of the experience and remembered the part where they told me id experience a slight numbing in my arm (which id forgotten up until that point) and promptly examined both my arms, and in the exact spot (as near as i can remember where the spot was) where i felt the numbing there was an inch-long, horizontal scar with a horizontal hard lump underneath it. i have had many of my friends and even my family feel this lump under the scar and agree that there is something hard there. my family thinks its perhaps from some childhood injury where a rock or something got trapped under my arm. my friends dont know what to think since i havnt told any of them anything about my experiences for fear of being made fun of or stigmatized. i did, however, tell numerous doctors about my experience and offered up my scar and lump as proof. all of them said the same thing: all this was being caused by my schizophrenia, i was delusional, and they were not going to operate on an old scar to remove what was probably just a cyst (however one or two doctors remarked that it was too hard to be a cyst and agreed with my family about the childhood injury theory). so i grew afraid to tell anyone about my experiences, having learned that talking about them in the hospital would only result in me being kept there longer and i would never be taken seriously by probably anyone.  i confided in my best friend about my experience and he was shocked to see the scar and feel the hardness underneath.\r\nanyway, i resume my normal life, and try to convince myself that it was my illness but it still haunted me and seemed different somehow. then one night i woke up with the same cold-back sensation, no clothes on, figures standing over me, and again i was terrified. the same hand on the chest, the same \"dont be afraid\", and the same information that i woud experience numbness on my arm. i screamed (or i tried to scream, i cant remember if a sound came out), and they \"said\" \"relax. its being removed\", and although i didnt neccesarily beleive this there was nothing i could do. after the arm thing i was allowed to get up, although i was told to stay where i was standing, and the first thing i did was feel my arm and the hardness was gone. i asked why they put it in me and why they were taking it out now, why couldnt they just have left me alone. i was told that i had to have been given a \"history of mental illness\". i beleive it is so nobody would beleive my claims if i ever came forward. (now, before i get into the details, i would like to say that i have no idea if this is the truth or an elaborate lie concocted by the creatures for some reason, perhaps to pacify me). i asked (in different words) if i could know what this was all about, and two of the figures turned towards each other for a minute or so and just seemed to be looking at each other. the first figure turned back towards me and told me \"yes, you may, but before i tell you let me assure you that you can tell whomever youd like. nobody will beleive you\" (now when i say they told me something i dont mean audibly, i mean telepathically somehow. i was the only one communicating audibly). the one figure began what turned into a speech of sorts, which i obviously cant remember word for word, but i will outline the details i remember. it started out with saying that human religion is deeply flawed and \"god\" is a normal but intelligent man who came from an advanced civilization, somehow escaped when they were in the process of destroying themselves, and that he did not create the universe or earth and nobody, including the figures, knows who did or even whether someone or something created it or it just came into being somehow. \"god\" merely created enough dna copies of man so there would be enough variety in the genetic pool so as not to create inbreeding problems, and planted the first \"batch\" of his creations on earth because it was a suitable planet, to perpetuate his species. it was explained to me that \"god\" became immortal through cloning and another method able to preserve the conciousness of one clone to the next, and that our existence on earth so far represents a very very small segment of time versus the estimated time the universe has been in existence (im pretty sure humans already know this). he is not omnipotent nor does he interfere in anything humans do, we have complete free will. however, there is some kind of war going on that i \"wouldnt understand\" and the life of this man is in jeopardy (i asked why it even matters if he dies or not since he doesnt interfere in our lives at all and i was told that he must continue to live until the universe contracts and time begins again as it expands and the exact same events that took place unfold once again, so that he can perpetuate our species after earth humans' eventual extinction.) and in anticipation of his possible death, many sets of humans were born with 1/3 of this man's dna code on the end of a dormant string which has no influence on how they would develop, and i was one of these sets of three, and copies had to be made for backup elsewhere at various times in my life. this time i remember being dropped on my bed from what felt like an inch or two above it, and this time the blankets were just on the bed and i was clothed, although my shirt was inside out. the important part is since that day all symptoms of \"schizophrenia\" have gone away and i have stopped taking the medications which i thought i would be bound to for life. this last experience was in approx. april 2007.\r\ni am a rational man, and i am aware that this sounds beyond beleif.  personally i think the whole god/patriarch story was a lie designed to make me feel special or needed and to prime me for future abductions (although nothing has happened since april 2007) but i am still haunted by the memories of these creatures and have a deep gut feeling that they are deceitful and malevolent.  i do not know why you ask for my phone number but i put my real phone number, except my work phone because obviously i do not want my coworkers to think im some kind of nutcase.  please do not publish my name though.\r\ni have also attached several photos: the scar on my arm is the first one.\r\nthe second one is a marking which has been on my hand ever since the first experience (i am sure it was not there before then, as you can imagine how many times in a day i see the top of my own hand).  the scar is where the lump was but the marking, i have no idea why or how it got there.  on the marking photo, the black on the right side of my hand is not part of the marking, it is the start of a tattoo.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14688,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.6527778,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01022009-0004","longitude":-72.3913889,"occurred":1025524800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1025524800000,"summary":"This

not an imagined event. i remember it pretty well to this day. i was playing hide and seek with the neighborhood kids, including my brother. the base was my front porch, and being sneaky, decided to double back through my back yard, hop the privacy fence, and come down the rather long (50 yards or so) side yard that ran next to the street. this was ingenious as most of the kids hid around the cul-de-sac my house was on (my house was the corner house). after climbing over and dropping down from the 6-foot fence, i looked up for some reason. no sound or light caused me to look up, i just did, perhaps thanks to the sixth sense of being watched. what i saw was a circular object covered in multi-colored lights that were flashing in patterns. i don't mean a few lights, i mean this thing looked like a times square sign. the craft was motionless  other than the lights and made no sound that i recall. the object was directly above me at an altitude of maybe 100 yards. from my perspective it was about 12 inches across if it was 2 feet above my head. i looked up at the craft for a short time, maybe 5-10 seconds. i then sprinted as fast as i could the 50 or so yards to the front of my house without looking back. i don't recall being fearful of the craft, i just ran out of instinct i suppose. i went inside to my room and turned my stereo on. it was a dual cassette and am/fm stereo that also had an auxiliary input, which was unused. i don't recall why, but i pushed the aux button. what i heard astonished me. before and since nothing but silence came from the auxiliarly source because there was nothing hooked up to it. that night there was a signal however. what i heard sounded like a foreign auctioneer. at least that's the best way i can describe it. i believe there were two other kids with me who also heard it, and i recall us commenting that it was alien tow truck drivers chatting on the radio. like i said only that night did sound come from that stereo when put on the aux mode. no one else saw the craft, but i remember others heard the radio chatter. i haven't seen any other ufo in my life nor have i heard the \"alien chatter\" again. i will never forget that night.

(in my mind then, i wondered if it was someone flying a hot air balloon at night with a large flair of some sort!) we watched them move southward slowly in the sky for about 5-6 min. even going into the back yard to see them better. then they just disappeared. we originally thought they went behind cloud cover, but the clouds were sparse and would have emerged quickly. but they were gone in an instant. we kept looking for them and waiting for them to reappear but they didn't, so my hubby & i  went in. i went outside several more times to look again and as i was going out the door maybe 5 min. later, i saw another single one moving out of the northern sky again coming toward the area of our home. it seemed to be lower at first that the other 2. i called for the hubby again and he came out and told me to grab the binoculars since his telecsope was put away for the winter. i brought out both pair and we both looked at this \"thing\" but it just looked like a red fireball in the lens. it moved slowly as well and it also disappeared in the exact spot that the other 2 did. it almost looked like it fizzled out when it got to that same spot, as we were both watching it with the binoculars. we told out daughter about it and she told me to do a google search to see if anyone else saw anything or if there was something going on that would explain it. when i did the search, all i entered was \"pittsburgh pa. jan. 1, 2009. red balls in sky\". immediately, i got a \"hit\" that someone in indiana saw exactly the same thing we did, but i believe the time was a little different. reading on, i see where people all over the world saw the same thing. someone posted a short video of exactly what we saw on ufo stalker dot com but there was only one on their video. we only saw 3 of them but others have seen many more. perhaps there were more & we only caught the tail end, but we definitely saw something that was unlike anything we've ever seen before and it was nothing short of amazing. and no one will tell me it was a weather balloon either! i wonder if now i'll start making mountains out of my mashed potatoes??? lol so glad others have seen it as well.

following the street called hwy 2, right behind the house, it was approximately 200' off the ground and emitting absolutely no noise whatsoever. i watched it for as long as i could, it wasn't moving fast at all, maybe 15-30mph. i noticed no windows or other lights of any kind, and the sky was completely clear that night. i know it wasn't a plane, helicopter or anything else man made. it didn't scare me, i just wish i had a video camera to have tried to capture it. i don't care if anyone believes me, i know my girlfriend didn't, but what i would like to know, is there anyway of getting radar reports of that night to verify that something indeed was there, because i know there was.\r\nthanks

to the north. many solid yellow/orange roundish lights all identical in size and brightness began slowly but steadily began appearing out of treeline in the sky . at first i thought that they were some kind of home made baloon lanterns that were caught in a light low jet stream. i began to think otherwise as i studied them further. the neighborhood was lively with people outside celebrating with fireworks and other outside activities as weather was very clear with very light clouds with nice seasonally cool temps. the stars were out and i would estimate the size of all these lights were about 3 or 4 times the size of the largerst stars out. two or three sets of lights were arranged in a triangular formation and others were strung along solo following the same course.\r\nas i fixed my attention on them i noticed several features, 1)they were all moving the same rate of speed. 2) no blinking or twinkle or change in hue as they traversed from one end of the sky to other. 3) no sound emanating from them at all. 4)all total were 16 strung in a path about wide as my vertical hand raised arms length. 5) distance between first to last is toughest to estimate but they were at one point covering one end (obscured by treeline) to directly over us to a good portion of sky opposite end from initial direction. 6) everything about them was constant - speed, distance, course, formation, color, size, and brilliance. as they began go move furthest away, i noticed a slight changing of course or slowing down then a quick fading effect to disappearance. all 16 faded out/dissapeared at about the same point. i am still wondering how to explain to myself what these were and how large they could have been. i would estimate though minimally between the size of a large bus and a small house, maybe larger. and as for altitude i would best guess 4000-10000 ft. due to clarity of seen lights.    \r\n

the fireworks display. i position myself at a tungku beach facing the hotel from far so that i can frame the fireworks and the hotel all in one frame. when i was there and the fireworks started i started firing shots with my camera using a cable release connected to my canon eos 5d digital camera + canon 70-200mm f2.8 is (l) lens and a manfrotto tripod stand. the firework started exactly 12.00am (+0800gmt) at the empire hotel and country club. the fireworks lasted for about 20-30 minutes. without checking my lcd screen on my camera as most of the shots were burst frames, i left the area. when i was processing the raw images (not jpeg files) captured from the camera i realise there was one shot which had something appearing on the left side of the screen so i zoomed in to see what it was. i was shocked! in the image, the object seemed to be hovering above the water and it looks as if it's not too far away from us. strangely...The object wasn't being seen with my naked eye when i was there. thousands of people gathered around the same area to view the fireworks. if i were to see it with my eyes, probably the others would have saw it too however it wasn't visible as it was quite dark from our view. or maybe... our eye were drawn towards where the fireworks were so i didn't notice it as it seems like the object positioned itself at a darker area (can be seen in the

above the city of el cajon. after a minute or two, the red light seemed to move at a very slow pace toward the southwest. it did not have any blinking lights like an aircraft. its movement was far too slow to be an airplane and it didn���t move in the same fashion as a helicopter.\r\n\r\nwe got off the freeway on the johnson exit, thought about going home, but decided to get a better look at the light instead. so we turned around and started traveling down johnson. we saw a mother and two children standing on the sidewalk pointing at the light. we had the windows rolled down and were going slow enough to hear them asking each other what the light could be.\r\n\r\nabout a block later, we pulled over and began filming the light. the light which had been moving southwest, stopped. a few moments later, the light began traveling in the opposite direction at a slightly faster rate of speed. because it was moving in the direction of our house, we thought we could get home so we could film it with a better quality video camera (the only thing we had with us was a sony cybershot).\r\n\r\nby the time we turned the car around and started toward home, the light had vanished. we only took our eyes off the thing for a minute or two, and then it was gone. if it continued moving at the same slow rate of speed it had been, it should still have been in the sky.\r\nwe're unsure of what the thing was. in all, the sighting lasted about ten minutes or so. i'm sure many others must have seen this light.\r\n\r\nyou can see the light in the clip, as well as a nearby star. because of the low quality of the video though, it is impossible to tell what it is.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then
