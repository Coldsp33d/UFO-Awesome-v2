clouds zig-zagging around together.They definately were not planes, we have an airport 45 minutes away, nor were they anything we have ever seen before.It was impossible to judge the hight as it was dark but they looked very big and changed direction in a flash.They looked like search-lights without the beam and not as bright,nor were there any other lights around them, just stars and the light cloud cover.We were amazed but thrilled as we are avid ufo believers and have seen several odd things in the sky here but never anything like this.We hope they were real and cant think of anything else they could have been.We eventually went up to our roof terrace and watched from there for another 15 minutes or so.The lights seemed to be playing with eatch other moving together then apart and becoming a single one at times.They started to fade and eventually after observing them for a good hour they disappeared.I took some photos and have something on one of them but cant be sure whether i have captured a photo of something and what i have is not a star as these can be seen in the photo. we are definately going to watch for them again tomorrow morning at the same time and will get in

50-east.\r\n   my exit was sunrise blvd in rancho cordova, about 15 minutes before i got off the freeway.    then i began to notice a steel colored object i assumed to be a old world war 2 bomber that are a common sight when the air shows from the nearby military base occur.\r\n    the distant object went from the left side of the freeway, gradually to the right over a 5 minute period.    driving down a semi empty patch of freeway the object came closer, the bright morning sun on the steel glowed off the top making it hard to see.\r\n    after the object moved to the right side of the freeway, a jet came from behind my car, it was impossible to miss from the square intakes to the wings that stood out distinctively that could fold back.\r\n    the cockpit of the jet faced left in a hard turn as it crossed the middle of the freeway, the jet rotated it's orientation facing to the right\r\ndragging it's own weight to counter act the first turn.\r\n in half the turn towards the object as it came close began to change from even flight and started to react as the top of the craft bent in the direction of the jet.\r\n   after the jet \"buzzed\" the object closest, it veered in the opposite direction left, revealing the underside to have a receded  dark ring and a center that was not sunk inward.\r\n  the climax that followed after i was shocked from the first pass followed as the jet made another pass in the same direction, the difference was the object was off to the right more.  as the f-14 approached the object, it was swaying side to side as a response to the object's movement, left to right four or five times. at the last moment something happened, the craft began to disappear from bottom to top, time stood still to me as a witness.\r\n\r\n-i would describe this as transparency, as the craft began to disappear from bottom to top as the darkest regions went first to the upper top right as the brightest as all was seen last as a brilliant refection off a steel hull from the sun that was reduced to a speck in moments.\r\n\r\n-craft was larger than the perusing jet by about 1/3 or more.\r\n\r\n   after the object disappeared, the jet veered off to the right of the freeway, i assumed it went to the air force base near by in ranch cordova again.\r\n\r\ncould not see any windows in the craft due to the sun's reflection, had a shiny steel look to most of the

shape. i immediately came to a stop to watch to look for movement as these were too close for any aircraft formation at night. i raced into my driveway and called for my mom and dad to come out to look at these as well. as i ran back out the door, i saw another appear out of the southeast sky and slowly move towards the other objects. they seemed to be just below the clouds and stayed there for

 the lady was behind me and had already made a left turn on another street so i didn't have time to ask for her help.  i choose to get a closer look.  i drove forward and when i went down the first hill the object went out of my view because trees raised up in front of it.  as i came up the next hill i kept looking left and right but i never seen the object again.  i kept looking the rest of the way home incase i misjudged it's distance from me and incase it moved. \r\n\r\nwhen i got home i told my wife what i seen and then we drove back to the street where i seen it but it was gone.  i few days later i took my digital camera with me to work and on my way home stopped a few places on the street to make pictures of the area the object was hovering above.  after enlarging the pictures on my computer i believe i know which trees, building and tall power pole it was hovering above. next my wife and i drove on all the side streets looking for the building and pole.  we believe we finally found the area on a dirt road with no name that leads to a power sub-station.  i believe the ufo was hovering directly above the sub-station.  we drove to the sub-station and then turned around.  right next to the sub-station is a mobile home with people living in it.  it would have been under the ufo also. i believe the sub-station is only about 1/4 mile from where i could see the ufo, so it was even closer than that since the street went down and then up a hill. as we drove past the trailer a man came out on the front porch staring at us, but i was afraid to stop because we were probably trespassing on his land and how do you start a conversation with a total stranger about a ufo above his house?  the dirt road is a dead end with only one trailer on it and the sub-station.  i often wonder if the people living there seen or heard anything.\r\n\r\ni have lived and worked in this area since 1989 and i have never seen anything that looked like that object in the air or on the ground. some people are probably wondering did i really see it or was i mistaken.  well, that would be like asking someone, can you really see that house or can you really see that building in broad daylight with the sun shinning on it.  yes, i really seen it. i know ufos exist, but i don't know what they are, where they come from, or what they are doing here.\r\n\r\nattached is a picture of the area i seen the ufo.  the ufo was slightly above the trees with the sky visible under it.  it was so wide that the trees on the left side and right side of the street almost blocked some of my view and i guess it was about 2 stories high.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14656,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.4590576,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01012009-0002","longitude":-85.6404932,"occurred":1206403800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alabama","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1206403800000,"summary":"Ufo hovering in daytime.","tags":["ufo","hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/14656_submitter_file1__S5005773.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Ozark, Alabama","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:283967"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Doylestown","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was attempting to get to sleep, i was looking at the sky and i saw a orange light slowly drifting from east to west, i dismissed it as just the rotation of the earth, but now i realize that the other stars were not moving close to as fast as it was moving. i saw and heard nothing as it was very far away, i've seen one of these things every night since then, it seems to be regular. it has moved closer and farther very slowly, it has moved up and down as well at 1-5 mph, it was too far away to see such details as fine shape other than from my vantage point in my 2nd story room. there seems to be something that it watches 30-50 miles in that direction, possibly the doylestown airport. but i'm not familiar to that area. or maybe the air force base a bit farther. each time i saw the object i eventually stop watching, but it tends to take around 30-45 minutes to move across the window. but it seems to move reguarly.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:20:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14655,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.3161963,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-01012009-0001","longitude":-75.1237939,"occurred":1038291300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Fireball,  Sphere,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1038291300000,"summary":"Orange light slowly drifting from east to west.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Doylestown, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:283968"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Riverside","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have vidio that you would not believe,but i am afraid that if i post it thr government will take it and maybe take me. what sould i do?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:24:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14654,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.9576687,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12312008-0025","longitude":-117.3932564,"occurred":1230640200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1230640200000,"summary":"Slow moving no sound.

interchange entering fairfield, ca my husband robert asked me to look at the approaching lights. he asked \"what kind of plane is that?\" i looked up and noticed three large, dark red circular lights pulsating in a line, one would light and fade, then the next would light and fade and then the last would light and fade.  the lighting and fading of the red lights was slow and steady, but definitely in a continual linear pattern. visible as well was one large dark green circle that was lit steadily.\r\n\r\ni said \"it's just a plane\", but he insisted, saying he thought it was something else, as it did not have the typical white strobes and wingtip lights common on aircraft.  i continued to look as he he drove, the craft was coming directly toward us, and would pass overhead shortly.\r\n\r\ni looked up through the moonroof to see it pass directly overhead.  i was amazed to see it was actually a dark grey scalene triangle shaped craft, with not only the the pulsing red and steady green lights, but with three more of the same pulsing red lights along the tail end of the triangle. i told my husband it was definitely not a plane-it was a triangle. it was passing approximately 500' above the freeway, and was approximately 400' long, approximately 150' wide at the wider end of the triangle.  i approximate the size, but in looking through the moonroof (large size on as in an suv) once we were directly under it, the triangle was fully visible through the moonroof and took up the entire view.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch it, but in a few seconds, it seemed to disappear, and we couldn't catch sight of it through the rear view or side view mirrors in the car. we definitely felt after seeing it that we'd seen an unidentified craft of some sort, that it was definitely not a plane.  a very cool experience indeed!\r\n\r\nas a note: robert's dad was in the us air force and he grew up on air bases all over the world, and has not seen an aircraft ever with those light characteristics.  robert was also in the navy and stationed on an aircraft carrier, so he is familiar with planes and their silhouettes-both commercial and military.\r\ni am a trained scientist, with

\"aliens, lets kill them!\". yes, it wasn't the most friendly of greetings but to our limited defense, we were two drunken 18 year olds graduating from a military academy during the 80's, which wasn't one of the most peaceful times in our history. \r\n\r\nafter screaming our welcoming statement, we went on pursuit of the aliens to perform the first interplanetary lynching by an ignorant and drunken mob. i guess they were as perplexed as we were since they just looked at us and didn't move until we were about 10 feet (more or less) from them. suddenly, they reacted and started running. they took off trough the same bushes they came with us right behind. at this time, i was on the lead about 5 feet from the last individual. i could almost grab him with my arm. in fact, that is exactly what i was trying to do.\r\n\r\nafter coming out of the bushes on the other side, they made a left. on the other side of the bushes there was an open field with at least a 50 meter clearing. me and my friend still right behind, lost the figures from view for no more than 1 second. after coming to the other side the aliens where gone. \r\n\r\nthere is no way in hell you could suddenly loose somebody running that close. but when we entered that field, they had just disappeared. we looked around but found no trace of them. and we had been left with a mystery in our hands. up to this day, my friend doesn't discuss the event with anybody for fear of being ridiculed, i don't blame him. he even gets exasperated when i bring it up. i guess i was exited when i watch the show and finally saw somebody that had seen the same aliens we saw and not the \"normal\" gray ones with big heads and big black eyes aliens.\r\n\r\nsomething about missing time, we finally got to our car about 6 - 6:30am (daytime). i have no idea if we really missed and hour or two, or simply got distracted given the events. but when we encountered the aliens it was night and when we arrived at the car it was day. something else, don't ask me why (because i don't know), but i'm sure they were aliens.\r\n\r\ni know this story don't amount to much, but i wanted to thank chris bledsoe for coming forward with his story. i know it has helped me, or at least made me feel less crazy.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":14645,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":18.4588347,"location":null,"logNumber":"PR-12312008-0016","longitude":-66.2676683,"occurred":415353600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":null,"reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":415353600000,"summary":"Brief contact with 2 aliens.","tags":["contact"],"timeZone":"America/La_Paz","timeZoneName":"America/La_Paz","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Dorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:283978"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Branson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving west with my mother on highway 465, approximately five miles northwest of branson, mo.  nearest intersection:  hwy 465 and hwy 76.  i glanced towards the northwest at a 45 degree angle and noticed an object suddenly appearing. i didn't think it could be an airplane because it just suddenly was there, with a clear sky.  it was highly reflective and traveling from the northeast to southwest.  i would estimate it being 2000 feet up and disc shaped-thirty-five to forty feet in diameter.  i watched it for ten seconds before it became darker and began \"peeling\" layers off it's outer rim counterclockwise.  looked like three feet was systematically being stripped away.  this happened for five seconds before it, growing smaller, disappeared completely. i still wonder if this behavior was a \"cloaking\", or if the object was folding in upon itself.  for three weeks afterward i experience \"distorted\" time.  that is, one week felt like five!  highway 465 is seldom used and was nearly vacant when we where traveling on it that thursday afternoon.  this is not the first sighting around branson area i've had.  three weeks later, after slowly recovering from my time distortion, i read about the stephenville, texas sighting, also on october 23, and i wonder if what i saw, somehow related?\r\n  ","distance":"501 Feet -

not side to side like a strobe light. the other feature of this object was the way it glowed. it had the glow of a garage door light. it reminded me of the glow my garage door light gives off with the cover over the light bulb, not bright and somewhat dull. the seperation across the middle was unique as well. after i realized this was not a strobe light i felt a fear run through my body and especially into my stomach. i continued to look into the sky for another few minutes but i did not see anything more. it is difficult to describe the size of this object and how far up it was in the sky. after thinking about it for a while and using a plane as a comparison i would have to say it was the size of four airplanes but round. i went in the house and told my wife and daughter and they could tell i wasn't kidding. my daughter and i tend to hold similiar views on this type of thing and she asked a few questions and that was the end of it. i have never seen a ufo before, i have always wanted too. to me, this was a ufo.
