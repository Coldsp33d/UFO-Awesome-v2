mountain ranges. i was waiting while my dog went out and to my left a flashing object in the sky caught my attention. we have many planes and helicopters fly over from time to time or that can be spotted in the sky, but this was unusual. i began watching it and noticed it appeared to hover over the mountain top. it was at about 15 degrees above the horizon and in the north northwest area. it was flashing white lights in what seemed like a circular motion and then occasionally another color or two would come in like a green/blue, maybe red. i know most airplanes have red and green lights, as do helicopters but the pattern and flashing of the lights wasn't typical of either. the object hovered above the mountain top for a few seconds and then i noticed it was beginning to descend. the object began moving at a very smooth pace. it began to disappear behind the frame of our gazebo and i moved to follow it the best i could. it continued to descend and eventually i lost it behind the mountain range. i haven't seen it since. what was unusual about it is i have seen plenty of planes and helicopters fly over those mountains but never disappear or hover above them. it could simply be some odd landing or occurrence but it definitely is unidentified. right after it disappeared i waited to see if it would come back up, unfortunately it did not. i then came in and spoke to my dad about it, who tried to take a very scientific approach to the issue. he went outside with me and i told him what i had seen and then re-enacted the event and even he said it didn't sound like anything he was familiar with. \r\n\r\n1. i was in my backyard in south corona, ca taking my dog outside. \r\n\r\n2. i first noticed the object when i saw the bright and unusual flashing lights out of the corner of my eye. \r\n\r\n3. when i first noticed it i thought it was probably an airplane that just happened to be at an odd angle with really bright lights. \r\n\r\n4. it was moving at a very calculated pace and didn't seem to do any strange or odd movements except that it smoothly descended straight down and behind the mountain range toward the chino hills/yorba linda area, which i am not familiar with any aerial objects doing in this area. and there are plenty we have seen flying around.\r\n\r\n5. i felt intrigued. i am always looking up at the skies, day and night and its always interesting to see something out of the ordinary. i was excited to be quite honest but also disappointed i couldn't get a better view of it to know more of what it could be. it also disappointed me when it disappeared behind the mountain range. \r\n\r\n6. i unfortunately lost sight of the object when it descended behind the mountain range. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

decided to go and take a walk to calm things down a little bit. we started walking down our country road and we were talking to each other trying to pass the time as we walked down the long country road. we had decided walk to my fiances parents house. it was a six mile walk so we took about 3,  15minute breaks. and about halfway there we had noticed that it had started to get dark out so we tried to hurry up before it got dark. we had tried to pass time by finding star formations like the big dipper and orion and orions belt. it was pretty dark and everything silent and still and there had not been any traffic at that point. as my fiance walked i still stared at the stars both not speaking just walking at that moment i had noticed a large orange/red light that blinked itself into existance thinking nothing nothing of it i was about to look away when out of nowere in a curved line. more orbs one by one apeared one after the other until there was a total of five, shock instantly filled me. at that moment i knew it wasnt no airlplain! i shouted for my fiance to look at the objects in the sky and the objects seemed to be hovering there not moving. she didnt like what she saw and wanted to leave quickly and at that time i was still watching the objects in the sky. she was a little scared at what she saw and started to walk at a fast pace to hurry and get to her parents house. as i looked up again the strange orbs instantly shot and darted around each other, one shot instanly from left to right without hesitation then vanished. i hurried down the road almost to my destination trying to calm my fiance down. at this time there was still no sound it was unnatuarally quiet. i looked to see if the lights were still there but they vanished, then out of nowere an extremly lound unatural skreech that sounded like it was right next to my head which made me and my fiance stop dead in our tracks and every hair in my body stood srait up at that time we were both frightened i looked around but didnt see anything but we started to run quickly to her parents house at that time we were almost there and still didnt see anything and then we finally made it there.It

about 4 miles west of hesperia michigan when far off, miles and miles away, west almost due west and just slightly south we both saw a day glow/lime green tiny dot in the sky. in less than 10 seconds it dropped and came directly at us, almost straight on. in what seemed like only a very few seconds it was on us covering literally miles in only a few seconds and it's emense size literally covered and engulfed our 1979 gray chevy pickup. the first fear was of a head on collision. the absolute shock and fear was indescribable. at this point we were both covered in a brilliant and unbelievable lime/florescent green light that completely blocked out any view outside the truck. we were both completely illuminated in green light. at this point i was in complete un describable terror and total shock like i have never known before or since. i turned to my now ex wife literally screaming with out hearing myself, wondering if i was personally going insane or god knows what only to see her in

swerving or even time to react before we went from complete shock to hmmm that was interesting. we both watched the green oval object fly off in a south west direction, more southerly than it had approached, over the trees and off into the far distance and up into the sky disappearing from sight as it seemed to climb far off in the distance. we continued the last 3 miles to our house on loop rd.\r\n\r\nwe did not have a watch or a car clock. when we got home it was 9 o'clock. then i was even more confused. where had the near hour gone? at this point i called the oceana sheriff office and made a report, just in case someone else saw or experienced this. the officer was very nice and took it all seriously and stated \" i have known officers that have seen things they couldn't explain

ok\r\n\r\nan unusual sighting occurred this evening around 7 ��� 7:30 pm.  there were several club members, astronomy club of tulsa, at the club���s observatory tonight to take advantage of the very good clear sky along with the early setting of a lovely crescent moon.  it was a great night for observing!\r\n\r\ni had stopped to get a cup of coffee and was talking with a friend. i was facing east when out of nowhere an extremely bright light appeared in the east.  it was located at an approximate altitude of 50 degrees and was directly between the constellations auriga and orion, directly above canis minor.  when it first appeared, just below elnath in auriga, it was extremely bright, equivalent to if not brighter than venus. venus���s magnitude tonight was at -4.3, which should give you a rather obvious idea as to its brightness.  at first sight the first quick thought that came to mind was the possible passing of an iridium satellite.  but no, even those don���t just pop up out of nowhere. you can always find them and then watch as they brighten up and continue on their marry way until they dim out completely.  simple info for these is easily accessed and in so doing you would know both the time it will appear as well as what direction it will be coming from and going to. the same holds true for the iss. can find it on its orbital track and then watch it as it passes getting brighter and then dimming out to nothing when it finally crosses the terminator.  this one wasn���t anything like either of what i���ve just described.  extremely bright and had one strobe light on top. \r\n\r\nfrom it���s initial point of appearance it dropped straight down to within what i would estimate as three or four degrees above the star gomeisa in canis minor.  from that point it stopped coming straight down and began to slowly dim as it suddenly was heading straight east.  the strobe on top was in it���s own right unusual due to there not being any position lights or anti-collision lights visible.  it���s very commonplace to all of us to see private planes, airliners even military aircraft flying around at night while we���re observing out at the club���s observatory. on rare occasion we get the pleasure of seeing a blimp or even an ultra-light but they never look like what was seen tonight. private planes, easily determined as to what they are from not only the position light configuration, common amongst all aircraft along with the common sound/noise from their engines. this object produced absolutely no sound of any kind.  nope, not a meteor, no way, meteors don���t have strobes.  it was considered that it may have been a plane and due to its distance from us we may not have been able to hear it. perhaps so but . . . since it was heading directly away from us it only seems logical that we would���ve stood at least half a chance to hear its engines and also make out it���s position lights (red, green). unfortunately, no to all of those possibilities were provided by whatever it was. \r\nwhat is most unusual is that it simply appeared out of nothing. if it were a plane, well, they don���t have backup light���s which it would���ve had to have to remain bright as it was moving away from us. not only this but airliners, private planes and military transports or otherwise don���t have a circular/ball shape fuselage to begin with. it remained in this form until it was out of sight in the east. airliners and large military transports landing lights are bright but nowhere near the brightness level that was initially displayed by whatever this happened to be. \r\n\r\nit remained in sight for about thirty seconds at the most until it was finally gone over the eastern horizon.  again, very unusual, most certainly not anything like what we���ve seen time after time in this area. most generally it���s rather easy to see a plane and know what it is ��� especially at night.\r\n\r\nonce it had disappeared, jokingly, i told my friend we had just witnessed an aurora coming in out of orbit and heading back east to wright-patterson afb.  an obvious reaction after seeing something that we had no idea as to what it was.\r\n\r\nhave you ever heard of any type aircraft appearing such as i���ve described? if so, it will be a new one to all of us here.  if not, we haven���t the slightest idea as to what it may have been. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

again i tried to write it off as an airplane since the area i was in was located to a major airport. it never moved. it sat there hovering approximately 300 feet over the freeway and as i drove closer i realized the object was a rectangular shape with only the two lights on it, being that there was no direct light hitting it i could not make out the color, only the shape. the object was in the same

i asked my step-son if he saw what i was seeing? he said yeah, what is that? we didn't know what it was? my next instinct was it had to be a ufo! as we drove under it there was no sound no movement!

still didnt move so i went and got some binocs to try to get a better look at it that took a fue mins when i got back out it was still there in the same spot now thats been about 15 min sence i first spotted it i looked in the glasses and it was shakey so i got to the can in the yard to steady my hands then i could see the thing much better at this time the clouds start to come back in but the light was still strong enought to get through most of that thick cloud now at this time the clouds are going by with holes in them so i can get about a min & half look at a time (now i must say that this started at 5:45pm and at 7:30pm the clouds have cleared out and its gone a star would move but it would still be there) the light was like arc welding bright just looking at it but with the glasses it looked as if there were 2 to 3 big lights that seemed to have light beams like beam or arm like coming off of them then the big lights merged togther and the beams formed a thing that looked like a triangle and some tinny ligts were swerling around and while that was happening a small light started wipping all around so fast almost all i could see was were the light had started then a ribon like strobe then were it would stop then it would do it all over again all very fast all around the now tri.Looking thing or light? then the clouds got to thick i kept looking to see when the louds would clear and when they did it was gone if it was a star it would have just moved west a bit but it would still be up there rite???? i must add that up here in the seattle area in which i have lived here for over 50 years we have boing here i know what planes look like in the sky this did not look or act like any plane that i have ever seen

slowly and smoothly. sometimes they would stop in approximately the same place for upwards of 5 minutes. \r\n\r\napprox. one hour later i stepped out front again and the bright light/star i had seen earlier was no longer their. however, the strobing red and white lights were still able to be seen moving throughout the sky. i sepped out about 5 more times between 7pm and midnight and still see the

bright fast moving sphere.  it didn't seem to be very high, and living close to a small airport, i can usually recognize rough height and distance of crafts in the sky.  however, this situation is a bit different, as the bright light didn't seem to be more than 50~70 ft. above the ground and i have never witnessed anything moving so quickly.  there wasn't a noise, not a trail following the light, just a fast moving bright orb heading due west.  then it disappeared over the adjacent treeline.  the total time we saw the object was appoximately 2~3 seconds.  it was traveling too low and much too fast to be a small airplane, as there is an airport approximately 3 miles due north of the sighting.  i have never been freightened of anything i have seen in the sky before, but i turned to my friend and he said \"what the hell was that!\"  i said \"i don't know,\" so to feed our curiousity we drove straight toward the direction of the object, turned south onto hwy 41 drove 0.5 miles and circled back to the origin and didn't see the object again.  i asked my friend \"ok, that object was clearly in the sky, correct?\"  he replied \"yes.\"  i said \"can you identify that object?\"  he replied \"no.\"  i said \"i want to report this, and hopefully someone else saw the same thing.  as i type this, hairs are standing up on my neck, as i can't explain what i just witnessed.","distance":"21-100

puppy out to go to the bathroom. it was a very quiet night and the sky was clear. the only sounds were crickets and the sound of semi tractors traveling down interstate 65 which is about 4 miles from my house. as i looked up i noticed what at first i thought was an airplane traveling from southeast to the northwest. i saw three solid orangish lights in a triangular shape. the lights did not blink or change shape or color. the object was low enough that during the day you could easily identify what type of plane it was if it were a plane. the object traveled relatively slow overhead. i would expect if the object were a plane it would traveled overhead in a matter of seconds however the object took 3 or more minutes to pass. the sound of the object made a sound similar to a jet engine except it was intermittent. it nade a swoosh sound like a jet engine for about 2 or 3 seconds then it died down to where you could hear nothing but the crickets. then about 2 or 3 seconds later the jet sound came back. this continued until the object was completly out of sight. i have been in the military for 20 years and live just outside a national guard training post. i have seen all types of aircraft, various types of jets and helicopters and this was nothing like i had ever seen before. i just sttod there and stared at the object. i didn't want to go in and try to find a camera or wake my wife because i was afraid the object would have passed before i made it outside.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

was just like you see earth from space except that it had reds and oranges on it as well as blue and green.  if i hold my arm in front of me and balance a football on my hand, that was about the size

seemed, above my next door neighbours roof and carried on in an arc till it disappeared behind the roofs in the next street.  given the angle it was travelling i totally expected to hear it crash.\r\n\r\nthe whole sighting lasted just a few seconds, during which i was too amazed and stunned to say anything. just as it disappeared, i managed to say something and my partner turned and just

out of the windshield of our vehicle to the northeast, four bright, solid orange points of light high in the sky in a type of vee formation.  they were slowly travelling easterly(toward canada).  i first assumed that they were helicopters from selfridge afb but, they started to loop around each other(as if tumbling) and go in different directions relative to each other but generally staying close together.  i then pulled the vehicle over and got out of the car.  i listened for any noise of engines or the such.  it was totally quiet. there were no noises to be heard.  we then proceeded to watch the four lights as they progressed eastward, continually looping and turning around each other until one by one they faded out of sight.  they never changed color nor did they blink at all. this went on for approx. 3-5 minutes.\r\n \r\n  when they faded out we i got back into the car and we headed home. i have seen alot of meteors, space debris, shooting stars, ect. in my life but i have never seen anything like this.  it was quite fascinating. i'm not saying that this was definately a ufo or not, but we still seen these lights in the sky that i could not explain and i wanted to pass
