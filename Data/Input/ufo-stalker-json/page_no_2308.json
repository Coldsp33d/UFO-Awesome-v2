my top down on my audi convertible. i was parked in a parking lot in the middle of the galleria shopping area in uptown houston.  i had a date that night and we were suppossed to meet at 7:30.  she called to say she was running late and to make it 7:45.\r\ni parked in the lot to kill time.  while listening to the radio i just happened to glance up to the sky.  it was a relatively clear night with some lingering clouds in the area.  however, i looked up just in time to see this bright white object jetting across the sky.  this was the fastest thing i had ever seen and the sighting lasted about 4-6 seconds.  the object was fairly low, but high above the skyline of buildings in the area.  it came out of nowhere and quickly disapeared from sight as it entered a group of darker clouds.  i thought i would be able to see the light from the object through the thin clouds, but it simply vanished.  the white color was almost like a solid color.  it was not like lights from a plane or a street lights or anything that i can say i've seen before.  it was a solid light.  no flashing.  i have seen several falling stars and meteorites, but this object had no tail.  i thought it odd that if it were a falling star, it wasn't really falling, it was flying in a level trajectory. it wasn't breaking apart into the atmosphere either.\r\ni also thought if it was a meteorite it surely would have crashed in a very populated area,yet no sounds or visuals to confirm that.\r\nin the short time i witnessed this object i can honestly say i don't know what it was, but in my opinion this was an object that was under some kind of navigational control.  the impression i had was it was a flying, solid object flying on it's own power.\r\nthe object was shaped like an excedrin tablet/capsule and again a solid white illumination.\r\nthis incident happened for only seconds, but i think i saw something extraordinary and it has been on my mind ever since.\r\n  ","distance":"101-500

(with two opposite red lights each side that turned on shortly after) which seemed like a star or planet. having never seen such in the night sky before i continued to observe it. i was standing facing south/south east compass bearing 170 degrees (taken later for report) and looking directly upward. this bright light was near what looked like another bright star or planet as i am not a well versed astronomer so i can't describe by names. i���m sure there is available star/planet charts for date and time if made available to me i could then point out where it was that i saw this.\r\n\r\nas i looked up at this unusual colored star it appeared to be a very large type star or planet. the light was pulsating. it then also appeared to get slightly bigger and move from side to side about in an inch square. it was then the two red small lights came on one each side. this went on for a few minutes when all of a sudden this light took off south/south east compass bearing 170 degrees at an extremely high rate of speed. no sound nor noise was heard or seen. at approximately the two o���clock position a smaller particle of the same bright light was ejected/departed the main light and they both soon disappeared into the horizon. \r\n\r\nhow i felt... not sure... weird, stunned, amazed... i'm a retired paramedic/fireman with both military and civilian background. as a trained observer over the years i notice many things others don't. i had gone out to get a breath of fresh air and is customary i look upwards and stargaze. as i was testing out a new flashlight i only wish i had looked up a few minutes earlier to have seen more.\r\n\r\nyou may contact me if you wish but i'd like my name and contact info private. you can use my observation also.\r\nsincerely,

her car. i noticed an incredibally bright white object in the north west sky at approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. i pointed this out to her, and i said what is that.I commented to her that i knew that a few weeks back three planets were alligned w/ the moon, but i thought that was in the eastern sky. she left and i contnued to watch the object untill 7:15, when i called a friend to see if he could see it. he could not get outside. i went inside, called 411 and called vandenburg afb. they had no info. i called edwards afb but was unable to reach anyone. i called 411 again and called kabc channel 7 news. they said they had no info. i returned outside, approximately 7:30 and the object was in the same place and was still the same level of intense brightness.  at this point i remembered that i had some binoculars in my vehicle, and thinking that they would help, i retrieved them.  i remember thinking this whole time that there must be some rational easy explanation for this thing i was seeing in the sky. a helicopter, or blimp, or planet. at this point,7:40, i was talking to a friend in new mexico on the cell phone, and he's telling me it's a weather ballon reflecting the sun.When i looked thru the binoculars i knew 2 things. it wasn't a planet, it was too close, and i could not identify what it was. it was still stationary, realative to the power lines across the street. it was so bright that it appeared to light up the sky underneath it. it was hard to discern it's actual shape. it was oval to the naked eye, but thru the binoculars it appeared to be tear dropped shape and oval, and bullet shaped. i think this was because it was so bright, i could not really see the object that was producing the light. at this point i thought it hasn't moved for 45 minutes, it's not going anywhere. i went inside to use the restroom and returned about 4 minutes later. i was shocked when it was not there. i walked west toward the street and saw that it had dropped untill it was about 30 degrees above the hozizon. i could not believe that i had missed its movement. at this point, to the naked eye the object was less bright and slighty orangeish, but still the brightest thing in the sky. thru the binoculars it was still to bright to clearly make out what it was. although i could not notice it's movement, probably because i was watching mostly thru the binoculars, the object continued it's descent. briefly i climed atop a retaining wall in the alley, to give me more height but at 8:11 pm i could no longer see it because it had descended too low. at this point it still looked white thru the binoculars, but it appeared more orangeish to the naked eye.","distance":"Over One

november, approximately nov. 26th. in the sky above northwest indiana. there was a smaller, much dimmer object close to the bright object as well. i noticed it and was a taken aback a bit because the object was so large and bright. i had taken classes in astronomy at purdue with a telescope with high magnification before, i have seen the planets upclose, and i had never seen an object so large,bright, and close as the one i am describing. i mentioned to my boyfriend the following night on the way to kokomo,in for a family thanksgiving get together that i saw the bright object and the near by dim object in the sky. he saw it also,and the hour and half drive from porter county to kokomo, indiana, i watched the object. i thought the object was maybe the iss or satellite of some kind so i wrote it off. on thanksgiving night, my boyfriend and i drove from kokomo, in back to nw indiana and then to charlotte, mi to drop off my son with his grandmother. while on the drive, sitting in the passenger seat i noticed the objects again, and could see them all the way to charlotte, mi. again, very very bright light, but not really all that interesting. it hadn't moved or anything in a strange manner, but it did get dimmer and brighter rather quickly,eratically,and drastically, not like a star,rhythmically. after arriving home, i saw the lights, one dim and one very bright from my porch. for the next few nights both my boyfriend and i saw these two lights, not changing, but were odd. my brother called me the next day from workand asked me if i had seen weird bright lights in the sky. i had told my brother the sequence of events now being described and he said that they were visible from his work, in cedar lake, in. night after night for almost two weeks my boyfriend, brother, and i saw these lights in southwest sky. they didn't move like stars which shift in position each night slightly, it was almost as if the lights stayed stationary every night at the same time. i wouldgo out about eight o'clock to see the lights and they would be in the same spot, but the rest of the stars would not. for example, the lights were close to orion's belt at first but then as orion's belt shifted, the lights never moved. finally, having an insomniac moment on or around dec. 18th, about 4 am, i decided because i couldn't sleep, i would stare at the lights out my bedroom window. we just moved into the area and had not put up blinds yet so i could lie in my bed and see the lights. however, what i thought would be a boring bright light that would put me to sleep, turned out to be something else all together. i watched the bright object for about twenty minutes when the light started to move back and forth, like it was jumping back and forth. the object turned green, then blue and finally red. the object got dimmer to where it almost was invisible, and then got so bright i had to rub my eyes. i woke up my boyfriend to make sure i wasn't crazy and he went to another room to see what the lights were doing. he noticed too that the lights moved eratically, almost jumping and then the bright object turned a violet color and split into three separate objects. one of the \"offspring\" from the parent object came back to the center, fused with another \"offspring\" and became bright again. the third seemed to stay distant to the two fused objects and was much dimmer. after we witnessed this, the object dimmed completely and could not be seen. there was no wind that night and the object could be clearly seen from my window away from the trees. i thought the object was very strange at first because it was so bright and low in the sky. after seeing this strange split, i felt an eerie sense that this was not an object like a star or planet. again, night after night we could see the lights right above the evergreen trees just in the front of our house. until tonight, dec. 28th. the lights moved down the street above the middle school, approximately three blocks from my house and i took a video of it. i thought it was odd that after almost a month of being in the same position, it had finally moved. what was even more odd to me was the fact that i could see the object with no problem from the park near my house through the video camera, but i had to zoom in to see the other stars, and planets like venus. also, i checked the nasa iss position, and it is not visible from my house for more than six minutes, but i video taped this object for more than six minutes. i'm not a skeptic, but i am a biochemist and i wondered if any one on your team could tell me what the lights were, whether there has been a satellite in orbit for the last month, or whether this was truly unidentifiable. i plan to film the object again if it is in the sky tomorrow night. thanks!!!    \r\n\r\n p.S. i do have the video of the object but am unable to locate the cord to download the video off of my camera at the moment. i can give you video as soon as i find the cord though.

bright light in the sky that seemed \"out of place\". as i continued to watch it, i realized that it was not an airplane or helicopter since it appeared to be stationary. it was also too bright to be a star or planet. the light was white. my friend came out & as he started to get in the car, i asked him to look and say what he thought it was. he said he didn't know, but that he'd seen it before.

it!), we continued to observe the \"object\" & noticed that it was about 20-30 miles away, but that it also seemed to have slightly descended. right after this, my friend said that it was \"beaming light down\", but i couldn't look away from the road at that point. when i could look again, it had apparently stopped. several seconds later, it developed a \"tail\" for a split-second,then streaked away at an impossible angle & speed, then was gone. the time it took for it to vanish, from \"tail\" to disappearance was a second or less. at the time, i didn't want to tell anyone anything for fear

32,000 feet altitute.  i was flying from atlanta, georgia to ontario, california. i had the urge to look out the window because i wanted to see if there were any visible ground structures which would indicate to me that we were not too far away from our destination.  i first i saw the lights at quite some distance below, but thought that we were flying low enough to be able to see structures on the ground, but what caught my attention was the patterns of the lights was something i had never seen before (the appearance was like electrical discharges).  after i followed the lights below, i activated the flight map on the computer screen and it indicated that we were flying at an altitute between 31,000 to 32,000 which immediately indicated to me that we were to high above the ground to be able to view any structures on the ground.  i stopped looking out the window and just sat back and tried to make sense of what i just had seen.  within ten to fifteen minutes later i decided to look out the window again and that is when i saw the three semi-domes flying at almost our same altitute close enough to where i was able to see details of the aircraft.  i saw what appeared to be semi-dome shaped objects.  due to the darkness i was only able to see the areas that were illuminated.  there were a total of three (a smaller one in the front, a larger one in the center, and a smaller one in the rear).  our plane was travelling to the west and the objects were travelling towards the east.  they appeared to be following each other.  they were travelling to the right side of the delta aircraft at a distance where i was able to see details of the semi-dome shaped object.  the illuminated area seemed to be composed of some sort of glass or see through type of material, which were composed of several one piece  panels (five or six individual panels from top to bottom).  what appeared to me to be the strangest thing was that there was some sort of a light or electrical impulse (similar to the ones used in monitors at hospitals to monitor heart rates) which would travel counter clock wise continously across the center of what appeared to be glass panels.  i looked at these objects for quite some time trying to comprehend what i was observing.  i am an aircraft aficionado and i've watched just about every documentary on the discovery channel and national geographic aircrafts and i've never seen an aircraft similar to what i saw that evening.  due to the darkness i was not able to observe if the bottom of the objects (or base) were connected to each other or if they were all independent from each other.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14583,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0516681,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12282008-0021","longitude":-111.0899011,"occurred":1229328000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1229328000000,"summary":"While

generally watch the stars to look at the constellations and such when i noticed a very bright light coming from northern san antonio and moving southward at a very slow speed considering the altitude in which this object appeared to be flying. at first they did seemed to look like airplane landing lights due to the intensity of the white colored light, but the direction and sheer altitude made this very unlikely. the craft itself was not visible through the bright light and as the object went overhead i could see that this craft did not have the traditional red and green lights which are mandated by the faa, if the craft did have the  lights in question, they were not on, not so likely next to a major airport.  after about 10 minutes the light went dimmed and eventually disappeared as if it started to travel upward. after that moment, it was gone. it was like nothing i have ever seen before. i have seen satellite many, many times. this was not one of those times","distance":"Over

only my dog and two cats were home when this happened. i'm not sure if this happened in 1999, or the year 2000.\r\n\r\nwhile standing in my kitchen there was a very large explosion nearby. it felt like it was underground or right near the surface. the entire house shook for just a second or two. i grabbed onto the counter to steady myself and my dog who had been standing in the kitchen near me scrambled a bit to steady herself.  it felt like someone nearby had either dropped something very large, or something very large had fallen over, or something right on the surface or underground had exploded. after steadying myself i ran outside to look around. i didn't hear or see anything unusual. the area was mostly rural, not many homes nearby. \r\ni then went back inside to call my mother-in-law who lived nearby but she was not home. on my way back to work i called my husband to tell him about it. all through the rest of the day i checked the radio on the news, the television and the newspaper. i saw nothing about an explosion. i continued to check about it for the next several days but never found anything.\r\nthe other day i caught a television story about ufo occurrences. some people in indiana had heard/felt a very large explosion. seeing the show prompted me to check the internet and share my story to see if anyone else had experienced anything similar.\r\n\r\nthank

we had just got out of going to see a movie. my granfather , my brother bob and his friend steve.Not much to do in a small minning town (chuquicamata) in the northern part of the andes in chile. my grandfather saw it first as he pulled the car to the side of the road. this object was massive as it silently hoovered over the main hospital of the town, which sits on a hilltop. it was a huge series of lights in a circular pattern , slowly rotating in one direction then to the next. what caught my eye is the streetlights leading up the hill and the hospital lights were all out. this object was totally silent. then it rolled on its side to where the circle was now verticle. at this point i could make out a distinct rumble. at that point the object shot over the horizon at an incredible rate of speed , leaving a gold like trail which lingered in the air before disapating. i do remember that none of us were afraid but rather excited . since , i have studied ufos my whole life.
