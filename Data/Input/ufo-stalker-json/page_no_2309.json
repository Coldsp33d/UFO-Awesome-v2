States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was on my way to work at about 6:15am on the morning of dec. 18, 2008.  i had just entered i-15 in layton heading south when i saw something flashing out of the corner of my right eye.  i drive a large box truck to work and it has large mirrors just like a semi would have.  my initial reaction for a split second was that there was an emergency vehicle behind me, but when i looked in the right-side mirror there was nothing close behind me.  then just above and left of the mirror, in the top right corner of the windshield i noticed an object in the distance.  it was in the sky to the southwest of layton and at first appeared to be about 15 miles away.  in my mind i knew that this would put it in the area of the salt lake int'l airport.  from my point of view it looked like a ball of light, one side green and one side red.  i immediately thought it was an airplane that was too far away for me to see clearly.  my office window at work faces the airport's flight path and is only about 2 miles directly south of the airport, so i see planes very close all day long.  anyway, i looked away for just enough time for me to think to myself that the lights weren't flashing at all.  i looked back over and noticed that the object had not moved whatsoever.  then, almost immediately an extremely bright beam of light shot out from the object and did about a 5 second scan across the cloud cover before all of it just disappeared in an instant.  just vanished.  when the beam shot out i also noticed that the object did appear to be a green and red \"ball\" of light and not two seperate lights as i'd first assumed.  the thing is is that when the beam lit up the clouds i realized that it was closer than i'd first estimated.  this time it seemed to be only about 5 miles maximum from where i was.  the beam itself also looked very odd.  it was extremely bright and lit up the clouds enough that i could see everything it scanned perfectly.  it happened pretty fast, but it definitely sent chills down my spine.  it was like nothing i'd ever seen before and the fact that it disapperared right in front of my eyes absolutely astounds me.  i kept looking for it throughout my entire drive and then some more when i got to work, but nothing.  one thing i did notice was that all of the planes i could see remained visible even after they had broken through the cloud cover, and they were even farther away than whatever it was that i saw.  i also noticed that every plane i saw in the sky that morning had two things in common that the other object didn't have.  first, all of the other planes had flashing lights and secondly, all of the planes lights were distinctly seperated from one another.  meaning i could see space between the lights.  i did consider the possibility of a helicopter, but i thought why would a helicopter be flying over the great salt lake?  especially at 6 in the morning. and why would it be scanning the sky instead of the ground or lake?  as i said before, i litterally watch planes take off and land from my office all day long.  i've had this office for about two years and not one time have i ever seen anything using any sort of spotlight.  never.  i checked in the paper, online, the news and even checked your site for an explanation.  i felt (and still feel) like there is no way that i could've been the only person to see this.  it was far too bright and far too peculiar.  i'm not saying that what i saw was an \"alien spacecraft\".  howeveer, i am saying that what i saw was by all definitions an unidentified flying object.  it gave me a sense of shock and excitement that turned to awe and wonder after i had some time to wrap my head around it.  it was very exciting and i feel like i have to share it.  i initially shared it with my boss and some co-workers immediately after it happened without really thinking what i would sound like.  i was met with jokes and strange looks like i was crazy.  bottom line is i don't care.  i know what i saw.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

awhile when i turn to look up at him that is when i noticed an unusual bright white light.  i stated to him \"oh look here comes a satilite.\" he then turned to look and  stated \"oh yes, i see it.\"  as we both were continue to look at it, he then said with concern \"that's no satilite.\"  you can tell it was some great distance away but could not help notice that it was coming closer.  it wasnt coming closer as if to fly over but to pass by. as it was getting closer you can tell it was getting brighter but the light was changing too, the white light got so intense that it got bigger but now the light was a goldish bright color that it was an intensly twinkling and sparkling, it was like it was building up when suddenly the lights flared up then went out. i then said \"it disappeared!\" my brother then said \"yelp, its gone.\"  no sooner that he said that when the lights came back but they were red.  we knew this was no satillite, plane, helicopter or star.  the light was too bright, sparkley, intense.  no beams shining down or anything like that. no sound, you heard nothing.  if it was a plane or helicopter you would be able to hear it even at a great distance.\r\n\r\nnot knowing what it was we both stood still just watching it, not wanting to take our eyes off it just to see which direction it will go.  it was moving at a slow pace. when the lights came back on we notice that there were three (3) red lights and each light was shaped as a circle close together but not touching but in a shaped of a v pointing towards the direction it was going.  still moving the same pace.  but these red lights were bigger but not brigher then the white goldish lights before. \r\n\r\ntrees that were in the line of site had gotten in the way.  i move side ways to get a better view when now there were six (6) red lights.  a little smaller only because they were moving away from us.  i could not tell if the same v shape was there other then the lights now look together.  i can not tell you directions if it was north south east or west. my brother could give those types of directions but if i have to guess i'll say they were coming from the southeast to the northwest. how high or how far, i do not know.\r\n\r\nwe stayed outside watching this till we could not see them anymore.  the whole event lasted about 10 mins or less. during this event i was shocked and surprised to the point that i would catch myself not breathing.  i was very excited to have witnessed this. i will be going back to his property in hopes to see it again and maybe get a picture or two.\r\n\r\ni

the trip was to visit my grandmother in her long term care facility. i live in tennessee and do not get up there very often as of late. i caught a cub's game and visited with my family for 4 days. my aunt and uncle own a lake house on lake michigan about 20 miles south of st. josephs on the beach. it is a beautiful place and extremely relaxing at night. the beach house is never the main reason i visit, but a nice bonus when my family offers it up for a few days of oasis. this visit my aunt allowed my girlfriend and i to stay there for two days, sept. 1st and sept second.\r\nwe arrived early on sept 1st and unpacked, went down to the beach and enjoyed the sun, later took in some shopping and had dinner. we noticed everyone packed up early afternoon and left there vacation homes due to the holiday weekend ending. we had planned to be back to tennessee on tuesday night so we had the beach to ourselves that monday night. the beach is basically a sand dune with a hundred feet of sand to the water. the water this night was calmer than usual and the night sky was clear and bright, yet without a moon. that afternoon i dug a pit for a fire and set it up knowing it would be hard to do that night with the wind, wasted time seeing that that night was extremely calm with tiny waves. people whom know this area, know that it can be very violent at night with huge waves and a brisk wind. we lucked out this night.\r\nwe had smores, a bottle of wine, fully prepared to spend an evening on the beach. we finished the wine and the smores and snuggled up by the fire. there was not a light to be seen for miles north and south along the beach. the only hint of light was st joseph's dull glow in the distance, 20 miles or so up the beach. \r\nthe later it was, the colder it was, and the more we fully covered up. i am telling you this because i think what happens next is a result of two things: being fully covered up in the sand and directly behind a fire facing lake michigan.\r\nwe fell asleep and had to have been asleep for an hour or so. still fully covered by a blanket, i woke up and shook my girlfriend waking her up, so we could make the trip up the dune and to bed. as i uncovered my head, lying on my back, i rolled on my stomach and looked straight north up the beach. not more than 50 yards from me was a bright light, and i mean bright, a spotlight, like one you see shining at a carnival. i know what you are thinking, wow, that is not unusual, well let me finish. this light was stationary, pivoting from a stationary point directly over the shoreline, shining in the empty vacation homes and up and down the beach. within seconds, my girlfriend rolled over and we both stayed covered and gazing north at this light. this light was coming out of nothing, roughly 30 feet to 50 feet in the air, i could see the abrubt beginning and end of the light source. it reminded me of a flud light above a garage, only brighter and with no building. the light never moved location, only direction it was pointed in, from the edge of the water towards land. the stability of the source frightened me because that ruled out any of the five hundred things my mind was feverishly trying to catagorize this as. not a boat because i would be able to see the boat and the water was 2 feet deep under the location of the light. i do not remember what i said to my girlfriend, i just know she was just as shocked to be witnessing this as i was. it was calm and clear that night, no noise, only the gentle swish of the water rolling onto the shore. this light was close enough to us for me to throw a football and hit it square, extremely close. as the light pivoted up the beach away from us, still from the same 50 yard location, we could see more clearly the fact that it was coming out of nothing, clear sky!!!!\r\nthe light was very defined as for its boundries, i mean as it went up the dune, a very defined circle of light was cast on the beach and the dunes. at this point i ran out of explanations, some things do not need analyzing for you to know something is wrong. still facing the light and peaking out of the blanket, we found ourselves looking directly into the light, as it moved south along the beach towards us. the light disappeared as soon as it hit the spot we were laying. it was not blinding, which shocked me. we jumped up and could see nothing. although no moonlight was present, the stars were plenty of light for us to have seen anything in the location of the light. we saw nothing, gone, thin air. my girlfriend said, and i quote, \"it went into cloakmode.\" usually i would laugh at something like that but it strangely seemed appropriate. \r\ni am a big guy, i mean i work out regularly and am scared of no one, yet something in me kept telling me to put the fire out and get upstairs, so i did.\r\nthis has been driving me crazy. i am glad to get it off my chest!

a movie at the local theatre. i went up on top of the building in which i formerly worked, lied out on a sleeping bag and gazed into the sky for a short while.\r\n\r\ni was positioned such that my feet pointed towards the ocean when i noticed a moving object in the sky from the corner of my eye.\r\ni would say that when i first noticed the object in the sky it was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon from the north, and traveling almost at \r\n\r\ni locked my eyes onto it, and would describe it as being a dark gray circle/disc shape with several dim red lights triangular in shape (isosceles, 80,80,20 degrees) pointing inward. it could have been octogonally shaped, but i only consider this as a possibility because of the arrangement of the lights.\r\n\r\nit took only 2 to 3 seconds before the object had flown completely out of sight in the sky. i remember watching it move at a constant velocity, from where i first noticed it all the way across what was nearly the zenith of my view of the sky, down to the horizon to my left at the south.\r\n\r\nthe object made no sound whatsoever.\r\n\r\ni had a hard time determining the object's size, because i had no reference for its altitude. i would estimate it to have been 50% the size of the moon at its highest point in the sky on any ordinary night.\r\n\r\ni think one of the most peculiar things about this event was that the size of the object did not seem to change much as it moved out of my perspective, so i believe that this object must have been flying at a good measure above the earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\ni cannot imagine this to have been an event observed of any military craft.\r\n\r\ni am positive this was not a satellite- i have seen satellites before, and they are small and star-like in

impression that it wasn't as distant as an actual star in the night sky.  it remained absolutely motionless without flickering and didn't emit any other colored lights. it's position on the horizon

strange lights \"orange redish colored\" lights and a object with white, blue, and green continus lights not flashing in the south/southwest sky over lake michgan.The orange colored lights moved real fast in \"v\"-\"w\" movements. and also like the other grand haven report the objects did dives.Like the other man said, like \"bomber dives\" very fast and abrupt dives and allmost pattern like movements. the lights also would vanish and then re-apper a few moments later.\r\nit became pretty clear it was like nothing i had ever seen in the sky above the lake in grand haven.Kind of strange that there have been these reports in the same area in ottawa county near lake michigan. and they all sound very simular in nature. this just reasures me that i am not the only one to witness these

observed 5 bright lights travelling across the night sky.  we quickly went to look ourselves and also witnessed the lights.  the lights were steady and did not flash.  they were yellowish and appeared to be moving in a rough formation travelling quite slowly.  as the lights reached the sky above the house they seemed to dim then disappear. further lights then followed taking a similar trajectory although no longer in any formation.  the last of the lights also appeared to change colour to dark less visable red and then back to yellow again.  i was shocked by what i saw as i am quite familiar with civilian and military aircraft as i work on a variety of mod sites and airports and i am used to seeing aircraft lights at night.  these lights were like nothing i have ever seen before and did not have the characteristics of aircraft lights.  the lights seemed to be large in comparison with normal aircraft lights.  there was no sound audiable as they
