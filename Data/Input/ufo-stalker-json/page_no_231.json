remember that december 2012 would be my last year in angola, and in that particular year, everyone was talking about the supposed ''end of the world'' on december 21st 2012. me and my friends wanted to go camping in this place i four on top of a mountain. it was very hard to get there because from a certain point, there aren't any roads. it's a place very far from the city away from all the city lights. we were on top of a cliff and we had a fire. there's no cellphone reception in that area so our phones were basically clocks. i remember it was almost midnight and we decided to watch the stars and wait for the supposed end of the world (which non of us believed). i remember saying that if the world ended at least we were all together as friends. we turned away from the fire and just sat there for a few minutes watching the stars as we talked about one star in particular that was a lot brighter then any other in the sky, not moving as all stars are supposed to be. suddenly it wend down a bit and made an ellipse like movement 3 times, going down a bit with each one and then simply disappeared in the sky. no flashes of light, it just disappeared. we talked about it trying to guess what it was but nothing made sense. we thought it could be a satellite that lost power or something of that sort but they don't move the way that light moved. we joked about being an extraterrestrial spacecraft but the night just went on.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":83838,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":-14.9486454,"location":null,"logNumber":"AO-05192017-0015","longitude":13.5375457,"occurred":1356048000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Huila

movement through out the season. on 5/15 at ~ 10:45 pm i took the dog out for his last walk and looked for the following constellations: orion's belt, the big dipper and the little dipper.\r\n\r\ni found orion's belt and the little dipper when i noticed three lights coming towards me. two lights were above and one below in a triangular formation. i thought to myself three \"airplanes\" do not land at the same time. it was my impression all three were in the same landing pattern heading towards rocky mountain regional airport. the two upper  objects were parallel and they easily had to be over the flatirons, when the lower object did a drastic starboard turn (i saw the red light of the left wing) and the object headed south and was gone. i firmly believe the lower object was a real airplane.\r\n\r\nto my dismay the two upper objects all of sudden hovered and remained stationary in the sky. that is when i frantically ran and asked my neighbor to come out and watch this phenomena with me.\r\n\r\nit is now ~11 pm. in addition to the two hovering objects we identified a new object to the nw (approximately over the lyons area?). all three objects  were stationary in the sky and hovering when my neighbor noticed that the southern object shifted outward and shifted downward from formation. at that same time we followed a plane heading west as it flew greatly under these hovering objects. flashing lights could be seen on all three objects, primary the southern and northern most objects.\r\n\r\n11:20 pm my neighbor went back inside, dismissing the objects as a possible military exercise while i remained outside watching. next i saw a new fast moving object in the sky moving from east to west. this object was low in the sky, moved fast, and moved underneath the two objects hovering to the immediate west. as soon as this fast moving object went underneath the two stationary hovering objects, all the objects (the two stationary objects to the west and the one to the nw) started to move away. \r\n\r\nat ~11:45 pm i called my neighbor back outside to watch this movement with me. we both noticed the illumination of the lights on all three objects had dimmed leading us to believe that the objects appeared to be moving away from us, that is westward. and the object in the nw appeared to have moved to a higher altitude as it was moving further from us as well. my neighbor and  i concurred that these objects were lower than stars, and their uniquely brilliant white light and flashing colored lights (red and green-blue)  where uncommon. \r\n\r\nat midnight, the neighbor and i both concurred it was an unusual phenomena. we do not know what we saw but we know they were not stars.

left it to see it because it went north and i was driving my car and i went west towards portimão.\r\nthe sky that afternoon was clean and very blue what caught my attention was to observe this ball

thought it might be an airplane but then i noticed that there was no fuselage, no wings, no engines, no track, so i concluded that an ordinary plane was not, then i thought it might be a weather balloon but i did not observe any material known and it was a ball of bright yellow light radiating in every direction and with a constant velicity in a concrete pattern and that afternoon there was no wind, reason why it concludes that it could only be an unidentified flying object.\r\nthe object was a ball of bright yellow light flying over faro's airspace at an altitude that allowed me to see it shifting south to north and past the infant's path next to faro's knot plus a few meters to the west flying over the hills, disappearing over them as they headed north.\r\ni felt calm and observant

chair with my feet up on the railing so i could comfortably stare straight up at the stars.  night was very clear with little to no light pollution.  was a perfect night for star gazing. back porch i was sitting on faces out due east towards open ocean.  pawley's island pier is less than 1/8th of a mile up the beach to the south of the house's location (my right).\r\n\r\nheard a loud clap (like a large wave hitting the beach / distant clap of thunder / or someone dropping a large pile of wood off in the distance). this drew my attention to the horizon.  about 5 seconds after this a fairly large orb appeared about 200 yards out to see to my east / south east (about 50-75 yards east / north east of the end of pawley's pier) and at an estimated 200 foot altitude.  orb was orange-yellow in color and started out very dim and brightened.  once the first orb was very bright a second orb to the left of the original appeared and brightened in the same fashion.  this continued in the same way and in the same direction until 4 orange-yellow orbs were fully brightened in a semi-oval shape on a horizontal plane.  orbs did not move or flicker.  all orbs appeared and brightened in place with no movement or apparent sound.  all four orbs stayed fully lit for about 15 seconds before all disappearing abruptly at the same time.  it is hard to judge the size of the orbs based on distance and brightening pattern but my best guess would be that each orb's diameter was somewhere between 2-5 feet.  3-4 minutes later the same phenomenon happened as described above about 400 yards to the north (my left) and 500-600 yards farther out to see (to the east).  i had my phone out ready to record for the second appearance.  i recorded about 15 seconds of video but could not get the camera to focus or the lights to show up so i stopped the recording about 15 seconds in.  upon checking the video on my phone after the phenomenon ended, the video was only 1 second long and abruptly cuts off when i pointed my phone up towards the horizon in the direction of the orbs / craft.  said video is attached to report. \r\n\r\ni checked the beach and the pier minutes after the sighting and did not see any other people.  all house lights on the beach were turned off due to local seasonal laws due to sea turtle breeding.  there were not apparent or viable aircraft in the sky during the time of the siting and no fishing boats / boat lights out to see at the time of the sighting (or before or after).  i did notice two satellites cross paths on the same plane (which i had never witnessed before) about 15 minutes prior to the sighting.  a commercial airliner flew over at cruising altitude about 7 minutes after the second sighting.  two \"shooting stars\" were witnessed coming from the sw sky tracking

music. i stopped to observe the beautiful night sky, which was quite clear this night, and noticed a particularly bright plane.\r\n\r\ni stopped my friend and pointed out that this plane was flying strangely. it did not blink like a plane, nor did i hear anything. it was difficult to determine size or shape as it was nothing but a slightly hazy orb of light. it had a light blue hue, and was the brightness of three north stars, or a very close plane on a clear night. the light was the sort to glow rather than beam, so it's dimensions were shrouded.\r\n\r\nthe treeline was low, and the way it'd fly above and below the treeline made us think it was a drone; however, this did not fly like any drone i've seen in life or video. it's motion was simply too fast and controllable for any drone the public has seen. it would hover for a couple seconds then pick up speed and curve down and to the right, then move to the left, up and back down, below the treeline for a time, then back up, always turning and varying its speed. it was as though someone was standing in the pitch dark with a round glow stick and moving their arm about; the motion, brightness and distance of the object added up to something so unnatural to all known flying objects.\r\n\r\nme and my friend were surprised and knew it was nothing normal. it dipped below the treeline for a time and we decided to leave. we never saw it again.

made any sound and it was quick! it seemed to be at an extremely high altitude. my father was a pilot and i have been around planes all my life, including in the military. it looked to be in an excesse of 100 thousand feet, and at that altitude it looked to be the width of my thumb, which wouldseem to make it way larger than the any plane that i know of. plus it was insanely quick. it traveled from the center of the cup portion of the big dipper which was almost straight above me, in the middle of the night sky straight south 1/3 of the way to the southern in 4 seconds. at which time it just stopped for about 4 seconds then it changed direction and started moving to the south west in a zig-zag pattern this continued for another 4 seconds. then with a sprial or circular bright blue white flash it simply vanished. 5. th3 really weird thing, and i'm somewhat embarrassed to say this it seemed that it was aware of me watching it, it almost seemed to be interactive. shortly

spectacular in the sky; there was a beautiful rainbow-ring around the sun. it was too bright to stare at so i laid back on the lounge chair and blindly snapped off 5 or 6 photos in about a 5 second period. tonight, may 17 at 10:30 pm i was looking at these photos for the first time. the first photo shows nothing unusual just the ring phenomenon around the sun. however, in the second photo taken 1 second later, it shows a disk, or blue-disk surrounded by a blue aura, and there's a trail of more blue aura ahead of this blue disk which looks like it was created by a different craft or object. the third photo shows the blue object clearer, and moving. however, in the fourth photo, taken an instant later, the object has moved a great distance (maybe dozens of miles or more) and the image is clearer still. the last photo shows it having done a u-turn. i never saw any of this with my naked eye. after all, i was trying to photograph the sun. i would have kept taking photos if i saw it in the sky. my photos are bizarre if you are expecting to rationalize what that blue glowing object is that flies at supersonic speeds and then does a u-turn.\r\nplease help! if this a natural phenomenon then why do my photos show an object. why is the object moving rapidly yet still maintaining it's same form and shape? why did it do a u-turn and not keep going in same direction? please give me your
