was coming around a corner near mill point (approx. 24 miles from dillon) i slowed down as there was a flatbed pickup stalled in the right lane of the highway. as i went around the vehicle, the door was open and i recognized the name \"selkirk hereford ranch\" stenciled on the door. there was no one in the vehicle. just as i got around the vehicle, something caught my eye to the left at about 45 degrees. there was a large fireball/flash/sparks descending over the ridge and apparently coming to rest behind the mill point. i was so frightened, instead of looking back behind the landform as i drove past, i accelerated and never stopped to look back. at that time, if you saw an event like that and lived in a small town, you kept it to yourself. i did share the event with one person, a trusted employee of my dad's. where this could get interesting is, by monday, there had been numerous reports to the sheriff's office of similar sightings. the local radio station, kdbm, suprisingly broadcast news regarding these sightings. one extraordinary report indicated a woman was persued by a firey object thate hovered over her car and scorched the hood.\r\n  i'm a professional

vision, so i know it wasnt a plane. it wasnt that high up in the sky either. i have seen this light for about the last 2 months\r\nin different parts of the sky above my town columbia missouri. there are about 80,000 people in this town so its fairly large.  i have seen this light about 8-10 times, and am actually used to it. usually there is the really really bright yellowish orange light and a smaller yellow light at either 10 o clock or 6 o clock about 6 inches above it, or below it. on the 24th of dec 2008 i observed only the large yellowish orange light.  the first time i saw it i kept waiting for it to fly over, as it seemed it would have to. but it always stays stationary.  after seeing it the first time, i looked  online to see if anyone had reported anything over columbia missouri. there were 3 reports describing what i saw, however one of the witnesses said he saw the light zoom off.  i havent had the chance to see that yet, it is winter and freezing so i can usually stay outside for a half hour max. when i see these lights in the sky i get excited and, this is silly but i try to project positive thoughts to it them, friendly vibes.\r\nbut i always end up angry at the fact that we are sooooooo in the dark about life from other planets, i also wonder what they are doing, or if it is alien technology reverse engineered by the usaf.  but overall i am excited and

we continued to watch the object for about 15 min. then i told my husband to run home and grab the camera,the phone, and our neighbor (the one who initially spotted it). i decided i'd stay put and watch. icouldn't take my eyes off of this spectacular thing in the sky. as soon as my husband drove off the lights started to become more intense and more rapid like it was going crazy. it started making crazy shapes and figure eight shapes and big loops and zig zags up and down, across the sky...I absolutely could not believe i was witnessing this incredible light show. it got so intense that i,for a brief second, became a little scared. however, shock and amazement prevailed. it was almost as if \"they\" knew i was watching them? it sounds weird, but that is exactly what it felt like. when my husband came back i tried to explain to him this incredile light show. i handed him the binoculars, but the lights apparently went back to the normal fast dancing strobes like he saw before. i just could not get him to understand the light show i saw no matter how i tried to describe. the only way i can try to explain it is as if i was at a greatful dead concert times 1000!! and with new shapes! we continued to watch the object a little longer then it began to fade into the cloud cover and to the distance. i forgot we did snap a photo. we went back home to see if the picture showed anything. it was faint, but zooming helped a little. after a little while at home we ran outside to see if it was still there. i couldn't believe it, but it was. this time it had shifted to the right of our house, but still visible from the school. i looked at my husband and said, \"do you want to try again?\" so we jumped in the car a second time over to the school. i looked through the binoculars, but i could tell it was definately farther away which made it more difficult to see. although i could see the faint strobing. my husband snapped two more pictures and it became apparent that it seemed to be leaving. it sounds strange, but i was actually sad to see it go. i guess i know that i will probably never witness anything like that again. i've always believed we weren't alone. you'd have to be so self-centered to think that we are the only ones who occupy this never ending universe, but i never believed for a million years that i would be lucky enough to even come that close to something from another world. of all places this object could've picked in this word, that night it was right outside my door. i hit the jackpot that night. i will never ever forget that experience as long as i live and am truly greatful that it happened to me.     *we were able to get a couple of pretty good photos with enhancing them the colors were out of this word. i didn't submit the photos because i want it to be mine.*","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":14526,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.8614263,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12252008-0005","longitude":-75.976295,"occurred":1230094500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1230094500000,"summary":"Blue, red, green, yellow, white fast strobbing and dancing lights which made shapes and patterns. it also changed location after hovering for a while. it eventually faded away into the sky.","tags":["lights","hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Virginia Beach, Virginia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:286464"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Round Rock/Hutto","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"About 10 p.M. someone came to our door to ask if we owned property near by. we owned 20 acres. they asked us to search it for a down flying object.\r\nwe searched and found nothing on our place.\r\n\r\nlater as we and dozens of other locals prowled the country roads, talking on c.B. radios the word came to us that the local airports as well as bergstrom afb denied any down aircraft.\r\n\r\nearly in the morning a friend who worked at the round rock paper tried to gain access to the property, which was a commercial egg prouducing business.  he was met by the military who threatened him with weapons and told him to go away. \r\n\r\nhe later told me he saw army trucks leaving the property with tarps over loads.\r\n\r\nhis name is c. l.

am a former \"force reconnaissance\" marine and currently a security contractor in iraq.  a little over a year ago, i had some pictures taken of me on an abrams tank.  i brought all of the pictures that i had taken on that tour back home to show my wife.  as i was going through the pictures at home, i noticed that there was an object above my head in the tank picture.  it was white and was a perfect triangle.  i have no idea how high it was, due to the fact that i have no idea how large the object was, so i could not estimate distance and size.  the only think that i can say in reference to size and distance, is that the object was about half the size of my head, up in the sky.  also, there were three pictures taken while i was on the tank and in every picture, the object was in the same position in each picture.  anyways, i analyzed the picture and it was no glitch in the camera at all.  the camera was a \"new\" pentax optio v20 8.0 megapixel. now, i know every single aircraft in this ao up here in northern iraq, and absolutely nothing is even remotely close to the shape of the object on the picture.  there are, of course some weird looking uav's up here and none of them look like that object in any way.  this was a perfect, white triangle.  there were no fuzzy apparitions in the picture, etc....  also, take in mind, my background that i stated in the first sentence.  one of my specialties is reconnaissance and surveillance.  i have made a living off of observation.  now, of course this really pisses me off, but i spoke with my wife about the picture the next day and she made fun of me about the picture, so i brought her up to the computer to show her.  i am not lying, but all of my pictures that i had during my last time in iraq were missing off of my computer!!!  i am not crazy or lying in any way.  i am at a loss of words on how that could of happened.  i have no idea.  i am pretty sure no one \"snuck\" into my house and deleted them, but who knows.  i am not going to delete them though.  on top of that, i am a skeptic about the whole ufo situation and personally think that almost everyone that claims to have seen a ufo is some \"hick\" or a person that has had an uneventful life and needs something interesting to keep themselves going through life.  i have had a very eventful life and \"been there, done that\".  i don't need something interesting to keep me going.  i know what i saw and it was nothing that the us or any other country in this world has for aircraft...At least as far as i know, but if we had an aircraft that looked like that out here, i would know about it.  now, one of my friends who was also there taking pics is currently recovering from battlefield injuries in the states.  when he recovers and comes back, i will try to see if he has the pic on his computer that i can get, to send you.  i am pretty sure he also took a pic with his camera when i was on the abrams tank.  if he does have it, then i will have proof that i was not seeing things or am crazy.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14522,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.335571,"location":null,"logNumber":"IQ-12252008-0001","longitude":43.137131,"occurred":1164873600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ninawa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1164873600000,"summary":"White

looked up and out the window to see an orange light gently coasting along. at first it appeared to be a solitary star or planet. however, the sky was overcast and the object was clearly visable, closer to me than the ceiling of clouds which were at the moment producing a very light rain. the object was to the west of my residence at an est. alt. of 8-12 thousand feet, depending on its distance which was hard to judge do to the unknown size. the only factor which helped to aid in range estimation was the cloud cover. i would estimate the distance from myself to the object at appx. five thousand meters, it's position was about 50 degrees above the horizon relative my position.\r\n\r\n the object moved at a slow and waivering pace, sometimes cruising along with very noticable movement, and at other times coming to an appearant stop, then once again moving along. durring the sighting no other objects were visable in the sky. the sighting lasted appx. 5 minutes. durring that time, the object moved from south to north, covering an estimated distance of 1.5 miles before making a gentle bank and gaining in altitude while heading west by north west. throughout the time i had the object under observation its appearance altered continuously, but remained recognisably similar. its brightness and realative size increased and decreased in pulsing fashion, yet no pattern of frequency of the rate in which it did this was noticed. at one point it apeared to seperate into two joined spheres momentarily, before merging together again. upon fusing back together it gained brightness and appeared to possibly drip a little bit, as if molten metal were collecting at its underside. yet at no time did i observe any potion of the object seperate fully from itself.\r\n\r\n after heading north for appx 3 and a half minutes it slowly gained altitude and began to shroud itself in the cloud layer while banking left to head west. its brightness dimmed i can only assume due to obscuration. i continued to track the object for a little over another minute as it was intermittantly lost in the clouds until it finally disappeared all together. the object made no sound that i could hear, and had it been a passenger aircraft, which i had observed many times at that appx. range and alt. i would have been able to hear engine noise. had it been a civilian aircraft at all it would have had some variant of marking lights, all of which were absent. it was definately not the landing lights of an aircraft either. it appeared much as a flame would in its flickering glow. it was not a military jet becuase it moved to slow, also no noise. it was not a planet or star becuase it was below the cloud cover and moving. it was not a comet or meteor becuase its movements were eratic, changing direction, and gaining altitude.\r\n \r\n i cannot for any purposes identify it as something i am familiar with as a trained observer having spent over 7 years in the military and having the ability to identify numerous types of aircraft both civilian and military, as well as pyrotecnichs. also i have a sound fundamental understanding of astronomy and weather phenomenon.This

and they don't have a compass for some.. really weird reason.))\r\n\r\ni was on my way to lichtenberger park in elk grove for my evening exercise, traveling by bike like i do every day. i left my house around 5pm, and immediately noticed an unusually large number of planes in the sky. i didn't think too much of them, as many looked like commercial flights and cessna's with the exception of a much larger, gray plane. \r\n\r\n(every now and then, myself and others have encountered similar very large planes but at very low altitudes slowly going over our neighborhoods and parks during daylight hours. though these were strange sightings and presumably military in nature, we have not thought much about it although we do wonder where the base is and why they are traveling as low as a redwood's height over our suburb)\r\n\r\nas i reached the end of my neighborhood and approached main roads, i noticed a strange helicopter. it was big, dark, and had two blades on the top of it. it was heading nw, and i lost track of it in the houses. i continued east through kloss park, and it was becoming dusk. when i reached litchtenberger, heading south, i was noticing something huge in the sky, bigger than any other other craft i'd seen that day. i couldn't get a good look through the oak trees, but it had two lights on top of it, and was not shaped like a jet or plane. i rushed through the park until i got to the end of it, trying to get a better look, but i had lost it in the rooftops and trees.\r\n\r\ni then sat down on a swing, facing east, intently watching the sky for another sighting. it didn't take long before i saw the craft again. at first, its size made me think that the two lights belonged to separate craft, but they were most definitely part of the single ufo. it was heading east, southeast towards franklin high school, and moving pretty slow. i continued to keep my eyes on it, and rushed down the streets trying to keep up with it. it had a round underside, and the two lights seemed like they were mounted at the top of two points on the upperside of the craft, and could be compared to a ch-47d from what i've seen, but i doubt that is what i saw (though i didn't see the blades, i assume it had one over each light). the two lights were level, or very close to level with each other. the ufo appeared to be descending, as though it would land in the field on the corner of bruceville and elk grove blvd. unfortunately, i lost it behind the rite aid and nugget market so i quickly returned to the swing i had sat at. i was relieved to find that i could still watch it. my friend a called me then, and i told him what i was seeing. i ended the conversation quickly.\r\n\r\ni don't remember hearing any sounds. i was also beginning to notice the number of other planes in the sky when i saw something else. it was getting pretty dark by now. to my right were two white/yellow lights, typical plane lights. but one of them disappeared as it moved down through a transparent cirrus cloud, it disappeared. the cloud did not seem thick enough to hide a plane's glow, as the night sky and even stars were visible through it. this light \"returned\" on the opposite side of the other light it had been with, only were it had been closer to and under it, it was now above and further apart from it. this light did nothing more, and continued heading north, northwest. i could barely make out a shape, but it looked like it was a jet.\r\n\r\nhowever, the light it was with begun acting strangely. it had been very slowly going up, slightly to the right while its partner had been gone before. now, it suddenly dropped down very, very, very quickly. it was almost as though it was teleporting, and i felt my heart sink because i thought i was witnessing a very weird crash, but in fast motion. then it continued heading north, northwest(i think it did other irregular things, but i can't recall with full certainty. may have also turned due west). i looked towards the larger ufo again to check on it, and it was still in my sights but had made substantial distance and appeared to be landing since it was  still descending. my guess would have been somewhere near franklin high school, especially considering that the land out there becomes vacant fields and farmland.\r\n\r\ni returned home sometime around 6:12pm, to go with my family to my sister's band performance at the middle school, and i continued to see many aircraft, presumably cessna's, on the way there. when the performance ended at 8pm, air traffic seemed to be reduced to normal levels. (0-2 crafts)\r\n\r\ni am planning to return to the park and make a sketch of where i saw the lights of the ufo. i know this area very well, and marked which trees it was nearest to. i hope to have some sketches ready, but at the moment i don't have a scanner accessible.
