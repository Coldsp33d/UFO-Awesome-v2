sighting occurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ufoinfo sighting form report\r\n\r\nlocation: winchester, virginia\r\n\r\ndate: march 9th, 2008\r\n\r\ntime: 10:35 pm\r\n\r\nnumber of witnesses: 1\r\n\r\nnumber of objects: 1\r\n\r\nshape of objects: spherical, star-like\r\n\r\nweather conditions: clear, calm, 40's\r\n\r\ndescription: i was on the porch of my home last night when i observed a yellowish-white star-like object. it was initially about 45 degrees above the horizon and moving toward my position from the northeast. we are under a major flight corridor here, and we see lots of commercial aircraft. in fact, there were several typical aircraft in the sky at the time - but this was definitely not one of them. it was larger and more brilliant than any of the stars in the sky. the color was very odd, similar to the \"creamy yellow\" of the holmes comet which appeared several months ago. altitude seemed very high, perhaps 30-40,000 feet. speed appeared slow, but at that altitude might have been around 200 mph or more. as it approached from the northeast on a straight line of flight, it reached a position about 75 degrees off the horizon when it instantaneously slowed to about half it's former speed, almost as if it was deciding where to go next. it then turned from it's southwest path and took a new heading directly to the west, resuming its former speed.\r\n\r\nthe most remarkable thing was that this did not seem to be a light that was attached to some object, but rather an entire object emitting light. after the object made it's turn and it began to move away from my position toward the west, the light it emitted seemed to \"flicker\" several times - ever so briefly appearing red/white, then returning to it's former coloration and intensity, which it maintained during the entire 3-4 minute sighting. i've never seen nor reported anything like this before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   another similar sighting from woodbridge virginia, describing \"four or five yellowish-white lights hovering low in the skyline, clustered together\", was reported to the same source from an incident on march 5th/6th of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n   finally, a report was made on this site of an incident that occurred on december 7th near danville, virginia describing a \"yellowish-white short streak in the sky\" and a \"very bright rod-shaped object\" with a \"yellowish-white radiance or cloud\" surrounding it.\r\n\r\n   i'm sure i saw another incident reported somewhere that described a yellowish-white object sighted near roanoke this summer, but i was unable to  relocate the information in order to reference it here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n   but cmon . . . how many objects - of any kind - have you heard described as being \"yellowish-white\" in color ??  the color was the key, because it was so unusual that it attracted my attention to the object and caused me to observe it.  the bizarre angular movements were observed as a result.\r\n\r\n\r\n   could it be that several complete strangers in the state of virginia are just coincidentally reporting odd aerial objects using such an unusual color descriptor as \"yellowish-white\" in 2008 ??  maybe 2009 will tell.\r\n\r\n

are quite common.\r\n\r\nme and my sisters were looking up at it, and i joked that it was a u.F.O. as we passed the southbound poulsbo exit, it began to look odder. it appeared to be more then one light, and it was completely stationary. while i cannot estimate it's exact position as it was night, it appeared to be over the hood canal bridge. if not over the bridge, as it was very far away and in the right direction.\r\n\r\nit continued to remain stationary the rest of the drive. until i passed the hilltop gas station at the crossroads for tytler rd and nw pioneer way. it then seemed to slowly move eastward away from what was almost certainly the hood canal bridge's general area.\r\n\r\nat this point it also became completely apparent it was three very bright yellowish lights. if they were connected they would make a triangle shape. it wasn't moving very fast, but definitely moving now and i was absolutely certain it was no longer stationary, and the size appeared very large. once i reached the four corners gas station at the crossroads of big valley rd. i noticed it had a dim, but rapidly flashing strobe between the two lights that framed the back of the triangle. the strobe flashed between red and green rapidly. like some kind of christmas rave dance. it wasn't too bright though and i was wondering if my eyes were deceiving me. at this point it disappeared behind the evergreen trees on my right, that is to the east.\r\n\r\nthis however wasn't my last sighting. i turned onto scenic drive and witnessed the object almost directly above us. it was moving at about 20 mph, and i was certain it was high in the air now as i drove past a very bright barnyard light i've seen illuminate helicopters before... and the lights were very far apart. if i held my arm out at it's maximum length, it would have been about the length of my thumb, about two and a half inches between the \"front\" and the \"back\".\r\n\r\nthis was the last i saw of the object, and the red/green alternating strobe light (which i will reiterate was flashing very fast.) was definite and my sisters saw it as well. i also thought i made out it's form against the night sky as a large dark triangle shape, with what looked like sharp edges (however i couldn't be certain because the tips of the triangle were where the lights were) i am not sure i actually saw the form though, i could have been just mentally connection the dots between the lights. i also rolled down my window so i could look at it without the windshield at this point as well.\r\n\r\nit then sped up and moved out towards pope resources land to the east. even as it \"sped\" off, it never achieved a very fast speed, i don't think above a hundred miles per hour. that was the last i saw of it.\r\n\r\nas a note, the picture i'm attaching has two small pictures on it. the larger one was my view of it when i first turned onto scenic drive, the smaller one was what it looked like about the time i was passing the poulsbo on-ramp. the picture was also drawn about 20 minutes after the event.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

snow storm the sky was very clear and all the stars could be seen. upon one of my trips to go smoke a cig, i looked to the sky as i normally do admiring how clear it was. i saw what looked like a star but much much brighter then normal. the star however would stay lit for a minute then go dimmer then come back with a red tint. normally i would pay no attention to this however no matter how i looked at it, it had a cross like appearance to the red light with the normal white light still seen behind it. off to the right of it there was another white orb but much smaller that appeared to move directly up, stop then move right. coming from the east of me was a small plane with what sounded like a propeller engine. it passed overhead and while i flew in that direction it appeared to get somewhat close to the first light which was still slowly blinking and alternating between white and red. when it appeared to get close i could hear the engine start screaming as if the throttle was maxed out and the plane veared south at a very fast rate as if running from it. the smaller orb moved in the direction of the plane and vanished. there were no sounds and it appeared as though these objects and including the plane were no more than 5 miles away as i could still clearly hear the planes engine. i went inside somewhat rattled not even wanting to think of what it may have been. i searched the internet seeing if maybe a planent could be seen that night but nothing. i searched maps looking for airports in that direction and still nothing. no lighthouses, nothing. i went out there again tonight at 3am on the 22nd after a large snow storm so no clouds at all were in the sky and all the stars could be seen. but looking, there is nothing in that area, that close to the horizon above the tree line. given how close to the horizon it was, i am sure it was not a star and definatly not a helicopter as the lights blink alot faster. also between changing from white to red there was about a 20-30 second period. i am not saying that it was definatly a ufo in the sence of a craft piloted by something other than human though i do not rule out the possibility. i just find it odd that i saw something where there should be nothing, and even saw a pilot react to this. the movement of the second orb was mostly odd because nothing should be able to be sitting still and then accelerate in mid air like that. being in the army and being around many different helicopters in my career, i know we dont use rotary wings that can perform like that. as a side note, the main light when red was brightest in the middle with the red, while it made points outward, up down left right, but the side points were shorter that the top and bottom. included is a cut-out from google maps. it is very possible that the area the lights were in, is further away than on map. another strange detail is when i went inside, my parents have three cats that normally sleep far away from each other and very loving of humans. these cats were awake, huddled togther in a corner next to the couch and acted as if very afraid","distance":"Over One

house fire in columbus, in. we were on st. rd. 450w heading east bound back to hope. right after we had past a local winery, simmon's winery, i noticed to the north of us was suddenly a blue surging light. the light lite up the sky in a large area but the source of the light had to be on the ground. i pointed it out to my wife and she too observed it. immediately we started naming off the possibilities of what we were seeing. i mentioned that not far from that location is electric transformers in a fenced in area. i was certain that it was the transformers some how exploding. my wife suggested that we take a road in that direction to check it out. the best way i can describe the light is : it was blue and bright. it flashed very quickly or maybe a better way to describe it may be \"surging\". visualize a firework that they call a fountain that is set off on the ground and the glow that it makes around it. now visualize that glow and effect a quarter of a mile wide and lighting up the sky. that���s what we had seen. as we drove around in the general area searching for the source we half expected to encounter emergency vehicles but we did not. it was as if we were the only ones who had observed it. when we got to the transformers there was nothing out of the ordinary about them. we continued to search the area trying to come up with an explanation. we did not see any other types of lights nor any smoke anywhere. we continued to take county roads circling the general area but we did not come up with any source nor explanation. what we seen could not have been over looked by anyone who would have seen it. it had us baffled. though we did not see any light in the sky nor did we see and object in the sky i could not get the thought out  of my head that it was possible extraterrestrial related. my wife laughed that idea off and refused to believe such a thing however she did admit repeatedly that it was a strange event and had no explanation for it. after searching for about 15 to 20 minutes we gave up the search and headed on home. the surging blue light on the ground lasted for approximately 15 to 20 seconds.

with my girlfriend and my two friends sitting in the backseat. i was driving of the freeway and we were all pretty quiet listening to music with low volume. i was driving of the freeway looking at the road ahead of me. all of a sudden i saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me all of a sudden shooting down diagonally extremely fast like around 20-30 degrees off of the horizon from where i was. to me it seemed like it was a white dot of light that all of a sudden popped out of the sky and immediately shot down towards the ground. i could not see where excatly it landed or anything because it shot down and went behind this hill hill in the distance. when i first saw it my first insticnt was that it was like maybe  firework but i quickly realized that it could not be because fireworks go up, then i thought maybe it was some sort of missle but i dont think that i would not have seem something as bright as that coming from higher up in the sky because i just saw it pop out of nowhere. then i started to think. after around 30 seconds i said \"wait hold on.. did u guys see that???\" and immediatelly my girlfriend said \"yeah, what was it?\" then i said \"i dont know what did you see\"  and according to her she saw a bright white line coming from the sky diagonally but she says she only saw it with her perifiral vision. i assume that it was a bright dot that was moving so fast that it seemed like a line coming down diaginally in a perfecly straight line. i knew that it could not be lightning because when i got out of the car i looked up at the sky and saw that it was a very clear night without a cloud in sight. also it could not have been lightning becuase it was way to bright. and also lightning comes down straight to the ground  but this came down diagonally  and in a straight line. i know that it was not a shooting star either becuase i have seen many and this was way brighter and bigger than a star and faster. after that we were all pretty scared and
