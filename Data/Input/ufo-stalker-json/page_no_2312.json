preparation for the fireworks display. it was very cold that night and there was a biting breeze that blew occasionally off the water. while sitting on a bench in the viking country of epcot, i witnessed what appeared to be something like a star or ball of light that seemed to appear out of nowhere, moving away from me, east to west in a slightly arching line, quickly across the sky, for a few short seconds before disappearing. it seemed a good distance away and it didn't seem to cover much sky before vanishing. my family was not paying attention to the sky when i tried to point it out

evening john\r\nvoici donc un r���cit de ce que l'on a vu hier  dimanche 7/12/2008 vers 17h15 (les photos sont not���es ��� 18h15...Car je n'avais pas chang��� l'heure ���t��� hiver !!)\r\n here is the story of our sighting of sunday dec 7th 2008 around 5 15 pm (photos show 6 15 pm as hadn t changed to winter time yet)\r\netant situ��� dans la haut jura, les t���l���phones portables passant mal, quand j'ai re���u un appel, je me suis dirig���e vers ma baie vitr���e (comme ��� notre habitude) qui est plein est, afin de mieux recevoir.\r\n as i live in the high jura mountains cell phones cannot go through well so i went to my large window to receive better , my window is full east.\r\net c'est ��� ce moment que j'ai vu 1 grosse lumi���re au loin au dessus de la suisse (difficile d'���valuer la distance), apr���s avoir raccrocher mon t���l���phone, j'ai appeler ma famille afin qu'elle vienne voir, et je suis all���e chercher mon appareil photo (apn avec objectif 70-300mm - 6mpx),\r\n thats is when i saw at a disatnce a big brilliant light above switerland (difficult to evluate ditance) after haniging up , i called my family so they could watch tooand went to get my camera (apn with 70 300 mm lense 6megapixels).\r\npour nous cette lumi���re ne pouvait ���tre une ���toile (trop grosse ?) et tr���s lumineuse. nous avons pens��� ��� un avion (puisqu'il y a l'a���roport de gen���ve), mais pour nous la forme ne bougeait pas et la lumi���re ���tait trop grosse, nous avons l'habitude de voir les lumi���re des avions (nous avons d'ailleurs v���rifi��� plus tard), et elles ne sont pas si grosses, m���me quand ils allument le \"gros phare\", cel��� n'est pas si gros, de plus le ciel ���tait parfaitement d���gag���...Pas un nuage, temp���rature n���gative, temps froid et sec (pour dire, il a fait -10 dans la nuit).\r\n for us this light couldn t be a star (too big) and too luminous.We thought it could be a plane (as geneva s airport is closeby)but the light wasnt moving and was too brilliant.We are used to seeing plane lights including the very powerful beams and they are not that big.Besides the sky was cristal clear , no clouds and under freezing point temperature cold and dry.\r\nje suis donc sortie sur mon balcon afin de prendre des photos, mais la 1���re a ���t��� loup���e car je n'avais pas pos��� l'appareil (je ne suis pas pro, et il n'y avait pas assez de lumi���re), donc apr���s j'ai chang��� d'endroit, j'ai pos��� mon apn sur ma barri���re, et j'ai pris 2 photos.\r\n i went out on my balcony to shoot the photos but missed the first one(not a professional)so i changed area , put my adn (digital camera) and shot two more photos atuomatically.\r\nensuite, nous avons regard��� encore un moment, puis la lumi���re a disparue  dans un scintillement in���gal \"orange\", elle est revenue comme on l'a vu, puis a compl���tement disparue.\r\n we then looked a while then the light disappeared in a fuzzy unequal orangy colour , came back as we saw it again then disappeared fully.\r\nquand je parle de la lumi���re, c'est celle qui est la plus grosse, c'est en mettant les photos sur l'ordinateur que je me suis aper���ue qu'il y avait une 2���me lumi���re (forme bizarre en grossissant fortement l'image, avec plusieurs points lumineux). je pr���cise que nous ���tions 4 ��� regarder cel���, et aucun des 4 n'a vu cette 2���me lumi���re (peut ���tre trop focalis���s sur la 1���re ?). les 2 photos ont ���t��� prises ��� 14s d'intervalle.\r\n when i speak of the light it is the larger one.It s ones photos loaded on my computer that i noticed there was a second one (bizarrely shaped as when fully zoomed one can see a few smaller lights).We were four to watch this event and noce of us saw the second light.Both photos were taken at 14 seconds apart.\r\npour nous, la lumi���re n'a pas boug��� (en tout cas nous n'avons pas vu de mouvement), c'est en voyant les 2 photos que guillaume a mis sur le forum, avec l'axe trac���, que nous voyons qu'il y a eu d���placement.\r\n for us the light didn t move (we havent seen any movement) and it s by seeing the photos on the ids forum with a axis traced that we saw movement.\r\nj'ai regard��� ce soir ��� la m���me heure, m���me temps (-5���c, et temps ciel d���gag���), je n'ai rien vu.\r\n i looked tonight at same hour and saw nothing.\r\npour l'orientation : la photo est quasi plein est, la droite de la photo le nord, donc la gauche de la photo le sud, les fils que l'on voit c'est une ligne haute tension.\r\nthe orientation of the photo is full east with north to the right handside and left being south.The wires seen are electrical.\r\nles photos ont ���t��� prises avec le 300mm, mode scene de nuit, la ligne haute tension est ��� environ 300m de chez

even through a barren tree and power lines partiall obscured the field of vision.  at first i thought the lights may have been fireworks or perhaps flares but the color of the lights were unusually pure color and did not \"flicker\" as do illumination or anti-missile flares.  \r\n     the first lights exhibited short-range movenment and fadded away within 4 to 5 seconds, they all dissappeared

\"trail\" behind this light.  after approx 5 seconds each light fadded away, also within 1 or 2 seconds of each other.\r\n     i suspect that these lights were in fact conventional objects in that

rather i was just seeing the light reflecting strangely.  this \"reflection\" of light coming from the object looked like an asterisk shape almost.  \r\n\r\nthe strangest part of this experience, and the part that leads me to believe this wasn't a plane or helicopter, was how slowly it moved and that it did not make a sound.  it was very quiet where i was standing, and the sky was as clear as could be.  in the time it took this object to fly from the distant spot where i saw it first, until it has passed by my neighborhood, i was able to witness many other planes fly into and out of my visable area.  in fact, while it was almost directly overhead, there were other planes, large passenger planes, flying at a much higher distance than this object - and i could see them and hear them, and they would completely come into my visable area and then go out of my visible area all while this object passed by slowly.  i would estimate that approximately 6-10 other planes came into sight during the time the object was flying towards me and then left my sight as this object was still passing by.  as i mentioned, i could hear the other planes, but when the object was the only thing in sight, i could not hear the object.  \r\n\r\noverall i watched it for approximately 20 minutes.  the shape of the object seemed circular or spherical.  it was an orange-yellow color.  see attached photo (sorry it's not very good).  i lost sight of the object after it flew over the wooded area behind my house.\r\n \r\ni'm not sure exactly what i saw, but i know that it was awesome and had my heart pumping.  it easily could have been something explainable, but i'm not sure what?  for how close it was, how much noise it made (zero!), and how slowly it crept across the sky, coupled with the hovering when i first noticed the object - i believe definitely something odd was viewed.\r\n\r\ni do also have a short video of this object, but it wasn't moving in the video and i couldn't get the shot very focused.  it is 30 seconds long.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet -

time but never in the sky above the mountain. i went to wisemans view to get a better look accross the mountain. there in the barren trees on top of the mountain i could see a white light flashing. this i recognized as a brown mountain light. in the sky to the right above the mountain i could see the object flashing red lights like a helicopter. the lights would flash red and white.The one in the sky would move up and down and appear to move farther away at times then return to the same spot. the light on the mountain seemed to coincide its flashing with the red light flashing. sometimes they would flare at opposite times resembling communication. i dissmissed the possibility of a helicopter due to lack of noise and the movement of the object. i watched for some time and very faintly i could see other lights in the sky behind the first. they would appear then fade out. it was an overcast night and i could not see any stars. this lasted for an hour or more. it finnally faded out and i went back to camp where i could still see the light on the mountain. i will go back with a video camera next time and hopefully capture an event like this on film.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Path then

video, audio or physical.  at the time this was taking place, a nuclear power facility was being constructed in midland within 5 miles of my home and the sighting took place within a half mile of the cooling pond planned for the facility.  later, due to the facility sinking into the ground far further than planned, the plant had to be scrapped almost causing the collapse of consumers power - the public power facility.\r\n\r\ni was driving my 1976 subaru from my house on poseyville road in midland while accompanied by a neighbor girl, *name omitted for confidentiality* who lived literally next door.  as a 17 year old boy, i was pretty much in the mode most 17 year olds are in... i was looking to get closer with charise as she was attractive and we seemed to get along fairly well.  we were just two high school students simply going for a drive on what was probably a weekday evening.    \r\n\r\ni remember that we went about 2 miles down poseyville road from my house and turned left (east) onto gordonville road - just talking, with me trying too hard to be cool.  next we turned right (south) onto sasse road and shortly after, one of the strangest things in my life occurred.  i don't remember seeing or sensing anything until after we'd been driving roughly a quarter mile down sasse road.  we were travelling quite slow at the time - perhaps 25-30 mph.\r\n\r\nsuddenly an object started to appear in the top right corner of the drivers window... actually it was more of a light, and i don't recall ever seeing an outside edge or shape of the object that emitted the light that was very clear to us.  whatever the object was, it was fairly low in the sky - perhaps 100 feet off the ground.  as it appeared, i pointed to it and my passenger and i were both immediately amazed... it wasn't like anything we had seen before.  the sky was quite dark, but it wasn't long after nightfall and the object's \"bottom lighting\" stood out from what must have been a dark colored bottom of the flying vehicle.\r\n\r\nonce it was clear that the object was completely past us (it was only travelling maybe 10-15 mph faster than we were - and i had slowed down dramatically) the only thing that was clear were three pale pink \"bars.\"  the three bars ran aside each other - side by side - with the center bar being a simple rectangle of a pinkish hue - and the other two being rectangles of the exact same dimensions, except with an additional \"leg\" or small square of light sticking off from the rectangle opposite each other facing away from each other.  it looked like a letter l - next to a letter i - next to a backward l with the bottoms of the letters at the front of the \"craft\" or at least at the leading edge given the direction they were travelling.  if i absolutely had to give a guess as to their size, i would say the each bar was roughly 50 foot long and 8 wide - seperated by perhaps a 3-4 foot space filled only with darkness,\r\n\r\ni seem to recall that you couldn't see anything through the dark space, indicating that there was something there - but you just couldn't see it.  we both saw the same thing and compared notes later in amazement... they had come from behind us - which would have put them directly over dow chemical companies large chemical plant, the nuclear plant in construction and certainly they'd travelled over the cooling pond for the proposed plant - although we only saw the lights over our heads on sasse road.\r\n\r\nwe both either felt, heard or somehow sensed a slight buzzing or vibrating sensation when the lights were nearest us.  i tend to think of it more as a feeling and less of a vibration as i believe we thought the \"craft\" was silent... but there was defininately some type of sensation accompanying the sighting.  although there were three bars \"flying\" parrallel to each other - neither of us suspected for even a moment that there was more than one device in the sky near us - the bars of light all appeared to be locked into one main body, not waivering at all or changing dimensions in any way.  \r\n\r\nwe drove along at roughly 15-20 mph for some time with the craft in sight almost hovering above us but moving forward just barely faster than we were - and just above us not changing speed or hieght.  after perhaps a half mile or mile of this, the craft seemed to change angle slightly- as our perspective on the lights changed... with the bars becoming \"thinner.\"  it also seemed to raise its angle upward at the same time.  then it took off in the strangest manner, disappearing into the sky very quickly and leaving no trace of any kind.\r\n\r\nwhen it \"decided to take off\" we could certainly tell.  it took enough time for us to see the small changes, but when it accelerated it was like its speed increased exponentially - starting off more slowly but very rapidly accelerating off into the distance.  i don't remember hearing as much as sensing a change in the frequency of the vibration we both \"felt\" related to the craft and likely its propulsion system.  the pitch and frequency became very high (in sound terms - approaching 4-6khz whereas when the craft was travelling more slowly the frequency we felt was more in the 150hz range).\r\n\r\ni haven't talked to a lot of people about this and i rarely saw my passenger again after that - but i've always wondered if she reported it and wanted to confirm her tale should she have decided to tell it. i've never heard of anyone seeing a ufo with the kind or color of lighting this apparent craft had... i would assume that its overall shape was round at front and the rest of it shaped like a rectangle - or at least, that was the impression i had - despite the lights being laid out in a rectangular pattern with two squares sticking out the sides.\r\n\r\ni'm almost 50 now and enough information is out there that this might actually fit into some other story helping to confirm something down the road.  thats why i felt it was important to tell.  i've seen a few lights in the sky before, but this was not the same and was surely something incredibly unusual.  there is no question that this was some time of mechanical device which appeared to be under intelligent control.  it seemed to actually be inspecting us as surely it could have speeded off well before it elected to - and i am glad i had the chance to experience this.\r\n\r\nany official investigator can contact me via email at the address i left above if you have any questions about this.  this took place over 30 years ago and we still haven't released any military craft that could possibly maintain the height and speed this vehicle maintained without generating excessive noise, rushes of air or other sure signs that it is a man made device.  i'd be willing to bet that whatever propelled this ship through our skies - it wasn't a technology that we have perfected on earth at this time - and surely not at that time.\r\n\r\nit takes a lot of fortitude to step up and tell stories like this and one can't help but think of what others will think - but who really cares what someone thinks of me at this point!  its more important that someone knows the truth of it and it can then be added to the volume of other similar encounters that could lead us to a better understanding somewhere down the road.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":14446,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.6198425,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12172008-0007","longitude":-84.2436116,"occurred":244522800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":244522800000,"summary":"Three pale pink bars travelling very slowly at roughly 100 feet and 25 mph -

 this thing circled back and began following me, gaining on me at a high rate of speed.  i was doing 75 mph on a rural highway and was totally in a panic.  i knew there was a 90 degree turn just ahead in the road and i was too afraid to consider slowing down as this thing was gaining on me fast.  suddenly, it erratically shot back to the south across the top of the treeline and was gone.  i pulled off the road and cried for about 5 minutes as i was visibly shaken.\r\n\r\nthe object was a red, gaseous orb with what appeared to be a solid core of some type.  it was no more than 5-6 feet across andd travelling at a very high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nfortunately, i am happy to report, these are my only ufo sitings and both occured in southern illinois, 90 miles from st. louis, 45 miles from hwy 64.  this has haunted me since 1973.  i know what i saw but could not find anyone to corroborate my story.  when i saw your special on the discovery channel and the sitings in southern illinois, i was thrilled to know i wasn't the only one to see these things.  people in the area have jokingly said it might have something to do with the cahokia indian mounds.  that is as plausible an explanation as any one i might have!  i just don't know, but i am happy to get this off my chest.  it is quite cathartic.  thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nfrances wiggins, dc\r\n17515a tangi lakes drive\r\nhammond, la 70401\r\n\r\nphone:  (985)634-4006    \r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14442,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.0718152,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12172008-0004","longitude":-89.2211637,"occurred":94636800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":94636800000,"summary":"Arrowhead-shaped object with 15 white lights along the side.
