shapes and sounds of the various domestic and military craft that crowd my seattle-area skies. at first glance i thought this was an airplane, but after i watched it i don't think it was one of ours this time, since there was a lot askew. tonight i watched three very large bright white lights in formation hover above lake washington and travel very slowly northeast, which was not the prevailing flight pattern i had been watching today. while i watched with 10x50 binoculars, there was a red light towards the right of the craft that flashed intermittently, but i was never able to see any green light, even though the craft was relatively close, not more than 10 miles away, and i should have been seeing the front side and back if it were a plane during those 3 minutes. there was no sound at all. it was almost as if the lights were flying in formation to mimic a plane, was the feeling i got. anyways, i kept waiting for the white lights to break apart, as i've seen in videos and while they never did during my watch, the snail-pace speed and the behavior of this ufo was unlike the airplanes i have been watching and filming. i also realized that i had not been able to get a good look at any of the planes tonight due to the cloud cover, while this craft was seen clearly. i have seen about five different ufos since december of last year, but this is the first time i reported one. in april of last year i saw three of them hover and then take off, and this was over lake washington as

orbs in the south west area of lake michigan off the shores near holland, on the west side of the state.\r\nthis past week i once again witnessed these strange fireballs dance around the sky. the only waya to explain their movements, would be bouncing around, allmost in a seemingly playful matter, allmost \"tag\" like,\r\nwhen i first saw the lights this past august, they hung very low in the air in a triangle patter, with 1 orb at the top and 2 on the bottom.\r\nthe strange thing other than the extreme movements they are making is their ability to just vanish and reappear in a completly differnet spot. i have also seen fighter jets as well as the stealth aircraft in the exact area moments after the firball orbs appear. the light will appear, and within 15-20 min. several jets head in the exact direction of the strange objects. let me tell you, i have been sober for over two years, so i was in now way intoxicated.\r\n  once the jets show up, the orbs seem two just dim the light and dissapear once the jets get close. since august i have seen these orbs over a dozen times, with each time becoming stranger and stranger?\r\nthe firballs hang in place, sometimes going straight up or down, making abrupt stops, and \"w\" like patterns in the sky, allmost like if you were to take a ping pong ball and bounce it up and down as fast as you could. the lights seem to sway back and forth as well. \r\n  living on lake michigan for over 20 yrs, i have seen alot of air craft. where i live i am smack in the center of three air ports...Holland , grand haven, and grand rapids. and between two coast guard stations, grand haven and holland. i am very used to seeing all sorts of commercial and private planes, as well as coast guard and private helicopters, one of my neighbors is a fighter pilot, and he buzzes our neighborhood everytime hes in the area, so im familiar with jets, and like clockwork every night at 11:00pm the stealth fighter flies over!!!...Every night like clockwork. the stealth is very easy to identify, especially at night due to its unique light patterns, as well as a extremely bright landing light that actually illuminates the lake for miles below as it comes closer from the west, eastward tword kalamazoo air base. the stealth shape is very unique as well perfect triangle. \r\n   my friend tried telling me they were probably planes, so i called him over to my deck to have a look with some bonoculars. it didnt take him long to realize it was not a plane, it becomes aparent to him because there is a more than one plane in the area where the orbs appeared. so its pretty easy to tell its not planes, especially when there is like 5-12 planes circleing in the area.\r\n   that was the other thing that has really made this stand out, once the orbs appear, planes start coming from every direction, straight out to the area of the orbs, and then these planes circle out in the lake for hours, up to three or fours to be exact, and its strange because one of the first nights i saw the orbs, within about 15-20 min. a stealth went over my head from the inland south eastern area \"kalmazoo\" ,directley out to the area of the orbs, the stealth circled for three hours and then came back in the same path it went out, and as it was coming back in, another jet \"not stealth but indeed a jet\"  came from the exact inland area and went out and circled, it became very obvious to me that there was something of inturest out there because at one point i counted over ten planes circleing the area for hours!!!!\r\n  this is no joke and i am not lieing to you ppl, if anyone reads this and wants to see for themselves, hop in your car and drive to a park called \"windsnest park\", or \"kirk park\"..In between holland and grand haven  around 8-9pm anynight and look to the southwest area over the lake, be patient, but you will def see what im talking about. and these orbs are not boats, or flares. they keep reapearing allmost every clear night, and they are making insane manuvers that would kill a person. they are bouncing around, taking off at very high speeds and then without even stopping, all of a sudden shooting back in the other direction. these firballs are moving real fast to, much faster than the jets that are following them. is this top secrtet government testing? unmaned aircraft?\r\nprototypes? what the hell is it? whatever it is, it is weird? bright fast and \"jumping\" around in the sky, allmost like if you were playing with a laser pointer. i guess jumping, bouncing, and playing are the only good way to describe how their movement. this is very inturesting, and i would love to find out some day whats going on out over my lake. i know that some of these pilots im seeing following the fireballs may have the answere, and honestly i am very supprised that none of them have put a report on mi. mufon, because i know they saw it too!!!!\r\n   why cant are leaders tell all of us what they know about these strange lights all over our country, as well as the world. to me this seems very important for us a humans, as a species, and a society at whole to know? to know the truth? i am in no way saying i think what i am seeing is from another world, or something lake that. but what i am saying is whatever i am seeing, is moving around in the sky like no flying aircraft i have ever seen in my 25 years on like michigan. and in the way it moves seems like it would kill its ocupants \"the amazing speeds to dead stops, and up and down manuvers\" just seem like that would flatten me and you from the inside out. somethings not right here? and the first night i saw them, they were just hanging \"floating\" or hovering in a triangle pattern in the sky, a huge triangle pattern with one orb it the tip of the triangle and one on each bottom corner, the lights were perfect cicles and seemed orangeish and firery, but the very contained, no glare or light outside the orb. i guess sefl contained might be the right was to say it.\r\ni also want to remind and stress how these orbs just vanished, like you dimed the light, just there one minute and gone the next.\r\nalso when they were in the triangle pattern they seemed to be in sync with eachother, also the triangle was massive, from where i was on the beach, i would say the triangle had to be over a mile from top to bottom.\\just massive and almost seemed like they were connected somehow, because of the ever so slight movement, the triangle went straight up in the air. so when the triangle appeared you could say the botttom with the two orbs was closest to the surface of the water, and the top orb at the tip of the triangle was sraight up above it, im trying to explain it, its hard thought. basically the triangle orb formation was pointing vertically up at the sky, and moving slowly tword space, straight up and down, and the only time these orbs were moving that slow is when they were in the triangle formation. they only moved slow in formation, or when they were hovering, any other time they were bouncing around like bats out of hell. believe!!!!!! if its all you do just be open to something bigger than me or you! because something was out there, something very strange, and obvouisley very cool and powerful. for all we know it could be our ownn airforce. sorry so

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In february of 1976 my self and two friends were on a multi-day backpacking journey in slickrock creek wilderness located in the nantahala national forest of western north carolina. we were prepared for several days of remote hiking and had chosen a period of time after the close of hunting season for our safety and also to be as isolated as possible with hopes of seeing no people. slickrock creek wilderness is a large road less tract intertwined with deep coves and rugged high southern peaks best known for great trout streams, good bear and wild boar hunting. the weather was absolutely stellar with crystal skies and temperatures at night in the teens. we made our way into a very secluded small cove known as nichols cove, a side drainage to the main valley of slickrock creek and there we established our first camp. at the end of a day of scrambling up creeks to locate undiscovered waterfalls and orienteering over trail less mountaintops we returned to our camp for some much needed rest and food. after our dinner and after the fire had been established we sat back to enjoy the brisk night air and to gaze into the milky way on one of those winter nights that the stars are countless and seem much closer to earth. we all noticed an unusual light somewhat larger than any of the stars moving erratically across the sky, stopping and going and making right angled turns. the light appeared disc shaped and the color was white like a star but less brilliant, somewhat duller and less jewel like than a star. from our camp in the small cove we could see the horizon and the mountaintops surrounding us quite clearly. the disc began to come closer and closer towards our location startling us a bit but we laughed it off and made some jokes about martians. as the light grew in size we could see that it was indeed a disc shaped object. there was no sound and it continued coming closer to earth dropping behind the ridgeline that separated us from the slickrock valley. as the disc went out of sight into the adjacent valley a glow spreading into the night sky moved north to south and back again as if following the exact route of the creek. after a few moments the glow began to move up our small valley becoming brighter and brighter as it came closer. all of a sudden a behemoth craft larger than a football field, equally the size of several jumbo jets lifted up slowly and hovered just above the tree line over a small ridge illuminating the entire area. we could see that the light from the disc we had seen in the sky was actually the underneath of the craft and it was encircled in multi-colored lights most of which were reddish in color. we were completely mesmerized and we could 'feel' that someone or something was in the craft and we felt certain they knew we were there. at the risk of sounding clich���, the only image of this thing that i can accurately relate to you to describe this is the end scene in \"close encounters of the third kind\" where the large ship comes to the top of the mountain. this monster was that large and that dynamic and we were practically catatonic at the sight of it. it was almost ironic months later when that movie came out and we tried in vain to explain to people that was what we saw. back to the story; in the blink of an eye and with absolutely no sound this huge craft shot skyward faster than the eye could follow and again became the white disc light that we had seen earlier. as if this was not enough to frighten us none of us had moved from our positions around our campfire. a couple of seconds later we began to hear a roaring noise and a pair of fighter jets roared into our black little valley coming so close to the ground we could see the undersides of them. this is when we al seemed to 'wake up'. we all screamed and jumped away into the night. the jets made a few more passes and then returned from the direction and whence they had come. \r\n\r\nwait, there is more...First, i am always the fire keeper and after this event was over we all assumed that it took about 20 minutes for the entire scenario to play out. as i said, it was a rather cold evening and i had built a large fire with several hard wood logs that i had cut. we all noticed that the fire was almost burned to coals. second, we had intended on a week or more of backpacking through the region but the very next morning we packed up without speaking a word and drove the 7 hour trip back to our hometown never mentioning what we had seen. third, we all worked together at a local restaurant at the time and not one of us spoke about the event until a few months later at a large outdoor party to celebrate the purchase of a friend���s new farm. dancing around the party fire that night the conversation turned ubiquitously to ufo`s and lights in the sky. standing next to my friend he began to curse at everyone telling them that they didn���t know what 'bleep' that were talking about. he grabbed me sobbing and exclaimed to everyone \"he is the only one that knows\". it was at this point that i myself began to remember that night in our camp in tiny little nichols cove. i will not purport to speculate regarding the origins of the craft we witnessed that night but as a fairly observant guy and somewhat of an aviation buff, i can tell you that we humans are not capable of producing the thing we saw flying even unto this day. unless the federal government is hiding some rather amazing technology i will maintain that we do not have crafts such as this. this story has lived with me for decades now and upon occasion will haunt my dreams but i am always amused when people want to tell me their ufo stories and talk about seeing lights in the sky. i listen quite carefully and empathetically to them and then i say \"did you get the jets with yours?\" that���s my story and i���m sticking to it.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s)","flightPath":"Path with directional

driving roughly westward on the raleigh inner beltline near the six forks rd exit when i saw directly in front of me what obviously was an airliner flying at low speed. it was at extremely low altitude and seemed about 2 or 3 miles away flying just barely above the trees and straight across my path. i stared at it for maybe 2 seconds. it was a long slim cylinder of shiny metal with two colored sections-one red and one black each about 1/3 of the length of the craft. i saw no wings, tail or engines but assumed this was due to looking from the side of the plane and maybe some subtle reflection of sunlight was hiding the tail. also, since it is extremely common to see aircraft approaching nearby raleigh/durham international airport, i instantly dismissed it as an airliner. so i looked slightly away from it to maintain my lane position but glanced right back within about 1 second to confirm what type of plane it was. within that one second it had vanished. i blinked my eyes repeatedly like you see people do in the movies... but due to the craft's low speed and relatively wide sighting area i had in front of me i would have had to look away for at least 5 or 6 seconds to miss it going behind trees and buildings. this event didn't conform to any rational explanation i can think of other than that it was an extremely advanced technology and either departed or became invisible instantaneously. \r\ni've read that many new pictures of ufo's are being reported by people who saw nothing while shooting normal pictures with a new digital camera but the objects turned up

it i was hoping to get more info on it. there was a travel advisory which i as a teenager ignored. i also took the backroads home from dropping off my girlfriend. i turned off highway 158 between belleville illinois and millstadt. i have never known the name of this road. it connects 158 with the newly called frank scott parkway. the sky was clear .Snow all over the ground. there was a full moon. i saw this huge object motionless in the sky. it looked triangular from my vantage point. i got out of my car and sat on the hood watching it. i focused on the lights since i had no camera. it was surrounded on its edge by flashing colored lights. they changed color very quickly. at the time i remembered the sequence but now i do not recall. 2 airforce jets came after it and as they approached the object went slowly up and out of sight. the jets did not follow object up in the sky they turned around and returned to scott air force base nearby. it was in the belleville news democrat as hundreds called in . the air force denied having any planes in the sky that night. who knows more???????\r\n\r\np.S i am not sure of the month. pretty sure it was 1977 but could have  been 1976 0r 1978.\r\n\r\ni noticed it because there was so much snowfall that i could not see the road, i was hunched over my steering wheel up close to the windshield when i noticed the flashing lights. the full moon and snowfall made the sky quite bright. i immediately thought it was a ufo because it was so large, motionless and made no sound that i could hear. i really do not know how big it was. at the time i thought it was the size of a football field. i was still for 6-8 minutes until the airforce arrived.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":14431,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.5213504,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12162008-0003","longitude":-89.9803135,"occurred":248428800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":248428800000,"summary":"Huge

there now before i forget most of the details. i had a similar experience to this, but not the same day, it was actually just one day later on january 9th, a wednesday. everything i say is 100% truth, i have no reason to lie about this.\r\n\r\nanyways, this all occurred somewhere between the hours of 10pm and 12am. i'm not exactly sure on the time, but i was coming home from church. the reason it was so late is because some of us had hung out for a while that night. i think it was more around 10 though the location was right outside of tye, tx, a small town just a few miles outside of abilene, which is about a 3 hour drive west of dfw. i was driving on 707(a road that goes straight through tye and eventually hits abilene) just making my way back from church, i made a stop at the flying-j on 707 to get a drink and snack to play games for a few hours with, and as i was leaving i saw a bright white light in the sky in the direction straight ahead of where i was. it looked almost like a flashlight would if it were 15 feet in front of you, best way to describe it. it was probably about a mile or two away from where i was when i first saw it. keep in mind this road is straight for several miles after it goes through tye. so i continued driving towards it because that is where i needed to go. the closer i got to it it seemed as if it was just in a fixed spot and wasn't moving at all. i took a video of me driving towards it, which i will talk about in a second, and i actually pulled up next to it. i stopped parallel to this \"thing\" and watched it for several minutes. it hovered there making no sound whatsoever. i even shut off the car to see if i could hear anything and couldn't. this object was floating, or hovering, only about 200 feet off the ground if that and was only about 100 feet away from me. it was stopped slightly over a house and just sat there for about 2-3 minutes. it had several lights on the bottom that would flash blue, red, and green, but not like any aircraft i have ever seen before. it made a strange pattern. it started out coming from the bright light at the front and continued down the bottom straight but towards the end it broke out into two different lines making a triangular shape. the craft didn't really have a defined shape to it, all i could see was a very faint silhouette and it almost appeared as if you could see through it. like i said before, it hovered there for just a few minutes, making no sound at all, and when i stepped out of my car to get a better look it took off. at first, it was slow, but then it went pretty fast. i continued to watch it fly straight ahead until i could no longer see it. it did make a small, but not like what i have heard from airplanes, sound when it took off at first. after the initial sound, it didn't continue to make any noise. for some reason though, i had my phone sitting in my lap the whole time and didn't take anymore video footage, i guess i was just too dumbfounded to do anything. it was by far the scariest, weirdest, and mind-boggling thing that i have ever witnessed.\r\nimmediately following this event, and called my mom telling her that i think i just saw a ufo and she just laughed and told me to come home. i got home, showed her the video and she was just skeptical about the whole thing. also, one detail that i clearly remember is that absolutely no one else was driving down the road while i was on it. it was rather odd because there is usually someone on it no matter what time of day it is. anyways, about the video, i kept it until my phone broke about 2 months later and lost the video for good, so i have no more physical evidence of this.\r\nthat following monday morning i was woke up early and told to come watch the news, it was about the stephenville sighting the day before i had my sighting. all i had to say to my mom was i told you i saw something. she finally believed me after that and wanted me to report it to abc, but i didn't want to because i just didn't want to be out there on tv(if it got that far) or anything of the sort, so i kept it between me, her, and a few friends. i only told a few people that i knew which included 2 teachers and some friends and classmates of mine during a small class, and they all believed every word i said and even i was surprised by it. they all told me that they all had no reason not to trust me.\r\nnow for those of you who look up the locations, yes, there dyess air force base is just a few miles from that location where this occurred. i know what i saw, and it was no aircraft i have ever seen before. i may not know a lot about aircraft but i know that dyess did not have one of these, or at least open to the public. i have lived near that airbase for a total of about 7 years so i know what the aircraft they do have looks like. i have seen several airplanes that they have that have a bright light on the front of the plane, but nothing compared to what i saw.\r\nnow i'm not claiming this was a government experiment or an alien craft or anything, i just know what i saw was a ufo and i still can't explain what i saw.\r\n\r\nfor those of you who would like some information about me, my name is bryce lachance and i am currently 18 but was 17 when this happened.","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500

isotopes (ten), which is probably related to the fact that 50 is a \"magic number\" of protons. 28 additional unstable isotopes are known, including the \"doubly magic\" tin-100 (100sn).\r\n\r\n���applications\r\ntin becomes a superconductor below 3.72 k {-452.974 f}. in fact, tin was one of the first superconductors to be studied; the meissner effect, one of the characteristic features of superconductors, was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals {see superdiamagnetism}. the niobium-tin compound nb3sn is commercially used as wires for superconducting magnets, due to the material's high critical temperature (18 k, {-427.27 f}) and critical magnetic field (25 t). a superconducting magnet weighing only a couple of kilograms {about 4.5 pounds} is capable of producing magnetic fields comparable to a conventional electromagnet weighing tons.\r\n\r\n{1991} ���. . . the burning oil-wells in kuwait, where firefighters used \"corrugated tin heat shields\".  . . . seem to reflect heat the best . . ..\r\n\r\n���it is estimated that, at current consumption rates and technologies, the earth will run out of tin that can be mined in 40 years. however lester brown has suggested tin could run out within 20 years based on an extremely conservative extrapolation of 2% growth per year.\r\n\r\n���the recovery of tin through secondary production, or recycling of scrap tin, is increasing rapidly. while the united states has neither mined since 1993 nor smelted tin since 1989, it was the largest secondary producer, recycling nearly 14,000 tons in 2006.\r\n\r\n���in 2007, the people's republic of china was the largest producer of tin . . . with 43% of the world's share, followed by indonesia, with an almost equal share, and peru at a distant third, reports the usgs.\r\n\r\n���after the discovery of tin in what is now bisie, north kivu in the democratic republic of congo in 2002, illegal production has increased there to around 15,000 tons. this is largely fueling the ongoing and recent conflicts there, as well as affecting international markets.���

saw five lights and i thought kinda strange for a b-52 bomber to be flyin that low right at me directly above the center of the road. i figured it was one bec it was so low and it had a brighter light in the center and two on either side that where parallel with each other but not the center light. so as im going down the 50 feet (which is a small hill that goes down levels out and then goes back up to a greater hill my house is on the bottom slope of the hill about 15ft up from the flat point, but this road is completely straight, it just goes up and down (i know this is the straightest point bec i useto ride my bike there and only there bec it was the only point where you could see cars coming from either directions, almost like a half pipe, but one side three times smaller than the other and ive lived in this house since i was 8 and im now 20 and i've lived in the neighbourhood since i was 5.) anyways these five lights are very slowly coming towards me, and as im headed down the little hill i notice it move directly left and i kinda thought to myself did that just do that?? or am i trippin? bec had it been a b-52 it would of had to bend sideways to move that way and straighten out and this would of had to of been done in prob 2 sec max. so i dismissed it and i keep lookin at it and im now at the flat part and it moves the same distance but to the right directly right and then i was like, ok wtf is that. and as im thinkin this it moves back to the direct center again (at that time i was going slightly up the hill to my driveway) i park cockeyed in my driveway about 3/4 in the rest of my car in the road and i see it and i realize its black and its just starting to go under me and im thinkin woah that looks like a stealth bomber and now is where it gets really strange, after that point this thing dropped in altitude and slowed down and i realize it was either much bigger or much smaller than initally presumed. its a completely jet black pyramid rotating very very slightly, so black that the just setted sun behind it would of created a reflection but it had none, as it passed beneith me i saw four lights, it was a flat triangluar area at each of the three points a different colored light was strobing very slowly but never went out just got brighter and less bright in sequince with the other two on the courners the corners closest to me where blue and green and the other corner light was red and in the middle was a sufficently brighter whitish yellow light, as its going over me im screaming at it yelling you! hey yo0u! come down! wtf are you! come down now! and right as it passed the point under me. absolutly no sound, i could see and hear other planes that where very far away compaired to this thing (it went from my left to right, bec my house is on the left side of the road) and was followin the road it turned off the blue and green and red lights just the whitish yellow ones where there and i looked exactly like a plane and started strobing the red light like a plane would, white lights (and red,blue,green before turned off) ---....Oooo00000oooo.... red light after moved over me ---..O0.0.0o.. just like a plane two red flashes every four sec. at this time i flipped my [cms pd] and sprinted to the side door of my house (my car was still on in the driveway) i slipped on some ice and busted my thumb but at the time i was too excited to feel it i ran to the deck which kinda faces the direction it was headed, the direction i came from. grabbed binocks and watched it continue over hwy69 i could not focus on those lights it was if they where unreal, most airplanes flying that low with lights on in that visablitly i would of been able to see the bulb of the light while it was strobing and when it wasnt but i couldnt and there was no reflection of the pure jet blackness of the object; i gave the binocks to my mother who had heard the commotion and she looked at it and said it was a pyramid rotating slightly and flying on its side, on an angle and my mother is a student services cashier at embry riddle aranotical school of enginering, all she does when she is at that position is do student loans, but they make her go out to the airport and do flightline where she is there and watches every plane from erau take off and land and log their hours and she said those where not the lights of a plane and that was not how any of our planes fly. this was dec 14 2008 at six p.M.

i would know the difference. it appeared to be far enough as to be in space, either at the edge or just above our atmosphere. i imagine it was of great size to be visible from that height. we watched as the tube seemed to shrink and almost fade out but then it grew back. sometimes it would appear to be rotating on its axis, spinning end over end. one thing i noticed as we watched it perform its maneuvers was that it remained in the exact same place in the sky for over an hour. that told me that it was geo-synchronous and moving exactly with the earth. had to have some kind of intelligence behind it. it did not fly away in any direction. after a while, i went for my telescope and set it up to view the object. the light seemed to have a greenish glow when viewed from the ground but through my telescope, i could see a definite cylindrical shape that glowed white. it also looked to me to be translucent, not really solid. it would almost shrink and fade out of existence then would suddenly be there again.\r\n\r\ni remember thinking; this must be a government experiment in space. i didn't think it was a ufo at that time. i had recently viewed a lecture (on one of those college tv channels) on lasers and particle beam technology. this object seemed to behave exactly the same way as a particle beam would when being manipulated by an opposing laser vibrating at the same frequency as the beam. the beam would grow and then retreat according to the pressure applied by the opposing laser. i figured the government had something big going on up there. \r\n\r\nbut then i read more about other sightings and how similar some of them were to ours. other people reported seeing an object that would seem to fade in and out of existence. also, many were initially viewed as cylindrical that would change phase. i thought that was pretty accurate. i also began to realize that the space station and shuttle all travel in an orbit and do not stay in one place for over an hour. my neighbors were convinced that what they were witnessing was an actual ufo. it took me a few years before i would believe it also. my neighbor said he phoned the local news channel but was told it was probably a \"weather balloon\". the next week an unusual amount of press came out about meteors and such. i figured this was just some attempt at disinformation for the public sake. \r\n\r\nto this day i have no idea what we all saw that night or how many others viewed it also. i have seen many happenings in the sky over the years. i have seen satellites fly by on their very high and very straight course. i know the difference between stars and planets and meteors and such. this was not any of those. not swamp gas either. this was a very large object at high altitude under intelligent control, doing some weird things. not natural at all. not the aurora borealis. it was very localized in the sky. \r\n\r\ni went back in the house and came out several times that evening to look again at the sky. i don't remember at what point it vanished for good. it did not return.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":14411,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.0646738,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12142008-0009","longitude":-74.3974012,"occurred":998377200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Jersey","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":998377200000,"summary":"Luminescent tube of greenish to white light changing shape and size high in the sky, sometimes rotating, fixed position for over an hour.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"New Jersey","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:289682"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed","city":"New York","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Around 1am i was called to the window to witness what was atlest 100 star like crafts dropping into the kill van kull. no surprise someone from california just put up a report of exactly what i saw. me and my girlfriend were up till 4:30 am watching these low dropping objects. this is not the 1st time i have seen crafts above the kill van kull. out of all the crafts, the most memorable was a firey disc that shot across the sky in a strange wobbling motion. some crafts were also not lit up, but you seen them with the moon light reflection, dancing and playing with each other like kids. very peaceful display in their aerial acrobatics. since i was i child i seen crafts of all kinds. last night was somthing surreal.
