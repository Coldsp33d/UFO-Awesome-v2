2008\r\n\r\ndecember 12, 2008 11:30 pm \r\n\r\nmy wife was outside and noticed a fleet of lights moving across the night sky. she asked me to come look at this���i looked up and saw what looked like bright stars moving from northwest to southeast across my night sky. she pointed out three of the lights in the middle of the group that were moving in a diagonal row.  there were scattered clouds that night moving west to east. the lights just kept coming and coming. there had to be at least a hundred of these lights in all. they were all moving at the same speed and direction, maintaining the same distance from each other, across the night sky. the lights were slightly different in colors and brightness, some were pure white and bright, some were slightly orange-red, and some were blue-white. to us they all appeared to be at the same altitude moving swiftly, taking over a full minute to cross over our entire night sky. it was just amazing how many of them there were, and the speed they must have been going. i���ve seen many satellites in the past moving across the night sky and these lights were moving at twice the speed of them. once the fleet had moved past us there were no more lights trailing behind.  \r\n\r\nthe next morning i thought about the three stars that my wife had pointed out to me when i had first joined her outside. then it hit me, orion, the constellation of orion, the belt!  that night i showed her the constellation of orion in the sky; i asked her if anything looked familiar? without hesitation she pointed to the three stars of orion���s belt. i printed out a picture of orion and held it up over my head, as strange as this might be, i feel that the fleet of lights was moving in the formation of the constellation orion.

columbus towards dayton (basically west of columbus). one light would travel up & down on the right of the horizon; one would travel from the left of the horizon, slowly right, then shoot back across to the left, only to start all over again; the other light would start towards the botttom of the horizon, travel up & and the same time, come towards me, then back down. one clear, calm night i decided to see if i could attract that one. as i drove towards them through relatively empty country roads around midnight, i would flash my bright lights towards them. by the time i got to the london ohio area, i noticed one of the lights was coming a lot closer to me. eventually, i could make out a shape. so i stop on a dirt entry road of a local field, intentionally left my car running, lights & radio on, & got out. whatever this thing was, it silently floated over me about 100-200 feet overhead. it was black (or dark blue. it had what i would describe as \"fat\" wings attached to a tear drop shape with no tail fins. there were port hole like lights along both \"wings\", and one spot light like on the nose of the craft & at each wing tip. the lights were pointing to the ground, but not actually making contact with the ground that i could see. while it drifted over me, i was looking straight up & made notice that there was no interruption with my car's function. this thing floated over my car & over towards columbus. i looked back towards the other two light to see what they were doing. they haven't moved. i looked back to see the thing that went over me & it was gone - no where to be seen. this took about 1��� seconds. i have no idea where that thing went. \r\na few days later, those light disappeared & to date, i haven't seen them again.\r\ninteresting note, i told a few friends about the lights & they verified they have seen them too, but never with the experience i had. a couple friends told me they could even see them from interstate 70 traveling west from columbus!\r\n\r\ncrude drawings are attached. the 'object' is basically correct, but the proportions aren't perfect. the lights on the wing tips & nose are shown as shining down to the

where.  she says between the treees.  i then began to focus on what looke like to me a ball of amber light. she said it appeared from no where, glowing really brightly. i could see a black line making a motion in the ball of light. it look like a band of lights where moving from left to right in the center of the object.  i guess that is what made the black apear to be moving, or the entire object was rotating. next it started to make all color, red, white, purple, orange,  rainbow colors. then it started to flash one color. it would flash red,then white.  im really thinking plane at that point.  next it would turn back to the amber light with the motion in it again. the  amber  color  was like something was on fire in the sky, it had a lot of motion in it. u could really see all the colors it was making. next i tell my wife to go  get the video camera.  \r\n\r\nwhile she is looking for keys so she can get the camera out of the truck, i watch the object make serpentine motions over the trees.  i could tell it was at least 200 yards away becaude i would loose site of it behind a tree. then it would reappear on the other side of the tree.  at some point i could see it over the tree also.  so i basically stayed in the same area. it takes her close to 5 minutes to bring me back the camera, and it is still there. i try to video it through the trees, but i couldnt finde it in the camera. so we watch it for a few more minutes, while trying to figure out what to do. \r\n \r\nwe decide to get in the truck and  drive  to the object.  there is a cut out over a sewer lake there, so the skies is clear at least to the trees the object was dipping behind. so we drive there in less than 2 minutes. the cut out is on  the street behind our street.  we pull up to the fence around the sewer pond and beging to watch the object. i see a red light and a white light. i tell my wife it's a plane.  that's a air plane doing search manuver.  she starts argueing with me that it is round lights that are rotating in a circle.   i tell here again that it is a plane searching for something. it is taking me forever to get it in the view of  the camera. im not really trying that hard because it looks like a planes seriously.   im not paying attention to that this thing just stopped and hovered in one place. im only thinking i can  get it on video now that it stopped moving. it paused for a few seconds, like it had noticed that we was there.  it then took off headed north.  \r\n\r\nthe moon was still low in the sky so i aimed for it. i brought the moon into view.  that's when i go it on tape.  to the naked eye it looked like a plane  going across the sky .  through the camera i could see that a red light was behind a white light, but could not see a structure. i knew then that it wasnt a plane by the position of the red light to the white one.  we was there  3 or 4 minutes before i got it into the camera's field of view.  i have about 10 seconds of the object on video before it got out of site behind the tree.\r\n\r\nwe decide to get back in the truck and see if we can get another look when it  goes across the area where it wasnt any tree.  we didnt see it again. if it would have keep the same speed that it took off at, we should have been able to see it.  i veiwed the video and was thinking piece of crap.... i tell my wife, man we had it.. i just couldnt get the distance right on the camera. \r\n\r\ni go home and download it to my cpu using sony vegas 5.0 program.  next it comes to me how i watched a guy do a frame by frame on some shuttle explosion video. i try the frame by frame on my video. all i can say is wow.  i cant believe it\r\ni know some of the light effects is motion blurr. what looked like single lights to the naked eyes was several lights. sometimes as many as 9 rainbow like each a different color.  they made triangle patterns, x patterns, they made spiral patterns, helix patterns.  i know that the shaking on my hands could not have made all those effects to the lights, plus i was filming leaning on a fence.  plus u could see multiple effects on a  single frame. there was quite a  bit of patern changing in the ten  good seconds of video.  \r\n\r\nat one point it looks like a saturn shape ufo.  but then it kinda looks like four diamonds shape lights.   i have the original video. all the motion in the video is by my movements, this thing took off on a level plane.  it looked to be slowly speeding up slowly and rising.  like a plane to the naked eye. i used a sony handycam dcr-trv 280\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

relatively clear day. something in the sky slightly ahead and to the north caught my attention. i couldn���t make out what is was at first, so i tried to observe it as closely and often as i could considering that i had to watch the road and that some roadside power lines obscured my view. it was metallic gray in color and appeared to have more mass in the center and possibly some sort of rim. i tried to match it to common plane types, but i couldn���t. it was closer than a jet and had no contrail (though a jet at low altitude on ascent or descent wouldn���t have one, i guess���but the nearest jet-supporting airport is 60 miles away). yet it was grayer than most prop planes i���ve seen from our local airport, and i couldn���t make out any wings. it traveled ahead of us smoothly and slowly. i kept trying to observe it, but i eventually lost sight of it. the entire time, i wasn���t able to definitively call it an airplane, though it could well have been. i joked with my family that it could have been a ufo. they weren't able to see this or the next object, however, i guess because of the way we were seated and the available windows.\r\n\r\na few minutes later as i continued driving west, i spotted a bright, yellowish-white short streak in the sky roughly in the direction the object was going. i immediately thought it must have been a jet after all and had reached a cruising altitude and produced a contrail. this image was in the southwestern sky near the afternoon sun but lower and slightly north. i continued to try and observe the object and soon noticed that it didn���t change shape or move. taking a longer look, it appeared to be a very bright rod-shaped object in a slightly slanted upright position. a yellowish-white radiance or cloud immediately surrounded the brighter interior. i soon lost sight of this object because of the trees.\r\n\r\nwe stopped at a local business to look around. about 15 minutes later we started back for home, traveling east. after we made a turn onto us 29 north, i glanced back at the western sky and noticed the bright object again. it did not appear to have moved from its former position.\r\n\r\ni don���t know if the two objects were associated, and the first one could well have been a plane. the second bright object really has me wondering, though. i would like to find out if some sort of cosmic event, such as a supernova or planetary alignment, caused that bright object, as it appeared to be as fixed in the sky as a star at night (in fact, i jokingly told my family that it could be the star of bethlehem). that���s hard to imagine, though, since it was still broad daylight and the object was near the sun.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:25:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

768-2332 on the 9th of december from 3:00 to 6:00pm.  i was working on a horse named cassinova and kathy at the same time out by her barn. i looked up and saw a long thin craft that was just still and steady above the tree line- it was not close or at least did not appear that way. i would say in relationship to a regular commercial airplane the object may have been slightly closer. the objet started to shift or spin clock wise about 90o and then go counter clock wise but was so fast the manuver was blurred and then the object had split into two that had a strobe light quality but shape was hard to decipher. honestly if i did not see the craft split i probably would have thought it was a plane or something \"normal\". the only difference was that the lights blinked really fast, no noise, a beam of light that was pretty faint, and the flight patterns were odd.  the objects, one on my right flew at a casual pace away from the other one, while the other one had a beam of light comming from it shining in a 45o angle towards the ground but not on the ground since it was so high in the sky  and headed in our direction which was directly in front of it. this second craft was also at a casual pace. i was a little freaked out so i thought we better get in the barn since it was comming towards us and i was suspicious of that beam of light.  connie welsh (209)878-3336 of greeley hill, kathy and myself ducked into the barn which was probably 12 feet from where we were working on the horse. we lost sight of the craft since it flew over the barn and then could be seen again off to the right side of the barn with the beam of light now projecting 45o angle in the sky not towards the ground.The craft ended up doing a complete circle and came to the point where it had split then drifted further away from us but still directly in front of us. \r\n  connie's dog was in her car at the other side of the barn. she went to check in on him only to see several more crafts on the other side. she called to us and we got there just in time to see two more longer crafts break the same spinning way into now 4 more crafts as well as 2 others that had already spilt prior to us going on that side of the barn. three of the crafts, total, had beams of light that pointed in different directions: one horizontal across the skyline, one above, and the earlier craft did both towards the ground and above. we watched the pairs move away from its mate and how their beam was comming from one of the pairs only. kathy's ranch is very open and you can see the whole area.  the crafts surrounded the area very high up in a horseshoe shape that appeared somewhat uniform or organized.  we watched until they drifed farther apart and felt like we had a window of opporutunity to leave. it was very close to 6 pm when connie and i drove out kathy's driveway in separate cars.

before, i knew what it was. i went to get the binoculars and when i looked at it, all i could say was oh, wow!  it had these red and green lights on it that seemed to flicker or pulsate.  i gave the binoculars to my husband so he could see it, and he was as astonished as i was.  you could even see the red lights flashing on it with just the naked eye.  i looked around the sky and saw another object that had the red and green lights on it as well, but a lot smaller then the first object. there were a couple of planes that were flying around these objects. don't know if they were out there because of the moon or if they were checking out the strange objects. they were both stationary, but seemed to move very slowly. looking at them through the binoculars, they looked like they were kinda bobing around.  we had to come in because it is very cold out side tonight.  i just looked out side and they are still there. this isn't the first time i have seen this, but every time i do, it is very exciting, sometimes when i have seen them, i feel a little uneasy, but didn't feel that way tonight.  i would really like to know what it is out there.  i feel i'm looking at a ufo, but i'm

there when i noticed a reddish light just above the treeline, on the left side of the road. it looked like a dim, oval star, kind of flat, and i thought to myself that it looked somewhat like the planet mars, but larger and a little brighter (and misshapen). i noticed it because i'd been looking at the sky a few minutes before and hadn't seen anything like it. i didn't say anything to my husband at first, but i kept watching. it stayed in the same place, and after maybe five minutes i lost track of it as we passed under a bridge in a more densely wooded area. \r\n\r\na few minutes later i saw it again, this time on the right side of the road, still slightly above the treeline, just hovering. as we reached a bend in the road and headed into a clearing, i got a better view and finally asked my husband if he saw it too, and he did. as we watched it looked like it was flashing, but not like a strobe, rather, the light was steady but looked like it faded off and on, from rust-red to orange-yellow. we went through a list of what it could be, from a microwave tower to a plane, none of which matched what we were seeing. after a few more minutes of watching it, we ran into more trees for a just a moment, and when we cleared them it had disappeared. by this time we'd reached terre haute. as far as our feelings, i definitely felt curious, and a little excited. my

to post it or not. well today is the day. i assure you everything i am saying here is 100% true.\r\ni am a new member.. all my life i never believed in ufos. i thought people who claimed they had sightings were nuts. three years ago i started watching youtube videos of ufos and i was shocked at what i saw people capturing on home video and then i became a believer. i do believe that  flying triangles are governmental in nature.(just my opinion) i saw films from the 80's on youtube where they were using antigravity technology in air craft. i do think the orbs and the flying serpents are ufo's and are of another world. i am 42 female, was a new ager, astrologer. studied esoteric books for over 30 years.I had many paranormal experiences through my life including nde, astral projections and many weird happenings throughout my life. to long to explain here, believe me i could write a astonishing book on my experiences.\r\ni recently found out about the new world order about 6 months ago and how the governments of the world are actually practicing,worshiping lucifer and erecting statues of the pagen deities over governmental sites.I have read about it for so many years, but as much as you study esoteric knowledge somewhere in the back of your head you remain a little skeptical, because you are never 100% sure how much of what you are reading is really true. i know the  most important symbology of the new world order is the triangle. i do know astrology is true, not sunday morning newspaper astrology but real astrology. the subject is profound, complicated and at times frightening.\r\ni recently had 3 major events happen to me in the past 4 months that have me scratching my head. i have one on video which i will post.\r\nthe one i have on video is the most puzzling\r\nplease keep in mind my camera that captures video is broke so it looks like night time when i took the video but it was still light in my room when i filmed this. something is wrong with the settings for the lighting. the picture i took shows about the same lighting as when i filmed the video of orbs and triangles. also the flashing red light you see is from my camera. it take ok pictures but the video settings are broke.\r\nit was the last week of sept 2008 about 5:30pm. i got out of the shower and went to my closet in my bedroom. as i was about to walk into my closet i briefly noticed a white glowing orb on my wall. i thought at first glance it was the sun beaming onto my wall from my window. it seemed strangely glowing, oval and about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. i proceeded to walk into my (walk in closet) and change. when i walked out of my closet and i walked up to the wall for a better look i was amazed and shocked to see a dozen flashing multicolored triangles next to the glowing orb. flashing in and out. i couldn't believe my eyes! i said out loud wait here i am getting my camera, that's why on the video you hear me say \"thank you\". i ran to find my camera which can also film video. by the time i got back with the camera the orb had reduced in size to about 1 inch maybe 2 in diameter, the flashing triangles were still there. i watched it for a few minutes before it faded out. (which you see on the video)\r\ni want to point out that prior to this, about 1 month before this event i had prayed to god to please let me see him, and about 2 weeks later i the first experience in these series of episodes. my husband was sleeping in the bedroom, the lights and tv were off and i had just laid down. i looked up at the ceiling and there was a 5 inch glowing orb on my ceiling, i couldn't believe what i was seeing. (it looked the the one you see in the video but bigger) i looked around the room to see to see if it was a reflection coming from somewhere. it was pitch black in the room and no explanation for it. i woke my husband up because i thought i was seeing things. he turned around half asleep and said he saw it to. honestly this was very unnerving, i put the covers over my head and fell asleep. 2 weeks later is when i had the flashing triangle episode.\r\nabout a week after the triangle episode about 5:00am in the morning i was looking out my back window because i heard some noise coming from the business strip in the back of our parking lot(see pic). i opened the window and noticed a truck in the business strip which i assumed was the noise i was hearing. out of nowhere i see what looks like a comet with a flame going perfectly horizontal 100 feet above my parking lot. i was shocked because it did not come down vertically from the sky. it was perfectly horizontal like someone shot it through a cannon. it was a very big size and very bright. i can't explain what i saw. i saw a video on youtube of a flaming comet that was coming down from the sky, but was traveling one way then would change directions, then change directions again. it was a amazing video and not a comet as it appeared to be because of the erratic changes in direction.\r\ni saw a posting today on mufon dec 12th 2008 from someone that had a similar experience withe glowing orbs in his house.\r\ni know in the kabbalah, ancient egyptian esoteric sun worship, astrology and gnostic circles this event may be seen as a good omen, being that the up side triangle represent fire and the downward triangle water, the male and female principle and a sign of enlightenment, but after listening to tom horn, steve quayle, david flynn and joye pugh i have came to believe that maybe it is something more sinister, maybe a deception. i am not sure but the more i have learned about what is happening in the world the more frightened i become.\r\ni was baptized catholic have been a new ager for most of my life until now. something very strange is happening in the world today and i believe we are on the cusp of something very unbelievable that is going to happen. the fact that there are governmental groups worshiping lucifer as the bearer of light and erecting pagen statues has made me run back to my christian roots. if there is lucifer then there is jesus. ufos are in the bible as well as stargates worm holes and inter dimensional beings, fallen angels and nephelim. research tom horn, steve quayle, david flynn and joyce pugh. i know it's clearly states in the bible that a falling away would occur and a great deception will spread the world over and even the elect will be deceived\r\ni am in a state of confusion as to it's meaning. my esoteric knowledge says good. my faith say's bad. \r\nyour thoughts are much appreciated....But before you comment please research those researchers i have listed above.\r\ni listed on mufon message board you can post a reply on the message board","distance":"20 Feet or

house is next to the mountains and michaux state forest. it was a clear night, no moon, and the stars were clear and numerous. looking west, i saw a very brilliant red light moving to the north. the object seemed fairly close to me, and at about the altitude of a low flying private aircraft. the red light was very bright, quite a bit brighter than i would even expect from landing lights at that distance. my first thought was that an aircraft moving left to right in my view should display a green marker light. a red light should either not be visible, or be dimmer. i also noted that i could hear no engine noises of any kind. the object moved in a straight line, and quickly passed out of sight behind the mountain. i looked around and could see no other traffic in the sky. i cannot say if the light was the whole of the object, or was attached to something larger that was not lit. the sighting was fairly brief, and i did not think in time to see if stars were occluded near the light. i was and continue to be curious about what i saw. i have a digital camera, but knew when i saw the red light that there would be no time to get it. i wish i had noted the date and time of this event, but at the time, had no thought of sharing my experience. i have felt compelled to submit this report after seeing the recent ufo program on the history channel about mass sightings in pa. i pay attention to the stars and air traffic. i have seen other odd things that have attracted my attention, but this is the least explainable. bright landing lights in the distance can appear strange
