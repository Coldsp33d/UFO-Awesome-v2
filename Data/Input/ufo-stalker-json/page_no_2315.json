(appearing up & down) the lines when first noticed were bright orange in appearance, then the lines started to change to black starting from the bottom to the top, then they changed to bright orange again. at this time, i paused no more and ran the heck home faster than the wind it seemed.\r\n\r\ni do not know what happened to the lines after that.\r\n\r\n*at the same residence, in about the same year, i was playing on a large flat rock in the back yard, with rolling fields that went on forever. from this rock, i liked to shout to hear my echo. it was fun back then as i can remember. i heard and seen a flat black copter with no markings, no windows except for the front that appeared to be blacked out or tinted, of sort fly overheard at a low alititude and keep going until i could not see it any longer. i am not sure if it was anything to think about, but i did look up military craft in a military craft book and did not find anything similar to its squarish shape, that i was looking for. i never really though about it after.\r\n\r\n*i was in this same house, when at night, my dad, a non-believer- went outside to (pardon the \"too much information\") pee off the side of the porch (found his activity out later on in life) and called for my mom. my mom never did go outside to see what it is he was calling her loud for.\r\n\r\ni remember him coming in (mom & i were in the parlor watching tv) and him being pale faced and he took my mother aside and was talking to her in another room.\r\n\r\nshe explained to me later on (because i was nervous & needed to make sure my dad was ok) that he had seen a enormous object hovering above the adjecent field with yellow, blue & red and white lights circling the object and it flew off extremely fast. she said it was nothing he had seen ever before, not even in the military, when he was serving. he was navy.\r\n\r\nmy mother never got to see it, but she is a believer.\r\n\r\n*i had moved from the country to the city in 1980. now it was no longer pa, but now i lived in ri.\r\n\r\ni would say when i was about 14 years old, i was looking out the window & it was night time real early morning hours when its still dark & looking out the window to the yard below and the sky above in a clearing, i saw what appeared a cigar shaped object, kind of charcoal in color with a red lighted tip zoom quickly past overhead. i am talking extremely fast that i wasnt sure if i had seen what i had seen and being in an apartment i couldnt go look out another window, due to the houses on the other side being in the way. i shrugged this experience off. \r\n\r\n*when i was about 17, i had become extremely interested in the paranormal. especially interested in ufo's.\r\n\r\ni had no more sightings really, until i was about 25 years old. \r\n\r\na friend of mine i hadnt seen in ages! had had a major sighting and had wanted me to go to approximately the same area to do some investigating with her, just to be with someone & know she wasnt alone. she wanted to face the same area she had had the major sighting.\r\n\r\nwe went there on occassion and when we did, we would see an occassional white dot in the sky in the night sky going across at a very high altitude dimming in & out of its white color. i had seen a pair flying in formation too far apart to be the lights on an airliner before, they just faded out and vanished from sight, almost exactly overhead. those type of mystery lights were the kind that we saw most of. until...\r\n\r\nthe following year, at night time, i am guessing around 10:30 pm or at least at that time of night, i was out with this same friend and a guy i was dating at the time. none of us believed in doing drugs or drinking, so i can assure you, none of us was on anything. we went to a business type area, where all it is is parking lots and lots of business type buildings. we had chosen this type area because it is also very dark and easier to see the sky in a dark and wide open space. we had all sat down on the pavement of a large parking lot and decided to bring binoculars to do a skywatch. it was a warm night. clear & the sky was filled with lots of stars.\r\n\r\nwe were joking about ourselves being out on a saturday night & skywatching instead of hanging out with a  group of friends and eating snacks and watching movies all night long instead. \r\n\r\nwe apparently werent seeing anything in the sky because we began to joke about \"alien folks\" and said even they had better things to do then to come visit earth. \r\n\r\noverall we were having fun & in a good mood and joking around while gazing upward.... \r\n\r\nuntil.....\r\n\r\nsmack in front of our faces was a large craft, dull bronze (or copper) in color about 500-1000 feet off the ground. the bottom was shaded out due to it being closer to the earths surface. \r\n\r\nwe all flew to our feet and looked up. we were directly under the craft, perhaps off to the side a bit. as i am watching this thing, it looks like a fat disk with a small rim/lip portrusion coming from the sides. no lights, no sound, nothing.\r\n\r\n i mean it was not there and all of a sudden it was right there! i seen the extended rim/lip flex as it appeared to stop in mid air & as soon as we thought we were focused on it, it was gone, quickly to the left, my eyes followed as fast as they could and last time i had seen it, it was above the trees in the horizon to the left of where we had seen it last and again it was gone. \r\n\r\nthis time, gone for good. we never seen it again that night. matter of fact, we discussed it for a while, checked time & wrote the incident down on paper & all went home for the night. it was an amazing experience.\r\n\r\n*about the same time era, the guy i was dating & i were out in the same parking lot observing again the sky, but mainly there to talk to each other about things.\r\n\r\nit was about fall time, the trees near the edge of the parking lot were bare and you could see through them, even though they were dense as it was. we were parked facing the trees that lined that side of the parking lot & again it was late. maybe about 9:30pm, perhaps 10 pm.\r\n\r\nwe were both sitting atop the hood of the car. he and i noticed a glowing pulsating orange orb seemingly going behind the trees we were facing, but more up toward the tops of the trees, making us know that it had to be angle in which we were looking at it that made it appear to behind rather than up above the trees.\r\n\r\nanyhow, it was pulsating a bright orange/red glow dimming in and out, from dark orange red to orange to dark orange red to orange and kept repeating itself until it finally did clear the tree tops & then it went to a complete bright white (with no dimming)\r\n\r\ni would say it gave the appearance & size with the naked eye, of a police search light, but it didnt have that type of brightness, just an internal white glow that was intense. when it reached the to line of the trees and turned white, it now seemed as though it was moving straight up and not across anymore. very slow on its travels. it seemed to go up for a short period of time and then park itself in one position for the next several hours, we seen little white light dots come out of it that were slowly dimming and brightening. mind you these were so small looking as opposed to the large one we seen park itself. we also witnessed these little white dots coming back to the white object rapidly pulsating like a strobe light, without the rays of light that strobe lights cast outward.  \r\n\r\nat some point we did drive away to try and get a friend to witness this with us, but to no avail. instead we just went back and hoped it was still there, in which it was. \r\n\r\nit was approximately going on about 3am when we decided to call it quits and leave well enough alone. upon leaving we did seem to notice a blueish hazy beam going sideways in the sky from this white object, but not exactly connecting to it.\r\n\r\nanyhow, we did leave & never saw it again after that.\r\n\r\n*with the same guy, i witnessed not to long after the last incident, a \"blue donut\" blur a streak in the sky. downward & upward. it was quick and sweet! it was an object/light that was perfectly shaped as a donut that came downward in the night sky, made a blur streak above it and then shot back upwards again casting a blur underneath its blue donut shape/appearance. then the intense blue went out & was gone. (the light was the color of the blue in a flame)\r\n\r\n*i had seen the same object above a chili's resteraunt in the pouring rain, while driving. same thing, it was there & then gone. i was sitting at a red light and chili's was right across the street. i seen it high above the chili's and then it was gone. the red light then changed and i moved on.\r\n\r\n*later on in life, little experiences include: little white dots pulsating, dimming, fading going back and forth in the night sky every 5 minutes. some have done zig zags. i have seen alluminum colored little dots, high up, moving slowly (at a snails pace) across the sky. i have seen black dots high up, doing acrobats (as if they were playing) i have seen them closer too wizzing into clouds and such, never coming out the other side. (some of my little experiences)\r\n\r\n*while in an eight hour shift, working outside the building i have (with a witness) seen 5 silvery objects sitting so still between big puffy full clouds. they sat there for about 5 minutes and then one moved into a cloud and came back to its original position, and when it did, they all moved into the cloud together.\r\n\r\n*i have seen also while working my 8 hours, a white egg enter the atmosphere, without a tail, without noise and go downward and then come back up vertically and sit still in one position.\r\ni had my binoculars in my car and took them out and focused on it. it was just that, a white egg shaped object sitting still. i removed my eyes from the binoculars (but keeping the binoculars in the same place as they were) and could not see it anymore with the naked eye, but when placing my eyes at the scopes again, i could see it. finally i had no choice but to continue working.\r\n\r\n*i had seen a flat black helicopter try and land on the trees near my job as well. the windows were not tinted, but i could not see inside & it had no markings. i am not sure what it was or what it was doing there, but it knocked down the cable line to the building. it never completed the landing. it just flew away.\r\n\r\n*i had also seen in the same vicinity a tube like object, long shaped, that resembled two long (stretched) beer kegs stuck together by a black band around the center fly very slowly over my work place as well. when i went to get my kodak zoom lens camera out of my car, upon looking back up to locate it, it was already far in the distance. it had no sound, no wings. it has been seen more than once, but on occassion.\r\n\r\n*i have seen with a witness- a group (about 3) black dots crossing the road at an intersection (again small) but obvious they were not planes, they were round. they were not too high either, maybe cloud level. no noise. they moved very slowly and in straight deliberate direct path.\r\n\r\n* i have seen & with a witness- two red dots fly up really fast into the sky coming from ground level it seemed. i was standing on a small deck on a second floor.\r\n\r\n*i have seen and with a witness- a really odd object, cruising over a walmart in ma, with three pale circles of light grouped close in a three formation, no noise. the lights seemed to rotate and then disappear, but when they disappeared, three straight lines formed above where the circles were. it repeated this process over and over again until we could barely see it, at the last sight of it, it was near a woody patch in the sky near the lowes store not far from walmart.  \r\n\r\n*i have seen with a witness, a little silvery object at high altitude that appeared to take about 30 minutes or more to move across the sky. \r\n\r\n*i have seen with a witness a dull bronze unidentified object blending into the sky, but just enough to notice. no sound. go over a old garage and uturn it back the same way and just disappear. it was a seconds sighting. didnt last long at all. (we were outside viewing 2007 meteor shower night)\r\n\r\n****the most recent sighting*****\r\n\r\ni & friends witnessed a fleet of ufo's cross over the sky at a cemetary. it was just amazing, we looked up and saw what looked like vaporous silvery objects all in perfect formation (looked like an army) crossing over the sky above our heads, slightly to the side. there was no noise, no nothing. they had a peculiar way of moving too, one row, one row, one row at at time. they were not that high up, probably at cloud level, because they did enter clouds & we watched them come out of the clouds (when coming out, they were a little out of formation) looking more like silver disks and continue onward.  we had seen another large army of ufo's join up with them and we observed them, took pictures and filmed them until we couldnt see them anymore. it was truly amazing. researched and found no air shows in the immediate area as none were in surrounding areas at the time. this sighting was on august 17 at around 2:30 in the afternoon, broad daylight.\r\nif you look under massachusetts sightings in mufon, you can see my pictures and possibly a video.\r\n\r\ni know there are some of you out there saying to yourself, what a flake this person is telling their stories as they think it happened! what nut job!\r\n\r\ni know there are some of you out there that will read this and enjoy it because perhaps you have had multiple sightings throughout your life as well. \r\n\r\neither way, whoever reads this, nothing was made up & i attest that i, myself, as everyone else- does not know, what these objects are. that is why i am sharing all of this writings to all of you, where it is supposed to be, at a unidentified flying object reporting website. because they are just that unidentified. thanks for reading!\r\n\r\ntake of it, what you will.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"To all others concerned like myself\t\r\n\r\nfirst of all, we all are here because we have seen, or been a part of something that we cannot explain. im 39 years old, married. she is 30, and we have 2 kids, 13 and 11. we are all sound minded, and not \r\nunder the influence of anything.  we live in a small town on the border of louisianna and arkansas. our lifestyle here is very slow, and down to earth. country folk!. i was raised in houston,tx surburbs\r\nuntil i graduated. then move here to go to college. it truely is a sportmans paradise here. here missing school to go hunting, or fishing is a good thing.\r\n\r\nso basically we live in a combination of pine forest and oak bottom land. white tail country. so here we spend much time out side enjoying nature. while enjoying nature is how many of my strange situations occured.\r\nsome of the time i was alone.  sometimes i was with friends and family.  often it was just me and my wife. some event i cant give a definite time, but the occurrence will not be exaggerated. so here goes.\r\n\r\nin fall of 91  i was exploring the woods/trails below the house. i was trying to develope my hunting skills so i spent all my extra time in the woods.  i was near this creek deep in the bottoms when i came across some \r\nfootprints. i was like,  what the heck is someone doing in the woods walking bare footed. im thinking maybe a bear. i begin to nervously look around me. i said to myself those are human tracks. i took off my shoe to do a comparison. to make sure that they werent bear tracks. i made a foot print right beside them then i noticed something.  each toe had a small hole in front of it. i was shocked... fist i thought the holes were ant holes in the ground.  then i was like these have to be bear tracks. i began to follow the tracks there were less then 10 and all had the same claw marks at each toe. i never went back to that part of the woods. maybe a couple of years later i saw the same tracks again at another fish spot we frequented. human tracks with claws at each toe. at corney lake,summerfield, ar we fish there often.  so i saw the same tracks in 2 different places about 10 miles apart.  below the house and at the lake.\r\n\r\nin the summer of 1996, about 11pm cst. i was lying in the drive way of my then girlfriends house, in bernice,la.  there only a few  clouds out that night and i was watching the sky.  all of a sudden i see a light i thought\r\nwas a air plane.  i keep watching it and noticed that it didnt have the marker light planes have on their wings. it was just a bright white light moving across the sky. this white light went into a small white cloud bank and never came out next i noticed that a air plane approached directly in front of the light but didnt go into the cloud bank.\r\ni waited and waited for the light to come out. about 10 mins after the plane passed i saw the clould  glow up like a street light in the sky. this was a pure white light the brightest i have ever seen in the sky.\r\ni looked up for another 2 hrs at least and didnt see anything else.\r\n\r\noct. 92/93. im not sure about the date on this one. me and some cousins were out fishing. about 12 of us.  we were at a small creek in the woods a couple of miles from the house.  we all started to here the loud  \r\ngrowling sound. it was growling so loud that u could feel it. at the same time u could here huge trees breaking around it and the woman screaming for her life. u could feel the ground shake every time this thing pushed over a tree. the growls are making our clothes vibrate. it was close to halloween so im thinking maybe some is in the woods with a bass car system up loud as it could be.  this thing is pushing over trees.\r\na woman is sreaming bloody murder. it growling like a tiger or something and it is coming our way.  we all laid on the ground and each chose a tree to climb when this thing gets in view. i chose one leading over the water, telling them that when this thing comes over here, im going over there.  next good judgement hit me, and told them that if whatever is pushing over trees.  we might want to get on those bikes and get the hxxl out of here. and then we all ran to our bike and got from down there.  i watch the news and newspapers for a couple of weeks waiting to see if there would be a missing woman on there.  later on me and some cousing were talking about it and they told me that was the 2 time that they had heard that noise/event.  the first time it was alot closer to the house i was living in then. maybe a half a mile away in the woods.  im goin to make a statement here. invisible.  we could hear the trees falling. see the trees falling.We could hear the  growling. feel the growling. hear the woman scream... but we could not see what it was. it should have been just on the other side of the creek and we could not see it.  all of the noise stop when we was lying there waiting on it to come out like it knew we was there and just  got  quiet.  once again....Invisible!\r\n\r\nsept 94.  i was walking down a 4 wheeler trail.  the same woods below the house. maybe about a mile deep. this was a new trail to me  so  i explored it. it was tight at firstm but about 50 yards out it started\r\nto widen and become a nice road. something a truck to drive down. about  200 yds down it i passed a deerstand. i thought that's a good spot for one. all by itself on an nice rd.  i keep walking and about 100 ft down i hear a deer?  get spooked?  what i thought i heard was a deer or 2 running off in a young  pine  grove. it had a little brush near the road but in the trees was clear.  i should have been able to see what was running.  i could hear them. they headed out and circled  around back to my direction. it shounded like a horse  galloping. i was closing on me really fast. i have a 270 rifle with me. so i really wasnt to omfortable. the nois got so close i that i paniced and took off running back to the deer stand.  i mean running. i could here the charging right behind me.  when i got to the stand i leaped as high as i could  grabbing the top of the stand, i lifted my legs up so the thing wouldnt impale me with it horns. i could hear it running by.  i didnt see a thing come by. my heart\r\nwas beating so fast. i got to the top fo the stand and sit. i took the lense covers off my scope hoping to get a shot off but there was nothing.  invisibel... something run awayfrom me, then back towards me, chased me up a deerstand and i saw nothing....Invisible!\r\n\r\nsummer of 95?... im guessing.  i was living the life of an outlaw.  i was running from the police.  so i head straight to the woods. i didnt want to go to deep because it was dark. the moon was out out so i could see the\r\ntrail well enough to navigate it in the moon light. just a couple of hundred feet from the house is a old trash dump. there is a road behind it. my thinking is that i will take that road, walk towards the raliroad tracks, then hang out on the tracks until it was all clear.  behind the trash dump i notice a red light in the sky. i could see it through the trees, im thinking it was the towns water tower, and if i head towards it i will  reach the tracks.  so i keep walking and i keep the red light in sight, when i come to a place where i know that i can cross over to the tracks....No brush/briar patchs.  i turned and headed towards the light. maybe 50 feet from where i turned. i was within 10ft from the light.  it was on the  ground.  i could hear radio static. police radio im\r\nthinking.   so i think i just walked up on a police car parked in the woods. i really thought this until recently. i walked up on a police car in the woods.  what i saw was a black object with a red light on top of it. it was less than my hieght,5'4\". i kinda was adjusting my eyes to  get a  good view because im looking up through the  trees  one second then the next second i was standing by the light i was following. i didnt pause long. i have really good reflects.  i have been tested and have pilot type relflects.  so it didnt take me long to put everything in \r\nperspective.  it took probably less than a couple of seconds.  i could see the interior glow. i could see a seat with a body/person in it. i could hear the static from the radio. i could see a retangular red light on top of it. i bolted, i over shot the trail i was on and ran up in the briar. i ran about 100ft down and  got back on the trail.\r\ni was like dam what, how did a police car  get down in these woods.  for years i thought it was a police car. first of all our police cars are white. second there is no way a car got to where i seen it... a 4wheeler barely can get down there. there is just no way possible a car was where it was. mabye a 4x4 with a winch could make it there. since now im a u.F.O. hunter. i think that what it was, and i was withing arm reach of it. one more thing. when i turned and bolted off from the object.  i could see a bright amber light all around me  blinding me. that's \r\nthat's why i overshot the trail i was looking for. i couldnt see anything for a while.  i thought the light was part of my panic. now i see the star-like ufo's more often and see them  glow very brightly and dim out.\r\n\r\nsummer 96.  my wife, then  girlfriend was sitting out at the lake. about 10 miles from the house, corney lake. we was going to houston,tx so decided to get some rest at the lake before we head out. it was well after 10pm at night. at about 2:30 my wife wakes me screaming somthing is shaking the car.  i tell her it is the wind go to sleep.  she is distrot. she is like man something just shook the the hell out of the car. im awake by now and tell her to be still and quiet.  she is really panicy. i tell her to sit still and shut up.  i remember keeping perfectly still.\r\ni eased my hand up to the radio and turned it down, so i could hear anything that was out there.  it wasnt up loud anyway. i began to think maybe a bear has walked up on us. we dont have any bear around here, but u never know.  i remember keeping my head and body still for at least 10 minutes.  all at once i looked out the car window. expecting to see a animal on the window breathing heavily at us.  i saw nothing.  she is screaming there was something out there that shook the car.  to calm her i got out and took a leak. i couldnt hear or see anything.  i really felt like something was watching me and was approaching me. so i hurried into the car and started it up a got out of there. !Invisible... for sure she isnt losing it for nothing. but i didnt see or hear nything....Invisibl!!!\r\n\r\nlate summer 99.  i heard about  a fishing place in hapmton,ar. i went, it was down a long dirt road.  i get there and unload my rod, tackle box. i lock up my care 88 mustang conv. 5.0.  i walk off just out of visual of the car. im thinking this water looks great, so i really get into it.  im only a cpl hundred ft from my car.  i could hear a kid/ maybe 2  playing. its a school day so i figure they are  young and at home.  the road i was on appeared to be semi-private.  selective!  there were a lot of reble flags hung on the houses.  which were all on stilts. so i was on p's and q's. i could hear a small laughter. coming from where my car was.  it was really light and delicate.  sounded like kids having fun.   i wasnt  getting any bites so i decided i better not be here when these home wners get home.  rebel flags! so i head back to the car.  my door was open. my trunk was open. i got really spooked.  the passenger door was open. i didnt get out on that side of the car.  im thinking bad joke. but i never saw and signs of kids just the laughter. im talking pre-school laughter, not deliquent. i am telling this story because this would not be the last time i returned to my vechicle and found it opened and unlocked.\r\n\r\n\r\nsummer 02.  me and my wife took the senic/ backway home.   we were coming up to the road that heads to our street. maybe about 6 miles deep in the woods.  i say hey look there are some light  glowing in the sky.   there was 3 maybe 4 light dancing in the sky.  they where not too high up. not too far away. they danced for a few seconds, then combined one by one into one bight light. and shot off really fast into the horizon. we were both like wow.\r\n\r\nhigh school homecoming night 2003...My wife and i was at my grandmothers house. about 5 miles east of town.  we was standing outside talking with an aunt.  when i showed the aunt what looked like a star. or a plane with just one light on.  the landing white light i guess.  i say to my aunt and wife hey yall look at that. i tell them that it is not a  plane, where are the other lights.  besides what plane do u know fly that fast.  they are like yeah,ok. then i was like whatch this, here comes a plane towards it. whatch what it do. they ask what.  i tell them watch it hide in the clouds till the plane passes by. it did just what i said. it hid in one place in a cloud till the plane was well by it. it come out about 15 mins later heading in the direction where the plane had come from. we only thought it was going fast at first. this thing now is going at least 2x as fast as it was when we first seen it.\r\n\r\n\r\nnov 06. the wife and i decide to go fishing.  i remember there being many leaves on the ground and we were off work for thanksgivings. we went to the lake... of course, corney lake.  we gather the usuals. rods, tacke boxes.  we lock up the truck 02 sports trac. we especially lock the tailgate because of the  tonneu cover on back of the truck.  we lock the doors because the truck will be out of visual and ear shot.  u really dont know who will come down there to fish... or whatever. so we lock the doors. blow the horn for the alarm. things that we normally do when leaving our vehicle unattended. so we walk about 100 yds or to a place we like to fish. as soon as we got there we could here something walking in front of us. since it was fall there was not brush or briar patches, so u could see at least 50yds in front of us.  i thought it was only a deer. maybe if we were lucky, we could see a wild hog.  i was excited, it's\r\nheading our way.  i tell my wife keep a look out incase it's a  hog, i dont think i will cross the creek, but u never know. she nods her head ok.  so we keep hearing what sounds to be walking towards us rather quickly.  i began to rationalize. is it a armadillo, is a rabbit. maybe a squirrel.  i knew for sure it wasnt a deer after thinking about\r\nit for a while, deers walk silently.  no rodent would cover that type of distance so quickly. the creek we are fishing on have small sand banks on both sides, and is only about 30 ft wide. where my wife is standing is gets smaller about 10 feet or less.  when i could here it on the opposite of the bank, but see nothing, i signal to my wife to be quiet. she nods here head and begin to try to  get my attention. i kinda was looking all over, thinking where is it.  she is looking at me strangly and looking over her other shouder.  i hear it behind us now.  it is now moving towards our truck.  i looked at her and was like did u see it.  where did it cross.  she says right beside me, but i couldnt see it. im like\r\nwhat?.  so i srug it off as the game warder just walked by an i couldnt see him because he was in the green uniform. i then think maybe it was someone else here fishing. and the steps were the echoes coming from behinds us.  i tell her to rap it up... lets get out of here. we hurry back to the truck.  when we  get there  the passenger door is open,\r\nand the tailgate is down. im really nervous now.  i think someone probably has gotten our battery.  nothing is missing nothing was tampered with.  it was like we just left the door open and the gate open on the truck. im like hell no i  didnt do that.  i asked my wife what did she see.  did she see it come by her.  she says yeah it was close enough to\r\nbreath on me, but i never saw anything. i said how did u know it was close.  she says i could see something making the water move like  and i could see the water running off whatever it was. i said what... it made steps in the water and i could see the water dripping/running off what ever it was.  she said when u was telling me to be quiet, that what\r\ni kept looking at and pointing to. something walked by my wife close enough to breath on her and she could see water running off it, she could not see it.... it walked behind me and up the rd we came down. i could hear it all the way. but saw nothing.   the truck is unlocked and door is open when we get there...Second time this has happen to me. we \r\nhave never been back there since then. this is also in the area where i saw the human footprints with the claw marks on the  ground..... invisible!\r\n\r\nsummer 06... one night after 12am we were coming through lillie, la.  my wife and brother-n-law saw something on side of the road.  they describe a something tall and hairy.  my wife says it was black.  they both say it was about 7ft tall but really broad. much broader than a bear.  bro was thinking it was a grizzly bear. but bigger. but looked like a extremely hairy cave men. u could se that it didnt have on any clothes.  at first look u would think it was a man, but then u could see it was very hairy.  we had been hearing  from friends all summer saying that they were seeing \r\na bigfoot on side of the road.  this was 20 miles in the opposite directions from what people say they were seeing it, but it was on the same highway.  my wife was driving.. i was begging her to turn around for me to see what it was. she was too scared to turn around.\r\n\r\nmay 08- present.  what we really see  regulary is the star-like objects that glow up, dim, move fast, or move slow. we have seen them streak off so fast that they leave a white trail of light to the naked eye.  they hide in the clouds from the air planes. they dim from the air planes.  we hardly see on just plain take off and out run the planes. usually\r\nwe see only one at a time. they can  glow brightly enough to look like an amber streetlight in the sky. we have also noticed that they  glow up when they are about to go really fast. 3 or 4 times faster than an airplane. \r\n\r\noctober, a star-like ufo jumped from the horizon, to less than a 100ft in front of me and a friend and jump back into the horizon just as fast. i cam directly at us for just  a few seconds. then just took offmthen i also notice a jet just off in the horizon. we was thanking \r\ngod for saving us.  \r\n\r\nnovember sitting in the back yard my wife screams for me to come out and see on that just appeared directly over her in the back yard. it was just over the treeline. it move over the house and flew off.\r\n\r\nnovember around the 8th when everybody had all the sightings. a starlike ufo came do the street and shinned its light on my wife and brother in law. it lighted up the entire street.They ran home horrified. \r\n\r\nnovember. one night in the yard we could see lights through the bushes next to our house.  we live next to a huge sewer pond. and there are no lights in that direction. the light was  red, green, white flashing and moving. the kids was screaming because they know that nothing should be out there.  we next heard something walking closer to us. we heard this this thing trip and fall dropping a beer bottle. company through the bottle beside a tree just out in the bushes. we hear it get up. and go back to where it got the first bottle then move back out of the yard.\r\nthis time they noticed that it moved from besided us to the back of the yard in less than a second. close to 100ft. then we couldnt hear it any more. .... invisible!\r\n\r\nnovember. we saw what look like 3 planes going over the house.  the only difference was that they had huge square lights completely across them. they where shaped like triangles, and the back was completely lighted up. they were in close persuit by 4 or more planes.  6 saw this\r\n\r\nnov. 29... me and the wife see a cloud glowing. i went out to feed the dogs, when i turned around to head back to the house i see a huge cloud with light on the inside of it... it looked like something was hidding in the cloud it was huge. my wife said the entire street was lighted up when we first walked outside.. i could see the light shinning on the houses on the next street.  i looked like whatever it was, it was smoking. there was 2 jets right behind it. it was  very low just over the trees. there was not any moon light out and the top of the cloud was what was lighted up.  not very sure at what i saw.\r\n\r\ndec 6th...  a huge circular object broke through the atmosphere. it was perfectly round and had a green burning halo around it. the object was the size of the moon in the sky and left a green flame trail about 3x as long as it was. it had the same color glow as the moon but was burning green. 7 of us saw this thing.\r\n \r\ndec 6th a starlike ufo was passing over the house being met by a plane.  it hovered still near a cloud looking like a star.And the plane went by it and turned around very quickly.  the plane passed it again.  the plane then turned back around, then the starlike ufo glowed up and shot off like a rocket leaving the plane. 3 saw this.\r\n\r\nsomething i have noticed about the star-like ufo... they cant be very large.  we have been close to them,  withing 200 ft and  u cannot see a shape of anything. u can only see the light which up close look like the landing lights on planes.  4 adults here have been this close to these things and only saw light.  i hope they are military toys.. and some ones\r\njoke...  a sick joke if its military....Ha ha lets chase them around... not funny at all. one thing for sure there is always an airplane close by it.  either meeting it... or following it.\r\n\r\nim just sharing some of the things i find strange around me.   i would like to hear what others have to share... i copied pasted this here so if it doesnt read correctly im including a notepad version of it.  thanks\r\ni hope other can relate to some of these occurances.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14373,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0204201,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12112008-0016","longitude":-92.7200243,"occurred":1196409600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1196409600000,"summary":"Strange

shot, i am hoping you can do what is necessary). what we observed with the naked eye and what we caught on digital camera look like different things. the picture is taken at sunset and we were looking at three very long cylinder, phone pole looking lines (almost like jet trails). they caught our attention because they did not begin to break up as jet trails do and as we took a closer look, they seemed to be highly reflective and almost shiny. they were suspended in a perfect line across the sky just above the tree line. in the picture the cylinders look more like round white orbs (not sure why). you can see all three of them in the lower left area of the picture beginning just above the trees. we went back inside after looking at them for a long time because it had gotten dark, when we looked again later, we could not see them. we have had several other strange sightings since (the last one on dec. 7th)but caught nothing else on film. i wish we had professional equipment! i have

a brake. it was completely dark by this time. i have always sky and star gazed, and that night i was checking out the latest separation between jupiter and venus. as i continued scanning the sky, i saw a very bright (larger than venus) light in the sort of north, north western sky.\r\n\r\nat first i thought it was an airplane approaching with its landing lights on, but i didn't see the port or starboard lights. there were no flashing lights at all. i could see the motion of the object as it moved very slowly across the sky, left to right (heading se?).\r\n\r\nat this point i started to think it was a satellite that was reflecting a lot of sun light because of its height in the atmosphere. after about 3 or so minutes, the object had only crossed about halfway across the sky. way slower than any satellite i had seen before, but assumed the object must have been more or less approaching me, so i thought nothing of it.\r\n\r\nat about that time the object began to fade. i attributed this to the object entering a hazy area of the sky, light or dust interference, i didn't know.\r\n\r\nthen the light became dimmer and dimmer, and within a very sort time disappeared. that shouldn't have happened. as i thought of explanations for this i came to only one seemingly valid conclusion. the object could only have been climbing and left the atmosphere. the light wasn't dimming and getting smaller because of haze; it was getting smaller and fading because it was getting farther away.\r\n\r\nthis immediately bothered me, and this is why. i have more than the average persons experience with military aircraft, nasa, and astronomy. i am not claiming to be an expert on these matters; however i'm not a hayseed either.\r\n\r\ni like to understand what i see, and i like to have explanations for what i don't understand. i am usually able to explain most of what i see, and although i am satisfied with my explanation of this incident, i still want to know what it was that i saw. that is what bothers me. i have not been able to answer that question.\r\n\r\nno one else, that i know of, saw what i saw. it wasn't that obvious, but that doesn't help. i have done some internet research and have found no answers, or possible explanations, such as recent launches by anyone, such as missile firings, or anything else that might answer my questions.\r\n\r\ni guess it could have been something from white sands missile range in new mexico, but that seems to be a little far fetched; far away and not a reasonable answer. it was to large to have been anything smaller than a commercial aircraft.\r\n\r\nso... there you go. that's my ufo story. i would very much appreciate a response from ya'll, even if it's just to say, \"huh\".\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n[cms - name

fort worth. it would stop in air the move real slow as like it was gliding. i could swear i was seeing a thin light blue beam every once and awhile from it.When we got closer and it passed over the

he said i have no idea.  then i go to my kitchen and the back door is unlocked, my purse in the window with money hanging out, none taken.  we always lock the door, not a great area we live in.  our heater was on in the kitchen, all the lights were on, the couch had been ruffled, also in the bathroom, things were out of place, the closet door was open.  we both had stomach aches and we're so dehydrated we drank a gallon of water in 15 mins. between the two of us.  was there anything weird happening in tucson last night???  i have a friend who referred us to your website.  i guess the most odd thing was the painting because it's heavy and over a glass table and you would need to be very careful handling it.  also we are very energy saving in the fact that we do not leave lights on or a heater going or even doors open.  maybe you know something we don't?

compass. we have never seen this light before and thought it was strange that it appeared in the sky randomly. the light was at a stand still for a short while after we first noticed it. then in very small intervals would move just a little bit either up or down and even left to right. but always staying pretty much in the same place. then after watching the light constanly for about 25 -35 minutes it starts to decend or in a sse heading. either past the mountains or droppping below it. the last few minutes of the light moving were incredibly noticable. dropping faster then before. and after moving from sight behind the mountains the light was to bright that you could still see the aura of it in the tips of the mountains moving from left to right across the range. after the initial

night there was only one light hovering the mountains. tonight there was two! the brighter one was now no longer over the top of the mountains but closer to hovering the valley. the secound light was in the same place right above the mountain. after watching this for about 15-20 minutes the dimmer light was droppped behind the mountains and the brighter one moved and took its place. weird...

home in my backyard looking at the moon. i was watching the moon and saw that it was kind of a muddy color but there was nothing extraordinary about it during the eclipse. after about five minutes i decided to go back inside and go to sleep. i was about to go inside when i noticed two bright reddish orange lights flying in tandem. i thought it might be a plane also observing the lunar eclipse. i realized it wasn't a plane as there was no noise or the usual blinking running lights planes are required to have.\r\nwhen the lights separated and started to do aerobatics i knew that i was watching something unusual. they continued to fly in an easterly direction\r\nwith one of the lights hovering and the other flying around it. they were both at the moon's five o'clock. the lights were probably moving at about one hundred miles per hour and were several hundred feet above the ground.\r\nneedless to say i could not take my eyes off of them. they then joined up again and started to fly east to west in tandem. the lights then separated and flew off in opposite directions into the night sky and quickly disappeared. \r\nmy home is regularly overflown by many aircraft and helicopters which i observe on a regular basis. i live about fifteen miles north of miramar air station which is now used by the marines. i do not know what the objects were, but i do know that they were not airplanes or helicopters. when i went upstairs i woke up my wife and we both went outside to see if i could spot the lights again but they were gone and didn't return. several months later on jan. 1 there was a similar incident in san diego involving three lights which were filmed. when i watched the film the lights looked very similar to what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

cole.(insertion: i haven't seen jack in years...The last i heard he married and lives in eastern washington...And that's been about 15-20 years ago i think i'll try a search for him...I should have done that before i began this report.)  so, even though it happened a long time ago, it's still fresh in my mind...Well, most of it! it would take a lot more space than you have here to tell you everything that happened that day and night, so i will do my best to at least give you the basics. it started about 8am and ended about 11:00pm that night. at one point we were surrounded by 3 ships. a good bit of time was spent going through castle air force base...Where at the time i was told they had 'ground to ground' radar...If that's any help. there was communication (of sorts), we saw a lit-up inside, from our car, and watched figures...Watching us, through some kind of windows. the experience itself lasted about 1.5 hours. we had driven from la where we lived, and driven to seattle for a week vacation. even though things really started happening around 8am, i will for now stick to the actual event. it was extremely clear and 'starry', i didn't drive, so jack was getting tired...We had only stopped for food or gas...And as i have said we had left the south of seattle just before 8am.M he had been complaining for about 45 minuets about a pressure (almost to pain) in his lower neck. we were the next exit form stockton,ca. and i asked him if he wanted to get off and get some asperin or something, and he said no. shortly after i could see the lights ahead and i was following our progress on the map...So i could see it was somewhere called ceres. with nothing to do but look ahead i saw this light, straight ahead but a little high to be ground level. it was kind of bright,but it didn't look like it was moving, so i thought it was tv tower or something like that. about 2 minuets later it started to move...Up and off to my upper right. oh, about this time i felt the pressure from my lower back side of my neck. like something was trying to push me forward with pretty good force. then as we 'dipped' down some gully or something i lost sight of the light, then we were suddenly in downtown ceres,ca. (i think the freeway by-passes it now)...That didn't take long and as we headed back out on the freeway leaving ceres behind...There were other cars but not too many. then, there it was...Jack started yelling and pointing out his driver's sidewindow. just across the other  side of the freeway, and just above the lights (still extending from ceres) was a \"banked\" oval ring of 'blue-black- lights. with windows rolled down there wasn't a sound! it was going the same speed as us...Exactly the same!!! they stayed beside us for about 15 minuets. it was then that i got such a strong feeling that they could hear and understand us. i know it sounds nuts (and i remember telling jack at the time, that it might sound nuts), but i'm going to ask them if they can hear us and understand us...So, out loud i did ask them and immediatly jack was yelling againg, and as i looked over i saw it blink out it's lights and you could see it give us an answer by showing us the bottom side. it was diamond shapped with lights 'pulsating' a cluster of different colored lights in the center and several at each corner. it stayed that way for about (i'd estimate just a few minuets) then it gently went back to the 'ring' of blue-black lights..Still going the same speed as us. about this time i looked out my side of the car and there was a second one...I'd estimate about the same distance away as the other one. as i recall the banked ring of lights. we went along for a while like that and i noticed by there were no freeway lights and no traffic. suddenly there was a third ship down in front of us...Above the highway about 30-40 feet i think. it was about 1/2 of a block away, but we could see that it was lit-up inside with a soft glow like and there was a pannel in the background middle of the ship. it had a lot of lights that changed patterns. there were about 7-8 figures standing in the windows looking at us. they moved around a little, but not very much. they really seemed intent on us. jack was spooked by this time and had stopped the car (in the fast lane). we sat there for a few minuets when i relalized we'd better move or get off the highway...Jack started the car and all three that had stopped when we did, began moving right along with us again. then, i heard a loud roar....As i looked back i saw a big semi truck barraling down on us...As i looked out my window, i saw the driver smile and wave as he 'flew'by....As though nothing had happened...But it was close! that has always remained strange to me. when i asked jack to get off the freeway so maybe we could get a better look...He did get off but i think he was scared, but i was totally ok...I was never felt afraid. so back on the freeway we went and them with us...Then, one by one they 'zipped' off into the night sky and then blinked off. we got home with about 1/3 tank of gas. we had gassed up in sacramento...That's not possable in the el camano we were driving...Also there no way you can drive (even over the limit sometimes), from seattle to la in 18 hours. wer left seattle at 8am and got to my front door at about 2:00am in the morning. northern and middle california have some long lonely streches...At least it did then. there's so much more to this...Like the things leading up to the event itslf that day...Other sightings very, very near to us at that moment on the morning news...Near sea-tac airport, as we were leaving south seattle. we started looking...At least i was. jack is a pretty down to earth guy litterly. where i'm curious about everything.
