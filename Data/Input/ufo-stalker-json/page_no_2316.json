(nov 4 2004 mexico city is one) so, i've concluded that there was 'something' extended below the craft\r\nthat gave the 'top shaped' impression, due to the blurring effect of the strange 'flat black' glow around the object. the flat black 'blur' around the object decreased the sun's reflection off it. but we all agreed, that there was not doubt of the solidity of the object.\r\nno one reported anything to any authority. we've told very few people, not even family members due to the credibility issue. however, now i have decided to actively pursue the political angle, demanding the gov. to disclose what they know.\r\nr. conner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),

window. as i went outside to get a closer look it revealed itself as an airplane that had its lights pointed at my direction very briefly. so i watched the airplane until im convinced its an airplane and as im watching it i started to look around the sky and i noticed a very faint blinking almost directly above me. i tried to follow it for as long as i could which was about 30 seconds but it disappeared in the clouds.\r\n\r\nnow there were a few things that were interesting about this light. particularly the strobe of the light when it would blink. it looked identical to a buoy when it blinks,(starts out faint and within a second or two it fully lights up and then dissipates.) lights on airplanes don't flash in this manner. when you see a blinking light on an aircraft in the sky its a very constant flash and almost instantaneous (on , off within a second.)there also appeared to be about a 2 second interval between each flash but i dont think that means anything significant or maybe it does..\r\n\r\nthe other piece of evidence that leads me to believe that this blinking red light was a ufo because of the appearance in altitude and speed that this object had and i compared it to my previous sighting which was an airplane and still in view and appeared pretty far away. it appeared to have just recently taken off and was climbing towards cruising altitude. it was traveling from the sw towards the nw then heading north. the red blinking light appeared soon after the plane had reached about the halfway point in my field of vision (halfway meaning from where i had originally seen the light from my living room to where it would travel out of view on the opposite side ) so this leaves about another 30 seconds until they both go out of view) the red blinking light traveled out of view in about 15 seconds before the airplane (keep in mind this object did not appear in my field of vision when i first saw the airplane )giving the appearance that it was traveling at an enormous speed but it was also extremely high in altitude compared to the airplane and the clouds. when the red flash would dissipate, the object became invisible it had no other visible parts or lights other than this faint red flash.\r\n\r\nso basically when the first object i noticed reached the halfway point in my field of vision, a second object came into view where the first object was originally seen. before the first object (airplane) could travel out of my field of vision the second object (bright red flash) traveled out of my field of view about 10-20 seconds before the first object did.\r\n\r\nso the red blinking flash had 3 times if not 4 times the speed of the airplane that combined with the altitude made it appear to be traveling in our orbit\r\n\r\nive seen satellites and space shuttles and neither of them have signal lights that broadcasts their presence for anybody who looks in the sky at the right moment would see it. when you see satellites and space shuttles with the human eye they appear as very tiny solid object with a small reflection from the sun. no signal lights or anything this bright and visible for that matter. the only way to see satellites and shuttles is to be very lucky or would know their orbit they take and be able to track them accordingly. \r\n\r\ni tried to grab my phone to take a picture but when i came back it was gone. but the plane was still traveling out of view.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14327,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":47.6284681,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12102008-0003","longitude":-122.5132148,"occurred":1228890300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1228890300000,"summary":"High

directly over the farm market on highway 27, a light caught my eye. i looked up and saw what i thought was an aeroplane, but noticed immediately that it was not moving. it wasn't hovering; it was still. it was dark, matte gray, almost black. i said, \"guys, what is that plane doing?\" to my sons who were sitting in the back of the van. \"wow, thats really weird. is it going to crash?\" they said. my husband, who is legally blind even saw it. its like it just didn't make any sense.It couldn't have been any higher than the power lines- that would be, what? 150 feet? and it stood out really clearly from the sky;, no wavy heat patterns or anything. there was a lot of rush hour traffic, but i tried to roll the window down as fast as i could to get a better look, and my husband said \"it sounds like a jet, but it doesn't look like one..\" my children and i noticed a black thing (they said it looked like a ladder to them) hanging out of the back of the \"plane\".I couldn't understand why people weren't seeming to pay any attention to it. it was very big, and very low, and stationary. it was just weird, almost surreal.\r\nwe didn't really talk about it at all after that night until today. we even all drew pictures of how we remembered it, and it was all the same, except my husband and one son remember something that looked something like big engines way towards the back; i dont remember that. also, right afterwards, as soon as we got home and out of the car, we heard lots of helicopters, and saw 2 or 3 of them. it was the oddest thing i can ever recall seeing.\r\noh, and the \"plane\" only had one light on it, and that was a very bright white light near the tip of what would have been the right \"wing\". we talked about that when we were home, as we thought it odd, as most planes have a white light on the nose of the fuselage, and a green and red light on the wings. this only had the one light. there was nothing else visible or discernible on the whole thing. not windows or insignia or anything.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings,

pretty much silent. i was staring out the window at two lights and wasn't thinking about it really for about a minute; then i was confused because at first i thought they were part of an airplane - but they weren't moving at all. it was just hovering there, so i asked my mom what she thought because it scared me a bit - and she didn't know either - and she was trying to focus on driving so she didn't get a good look at it - i could tell it scared her too though. but i stared at it - i couldn't look away. it was too close to the ground to be any kind of airplane and too high up from it to be a tower or building. \r\nit was a triangle. picture a normal triangle with equal legs and the base being smaller. the points of the base where the legs meet had the brightest lights - white lights being about the same brightness of car headlights or brighter. the 'tail' light was smaller - and less bright. you almost couldn't make it out. the rest of it was just the triangle - darker than the sky was so you could tell it wasn't an airplane or anything. also if you've ever seen the road on a hot day - that weird hazy fog that comes off of it in the summer - thats what was around the thing i saw - that same haze - only more of it than on a road. \r\ni know we weren't the only ones who saw it because while driving we saw people on their porches or in their yards looking at it too - one of them was filming and pointing. i watched it as we were driving, and then at a stop light i saw that it was moving, but very very slowly - about the same speed as somebody walking. our planes can't do that but i wouldn't call it a 'hover' quite because it was moving but it almost was a hover. i couldn't see it anymore because after that light turned green we had to drive away. \r\n\r\nif anybody else saw this can you email me about it?","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

out at nights being that summer was coming up 3 weeks before that we traded our oil in for a wood and coal burner so i first i thought to my self someone was burning wood up here on the hill that was my first reaction to it as it got over the tree's it was a as to what some would say your crazy and out of your mind a big red fire ball and it was that close to me that it will stick in my mind till the day i die and i know dozens of people said they seen the same deal but the strange thing that boggles my mind is my neighbors were out that night and i was yelling to them to look up but they didn't see it as it was going over the house they move so slow that i had enough time to get in my house to yell for my mom we watched what we still to this day can't be explained right after that like a week later i was driving to pick my mom up from work i looking towards the moon and once again seen it heading for the moon and it would dissipate then the summer came on and we would see them

friday, december 5, 2008 at elliott bay park on the seattle waterfront.  these rare large, layered \"lenticular clouds\" did not move; they hovered in the same shape/position for three days.  others saw and photographed this phenomenon from friday 12/5 thru monday, 12/8/08.  they were evidently seen by a number of thousands of people \r\nthroughout western washington on these days.\r\n\r\nin my opinion, they could possibly be et motherships using a cloud camouflage to send a signal to those receptive to prepare for something imminent.  this seems to support some channeled transmissions

show:  ufo-like cloud formations give \"peak/peek(?)\" experience\r\n \r\n by scott sistek-komo-tv reporter \r\n\r\n\r\nour little dry streak is about to come to an end. but if you looked at mt. rainier today, you would have known that already.\r\n\r\ntake a look at some of these incredible clouds captured over mt. rainier today. the one above was taken by tim thompson. the one below, by david embrey:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose are called \"lenticular\" (vehicular?) clouds.  they're caused when the air flow is just right so when it flows over mt. rainier, the air gets pushed upward where it cools and condenses into clouds.  depending on how smooth the flow is, you can get some rare, amazing clouds formations as we've seen so far today.  here is more information on what causes them from an earlier blog entry. \r\n\r\nit's usually a sign of rain within 24 hours because typically the moist flow that precedes a storm around here is the perfect set up for these clouds.\r\n\r\nhere are some other ones submitted into younews (feel free to submit your own!)\r\n\r\nfrom younews contributor: corgis4ever in monroe, wa:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norca86 from orting, wa:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuser samich in

hampshire, en route to my home in andover, massachusetts, a trip of about 21 miles.  i was on route 93, a major interstate highway which runs between boston and northern new hampshire.  i was between exits #3 and #4, about a mile north of a truck weighing station, traveling at about 65 m.P.H.  there was very little traffic, and the sun had not yet set.  by chance, i happened to look up, and i noticed a flying disc of gray/metallic color which seemed to be hovering at an altitude of about 100 feet, off to the side of the highway.  it appeared to be perfectly round, about 25 meters in diameter, perhaps seven or eight meters in thickness at the middle, looking very much like a classical \r\n\"flying saucer.\"  it seemed to have an observation dome made of glass (or similar transparent material), but i did not see anyone or anything within the dome.  it seemed to have four \"landing legs\" extended from the underside.  it appeared to be swaying slightly from side to side.  my first thought was that it must be an advertising balloon designed to look like a \"ufo\" which was meant to attract attention to a business or store.  however, i have passed that location on many subsequent trips and have observed no store in the area - and in fact, there is no street or road!  i slowed down to try to get a closer look at the object, but it my view of it was obscured by a stand of trees atop a bluff.  when i passed beyond the bluff, i looked back to try to view the object again, but it was gone.  i have never seen anything like this before, but i was not at all frightened.  rather, i was intrigued, and i wished that i had been able to get closer to it and view it for more than eight or nine seconds.  i wish i knew what it was, and i wonder whether anyone

to cooberate with them.  tom maat & amberrose hammond had been watching this for about 3 minutes before i came out.  we all saw an object floating in the sky through the tree line in front of us.  it was flying in all sorts of random patterns within, from our vantage point, at least a mile distance from left to right.  it was very difficult to discern the distance it was away from us, but upon further inspection after the event, we drove out to the approximate area we think it was hovering and it was about 2 miles southwest from where we saw it from.\r\n\r\nwe watched it for about five minutes and tom maat grabbed his camera to take some video and pictures.  tom started filming at 11:33 pm and filmed until 11:36 pm.  the craft continuously just kept flying in erratic patterns randomly up and down and from side to side.  i note that it was also doing ���dive-bombs��� back and forth kind of like a skateboarder does on a ���half-pipe��� styled ramp when they ride it.  tom maat also took some still photos capturing the anomaly in a couple of the frames.\r\n\r\nit seemed to disappear at around 11:37 pm.  we still stood and watched the sky and then it came back after about five minutes.  this time, while it was still doing all the random maneuvers it seemed to get a little closer to us and saw some detail.  i saw red, white, and green light emitting from it.  i could not see any type of shape but amberrose noted it looked like a rectangle. . this lasted for about another 5 minutes and then the object disappeared.\r\n","distance":"Over One

seems like it might have been real.\r\n\r\nmy \"bro\" (aaron s.) and i were walking south on 3450 west in our neighborhood sometime in the mid 1980's. i was somewhere between 10-13 years old. walking past west lake jr. high school as we did several times a week at night because it was between his house and mine. there was a fence to the right of us and aaron was on my right side and we were on the west side of the street. the sky was very dark but there was the usual house lights and lighting from the jr. high school. the street 3500 s. to the south of us has a mcdonalds on the north west corner which was directly in front of us. we were casually walking along talking when i looked up above the mcdonald's and saw some lights above it that were never there before, for a second i thought maybe mcdonalds had constructed some new parking lot lights. i couldn't believe my eyes and i stared intently at it and wondered if what i was seeing was real. i had to look away to make sure it wasn't just my imagination or my eyes playing tricks on me. so i looked down at the sidewalk in front of aaron then returned my gaze to the object which remained hovering silently above mcdonald's i was afraid to tell aaron immediately thinking for some reason if i said anything that it would vanish. it was a large solid black triangle larger than the mcdonald's restaurant and appeared to be hovering directly over it maybe 100 or 200 feet but it could have been a little further away perhaps across the street. the object had 3 somewhat large circular lights in each corner of the equilateral triangle which was pitch black, blacker than the sky. the lights were very evenly lit and looked almost exactly the same as what i've seen on ufo investigation shows and scifi shows except there was no circle in the center as i've seen on several shows. so, i look back at aaron's face to tell him about the object and perhaps my peripheral vision caught something moving and i looked back and it was gone. so doubt entered my mind and i said nothing to aaron or anyone. i had a feeling it was monitoring me. it seemed silly at the time and continues to seem silly that a ufo would be hovering above a mcdonald's of all places in the middle of the salt lake suburbs. i do have a somewhat active imagination but i always know what's real and what's not. i know i saw something in the sky that night. that area is a high traffic area for commercial jets coming into the salt lake airport but i don't remember seeing any planes that night and i can always hear and see the jets moving. which of course was completely different from what i saw. i could be wrong but i am also fairly certain that this happened long before i had seen any unsolved mysteries tv shows with the black triangle which is where i believe i first saw a depiction of a black triangle. when i saw the show i said to myself \"that's what i saw\" and then i started telling a few close friends about my experience including aaron who says he saw nothing that night. and most other people laugh at the thought of advanced technology floating over mcdonald's. which i don't blame them. so, i laugh along with them. but, still wonder about what i saw.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

next to thousand oaks, ca.\r\n\r\nhiking down from the santa monica mountains in point mugu state park, it was dark and when we cleared the oak trees while nearing potrero road at the edge of the park, my wife and i noticed a strange vertical shaft of light high in the sky. it appeared to be over thousand oaks to the north east of us, perhaps a mile or two away. we thought it was a beam of light from a searchlight but then noticed that it did not move nor did the shaft of light reach all the way to the ground. we could not tell whether the source of light was from below or from above. the intensity of the light was constant, there was no pulsating nor was there any noticable movement. the light seemed to have mostly bright white and a mix of blue and green streams. an unusual characteristic of this shaft of light is that it was not uniform from top to bottom but rather appeared as if it were a twisted ribbon of light. it was not unlike a high velocity jet exhaust where it varies from bright to dark to bright to dark and continues to repeat. a similar effect can be seen when stretching a ribbon tight and winding several twists to it.\r\n\r\nthere was no sound coming from the light. we observed it for about 10 minutes or more while we continued to hike from the park to my house which was right across the street from the park entrance. i ran into the house to get my binoculars and when i returned outside the light was gone. looking all around in every direction i could not locate it again.\r\n\r\nabout a month or two later while watching one of the network evening tv newscasts there was a story about an unusual shaft of light that several people had seen. there was even video of it and i recognized it right away. this news story took place in japan (i think) and appeared to be seen out beyond a sports playing field. this time it appeared to be resting on the ground while someone was seen running over to investigate it when it disappeared.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":14301,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.1349215,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12082008-0009","longitude":-118.9877942,"occurred":594360000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":594360000000,"summary":"Vertical
