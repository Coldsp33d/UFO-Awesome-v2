south-southeast direction and saw a bright orange light.  i thought it was saturn, but wasn���t sure because i thought saturn wasn���t visible right now.  i stood there watching it for a few minutes and called to my son to come check out this star.  he came to the window and watched it with me.  it was completely still, not moving, motionless, etc. for a few minutes.  as we watched, it started to slowly move directly up ��� not north, south, etc., but literally up.  i asked him what he was seeing and he said that it was starting to move up.  we watched it for the next few minutes.  it slowly rose, and as it rose the orange began to twinkle.  though it was moving up, i was still thinking it was an aircraft taking off and that the twinkle was due to a parallax from thermals and the high winds we were experiencing last night.  \r\n\r\nwe continued to watch it for a few minutes.  the upward motion was, at first, slow and gradual then it accelerated and as it accelerated so did the twinkling of the light.  the intensity of the light progressively dimmed by about 50% and then, instead of continuing to fade as it had, it spontaneously sped up and disappeared completely.  my son and i just looked at each other.  i asked him what he saw and he recited the same thing that i had seen.  being 8 years old, he got very scared.  i told him everything would be fine and that if there were ���aliens��� out there, i���m sure there not here to hurt us.  he went to his bedroom to try and fall asleep and i went into the living room to try and understand what it was i saw.  \r\n\r\nit is more than possible that this was just an aircraft taking off and that a parallax due to wind and thermals gave it the appearance of ���disappearing��� but i���m only half convinced of that theory.  honestly, i don���t know what i���ve seen on either of these occasions but i know it wasn���t usual.\r\n\r\ni���m not sure what to do with this information, short of letting you know about it.  if you want to speak with me about it, please feel free to do so.  i do believe in life on other planets but cannot prove or disprove the possibility of them coming here to visit/observe us or having the intelligence to do so.   however, i���m open to any possibility.  this is the second time that i saw something that can't be explained and this time there is a witness, so i know that \"something\" was out there.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line

it is military or not. the only reason i say that it could be military is that there have been 5 sightings for us beginning on oct. 20th 2008 through dec. 7th ( i reported two of them in october but the one last night was the most interesting of all). last night we had just arrived back to the ranch from dallas and went out on our back porch to feed our dogs at 8:19 pm. a large red orb was hovering on the horizon (less than 20 degrees from ground). it is not the first time we have seen it so we have gotten in the habit of watching it. it appeared to be between the next ranch over and i-45 but we cannot be sure. it always ends up descending or we lose sight of it over the horizon (not sure). we see lots of air traffic following i-45 so we know that this is different. it is larger looking than regular aircraft and does not have flashing lights. we were watching it last night and as it started to fade or descend another very bright marble size object appeared to the upper left of it (no more than 25 degrees above horizon). this object was very bright and was pulsating very fast with many different colors. it was so different that my boyfriend ran in to get his rifle so we could watch it through the scope. i did not feel comfortable by myself outside so i came in but watched it through the doorway. it was much bigger than any aircraft or light and the colors were rapidly changing ( hard to distinguish what exact colors ). my boyfriend looked at it through the scope and could not make out any shape but the lights were so bright it was hard to tell. as he passed the rifle to me to have a look, the light just went out - like someone had turned off a lightbulb. we knew it was still there, it just went black! we were waiting for something to happen and sure enough several piercing white strobe looking lights came on in a triangular formation, they started tumbling across the sky heading north. it looked like three distinct separate lights but in formation, there was quite a bit of distance between the triangle (at least the length of a football field), it almost looked like the lights were communicating with each other and making a cartwheel type motion. this went on until exactly 8:40 when other air traffic entered this things airspace and it just seemed to vanish. we were left just looking at an airplane traveling north along i-45. he had called his mom who lives in town at about 8:35 and she went outside but her view was obstructed by trees etc. we want to know if more sightings like this have been reported. i do want to add that there are two coal & lignite mines near us and our sightings always seem to be close to the lignite mine. we also have a large area near us that is blacked out on google satellite maps and wonder if it is a military area (there are no bases or anything visible). if someone else has seen this in the fairfield, freestone county area, please report it!! we cannot be the only ones witnessing this. i have a few pictures from one previous sighting but i do not have good equipment and it just looks like specs.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

years but i could attribute most to aircraft from the willow grove afb or other local airports.  \r\n \r\nhowever, in 1998 i had an experience that i - to this day - cannot explain.  \r\n \r\ni was in my living room, watching tv around 9 p.M.  the house was very quiet, short of the tv.  i started to feel a rumble that resembled the same feeling you get from a large woofer speaker with the bass turned up.  nothing in the house was moving, as you might expect from that type of vibration.  i figured it was just a neighbor kid blasting his car stereo or something.  thing is, it went on for about 20 minutes.  i finally got irritated and went outside to see what was going on.    \r\n \r\ni stepped out the front door and the noise stopped instantly.  our neighborhood is pretty quiet so i just took a quick look, no longer hearing the noise i figured the kid had moved on.  it was a beautiful november evening and all of the leaves were off of the trees.  i stargazed for a few seconds and looked above our house to try and find the big dipper.  i found something quite different.  above my house, maybe a few hundred feet, was a patch of sky the size of a football field which was completely blacked out.  you could see the stars around it but the silhouette itself completely blacked out the background.  there were, what i thought were, running lights around the shape, but there was no rhyme or reason to them ��� varying in intensity and color.  \r\n \r\nthe shape itself looked like a cross between a stealth bomber and the front of the concorde.  it was absolutely massive and absolutely silent.  it was alarming because of the sheer size of the object and the fact that it was moving so incredibly slow across the sky - i thought it was going to crash.  i stood there watching it as it crept along the sky.  instead of crashing, it just glided silently and slowly above my home.  i was dumbstruck.  i watched it track from a west-southwest direction to east-northeast.  once it had moved, what appeared to be, a couple of miles from my home it sped up - quickly.  then it suddenly, literally vanished.  i continued to stand there wondering what the heck had just happened.  i went back into the house and the noise was gone.  ten years later, i'm still trying to come to grips with whatever that thing was.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14297,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.953455,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12082008-0005","longitude":-75.162629,"occurred":909820800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,

television. it was a very clear night outside, no clouds in sight. i noticed a bright flash of light on the side of my car parked in the driveway and realized that it was just a reflection of another object. i looked up into the sky and noticed a bright red/orange teardrop shaped object moving at immense speed. the front of the object seemed to be almost perfectly round, with a tail at the end which may or may not have been flames, maybe caused by the object entering the atmosphere at high speeds? it started out almost directly above me by the time i actually saw the object, and moved very quickly headed in an eastward direction. it was only seconds after i noticed the object directly before it disappeared. i did not see it disappear behind any other object, it just seemed to vanish. i did not/ do not really understand what it is that i saw. i have seen shooting stars before, this was definitely not the case. the brightness of that object far surpassed anything i have ever seen in the sky other than the sun or moon. at first i thought it was a meteor, but after looking at the object and the intensity of light, i am uncertain. my friend was very confused too, almost scared it seemed. he said he did not understand what he saw and didn't really want to talk about it. he did say that he heard a noise and that's what made him look up and notice the object. i did not hear anything, i just saw the bright light reflection on the car and looked up to the sky. he did say he noticed the light and the sound at the same time. i felt a little excited, definitely in awe of what i had just witnessed. the hair on the back of my neck was standing up straight and my body was tingling all over. i do not know if it was a meteor or other common event, but i have definitely never seen anything like this object. i have been researching online for a couple of days to see if anyone else has reported any meteors or other anomalies over the area in the past couple of weeks, and have produced no results. i am submitting this report in hopes of bringing together information to find out what happened in the skies on december 3rd, 2008 above my hometown. i would be happy to take a picture of the location and photoshop in what i saw, if it would help in any way, but i do not have any photographic evidence, as the object was only visible for seconds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

see in the sky. instead, the object disappeared behind the mountains making me believe that it had hit tooele. i now realize that the object may have been much further away than it appeared, but if so

(ages 1 & 6) witnessed and followed a ufo for approximately 45 minutes, coming within 150 ~ 200 feet on some occasions.  \r\n\r\nwe were traveling west on state highway 378 in rural clarendon county on that evening.  as we were about to enter into the town of turbeville (yes, this is the real name of the town) i came to a screeching halt in the middle of the highway.  just in front of us, maybe 100' off the ground sat this massive ufo, just hovering over the trees.  my wife screamed at me for slamming on the brakes, and asked what i was thinking.  i pointed at the object, and when she looked up, it was moving to the north just over some buildings.  she told me that the object had to be a sign or something, and i reminded her that we were in a very small town, not the city of atlanta where we had moved from just six months before, and that there were no signs in turbeville.  she then told me to get out of the road before i got us hit.  mind you, there is very little traffic in this area on a sunday night, but i drove another 1/4 of a mile or so, and made my turn off onto burnt branch road (southbound).  within just a minute or so, the object came back into view to our left (west), and seemed to hover slowly above an open field, approximately 150' from our car, which i slowed down to a crawl.  this time, my wife got a very good look at the object, and seemed to be as shocked and fascinated as i was.\r\n\r\nthe ufo was massive - approximately 300' across and shaped similar to a football lying on its side, but had a deck or something like that about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom of the craft.  it emitted a brilliant white light from the entirety of the craft, but as bright as the object was, it did not illuminate the trees, the ground, or anything else it hovered over or near.   \r\n\r\nhaving had the opportunity to see a grounded blimp up close and in person on a couple of occasions at peachtree dekalb airport in metro atlanta, i realized right away that what i was witnessing (a) was not a blimp or any other type of known non-rigid air ship, and (b) this craft had no visible cockpit, tail, rudders, windows, engines or wings. i would estimate that it was at least 1.5x to 2x the size of the average blimp, and again a bright crystal white light emanated from the entire body of the craft, not just a single point.  additionally, there were no flashing lights anywhere on the craft.\r\n\r\nfor about the next 45 minutes or so, we followed the craft, which would speed up and dart off, then slow down at will, often times just hovering motionless.  during our chase, we came across other cars that had stopped along the side of the road to watch the object.  finally, we sat on a road that i cannot remember the name of, but approximately 10 ~ 12 miles south of our original sighting point, we watched the craft hover over the road in front of us for about 90 seconds, and then begin coming towards us.  my wife, who was already scared by what we were seeing, began to panic, and my son began crying, so we turned the car around and headed on to our original destination, which was my father���s house in new zion.  we lost sight of the craft shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nbefore this incident, i was a staunch non-believer, but having an encounter this close up, changed my mind forever.  \r\n\r\nafter telling family and friends of what we witnessed, most told us we were crazy, but my wife���s mother tell us that the next day she heard a story on abc news that a large and very bright ufo had been spotted that sunday up and down the eastern seaboard.  i have never been able to confirm this report, but did find a fellow employee at my company who saw it as well, but from about 20 miles away.\r\n\r\nto this day, i really want to know what i saw, and have even considered hypnosis on a few occasions to see if i can enhance my memory of that night.\r\n","distance":"101-500

high, it appeared to be a tight, small triangle of bright white lights, perhaps as bright as venus - brighter than jupiter (both of which are low in the southwest).  there were no flashing lights, no colored lights, as you would expect from a low-flying jet.  no sound.  the object moved much faster than the sighting i'd had of skylab on november 19, when it moved directly over nw arkansas and was visible.  skylab (with the shuttle attached) took three minutes to go from horizon to horizon.  this object took between 30 and 60 seconds to travel from 20-30 degrees in the wnw, past the meridian, to about 70 degrees in the east southeast, where the moon was.  i would estimate it was moving twice as fast as skylab appeared.  it was approaching the moon, which is a day or two past half full and very bright.  it appeared to change course slightly, jogging toward the south, as it moved overhead.  as it approached the moon, it dimmed, finally becoming a single point of light, then disappeared about 5 degrees from the moon.  it never reappeared.  i watched for several minutes for it to emerge from the moon's light on the path it was on, but nothing.  i waiting for over five minutes, and never saw anything else.\r\n\r\ni have been a stargazer for more than 25 years and am very aware of the stars, planets and moon phases on a normal basis.  this object was moving faster than anything i've ever observed.  it did not have any colored lights, which i would expect from a low-flying jet (since it was moving so fast).  i observed the conjunction of the moon, venus and jupiter last week, and am aware of the positions of those planets and their relative brightness.  this object was perhaps as bright as venus, but certainly brighter than jupiter.\r\n\r\nany other reports of this object?\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

of town near the local powerplant.\r\ni had just happened to look up in the sky over town and saw this light grey metalic object coming toward us. it was so low that the only reason i was able to see it was because the street lights in town were casting light on it. as it kept getting closer i could tell that it was enormous and was in the shape of a triangle. i got the attention of my friends and pointed it out to them. my first thoughts is that it must be some kind of blimp or balloon. as it came closer i knew that it wasn't a blimp or balloon, because it didn't have any propellars or flames. now, it is right in front of us and it is passing directly over the powerplant. i don't know why, but i expected sirens or something to go off at the powerplant as it was passing over. i also expected to see a lot of people coming out of the town chasing after it but there were none. i was shocked. as huge as this thing is i just knew it should've been getting everyones attention. now, as it is passing over the powerplant, the lights from the powerplant are casting a lot of light on this thing. now it is very well lit up by all the surrounding lights from town and the powerplant. it is definetly grey metalic, no windows, tubular, triangle, no vents, no propellars, no jets, no exhaust of any kind and no markings of any kind. then to top it all off, it makes no noise whatsoever. it is just slowly floating by overhead. as it is passing, i notice that it is hollow inside the triangle, because i can see the stars through the middle of it. it takes it about 15 minutes to come from out of town and pass over the powerplant. now, we get in our vehicles and start to follow it on the back roads. once it gets entirely out of town and away from any buildings or houses a bright white light comes on at each connecting corner. very bright. now that we are driving beside it and it is over a field do we realize just how big this thing really is. it is easily larger than a football field! each light is shining as bright as what you would see from all of the lights combined from a football stadium. we are just driving along real slow trying to follow it the best we can. the best i can figure, we followed it for about an hour. although i can remember the sighting in every detail this many years later, i can still not remember how it left or where it went. i have an uncle that worked with the new madrid county sheriffs office that saw the same craft approximately 2 weeks later. he contacted all local airports and none picked it up on radar. this craft was not the t.R.3b that our government currently uses. i am prior military and know what craft we have to include the aurora.\r\n\r\ni have had other sightings and experiences as well. if you contact me i will gladly share them as well.\r\n\r\nthank you and god bless,\r\nreverend james collier\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

which woke me up but i couldn't move or speak, next thing i knew i was on a stretcher but ususally it is a hard table i'm that i am on. the short grey was there, which lets me know he wants to hurt me. then the tall grey appears and dismises the short one with a wave of his hand. he then rubs my forehead and lets me know i'm ok. they communicate with me telepathy. i am scanned by a machine that looks like a upside down l, usually that is all they do, but this time the short one came in and gave me an injection in my inner rt. upper arm!! it hurt really bad! then i was taken to what i call the waiting room to go home, still on a stretcher. then a bright redheaded woman come in and takes my hand in hers (but she only has four claws instead of a hand like we have) and says \"come with me\" i get up and go with her. i'm already scared to death because of the injection and the fact that i'd never see a woman there. this woman had bright red long hair, with what appeared to be a crown on her head. she was white skin with very beautiful dark deep deep blue slanted upward eyes.She has a small nose and a round mouth and actually talks like a human and her mouth moves! she is dressed in a shimmering silver gown with a dark purple hooded robe over it. she has on a dark deep blue diamond shaped stone that glows brillantly and bright. she had a very kind and trusting voice. i was amazed at this lady, i don't know if she was a queen or princess or what. i still partly afraid though cause i don't know what she wants with me. i saw no feet but her gown did drag the floor. she lead me to a room with children of all ages in it. from small to what i would consider to be teenagers. they all came running up to me as if they knew me and all looked like 2 people i know and myself. all of them!! they were trying to touch me and most did. then we went into another room which had embroys and fetuses. there were hundreds so it seemed, in containers with clear liquid around them. they had tubes and machines coming from them, they also had something over there eyes cause they were in bright lights. they looke human but had no visible sex organs. then she says \"come on\" and we leave. we walk down the hall to what appears to be a large picture window ina house. she tells me \"to look thru it\" & i did. what i saw i believe was the future. there was bloody wars in us and other countries just really graphic, and i was crying i don't want to see anymore and turned away. she yelled \"look!\" so i did, what i saw this time was death, how people were dying, some sickness some suicide others murdered. some i knew, some i've seen before and some i don't know. i finally told her i'd seen enough and refused to look back in the window. she keep saying \"we're not through\" over and over again. i kept saying \"no, no\"! then i was back in my bed and for awhile i couldnot move and speak, but as soon as i could i asked my husband where did the bright light go and where did the greys and that woman go. he said he didn't see anything as usual. i got up at 6am, tired and drained of energy. when i went to put my clothes on i noticed whelp marks on both sides of my abdomen, so my husband took pictures of them and a red area on my inner rt. arm. as the day went on the whelp on my abdomen got redder and looked like some kind of scratches! by night they were really red. pictures were taken of all areas that day and at night i had one appear on each upper arm, pictures were taken of them also. i had nightmares off and on that night and more pics. were taken on the 12-1-2008. i had nightmares that night also. i have never seen that woman before or shown anything or walked on that craft!! yes, i am scared to death but i know my life has to go on!! just pray they don't come back!!","distance":"20 Feet or

cloudy conditions i saw a formation of several bright lights which i thought wre the landing lights of an airplane since there was a nearby small private airfield. i began to notice that lights were hovering and not moving.After a few seconds they vanished.I said nothing about it for fear of ridicule but heard on radio 2 days later that it was reported by several thousand people over several states.Air force stated it was a russian satellite breaking up.Not sure of the year but knew it was prior to birth of my child in nov. 1984.Ive been curious over the years as to the exact date of the sighting and if anything further came of the sighting. in answer to your questions i was driving at about 50 miles per hour and casually glanced at the sky because my wife was flying a small airplane at that time but i found out later she was nowhere in the area.Unfortunately the sighting was like a scene in a speilberg movie.I remember being puzzled that i could not see the body of what i thought initially was my wife's plane due to what appeared to be whispy clouds that were part of the formation.I believe there were at least 4 lights in a v shaped formation.What made me begin to think that this was something unusual was the fact that i could see what appeared to be small black objects being ejected from the formation towards the ground almost as if something were being sown.The view was unobstructed since it was over a reaped farm field and there were no nearby trees or buildings.When the objects suddenly vanished i began to think that this might have been a ufo.I never discussed this with anyone since i have a somewhat off beat sense of humor and was well known for reading science fiction for entertainment.(and no i do not wear an aluminum foil hat to ward off radio transmissions from mars.I hold a doctorate and have had 10 years of advanced education beyond college).The first time i mentioned it in public years later in illinois the person i was doing business with sneared at me and left the office never to return.(a wealthy and rich attorney i might add)i was hoping that you might furnish me with the exact date so i might research the incident further since it was so widely reported.Thank you\r\np.S. the only reason i am reporting this is that i am now retired, living in a different state and no longer dependent on the public for my income.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

between west and elmott when i noticed an odd light in the sky.  it was almost due south according to the compass in my truck.  it was about a hand width above the horizon.  it was a spot of light that was irregular in shape and to the naked eye appeared to be changing both shape and color.  it cycled through the pastel colors (light blue, light green, light yellow, light purple and light pink).  i brought it to my son's attention to see if he could see the same thing.  after watching it for a few miles he described it much as i did above.  as we were passing through elmott i estimated that it was directly above james conally airport.  at one point i thought it might be a sheriff's chopper with a spotlight. i figured we would be passing it on our left as we travelled further south.  we did not.  it was either moving away from us or it was stationary and much further away than i had estimated.  as we approached the north side of waco i decided we could get a better look if i hopped on loop 340 which circles waco to the west and south.  it also takes us out of the city lights.  as we rounded the loop headed toward robinson it became apparent that it was much further away than i had thought.  it was however still to the south but it did seem slightly lower to the horizon (about two fingers at arms length). all the while it continued to cycle randomly through the pastels and seemed to continuosly change shape to the naked eye. it never appeared to be round or symetrical in any way.  we turned off on fm3400 and followed it to the south until we reached downsville road approx 4-5 miles from the loop.  as it became apparent that we werent getting any closer i decided to pull over so we could get a better look.  standing still made no difference.  it still changed shape and color.  the sky was clear and full of stars and a half moon.  nothing else in the sky came close in appearance.  i would say it was 2 to 4 times brighter than the next brightest star.  we watched it for about 5 minutes.  it never really appeared to move.  it just twisted and turned and changed color.  from time to time i thought i could see faint light beams radiating out from it but i couldn't be sure.  we then decided to go home and get my small spotting scope out.  sure enough we still had a good view of it from our back yard.  again it appeared staionary from that vantage.  through the scope it looked somewhat different.  it appeared to have a solid shape but irregular like a rough tear drop shape on a 45 degree slant.  you could still see the color changes clearly but it was really tough to focus and hold it in frame.  i decided to take some pictures so i got my sony dsc-h1 and a tripod and took multiple pictures on multiple settings.  i also took a couple of short mpg's which show the color changes very well.  most of the pictures are fuzzy but there are a few that are very interesting.  they look stringy or like squiggles i assumed that was from the vibration from me pushing the shutter button.  i had recalled seeing a few stills on the news from the stephenville sightings earlier this year.  i pulled them up on my computer to show my son.  actually it was a video on you tube by david caron.  both my son and i agree that they are a perfect match.  anyway, we quit watching it and came inside because it was getting cold.  it was still in the same location doing its thing at about 2:30 a.M.  can you guys let me know if it is a known object?  i don't see anything on the star chart that should be there.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

was around 8:30-9:00pm, and it was warm because  i remember we all wore shorts. that's why i figure it was june/july. anyways, we live on an indian reservation in central cali,and there are not many lights (streetlights, etc). it's in the foothills of the sierra nevada range, so we have a nice big clear shot of the night sky. anyways, we pulled up next to the house and i got out to open the van door for my boys. soon as i opened the door and my 4 year old jumped out, i happened to catch movement in the corner of my eye. i looked up and i saw a huge triangle of lights moving silently from east to west over the oak tree behind our house. i'm not good at estimating size or distance, but i would say it was roughly the size of a large airplane, and it was flying about as low as the water helicopters do when they are fighting fires. it was low. there was a light at the tip, and i'm thinking 3 lights down each side. i seem to recall four lights making up each side of the triangle. the bottom had no lights. i couldn't make out any craft, other than the lights. i told me son, \"hey look at that\" and he says to me \"it's a spaceship\". lol the weird thing is, it moved without a sound. but, just about the time it got to the hills to the west (couple miles away?) all of a sudden you could hear the roaring sound of like a bunch of fighter jets, coming from over the mountain range, which is 12-14 miles from the house. i don't know if it was the \"ufo's\" engines or if there actually were jets following it. i went inside the house and put the local news on, and nothing. nothing on the radio either. i thought about calling in and asking if anyone else had seen it, but i just let it go. funny that no one else around the rez has mentioned it since. how could i have been the only one to see it?? well, me and my boys. i have a theory. i think it could be us military aircraft. i mean, the \"flight path\" would have been in line with china lake nafb and lemoore nafb.
