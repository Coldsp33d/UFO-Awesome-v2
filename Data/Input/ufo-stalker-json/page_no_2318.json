with family cats.  only lights on was backdoor light.  dogs were running around yard as usual.  what drew my attention to object i witnessed, was one of my cats, who would normally stays a distance from me, ran towards me and stopped right by my right leg.  she sat down and was looking up over the roof of house.  i looked at the cat, thinking she was probably just looking at plane lights or maybe a bird so something.  she kept looking, so then i looked up to see what she was seeing.\r\n\r\nwhat i believed i saw at first, was a mass of bird flying over, and more than likely geese, since the formation was sort of looked liked a shape of geese migrating.  but then reality hit me.  it was moving at approximately 10 to 20 mph, almost parallel to my street, but when i focused on it, i then could see, that it had mass, and structure of a wedge shape.  it was close enough that i could get a base size from comparing it to the roof of my home.  the overall length was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and height was approximately 7 to 10 feet, and it was only 100 to 200 feet from the ground.  i was looking at the right lower quarter, from bow to stern.  there weren���t any lights or any sound what-so-ever emitting from the craft. the right side was visible because of the lights of homes and a few street lights carried the that height.  i also had a small private aircraft flying at one to two thousand feet at about 2 miles southwest of our location, so i could get some variable and we have high pecan trees which also gave me some comparison to height from the ground.\r\n\r\nwhat was apparent, the side wasn���t a smooth surface.  i say this because you could see dark and then somewhat lighter shades.  this to me could have been either two assumptions:  1.  the surface was painted, as we do some of our military aircraft, so it will blend in with the sky (clouds lighter and darker) or 2.  the surface had angles on it which would show lighter for the parts protruding out and dark for the area that was indented. this is similar to our stealth aircraft for displacing radar.  the light of homes and street lights were barely hitting the surface of the object but it was enough to make out the details.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14262,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.7762955,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-12062008-0012","longitude":-96.5905493,"occurred":1228536300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1228536300000,"summary":"Wedge

jupiter and venus shining brightly in the sky. i'm an astronomy enthusiast and i had heard a couple days ago that the moon and the two planets were close together and i was looking at how far the moon had travled away from the two planets. i was in line waiting to get into a lab class when about 6:20pm i looked at the moon again and two lights caught my eye that i hadn't noticed before. they were lined up vertically to the east of the moon, about 1-1/2 hand widths or so, directly over a building on the campus called the hss building. at first i thought i was looking at sirius or vega but the two lights (the vertically higher one was slightly brighter) were colored more like incandescent car headlights with a slightly yellow hue to them. if you can imagine a car headlight off in the distance and how you can see the source but not the beam of light, then you know what it looked like. except they were high in the sky, east of the moon and not moving at all.  i turned my head for a second to adjust my glasses and looked up again and the lower of hte two lights was gone.  the higher one was there for another second then slowly dimmed out of sight. at first i thought i went behind a really dark dense cloud but i couldnt find any clouds.  i kept watching the same spot and a few seconds later a high flying airplace (with blinking blue and red lights) passed by the area very close to where i saw the two motionless lights and it never disappeared so i knew a cloud was not what caused the light to dim out of sight.  the lights didn't move and were very clear. there was no shape to them. just pin points like stars. living in a large city you dont see very many stars. you see planets from time to time and some of the brightest stars but these two light looked too large and had the wrong color hue. just to be sure when i got home later i checked an astronomy program i have on my computer to see if maybe there was a really bright constellation in the area at that time and there was nothing that bright. they were as bright as venus, made no sound or movement. just on then off. i thought maybe it ould be a helicopter but there was no noise and even helicopters have

1000 feet altitude because of the appearance of the 'headlamps' seemed like aircraft on a landing pattern, or as close as an aircraft approaching a runway.  the two lights moved slowly and uniformly, seemed to be together as if they were fore and aft lights of a blimp, but then their relative positions changed such as to suggest two separate objects.  silent running:  no sound detected whatsover

lights  one on the right and one on the left, low in the sky up ahead.  at this point i had no idea what it was.. i knew it was not a plane or any helicopter.  i continued up to the stop sign and stayed there for about 3 or 4 minutes.  just watching this light.  it did not move at all.  it was proably around 800 feet up and about 1500- 2000 feet away from me.  i decided to head towards san antonio.  i took a left onto loop 1604 heading north.  i drove very slowly.  i was heading more towards the object at this time so i could get a closer look. i started to see this was very well an aircraft of some type.   as i was driving around to the left of it.. i noticed there were two other lights.  they were both white lights on each side, not as bright.  it looks like it was either a diamond shaped aircraft.. or a circular aircraft.  two red lights opposite each other and two white lights opposite each other.  \r\ni pulled off the side of the road and got out of the car.  i was much closer probably about 900 feet away, and it was still at the same height.  i could make out a tubular frame / steel colored and outlines of a door/ or hatch?  not sure what the out line was.. but could see detail on the body of the aircraft from the illuminating lights on all ends...  there where no other lights coming from the craft.  it had no sound coming from it at all.  at this time i knew this was some kind of ufo.  i started walking towards the field in it's direction.  that is when it moved slowly away for about 4 more seconds and then quickly took off at the same height in the direction of loop 1604 south. the white lights then were off and only the red lights were still on.   this thing was so fast i watched it take off in the horizon and it was completely gone from my sight in less then 10 seconds.  as i said before.. there was no noise at all coming from this ufo and it stayed at the same altitude as it left.  i am wondering if anyone else out there saw this????

the one above us just faded out.So we pulled over on a side road to watch the other one.We sat still watching it for about a minute and watched as it too faded out. we sat for a couple more minutes to see if they would reapear then we went home.About two weeks before that one came over my house about two miles west of this location. it was moving south, stopped for a few seconds and then it went east. and faded out.About a year and a half my son and i had been seeing these kind of lights aproximitly three miles west of these locations. all i can really say about what i felt like at the time is i was excited to see it for i have seen these lights several times and i always make it a point to look for them when i am out in the yard or out driving around. my son and i always ask each other

south. at first we thought it was a high flying airplane but thought it strange that it had no visible position lights and there was no sound. we watched the object for approximately thirty seconds as it smoothly tracked across the sky, then it abruptly stopped. it stayed motionless for about five seconds then reversed itself at tremendous speed,covering about one quarter of its previous distance in about one second. it abruptly stopped again, remaining motionless for about three seconds. it then accelerated back to its original position in no more than a second and stopped. after approximately two seconds it exploded in a bright flash. pieces of flaming debris could be seen radiating outward from the explosion. there was absolutely no sound associated with the incident. my estimate of the time and date is easily a year off of the exact date. i could have been between 12 and 14 years old. i'm thinking i was probably around 13. i don't recall telling anyone of the incident. in later life i became a private pilot. as i reflect back on the incident and apply my knowledge of aviation, i realize that there was no way to judge the altitude or speed of the object. i do estimate however that the object was several miles high as evidenced by the lack of any sound during the explosion. applying my limited knowledge to the incident today i can imagine that the object

circling catalina, arizona in a wide clockwise pattern, and had just passed my place heading west, then to the north when i spotted a large object to the west high in the clear sky, at roughly a 30-degree angle from me.  it was moving northward fast, silently, and at a constant speed, having the behavior of an orbiting satellite, in this case it would have been a polar orbit.\r\n\r\nat first i concurred it was a satellite, then realized i should be seeing a dot of light moving through space, and not a large, dark brown colored object.  i concurred that if it was in earth orbit this time of night, it had to be huge to be reflecting sunlight.  if it was not in orbit, it was creating its own light(ing) in the night sky.  i rushed inside to get my nikon d-80 camera, which already had the nikkor 70 to 300mm vr zoom (vibration reduction) lens on it, removed the lens cover, and double checked to make sure the camera was on its most sensitive setting (when in the most sensitive setting, it can see infrared too).\r\n\r\nreturning outside, the object was now far north-northwest of here, and the sheriff's airplane was now heading in that direction too (speculating, perhaps they observed it too, and were giving chase).  i took three free-handed pictures, two of which i'm sending to you.  the lights are clearly not of an airplane, aircraft and law enforcement aircraft marker lights are different.  also i was only able to see the lights from it, i could no longer see the actual vehicle, as i did before.\r\n\r\nin each picture you will see to the bottom right of the brightest light group, other lights too that i didn't notice until i had these images on my computer screen.  one a gray-red-brown, the other different shades of blue with white.  also note their angle change between the two pictures.  even though i had vibration reduction enabled on my lens, please allow for camera shake, due to the shutter being open about a second.  my camera was set up to where it would not take a picture unless it was focused on something.\r\n\r\nafter a friend with a doctorate in physics looked at the emailed pictures, he was convinced i took pictures of a triangular shaped type of ufo that's been spotted around the world lately.  what i initially saw was not triangular shaped, but appeared boxy, like a small collection of large, interconnected boxes.  they were too far away to see exact details though, but obviously much further away than the sheriff's airplane.\r\n\r\ni don't know what to tell you, other than what i observed.","distance":"Over One

pinkish-orange in color, maybe even like a flare. not a directed beam but an orb in shape. in succession there was one, then another, then another about 1 second apart from one another and about 100 feet apart, up to 4 or 5 at a time. as the third or fourth one would illuminate the first would turn off, then the next and so on, in a line formation from my point of view. no sound of a jet was heard from my vacinity in the neighborhood. only distant traffic and barking dogs, no planes or helicopters were heard by me, as well as the sound of fireworks not evident. no other flashing or steady aircraft marker lights were observed. i observed this for about for about 20 minutes in the area then it just stopped. it might have been occurring longer but i was indoors and only noticed it when i

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At approximately 10:30 pm (2230 hours) local time on thursday, 4 december the two of us were outside in the backyard smoking cigarettes and sky watching.  it was a clear night with moderate cloud cover, no fog, no visible stars or planets or the moon.  we observed a massive series of twinkling lights in the sky displaying non-ballistic movement.  estimated 30,000 feet, constant, stationery, east by southeast for approximately 5 minutes.   \r\n\r\nthe light became much brighter with additional colors around the center.  the lights started pulsing in and out and grew gradually dimmer then faded to nothing.  the lights on the object pulsed twice.  at that time a northbound commercial airliner passed approximately 5,00 feet below the object but the object disappeared (the lights pulsed and faded out) before the airliner crossed into its line of sight.  the male felt a heavy hum with numbness in his chest.  we both felt electric; as if a thick static charge had permeated our bodies.  we then went into the house.\r\n\r\nwe have 3 cats and one dog.  the youngest female cat (age 2 ���) was very alert and agitated.  one of the male cats was unusually bugged eyed.  the other male cat and dog slept through the entire events.  at approximately 10:50 pm the whole house seemed as if it was buzzing and we sensed a presence and felt something was in the house.  we continued to feel the static charge on our bodies.  we noticed small disturbances within our one story house.  lamps were moved, lights turned on and items on flat surfaces were slightly moved by unseen forces.  at the same time we experienced a ���brown out��� in the bedroom.  power dimmed but did not fail.  also in our bedroom we felt a difference in temperature where the heat had been on at 70 degrees; it was now approximately 40 degrees and the thermostat still set to 70 degrees.  the female cat continued to be agitated and followed us as we walked through the house.  \r\n\r\nat approximately 11:15 pm we sat on the couch in the living room trying to comprehend what we had seen and experienced. at that time we both heard a loud whooshing, rumbling, sound; like we were next to a freight train or in a wind tunnel.  this rushing noise lasted about 7or 8 seconds.  the female saw numerous sparkly crystal shapes in the backyard and felt drawn to them yet scared of them at the same time.  the female mentioned that for the last 25-30 minutes she felt if a nail file had been driven into the top of her right foot and that the sole of her foot was hot and heavy with static electricity.  when the female removed the sock on her right foot you could see 3 small triangular puncture marks.  an hour later at 12:15 am when the female again took of her sock there was what appeared to be a 1 inch long laser burn by her big toe.  when we tried to take numerous digital photos of the female���s injury the camera would not focus on the areas in question.  the female cat still continued to be agitated and wanted to be held and petted by each of us.  \r\n\r\nat 12 midnight, now friday, 5 december we began preparations to go to sleep.  we woke up our dog to let him outside to the backyard for ���his business���.  we really had to rouse him; he would not wake up which is unusual.  when we finally woke him up our dog would not go outside to the backyard where we saw the object/event.  our dog always and only goes out the back door for ���his business���.  our dog balked at the back door and was not going outside.  only with guidance, perseverance and escorted by both of us he went out and did ���his business��� in record time without any sniffing.  after our dog finished he quickly ran inside the house and crawled back in his bed.   \r\n\r\nat 1215 am, we began to get undressed to shower and go to bed.  when the male took of his t-shirt we noticed a massive, non-allergenic, non-linear, eruptive rash.  the rash was similar to sunburn or gamma exposure.  we have exceptional digital photos of the rash/burns.  the rash/burns feel fine to the male and he is not in pain but the damaged skin is warm to the touch.  it appears that he spent a good part of the day out in the desert.  \r\n\r\nit is now 2:00 am and it feels as if the house is full of ghosts.  we can sense that a presence was in our home, in the adjoining garage and in the backyard.  the animals have finally relaxed and gone to bed but we are still quite keyed up and unable to go to sleep.  \r\n\r\nwe would like to talk to someone at mufon about our experience but don���t know what to do.  this is not the first time either of us have seen objects in the sky but we this is first full on contact experience that we have ever, ever had.  we don���t want publicity we just want guidance and help to point us in the right direrction to help us cope with this experience.   \r\n\r\ntwo freakin��� traumatized people in

my husband.\r\n\r\nmonths later, while reviewing the footage using quicktime, i noticed something odd.  advancing 'frame' by 'frame', i saw a cylindrical object appear & disappear.  i thought it was

mind you i was on the phone so i stop talking and i said wait i'm looking at something.  i could not believe my eyes because these two object were right next to each other floating. so, my thought automatically realized that it was not a plane nor a helicopter because it would of continue moving forward and if it would been a plane they have distance between each other. these two object were just floating in the sky side by side or almost kinda like facing each other blinking there lights.  like when you are in your car and you want to signal someone with your headlights. it went on and off. first one object signal with it's light and it was only one light very bright almost like a star but bright and the other object flash it's light back like if they were talking to each other. i just could not believe my eyes because the object were steady floating and just blinking their lights back and forth like about 4 times and all of sudden one disappeared. i was just stunned by it and speechless...But i still continue my conversation but said nothing. my boyfriend and i just looked at each other.  the other object just stayed there floating without blinking it's light. when the
