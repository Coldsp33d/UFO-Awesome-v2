States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Yesterday a buddy of mine(co-worker) came into work exclaiming he had to show me this photo he shot the previous saturday. on the above stated date, he was out on the coast near point reyes, ca with some of his friends. he had his digital camera with him and had been taking scenery pics(mountains, ocean, etc.) at exactly 12:09pm (as recorded by his camera) he took a shot of the sky as he thought the clouds would make a nice picture. he did not see anything with his eyes, but after he took the pic he noticed an object in the photo. it was oval/egg shaped and was white-ish in color. it had a \"tail\" behind it that was the same color. the oddest thing about this pic was that there were what appeared to be concentric circles, barely visible, that were the same white-ish color. they appear behind the object as if the object fell through the circles. on the furthest edges of the circles from the object there is another \"tail\" which lines up almost exactly with the tail just behind the object. this completely amazed me!! i've seen pictures and video clips on the internet and tv before of ufos but never from someone i knew. i downloaded this image directly from his camera to my desktop. i believe there is almost no way he could have photo-shopped this and then transfered it back to the memory card in his camera. it is not in his character to do something like that. he is not a ufo fanatic of any sorts and i just cannot see him fabricating a hoax like this. i honestly believe with all of my heart that this is genuine and it excites me very much!!! that being said, i guess there is still a possibility that this is merely a piece of an asteroid or sattellite falling to the earth. but the fact that he did not see this with his eyes, and the circles that appeared, just amazes me!! i will attach the picture. please tell me what you guys think of it. \r\n\r\nby the way, the first time i wrote this(earlier this evening), for the time of event i selected \"hour 24\"(12pm), and after i clicked submit i got an error message saying there was a problem with the hour i picked. i lost the whole message i'd written which which was kind of a bummer because it was so well versed with much enthusiasm and it took me a while to write it. it was hard to muster-up the gumption to do it again. maybe you guys can look into that. the drop-down menu for time seems to be out of order....Last i checked 12pm came after 11am. in your menu 11am is followed by 12am which does not make any sense.\r\n\r\nanyways, thanks for taking the time to look at this. i'm sure you are constantly inundated with many, many photos and claims. also thanks for any response you can provide.\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\njoshua

to my left and saw that a craft had landed about 20 or so yards away.  the occupents  had come out and were scooping up dirt and putting it in containers.  i must have looked afraid when i heard in my head as one of them looked up say to me, do not be afraid, we hare just collecting soil samples.  i remember replying back, ok.  the aliens looked very much like other peoples sightings, they were small, gray, had long arms and big dark tear drop shaped eyes.  then i remember taking a mental picture of my surroundings, almost like i was filming.  i first looked to my left and remember seeing the clock up above the stove in the kitchen and noticed the position of the hands. then looked at the sliding glass door and noticed it faced looking toward the west then at my right where my mother lay asleep on a chouch which also faced west.  there was a table next to the couch that was on.  behind me was the front door which faced east.  my father, brother and sister were not home.  when i looked out the sliding glass door again the craft took off.  i did not say anything to my family nor to anyone.  a couple of years later i was watching a news cast about ufo sightings and remember thinking to my self. \"so that's what i saw when we were living at the edgemere apartments\".  i still said nothing for over 40 years because i did not think i would be believed.  now that so many people have come forward i am hoping my story will be looked into further. but it is still vivid in my mind and know it to be an actuall sighting because i was only four years old at the time and know that at four years of age i did not know how to tell time nor direction until i was taught.  my story can be varified.  the street name and the apartments are still there.

car with me. she noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of us and asked if it was the north star. i looked for a few moments, then told her that no star was that bright. i then racked my brain to see if any planets were visible this time of year. the light was approximately 250-300 feet above ground. as we neared closer, we could see that rather than one bright light, it was actually two white lights and two red lights that were blinking intermittently. \r\ni said to her, \"must be an airplane.\"\r\nas we neared even closer, i wondered out loud to her, \"but airplanes don't hover.\"\r\nthe lights were remaining still in one spot directly in front of us. we could see, too, as we neared, that the lights were lower than first appeared, or perhaps had moved closer to the ground. the lights were not moving at all, other than blinking. it seemed odd and also apparent to me, that at my snail pace of 30mph, i was actually \"catching up\" with whatever it was. \r\ni told my daughter that we would find out what it was in a few seconds, because we're going to pass right under it. the object was still hovering in one spot.\r\nwhat happened next is unimaginable and outlandish. we passed under the object, which took 2-3 seconds at my drive of 30mph. as we passed underneath, we could see that the object was triangular with round corners, the body was metallic, and corner of the triangle had a brightly colored light. one light was green. one light was red. i believe, but can't be positive, that the third light was white. directly connecting the large corner lights were smaller red and white lights that blinked in a row. the front of the triangle (the longer side) had an amazing glow from it, as if from interior lights. we passed under in absolute shock.\r\nas we passed it, we both turned to each other and shouted.\r\n\"that was a ufo!\" my daughter said.\r\ni quickly pulled into a side street and turned my car around, in an attempt to catch back up to the object. by the time i had pulled in, backed up and turned around the object was almost gone from sight. it was now moving at a ridiculous speed away from us. i sped up, but within seconds the lights were completely gone from sight.\r\nhad my daughter not been in the car with me and witnessed what i had seen, i would have thought i had lost my mind.","distance":"101-500

same time and location. \r\n\r\nappearance: apx. 9 pm pst. appears at apx. s.S.E about 75 degrees off horizon, brightest object in area. unlike stars, lights strobe with color distinct color changes. color is intense, red, blue, yellow and white blue light.  light intensity did not change over time. apx 1 1/2 hour of observation.\r\nnote: appeared the next night at about the same time in the same place in sky. did not observe on 3rd night.\r\n\r\nhas movement: it was the slow movement and the bright flashing that attracted my attention, first seen while casually looking out a window while watching a 52 inch tv on the same wall as window. despite the tv and a lighted room, this object movement, light intensity and color strobe effect caught my attention through the corner of my eye, as seen first looking out through the window.\r\n\r\nat first, the object moved slowly in a straight westward arch only a several degrees, that is what first caught my attention, then the oddly strobing of colored lights. i used a fixed position of window frame to confirm this more rapid movement.  then after about 5 minutes became \"fixed\" in the sky, remained stationary, and tracked westward with other star movement over next hour  and a half or more.  \r\n\r\ni went outside on deck next to window facing the object, assumed it was a large aircraft with unusual colors, but when it didn't approach or move away, i knew that this was now an object i could not identify. \r\n\r\ni called to my girl friend who came out and she too could see and describe the same object as i saw it.\r\n\r\nobserver: i have good eyes, recently checked. i use to be a pilot and owner of a private aircraft. i am an professional artist, and have painted airplanes, and so i do look at flying aircraft often. i like to look at the stars in this area of the sky often, once or twice a week min. never seen this one before.  note: i do not drink or use drugs, never have, so there are no metabolic effect or distortions.\r\n\r\ncondition of night sky: no clouds, clear. more stars visible than usual.  typical light atmospheric effects on all stars, with irregular same and near same color distortions. all stars in area where not blinking these unusual colors, or in set patterns as subject object, i believe this would rule out atmospheric effects.\r\n\r\ni noticed other reports of same and similar objects, at different dates and times, mostly this year. why i am reporting this is because of a similar report in au, which is in the southern hemisphere!\r\nthe southern hemisphere views different stars and castellations as seen from the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nquestion to be answered:\r\n\r\nwho else noticed this? \r\nwhy are there viewers of same or similar objects in the southern hemisphere?\r\ncould this be the space station or other man made space objects?\r\ndoes the space station use colored lights?\r\nwhere would i go, or who could find out sky orientation to

but it was comeing in to slow and i remember thinking to myself when that thing crashes i might be to close. but then it seemed to slow even more and go behind the mountain as if it was being controled. i waited to see if there was a crash but there never was. the entire event took 30 seconds\r\nbut it was amazeing and i shall never forget it as long as i live. \r\ni read that there is a base inside mount shasta and that sighting confirms it for me.\r\n                          \r\n                                          sincerely david

dinner on the campfire, andrew, a co-worker and somebody you could trust your first born with,  and i stayed up awhile chatting about work and various other things. i layed down on old picnic table bench staring up at the endless sky, while andrew paced about doing the same, when suddenly he stopped talking and asked me if that was a flock of ducks. baffled, i rose up and could see around the tree in the direction he was looking only to see a very bright white diamond shaped light, hovering about 2,000 feet. his comment about ducks seemed very strange to me when i first focused in on it, because it was very obviously not ducks. then he said, \"i don't think that's man-made\". we watched this thing silently hover, motionless in the night sky. i could see the difference in distances between the stars, the ground, and this extremely bright light only lit itself, nothing below or around it lit up. we both commented again on how we have no idea what that is. and just like that*snaps fingers*, the thing beamed across the sky like a laser in a westernly direction. gone in an instant flash. \r\nwe stood there dumbfounded for a few minutes, mulled over a few possibilities, then oddly decided it was time for sleep. \r\nlater that night at about 4a.M. both of us woke up from very disturbing dreams in the camper in a cold sweat at the same exact time. we never did discuss what we had dreamt about, but it is almost like we never need to, because we already know. \r\nandrew is 10 years older than me, he has a family, and was raised in the mormon church his entire life. i highly respected him as a co-worker and as a friend. and after that light disappeared streaking across the sky without a sound, it shook the inner core of his belief system. i have not spoken with him in a few years, but he would be willing to collaborate more to this story. \r\nthe event was the first of several ufo sightings in my life, and i hope to have many more.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

for a week. they live in a small village called culverthorpe a few miles outside of sleaford. after a few days of looking after the house, one evening we were outside and the sky was perfectly clear and the sun had just gone down when we noticed 2 white objects over the fields coming towards us. we didn't know what the objects were. one object was big and round while the other was smaller and almost completely round but seemed to have a sharp edge to it and this object was moving faster than the bigger one but they both were moving in the same direction over the fields in front of us. the objects didn't make any sound and moved too fast to be balloons and they basically moved across the sky until we couldn't see them anymore. we were really excited from seeing these objects, and because we still had a day left looking after my uncles house we decided to borrow my dads digital camera just incase we saw anything else. on the last night we were outside in the garden smoking, the stars were out and it was nice and clear. my brothers were taking pictures with the camera and getting orbs which just seemed to turn up in the pictures, we couldn't see them and my view about these orbs is that most of them are just dust/moisture. when my brothers were taking pictures they were using the flash on the camera. after a while of being outside we noticed something flashing, coming towards us, moving parrellel/horizontal to the ground, over the trees at the bottom of my uncles paddock which is at the bottom of his garden. as the object came closer we could see that it would flash a white light which covered the entire object, then the light on it would decrease until it would go out, then it would increase in brightness and then flash and continue increasing, flashing, decreasing in brightness and the light going out. this object wasn't making any sound and my brother billy who had the camera took a picture of it. about the same time he took the picture we noticed another identical object coming from the same direction. as this second object was nearly above us we could see there was a smaller object, not perfectly round, which was travelling along with it. this smaller object wasn't flashing, it remained at the same brightness. billy took more pictures of these 2 objects together but because the objects were moving so slowly billy was actually taking pictures and checking how the pictures were turning out and seeing that they were blurry he was deleting any blurry ones and would try and get better pictures. after he got a clear picture, which is when the 2 objects were right above us, we watched them travel over the house and out of sight. later on that night we went back outside after we had gone inside for a while and there was an intense fog and we couldn't see the stars anymore. i think because of the moisture in the air my brothers were getting the orb pictures.\r\nattached to this e-mail are the pictures of the objects we saw. number 63 is the first object we saw and was taken just as the light on the object had gone out but you can just about see the object in the top centre of the picture. picture 64 was taken as the second object we saw was overhead and had flashed, you can see the white light around the object. near the lower left of the picture is the smaller white object. because of the settings on the digital camera at the time we saw the objects, the pictures appear quite dark so its best to use autobalance when looking at them, i also brighten them up a bit as well to see the objects better.\r\nthese objects aren't orbs which you don't see and appear in photos, we saw the flashing objects which are in the pictures. at the time of the sighting i didn't know what the objects were so i felt curious more than anything and basically stood there while they came over us. after the sighting and the more i think about it i have no idea what the objects are we saw so more than anything i would just like to know if there is a simple explanation for the objects. i don't want to get too excited over something that could be really normal but we have no idea what the objects we saw could be.\r\nplease could you e-mail me and tell me if you have ever seen pictures of similar objects before or have you any idea what these objects could be?
