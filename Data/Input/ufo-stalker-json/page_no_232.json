saw this ufo formation in rural capac, michigan - january of 1980, maybe february, when i was 18 years old.\r\ni was an absolutely bitterly cold winter night, i was out driving with my girlfriend and another couple, listening to music sipping a few beers, that's what we did back then living in the country, nobody had cell phones, we just socialized and listened to music. don't exactly remember, probably a friday night, perhaps saturday.\r\ni needed to stop to urinate, so i picked a spot between 2 houses that were approximately 150 to 200 yards apart, just a random spot far enough away from both houses. i stepped behind the car and started peeing at the side of the road and looked up. to my right above the one farmhouse were these 3 circular craft very close to each other in a straight formation with lights going all the way around the middle. they were just above this large tree right behind the house and the closest one was partially over the house a bit. they blocked out the stars. it was dark out but the sky was kind of that blueish-gray because the moon was out, it wasn't a black night sky at all so these craft were kind of silhouetted darker against the sky on the bottom side.\r\ni watched amazed, i had no idea what i was seeing really but i knew this wasn't something i'd ever seen in our skies. they were floating to the east (my left) about as fast as you would walk normally and there was absolutely no noise. they were pretty big compared to things i knew, i figured about the width of a football field, i played football and other sports, that seemed relative to me and about right, so i guess between 45 and 55 yards wide. the lights were yellowish like an old lamp you'd see inside a house, and they weren't that bright. i remember thinking that's weird, the side part is only maybe 4 feet high, nobody could get close enough to see out those windows. now i justify that they probably weren't windows, just lights... who knows. when these things had floated a hundred or so feet closer to me but parallel to the road, i went to the car and said to everyone hey come out here and look at this but they all just hollered to shut the door because of how cold it was outside. so i went back out for a moment, i was bitterly cold but i had to watch more. i thought, they're looking for something, then i thought, maybe they're looking for me and decided to get the hell out of there. i was shivering from the cold anyway, i hopped in the car and we took off. the next morning i got up and was tearing through my mom's newspaper and was amazed there was nothing in there about what i'd seen. this group of things was pretty big and surely someone else had seen and reported it, but not to my knowledge. i've only told a handful of people since then but the last 10 years i started telling a few more people and they didn't tell me i was nuts. i guess i'm comfortable reaching out especially now that organization like yours exist. i even made an illustration of it because i had to frankly, it's the greatest thing i've ever seen, i can still see this like it just happened whenever i think of it. i'm a graphic artist in the large-format sign business. i started this illustration a couple years ago and only recently finished it. i will attach a couple jpegs of when i first saw them and how far they moved in a couple minutes before i drove off. i'm not sure if i have the scale perfect and i was a little more to the left down the road than the illustration suggests, but that's the jist of the situation. also, just yesterday i was watching a youtube video and i was stopped in my tracks, i saw this image that was so close to what i drew a couple years ago it was almost dead-on, i paused the video and made a screen capture of it, closest thing i've ever seen to what i saw - it amazed me even though the quality is crap.\r\nthis was a visual sighting only, i never saw anything but the outside of these, no beings at all, just some moving objects 130 feet off the ground.\r\ni know this was really a long time ago, but i wanted you to have my report of it. i know they're here, don't know how they got here, what they are if they're always here or have to travel to visit here, but i know what i saw.\r\nkeep up the good fight. thanks","distance":"101-500

images with a canon power shot sx420is camera. the 8 images i have included in this report were the ones where the green orb is visible. in image 6268 there is a tiny black dot above a small white cloud. it is almost in the same position that the green orb appears in the following image. when i zoom in on the dot it does not appear to me to be a bird. i remained in the same position facing west while i took all of the images. the only change that i made was to zoom in and out on the sun setting behind the clouds. the sun was so bright that i didn't see the orb until i looked at the images on the camera. because i didn't actually see it outside i am not sure of the size or distance. there is a trail visible from a plane in the photos and it appears closer than the plane but i'm not sure. it moved to the left of it's original position and then it wasn't visible for one image and then it appeared in the top center of the next image. it continued up and to the left until it was no longer visible. the trees on the right side of the images are on my property approximately 75 to 100 feet in front of where i was standing. the tree that are along the bottom of the images are across the street. \r\n i also photographed the same green orb back on 2-21-17 at 3:42 pm in summerfield, florida. i took 6 images with my iphone 7 through my windshield. at first the orb appears behind some clouds then it moved slightly down. then it moved down and to the right until it was at the level of the trees. after i passed it when it was at the level of the tree i couldn't see it anymore. i pulled my car over and got out but i still couldn't see it. again i'm not sure of the size or distance. it was large enough that it caught my attention while i was driving. on the image where it is near the trees there seems to be some sort of pattern on the orb if you zoom in on it. i don't believe it was a reflection from my windshield or camera because it is the same green orb in 2 different locations taken with 2 different cameras on 2 different dates and times. i have included only 2 of the 6 images that i took that day. there weren't enough attachments to download all of them. if you know what this is i would appreciate if you would let me know.  thank you for your

lane, i seen a giant stationary disk-like object below the clouds flashing lights. it was silver and white colored.  it was a very large object, about 4 times as large as a large commercial airline. it was out-of-place to be so low in the sky and not moving. i could not tell how far away it was.\r\n\r\na few months ago, i took tecumseh highway and followed a very low, out-of-place red light that

flash last between 1 and two seconds and is intensely bright. it reminds me of and old kodak flash cube. usually there is just the one flash and that is it. there is no watching a faint body move across the sky as the sun no longer strikes the object directly. on a few occasions i have seen a dim flash and several seconds later i will see the intense flash. the only description i can use for an analogy is a sci-fi show that shows someone standing on a planet and the star ship warps and you have the flash. if what i am seeing is a natural phenomena please let me know.

appeared to be a large jet with four engines attached to the wings. i followed it with the binoculars as it traveled from south to the north. after following it for approximately 10 seconds or so, i noticed a very bright metallic glint just to what would have been the aircraft's 8 o'clock.  i remember thinking, \"wow.. that plane is extremely close to the other one..\" but then realized that this object wasn't moving, and wasn't leaving contrails like all the other aircraft at that altitude were. i pulled the binoculars away to see if i could see the object without the aid of the optics, but i couldn't - so i looked through them again, found the object again. it was completely stationary at first - then slowly moved to the six o'clock position of the airplane i was watching originally, then the 5 o'clock before returning back to the 8 o'clock in a jerky, quick motion. it was definitely metallic. i remember seeing the sun glimmering off the surface. it was far away, and i was using 7x50 power binoculars.. i could tell it was egg shaped with what appeared to be.. spikes jutting from the object that were darker in color than the craft itself. it was probably half the size of the aircraft it was near - which was either a 747, or a military aircraft of similar size - i don't think it was a c-5..Maybe a c-130 (size wise) it was difficult to tell because of how high the aircraft was and the power of the optics i was using.  i looked away from the binoculars again to try again with my naked eye, but couldn't see it. i could see the airplane easily - but not the object. i went back to the binoculars and was unable to find it again. i'm under the assumption that it must've left the area, as i was unable to find it again. i decided not to tell my in-laws for fear that they would think i was losing my mind. i did tell my wife later that day, but she brushed it off. i'm familiar with the flight characteristics of a multitude of aircraft, both fixed wing and rotor - i know that what i saw was not a conventional aircraft. i'm mostly curious if anyone else saw the object. as i said, i couldn't see it with my naked eye - which was strange considering how brightly it glimmered in the binoculars on that exceptionally clear day. unfortunately, i was unable to get a photograph of the object before it disappeared. i was in awe of it, honestly -- i never thought to take a picture, my only thought at the time was \"what the hell is that..?\" i was affixed. thank you for your time.

reddish light reflecting off of something in the sky.  when i looked out my window, there was a huge metallic cylinder hovering low in the air (much lower than airplanes fly, anyway) above an area a few blocks away from me.  the object was larger than a passenger plane, and looked as if someone had taken a plane and removed all the paint, windows, nose, tail, and wings; just a big shiny metal can.  interestingly, it was solid silver/chrome colored and there was nothing to indicate why the initial light i had seen was red.  it was angled so i could only see the \"front\" of it, but it was completely flat, no cigar shape or point.  since i was still driving as i was looking at it, i passed a tree which obstructed my view for maybe 1-2 seconds, and when i came around the other side of the tree, the object was completely gone.  i had had my window rolled down and didn't hear anything before or after it vanished, and there was no trail in the sky or any sign of something in the distance, it was just completely gone.\r\n\r\nlater that same night, when i was home, i was out on my balcony looking out over the area where the object had been hovering above, and i noticed that there was this really weird flock of crows flying around.  there must have been a hundred or more of them, really a huge flock, and they were circling in the air and then slowly spiraling down towards the ground.  my first thought was that it was a black tornado, but then i realized it was actually birds.\r\n\r\ni only just realized this site was a thing, sorry to be so late with this sighting

confirmed on radar as a cargolux 747 freighter, flight #clx775 lx-wcv b74f, heading 160 degrees at altitude 33,000ft.\r\n\r\nwhilst viewing this aircraft through binoculars i noticed a metallic silver sphere shaped object which was reflecting the sun, this object passed in the opposite direction to the 747 (heading approx 360 degrees).  although the object appeared lower than the 747 i could not ascertain if was actually beneath or higher and further away, also the object was small and not visible to the naked eye.  the object appeared no larger than a 747 engine.\r\nthe object appeared to be

was sighted lies within a main civil airspace corridor, military traffic crosses this corridor 7 miles to the north in a w-e and e-w direction usually at 14,000ft.\r\n\r\nmy initial thought on seeing the object was that it was a spy plane or uav, which i soon dismissed.\r\nthe object did not have wings or a tail plane and was not flat like the b2 spirit aircraft.\r\n\r\ni would be interested to hear if you have any thoughts on the identification of this object. \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

a farmer, a  doctor (my sister) and a journalist (me).\r\ni was near majoro hotel, nasca, southeast of nasca lines, looking the sky, because in nasca i saw at least dozen of ufo's before. no surprise to see ufo´s in nasca.\r\nfirst i saw two star-like objects passing south/north one after the other, not so fast. i called my sister to see. she was 100m from me, talking with a farmer.\r\ni called the ufo’s to land. and if it was like an answer, the first object projected two white and powerful beams, east and west. the lights seemed to reach all the horizon and was the same quality of light at all it´s length, no fading, as it was solid. then the objects continued it´s path.\r\nmoments after two similar objects passed in the same direction, but one of them was carrying a meteorite with a very brighty tail, orange, green and blue.\r\ni believe they were protecting the nasca lines in order to avoid being impacted by the meteorite, changing it´s path. \r\nthe day after i read about the meteorite of cheliabinsk, so i believe it was part of a bigger rock.\r\ni was happy to see these objects. my father had an interesting contact with aliens when he was 7 years old.\r\nthe objects disappeared as they passed to the north, straight and not fast, what surprised me, because other ufo’s i saw passed making sudden angles or making archs in all the horizon in fraction of second, incredible speeds.\r\ni had no time to be ready to take pics. i only have a pic of other object in ayacucho and other in nasca, but i saw this in other day.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line
