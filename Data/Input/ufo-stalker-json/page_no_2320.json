by-pass in olyphant, pennsylvania.  we came to a red light at the intersection, when we noticed a bright light in the sky. it appeared below the moon, which was crescent-shaped at the time.  at first we thought it was venus, but then it began moving.  it moved towards us, then receded.  it movet up and down, then left to right.  we noticed what appeared to be a black helicopter hovering in the sky across the road.  it appeared to be observing this object.\r\n   we then traveled to our destination, wegman's supermarket in dickson city, pennsylvania.  we drove across the same section of road that i sighted two diamond-shaped ufo's in 2002.  when we reached our destination, at wegman's supermarket, we got out of the car, and i began taking pictures, 10 in all,  of this object with my cell phone camera.  the object appears as a small pinpoint of light on the camera's captured images, with the limited capabilities of this camera, even at full zoom range.  the object remained visible for about an hour, moving towards us, then receeding, moving up and down, left to right, as it did at the stop-light intersection.  the sky then began clouding, and it soon rained.  the object was then not visible throught the dense cloud cover.\r\n   my fiance and i then travelled to our next destination, borders bookstore, near the viewmont mall, in dickson city, pennsylvania.  we remained there until 10:30 pm.  on our return trip to our home in jessup, pennsylvania, we were travelling down route 6 towards the town of eynon when we noticed a strange light in the sky.  at first we thought it was an airplane, but at times it remained motionless, then moved very slowly.  the object remained visible to us until we reacehed the town of peckville, when we lost sight of it.\r\n   these are my sixth

i would have thought nothing about the image, as there are various factors that could have been involved as to how it appeared, etc. but, as i looked closer, i noticed the darker pixels on the bottom of the supposed object, forming what could be a wedge. also, the pixels are darker in the center, forming a small circle in the middle of the supposed object. i recall seeing that shape before, and surfed around you tube until i found it. it has similar features to the nasa sts75 supposed ufo video. \r\n\r\na few moments later, another shot was taken, with no object in the sky, but the clouds still a bit illuminated. i understand an airport is located nearby, which might be an explanation. there was also a report of an explosion of an unidentified aircraft over viet nam on or around may

triangle. it was travelling at about the same speed i would expect to see a plane travelling at. no noise. it may have been making noise but we didn't hear it. the two lights that were where the wings would have been if it were a plane were solid white and the light at where the nose would have been was fading in and out fairly rapidly. it wasn't a flashing though... it was a slightly slower fade both in and out. otherwise, than the fading the nose light was identical to the wing lights. it flew straight overhead and out of sight with no change in speed or direction.\r\n\r\ni wish i'd had a camera, but honestly i was so taken by it that even if i did i may not have taken a pic. was pretty weird... deff not a plane. my lucky day i guess =)\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

dark overcast night.I was a few miles from my house which at the time was 1254 pearce rd. town of wheatfield n.Y.The traffic at the time was very light,i noticed a blur like light on the drivers side of my car in the sky.I thought because it was overcast that it may be the moon.However,it seemed kind of low in the sky.As i turned right onto a road i lost sight of the light.I drove a ways and turned left onto pearce rd. the street i lived on.I did not see anything in the sky untill i pulled up in front of my house and stopped in the middle of the street as suddenly the light appeared in the sky directly in front of my car.I was stunned for a second then i became curious and stepped out of my car.I walked in front of my car as the light was small as i had first seen it.I knew it was in a different position and wondered how it got to above my street.For some reason i went to my car and blinked my headlights on and off a few times.Then i returned to the front of my car.The object grew in diameter very quickly and i fell back against my car hood as it appearred to be comming directly toward me.The object stopped and i could see it was cylindrical with a definite edge around it.Just inside the edge it had three tear drop shaped objects revolving \"counter clockwise\" within themselves,in a \"clockwise direction and they moved together in sequence as they spun around.The center of the object had what i would describe as a smokey center like fog or smoke rotating and moving around slowly.I could hear no sound or see anything else.I ran next door to my neighbors mr. and mrs. james henderson and knocked on their door awaking them.They came to their door and i asked jim if he had binocculars,he returned with a telescope which i tried to steady on the top of his car but i was shaking too much and could not see anything else.Shortly after the object reverted back to the size it was when i first seen it.Then like a light being turned off it disappeared.When i settled down i called the niagara county sheriffs office and reported it.I also called nigara falls air force base and reported what i had seen.I'm not sure of the exact date and time but the report appeared in the tonawanda news on the front page shortly after.Also about two weeks later i received a phone call from a man who said he worked at speer carbin in lewiston n.Y.He claimed to be an engineer and said he was a investigator for nicap and asked if he could interview me.I agreed and he came to my residence.I drew the object for him and told him my story,he had me sign a paper stating that i had no objection to my account someday appearing in a book as he decribed it. thats all i have to offer,i hope there is some information that you find helpful.  sincerely ronald

up and see a elongated triangular shape flying due north at very low level and very low speed. i would estimate the speed at 30-35 mph and the altitude at approximatly 150 feet. i could not take my eyes off of this object and had a cell phone that i could of taken pictures with but i did not think of it at the time. the craft had a concave on the very front of the thickest part of the elongated triangle and the strange thing about it was the fact that it was flying with the thick part of the wedge forward and the tip of the triangle aft. i must also note that the sky was grey that evening. the very tip of the aft section of the craft was bending up and down like a pair of diving flipers. i stepted out of the doorway and started to walk down my little walkway that runs alongside of my house (left and faceing east)to get a closer look at the craft, when the caft itself seemed to notice that i was looking at it, upon which the craft imediatly slid sideways on the horizontal (towards me ) without turning left or right and rotating up on its side where the complete shape of the craft changed. this startled me and i stopped walking towards the craft, because this black aura started to surrond the entire craft like it was angry that i was looking at it.  the way the craft looked at this time and how it behaved just blew my mind. it was now a big black circle surronded by a thin white line with like a blended thick set of wings with small cocaves at the tips of those wings and the big black cicle in the center was blacker than any black i have ever seen and was emminating an extra black aura all around the circle aimed right at me. when i had stopped walking towards the craft it had stopped moving towards me. the craft rotated back down as it started to pass by me and once agian the entire shap of the craft changed, it was now like two offset spheres, but the spheres were not completly round because the bottom portion was curved and the rest was a circle. the craft still was giving off an aura and i went to the end of my walkway to the chian link fence so that i could continue to watch the craft for as long as possible as it headed north and went ot of sight. this sighting has been on my mind every day since it happened and has troubled me ever since. the biggest impresion the craft has left on me is that we are not alone on this planet,that there is another entity here with us. i have never written to any about anything in my whole life, but i do need to talk with someone about this because i don't fell like the people around me believe me and this sighting has effected me in a strange way. the one thing that i fogot to mention is that this craft was so close to me and it never made a sound!                              gary morse

thanksgiving. i stepped out front to light a cigerette standing in the middle of my front yard. after lighting up, i looked up in the the low cloud filled sky; like i tend to do, being a skywatcher like i am, i saw a light directly to my north start moving from east to west. right off the bat the hairs on my arm stood at attention. it seemed to be skipping the underside of the clouds, so the light was semi-obscured by the moisture vapor, a kind of halo around the light. it moved extremely fast for being as low as it appeared to be. i followed it with my eyes for about 3 seconds before it seemed to make a curving toward the south (now maybe a mile to my north-west) i yelled to my friend craig(33) to come outside. i of course turned my head into the house to communicate with him thinking maybe i won't be able to see it when i turned back around. as i turned scanning the sky like a desparate drug fiend looking for his next fix, i spotted it again, craig right on my tail. my oldest son tyler(16) followed out as well spotting what i saw, as i was beginning to not beable to see it anymore because the distance it had travelled in such a short amount of time. right after i lost sight of the object my son said, \"it just shot to the left\". craig; not seeing it initailly, was upset that he didn't catch a glimpse of it said, \"i just saw it shoot straight up\". we looked around for a while after, hoping this was the beginning of the \"tucson lights\" but it seems that nobody else has reported this event, yet! no sound accompanied this fly by as we realized right after the light went up in the sky (per craig, i or my son did not witness it going straight up but i really don't doubt it one bit.) i have been a sky watcher ever since i was a kid because of my interest in ufo's and have never reported anything like this before. this has affected me; in a way that truely makes me believe that what i saw was a special moment in my life. this was not a plane, balloon, or helicopter. i would believe you if investigations concluded that what i saw was \"inteligentlly controlled ball lightning\" but ball lightning, no.  *****i think that some of the local news channels have video recordings of tucson from 'a' mountain constantly scanning. ask them to see the video from the 28th at 6:27p.M.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14165,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.2276429,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11302008-0017","longitude":-110.918709,"occurred":1227925620000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere,

altitude.  i was standing on my porch, situated approximately 15ft off the ground.  my house was positioned in a cauldesac which opened up on the left and curved at the right from where i was standing.  i was standing outside observing the moon, which was discoloured due to natural atmospheric phenomena when an unmarked aircraft flew by, in between the rows of houses, at high speed and only 15 to 25ft. above ground.  the aircraft continued down the street before climbing and turning left at which point i lost sight of it.  the aircraft made no engine noise and all i heard was the jet stream as it flew past.  the aircraft also had no lights.  as visibility was limited and the aircraft was moving too quickly and at such an angle for any detailed observation i was not sure of its shape although certain features made me think it may have been a sea harrier, and at the time i accepted it as that or some other military aircraft.  however, sea harriers are by no means noiseless, they are extremely loud aircraft, and there would be no reason for a military pilot to fly at such a low altitude in a suburban environment where any error would be catastrophic.  the fact that it was also flying without lights made little sense as well.  a few seconds after the aircraft left my line of sight i returned inside.\r\n\r\nalthough this event took place almost exactly a decade ago and i'm sure it's of little use, i felt that i should report this event to experts in case it provides any information at all.","distance":"20 Feet or Less, 21-100
