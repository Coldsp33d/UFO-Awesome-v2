paper route in the dogwood section of levittown, pa i usually took a break on daffodil lane when i was about half way done my paper route so i stopped around 5 in the morning and i was just sitting there on my bike when a circular ufo just appeared above my head it came straight down from the clouds it stopped just over the street lights and it was perfectly round with all different colors on the bottom it didnt move but was  spinning really fast it lit up the whole neighborhood like it was daylight. it was only about maybe a 100 feet above the street lights it only stayed a few minutes and then it went straight up and disappeared in the night like it went into outerspace. i was kind of stunned i finally went and finished my paper route then i went home and went back to bed then i went to school and as the day went on i kinda forgot about it. as i was doing my paper route the next morning i stopped at my usual break spot on daffodil lane when i started thinking about the ufo so i sat there a few minutes when the ufo came back straight down from the sky it stopped instantly just above the street lights in the exact same spot and hieght above the street lights it lit up the neighborhood like daylight it didnt move kinda like it was held in place yet it was spinning insanely fast while the whole bottom was flashing different colors, it only stayed a few minutes then went straight up as afast as it came and it was gone. i was absolutly amazed i finished my paper route went home and told everybody in my famil and nobody believed me then i asked my mom if she could get mr=e a camera and she said no i wanted 1 incase it came back but she said film is expensive and you are not wasting film. so for about the next 2 weeks the ufo came back everymorning at the exact time to the minute and stopped in the exact same spot above my head at the exact same spot and it stayed for the same time the went straight back up and disappeared. i tried everyday to get my brother to go with me to see it but he said no because he thought i just wanted him to help do my paper route finally i convinced hi to go with me so  we did my route then stopped there around the time it usually came we sat and waited then at the exact time it came back again right over our heads and lit the neighborhood up and my brother freaked out he said omg you are telling the truth, it stayed a few minutes then went straight up and disappeared the next morning we both got up and di my route we stopped at the spot around the same time again but it didnt come back and never came back after that.. im 39 years old now so im guessing it was around 81,82 or 1983 in or around there im not sure how i would find out the exact year because i dont know if the courier times would have that

mindful of the time because she had to be at the movie theater at 7:30 pm. i noticed two orbs of bright white just over the hill i live next to. i didn't hear a noise when i got out of my car and didn't see any red or flashing lights like you would on typical aircraft i see all the time. after taking my daughter to the movie theater i was driving west on happy valley road to return home when i saw the same orbs but they were less bright and seem to be moving south and west. what struck me weird was if they were moving away from me why were they still only white and the fact that although they were moving, they were still seemingly the same formation in relation to each other.I also realized it was about a half hour later. i decided to head west and see if i could catch up to the objects. i couldn't, but i did call my parents who live 40 minutes west of me. they saw the lights south of where they live and also thought they were strange. they viewed the objects through binoculars and saw that the white orbs occasionally pulsated red on the bottom. one object was smaller and dimmer and higher in the sky compared to the other object. the objects continued to move southwest. after a half hour of driving i had to turn back, but i could still see those orbs in the distance. i realized that compared to other planes in the sky, these things were very big and very bright especially to be able to see them so far in the distance over an hour later. sorry i couldn't photograph it or video it. i wish i had time to investigate further but maybe someone has an answer

sleep (i'm guessing 1987, based on that alone, as i would have been under stricter house rules) and heard, or more accurately, felt a deep thrumming noise.  my bed was under my window - i looked out, to the east, and there was a huge.. something.  the lights on whatever it was, maybe 5 to 7 of them, were roughly boomerang/chevron shaped, and massive.  i sat there listening to the thrum of the thing until i could work up the nerve to go downstairs to wake my parents up. neither really awoke (my mom said \"go back to sleep, it's the ceiling fan\") fully, so i was the only one that saw anything.  several months/maybe a year later, i felt vindicated by seeing a video on some \"cops!\" type show which was taken by a police officer from brewster, ny (just over the ct border) of the exact thing i'd seen, though i saw it much closer.  it was massive - maybe bigger than a football field - and terrifying in that it made a noise that you could feel, but not really hear.  if you've ever \"thought\" you heard a helicopter in the distance, but saw nothing, that's as close as i can describe the sound.  \r\n\r\nit was also incredibly slow moving - too slow and entirely too quiet for its size.  it hovered just over the tree line, and i remember distinctly being filled with impending doom.  (actually, just typing this out made me wish i hadn't ever thought of that night again.)  it's a feeling that you've seen something you shouldn't have.  i almost forgot, the lights reconfigured briefly into an almost-cigar shape before it just glided away.\r\n\r\nironically, i've lived in the absolute middle-of-nowhere tx (er, near an air force base - so i've seen some funky, but clearly manmade things) for 16 years now and never once seen anything suspect (we have nothing but clear skies!) since that terrifying night.  here's the \"oh, she's crazy, nevermind\" part - i had a feeling that it was incredibly dangerous to me personally.  it was too big, too close, too quiet and (yeah) alien.  and it was right over my house.  but, no, not that crazy - no abduction story or anything, just a conviction that it wasn't manmade.  and it didn't care if i saw it or not.\r\n\r\nand.. thanks for listening. i had no idea that the \"hudson valley boomerang\" existed before this odd google night tonight.

one on the bottom. they were by far the brightest thing in the sky.\r\n\r\ni watched them for another ten minutes or so, waiting for some sign of one to change distance and angle from the other, but they remained locked.\r\n\r\ni went and found a pair of binoculars and focused in on them. it was immediately clear that there were no signs of these being commercial aircraft of any kind, ie no blinking lights to speak of.\r\n\r\nthe light quality was luminescent and that of a planet when viewed through a high powered telescope, but there and visible to the naked eye in the haze of an urban environment.\r\n\r\ni saw many aircraft fly by these lights, possibly investigating them. the lights were incidentally far brighter than these aircraft. the distance between the lights could have been anywhere between a thousand yards and a number of miles, it was hard to tell.\r\n\r\nduring the time i was viewing them, roughly 45 minutes, they disappeared down below objects in my foreground. my

bright flash in the sky over the parks, i didnt think much of it, but then it happened again, the flash was like a brilliant blue color, there were a thin layer of clouds, and at first i thought it was a helicopter, but i didnt hear anything, and then i thought it was lightning, but it was far too cold out, and then i just stopped driving and watched it for a couple of minutes. it was around 8pm. and the way that it moved was in a wierd patteren, and the light was above the clouds and it was massive. the feeling i had was i was just mezmorized, then a couple of days later, i finally told a famly member, and they had said that they recorded a show on ufo sightings, so i watched it and i felt shocked like wow, i really thought i was going out of my mind. i really wish that you help

guy leans over to me and my wife and says do you believe in ufo.Shis name was bob lazar and im like sure and he starts telling me about a place outside las vegas nevada called area 51 id never heard of this place and starts telling me he worked their and tells me about spacecraft that the feds have hidden in this area after an intence chat for 3 hours he gave me a map and asked if he could hide in our room as the feds were trying to kill him you know the story he said they had erased his identy and  bob was trying to tell eveyone he said so it would be harder for the feds to kill him well just meeting this guy im like no you can;t come to our room i have one bit of info that you didnt see on the show on bob lazar this will make my story true he told me he had a bottle of fuel from the  craft at area 51 and they wanted it back (them and they) had broken into many peoples houses bob knew trying to find it do i know where it is i cant say as im scared for my own life from this guy  (the map got stolen from my house in nd )the map told me how to get their that night we drove out to the area (only on wednesday nights) he told us and we stopped in the desert in our van it was so dark you could not see your hand in front of your face it was about 10-20 miles from las vegas north on the interstate than go west  we sat their in the dark for about 1 min and got freeked out and left it had the feeling like someone was watching us we never did see the craftbut we were close to the spot he said  im sure you have heard all about this guy and i have seen the show on tv about himbob lazar years after this incounter with him after meeting him our lives were never the same as we found ourselves being followed not that we were looking for people folowing us but it just happened im here to tell ya that was weird cuz the guy that followed us was an albino i know it sounds crazy but its true and let me tell ya you notice an albino following you when you live in nd now years later   we were driving from colorado almost home in nd a friend was driving my van and i said check out that weird light <zed thats my friends name being tired and grumpy from to many miles driveing said thats an antenna no i said its to high he argued with me he said i can see the tower coming down nows it;s 2 am and it;s not to far out in a field real dark and i said no it doing somthing over that farm house just than it did a 180 with lights blazing and i said see that ain;t no tower as we kept driving down the interstate at 2 am in north dakota at 25 below zero you can stop on the interstate cuz their just isn;t any cars so i said stop stop and as it got closer it got real big and it was not stopping getting closer i said go go than stop stop we than opened the van doors and got out on the highway as it went over totally a freek show for sure it was no higher than a crop sprayer ,maybe 500 feet so it was no star type sighting it went over  us with a woosh and it was hugh it was like it wanted us to see it i had a pregnant wife in the van and the next thing we knew   we lost 3-4 hours and we were standing on the highway watching it go away but it did go away totally it was up around 500-1000 feet totally silent and just watched us i;d turn on the van lights and the craft would back off just floating their it was round in the front with windows all across the front like a ship you see on the ocean and the back came to a tip so it was not totally a diamond cuz of the front windows but it looked like a diamond if you get what i mean  we got back in the van and drove the last 10 miles home watching the sky and as we drove it followed us and flew down the golf course we were freeked out to the max it followed us home and sat outside the window to the south just hanging their watching us we got into the house and i hid behind the wall looking out the window and it just hung their even after day break you could see the star type light than it was gone it had a light on the front and a light on the back and it discuised itself as two stars but i could see the outline of the craft between the stars / lights one real werid thing was on the highway we all said we saw cars comming maybe two miles away and they never came and they never went by yet they were comming we all talked about that after it was over for days and now years my belief is that these craft belong to the feds they fly them around i believe they stole the technology from somewhere maybe roswell i don;t know but one thing is for sure when you see a craft like this your life will change and you will never be the same you cant go outside without watching the sky i actually bought a old farm house just to watch the sky the location of the sighting was mile mark 130 on interstate i-95 in north dakota
