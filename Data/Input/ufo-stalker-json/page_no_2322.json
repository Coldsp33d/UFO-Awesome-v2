might report an old sighting in erath county, considering all the activity there in the past year, but i've seen nothing reported in that area/time period like what we saw, so here goes.\r\n\r\nthe best i can recall is that it was probably a friday or saturday night during the late spring of 1989. my husband was working late and my daughter was not at home. my in-laws lived down the road from us, but were out of town, so my son and i were alone at our rural erath county home. we were watching tv and waiting for my husband to get home when i suddenly felt the foot stool begin to vibrate slightly, then the couch started to vibrate, and the light bulbs in the ceiling fan began to rattle a bit. my son, who would have been 6 years old at the time if my memory is correct and this happened in the spring of '89, jumped off the couch and said \"what the heck is that?\". my first thought was an earthquake, but having never experienced one, i didn't know what it was for sure. \r\n\r\ni opened the front door to look outside and saw this \"thing\" before i ever stepped out the door. my son was right behind me and followed me onto the porch even though i told him to stay in the house. this craft was huge. it was at least 5 or 6 times the size of our house. i took about 3 or 4 steps out into the yard and looked directly up at the underside of this thing. it was a clear night and i don't recall any lights on the object, although my son says there were lights. i just remember being amazed at the size, the fact that it was only a few feet above our house, and there was absolutely no noise coming from the thing. it was like it was slowly floating over the house. i would compare it's speed to someone leisurely riding a bicycle, if even that fast.\r\n\r\nas i said, i don't recall any lights, but i could clearly make out the shape of the object as it passed overhead simply because it blocked out the sky and was low enough that i could tell it was dark colored, darker than the sky. \r\n\r\ni don't remember being frightened although i do remember some thought of radiation exposure going through my mind, so i kept telling my son to go back in the house. i think i must have become a little concerned about the sighting because i quickly followed him back inside. this is where i really feel strange about the whole thing. we watched this thing pass over the house, which didn't take but about 30 seconds, but instead of watching it out a window, we both went back inside, sat down, and started watching tv again. anyone that knows me will tell you that's not a normal reaction for me. i'm curious, or maybe even nosy, but anyway that was very odd behavior for my son and very odd especially for me. that's the one thing that has bothered me all these years. i could have watched this thing for miles because of the way our house was situated on the top of a hill and instead i just went back to my tv show. i have no idea where it went from that point. i don't know if it followed the road, or the creek that runs behind that house, or if it took off in a completely different direction.\r\n\r\nwhen my husband got home a little later that night we told him about seeing this craft and as i recall we were pretty calm about the whole thing. he suggested that it was probably one of the new stealth aircrafts he had heard about, but he also told us not to tell anyone else we saw the thing *laugh*. as soon as we got internet service a few years later, i began to look up stealth aircraft and then ufos. the thing that my son and i saw that night looked nothing like any of the stealth planes i've seen photos of, but it did look like a lot of the pictures and drawings i've seen of the triangular ufos. \r\n\r\ni'm not too concerned about what we saw that night, so long ago, but i am still bothered about our reaction to seeing it. it was just so out of character for either of us to behave the way we did that night. not a day goes by that i don't at least wonder about it........\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

north side of riverside drive, facing west, in ionia state park.  while changing my clothes and exchanging text messages with my father, regarding the days hunt, some motion caught my eye.  in the south west a light the shape of a 4 pointed star was moving toward the north east.  there were 2 quite bright stars in the direct area where i initially noticed the light.  at first i thought that perhaps i had seen a satellite, or possibly even the space shuttle or space station, as there was no noise, the light was white with no color and seemed to me to be traveling quite rapidly. the point of the star shape at the leading edge did not appear to necessarily be the front point of any object that it might have been, as it did not always appear to be immediately pointed in the direction that the light was moving.\r\nit occurred to me as the light faded out of sight past the town that the stars all had halos around them, and the light did as well, but not until it was over the city and almost out of sight.  it did not when it went past me.  i was approximately 3 linear miles from the town of ionia, and the object appeared to have the halo around it when it was over the town.\r\ni would estimate that the object was visible to me for about 45 seconds, and traveled roughly 6 to 7 miles in that time.  the light was bright (it was the brightest object in the sky), clear, and well defined as it went past me.\r\nas i watched the light it occurred to me that i might be seeing a ���ufo���, i actually texted my father a message stating that i thought that i was seeing a ufo, and although i had my digital camera sitting in the vehicle, on the seat in front of me i did not take a picture.  i thought that it would only be a white spot on a black background, and not helpful.  i regret this.\r\ni have included a simple picture of the light that i saw.  the point of the light that is longer was the leading point, and was about that much longer than the other

watched this object for 15mins from 5am-5:15am before i decided to call my parents and see if they could see it too. they could. it was flashing randomly sometimes fast, sometimes slow green red and white. i call the local police and an officer came out. we stood outside and watched it for while. he couldn't explanin why it was so close and acting the way it was. he saw the colors and flashing as well. as the sun started to come up it moved furter and furter west faster and faster. even though by then the other stars in the night sky had dissapeared, this on still remained. it moved further west but now and then was still blinking. it was the coolest thing to see ever! me and my parents tried to get photos but i couldn't even get it to show up on my difital camera. my mom did get a picture but it is blurry.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

then a light comes through it.  it stops once its through the circular like hole.  then it starts to move slowly north.  it gets to probably a half mile away, i can now see that it is very very large, the size of 4 jets stacked on top of each other and probably twice as long.  it has 3 seperate red lights that strobe, and a 2 or 3 bright white flood lights.  i wish i had a better camera, one that can take very bright video during night time, and one that can zoom, and focus manually.  i have seen many ufo's at this house.  this is not the first, second, or third this year.  i seen a ufo a few nights ago, 6 hours after the fireball happend in north dakota.\r\n\r\nthis event that happened tonight, would of been visible from grand rapids by 5:40 am","distance":"501 Feet - 1
