friend of ours who was visiting with us are those what you saw. \r\n   previously our friend had called us on the 15th around 7:30pm and had told us that he had just seen 4 bright red lights rapidly descend silently straight down from very high altitude to roughly 1000ft. slightly nww of him. he was in his back yard 3 blocks away. he said that they all appeared to be disk like with a reflective metallic surface that emitted a red light from the bottom with one emitting what he thought to be short vapor trails. he said they then paused briefly 2-3 sec. then 3 took off to the sww with unbelievable speed and vanished. then the one with the c. trails quickly followed suit.  \r\n  \r\n   when i looked i saw about 8-10 red lights in a random pattern with varied brightness levels. the group was silent and appeared to be getting closer. i did a check of the rest of the sky and there were no other aircraft in the sky. that is very rare for this area. our friend said \"yep that's them, now you know i'm not crazy\" i pulled out my phone and was trying to take some pictures. 1-2 minutes later they all appeared to have stopped approaching. 5-7 min. later as the clouds were about to start to obscure our view and i was thinking to myself \"flairs on balloons\" i saw a brighter red light approaching up towards them from low on the horizon from the west. it was silent and traveling very fast and slowed to a stop in the middle of the group it's color becoming less bright as it did. \"definitely not flairs on balloons\" i thought. my neighbors then came out and caught a glimpse just as the clouds were covering our view. 5 min. later from the east traveling nw a helicopter flew by rather low with an unusual light pattern of many red lights with the top one rotating. it clearly wasn't what we were looking at earlier . about 20-30 min. later the clouds rolled away and the lights were gone. i could see and hear a few jets but not as many as usual. \r\n\r\n this event was almost identical to the news coverage i saw from 1/1/08. \r\n\r\n      ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path

mufon was discussing a case w a woman named denise and trying to verify what she said.  at the end there was an illustration that appeared similar to an experience i had a few years ago. at the time i called nasa to report it, but never got any response. i'm sure they either thought i was a kook or i had discovered something they wanted to remain secret about.  my experience resembled the sparkly glittery that fell to the trees of this woman's property. it was the illustration at the end that triggered me to want to contact you. it was the first time i ever saw anything similar to what i experienced enough to consider speaking up about it. i don't remember the exact dates but i could likely figure it out. i think the summer of 2002. i was traveling from salt lake city to telluride for a mountain bike/climbing festival and we had left around 10 pm, arriving at moab 2 am ish. it was nice out so we were camping out under the stars at a location i used to camp at outside of canyonlands national park. its not an official camp site, and actually now has a no camping sign there, but has a direct veiw to the monitor and merimack. we'd laid down our sleeping bags and were trying to fall asleep. i was staring up into the sky and watching the stars. i saw what would have resembled in sorts what this woman denise described happened in her yard. i would describe it similar, in that it was glittery, but it was almost like a beam of glittery if that makes sense. it blended into the night sky and stars but was also very distinguishable from it. at the time, i felt like i was being \"probed\" laying face up and actually turned my body to the side because i was uncomfortable. i thought it bizzare as it was both vague but very real.  the next morning as we were driving to breakfast i eventually commented that i had a strange experience the night before and my friend excitedly said she did too, and described pretty much the same thing. she didn't turn away from the \"probing\" tho like i did. she just kept watching it. it really was like a glittery beam for lack of a better way to describe it. i've always wondered about it, thought maybe it was some new secret weapon or instrument seeking data. i considered that we were in the desert and had a heat signiture that was different than anything else surrounding us, so that would likely be why there seemed to be a focus on us in particular.  anyway, i thought it might be useful to speak up to support what this woman saw, and in case there is any value in it for your research. i tought it might be good to have it documented since someone else had a similar experience.Thank you.\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

spokane for a few hours before we headed home to seattle.\r\n \r\n  it was a clear night, not a car on the road but us. we were heading west up stevens pass near the summit just after the road splits into 2 lanes at approx. 4am in the morning.\r\n\r\n my buddy was driving my 1971 vw baja bug, i was riding shotgun. we had just tuned up the car before we left canada, it was running great. the car was bright orange with a yellow starsky and hutch type stripe over the top and down the side.\r\n \r\n the car started to spit and sputter and cough as we saw some bright lights through the trees, off to our right. our first impression was it may be a helicopter, until we realized that it would probably be pretty difficult for any aircraft to manuever between the mountains like that day or night, and why is the car starting to run lousy? \r\n\r\n we realized that the craft was going the same speed as us and it was glowing like neon exactly the same colors as my car, almost as if it was trying to communicate with us. there was a break in the trees and we saw the whole thing.Yep, it was following right next to us. we felt like we had little control of the situation.\r\n\r\n whatever this thing was, seemed to be shaped exactly like an old fashioned box kite. it had 2 ends and a frame. it even seemed to have criss cross support bows like a box kite. it was flying very low and appeared to have no windows and made no sounds or exhaust. \r\n\r\n i am not sure how big this thing was but i would guess it was at least bigger than a train car but most likely 50 to 100 times bigger. it appeared to be very close to us as it followed us along the highway. \r\n\r\n the car was starting to run worse and worse. i rolled my window down to see if i could hear it. it seemed to have no sound coming from it. it was silent. the car then died and my buddy coasted the car to the shoulder. \r\n\r\n we were pretty scared at this point. we looked at each other and said, \"well, lets go see what this thing is\". i remember opening the door and stepping out of the car to look at this thing. when i got out, it had disappeared. it vanished. no smoke nothing, just gone.\r\n\r\n we looked around for a minute but couldn't see it anywhere.Pretty scared, we got back into the car, it started right up and was running perfectly.\r\n\r\n as we drove off, we kept looking for it. i did see it again it was up near the top of the mountain and was glowing blue with yellow outline this time as it went over the mountain out of sight.\r\n\r\n we don't recall being abducted or recall any time lost.\r\n\r\n i enjoy watching ufo shows in hopes to see something like what we saw. they always seem to be disc shaped or v shaped on those shows or in photos.\r\n\r\n i would be very interested in hearing about other encounters such as ours. i am wondering if  sightings of a box kite shaped ufo is rare. are they different than others? i don't believe what we saw was of this world.\r\n\r\n

morning (20/08/2008), weather was quite overcast but the moon was shining through in places.\r\n\r\ni like to keep the curtains open so i can look at the sky as i drift off to sleep. as i was looking out the window i spotted a bright, fast moving ball of light, same sort of intensity as an aircrafts headlamps/landing lights when it faces you if you will. \r\n\r\n at first i thought it was just a fast moving jet aircraft, it remained on a straight trajectory, though its speed was impressive. it then suddenly (but not instantly) changed its course and started flying about in circles and loops, darting in and out of the cloud cover, still maintaining an impressive amount of speed for such hard turns. the object appeared as a ball of light, no flashing lights that i could see or other colours coming through.\r\n\r\nafter about 30 seconds or so of observing the object in awe, i tried to go for my phone camera, but it had already gone by the time i got it. my girlfriend was awoken by my excited reactions, but didn't believe me. it nonetheless spooked her because of how i was acting and for the next 10-15 mins, she was watching the sky herself while i slowly started drifting to sleep.\r\n\r\na sudden hitch of breath came from my girlfriend and i turned back to see the object had returned. this time it did no fanciful maneuvers, but hovered around the clouds for a few seconds before it sped off again at impressive speeds into the distance towards the general direction of raf benson.\r\n\r\nthis hugely disturbed my girlfriend i have to say. she tried to convince me it was just a bird, but i didn't believe she believed that explanation herself, she was really quite scared at what she saw and just lay there watching the skies for about half an hour before she finally fell asleep again. this morning when i tried to talk about it, she just got upset and didn't want to talk about it.\r\n\r\nthis is my first 'ufo' sighting and my feelings on the matter has often been its most likely human made, super secret aircraft. it did not behave like any aircraft i'm currently aware of and it most certaintly wasn't a bird. it did not behave in a manner of something falling to the earth either (meteor, satellite etc), but in a controlled manner at cloud level.\r\n\r\npersonally i found this to be an amazing experience for me. even though the possibility exists that this can be mundanely explained, i felt such a rush of adrenaline and combination of emotional reactions from fear, anxiety to sheer excitement at what i saw. i have often seen videos of similar objects and wanted to see one for myself to make my own judgements....\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

outside, i continued to lay there and the voice said again go outside!I get up with this weird urgency and run outside, i'm looking everywhere and i see nothing. i cant explain the feeling that was going through my body, it was the most intense feeling of fight or flight. after about 3 minutes of looking around i figured i was crazy and began to walk inside because it was so damn cold out. as i was walking into my door, something was drawing my head to a section of the sky. as i looked there was a flashing light, it was going from green to red to white and changing between these colors behind a tree. the tree was about 50 yrds away across the street, but you could tell the object was super far in the distance, and super high. at first i thought it was a plane, but i watched over 20 minutes about 5-6 planes fly across the full span of the sky. this object stayed in the same spot, and it wasn't a constant light or star there was a flicker to it, i couldn't even believe it and i was telling my self it was just a star. i placed the object behind a branch of a tree to hide it from my vision when i was surprised to see that it was clearly blinking, you could tell because the branch was hiding the bright main mass but the surrounding light leaking out behind the branch was cleanly blinking between green, red and white. my knee's were trembling throughout this whole experience, and the weirdest thing happened. i started to get really emotional, my knee's were trembling and i found my self crying and tearing for no apparent reason, and it wasn't a scared cry i cant explain it, it was a good thing. i'm not jumping to conclusions saying i know for sure i saw a ufo or what ever, but all i know is, i know my body. the way my body acted towards what ever this

sightings took place over a period of about two months.The majority of the sightings were the same with a few that were extrordinary.They would always start out as the first star in the sky,but they were'nt.Once the transition from twilight to darkness happened everything changed.Looking through the scope of my hunting rifle{the only optical inhancement i had}it changed completely.I could see that there was a red center light with blue,green,and yellow lights rotating around the center.It would then drop in a 90degree angle over a 1-2 hour period.What threw me off was that it moved faster than stars but slower than aircraft.These were the average that me and a friend saw every night for weeks,then things changed.One night i saw one that was moving very fast.It changed from lights to a decending fireball{like a meteor} then back to lights.From my house you could see the orange glow of lights from pelican bay prison through the redwood trees.One night my friend and i saw one

appears to be stationary but over time i've found that is not the case. the object is entering the atmosphere at a calculated angle of attack and the glow is its shielding which is metallic as the glow is a brilliant white yellow. the object then assumes a more level flight path and begins a rapid cooling phase from the yellow color through the reds and visually fading as it travels.\r\n there is no noise when this occurs and no other aircraft in the general area below it.\r\n the flight paths do change and i have not noticed any timing pattern. it is purely chance to see it. the

about 5 minutes. i left my vehicle and while walking towards the first crashed car i was approached by the operator of the same. he said, \"dont worry about me, you better check the big truck that was coming down the wrong side of the road and went into the creek below.\" i immediately noticed small trees and brush pushed almost flat showing the appearance that something went down to the creek. i immediately walked to the creek below. nothing was found. after studying the chain of events it appears that the bright lighted object i witnessed leaving the cemetery did indeed fly from the cemetery down the cut in the mountain, down the wrong side of the highway rt 309 and cause the crash. i now reside in florida and did not report the cemetery incident since i was concerned about my career. i

she saw ufo and now jets were flying all over the place .\r\n   so i went outside and saw about 5 to 10 jets flying all over the place \r\nthey soon started dropping flares in the area where my wife had saw the object . this was seen by about 6 adults and 4 or 5 children my wife wasn't shaken at all by the ufo , but the jets had scared her . she said when she saw it it was like she had always known . this is her second time seeing one , the other was in milwaukee in 2007 . \r\n   the neighbors on the other hand were clearly shaken by what they had seen. they all said that the jets that were dropping the flares was not what they had just witnessed . they described it as being a soft ball sized like fire ball that popped up then disappeared then popped up again in a different location . it lasted about 15 minutes till the jets showed up . they said that the ufo was much bigger than the flares that were being dropped by the jets .\r\n    while the jets were flying all over i was looking all over the sky cause i wanted to see what they had . i looked straight up and i saw what looked like a star moving directly above me but it was real far away . i pointed it out to my wife she saw it to . it was moving straight , then it like pulsed and disappeared . by pulsed i mean it had the star like light then an outer light not as bright around it kind of like a fried egg the yolk being the brighter light it was weird . i'm not sure if what i saw was a ufo , but ive never seen anything like it before .\r\n      i didnt go outside to get pictures of the fire ball that they saw , but i did take pictures of the jets dropping the flares .\r\n   the reason why i didnt report this to you guys sooner is i didnt know about this site . i did however report it to this guy

lights. at first i didn't think much of them but then i realized i saw these lights four days before driving home from a movie. this time i show them to my family and they told me i was crazy and that they were just airplanes. but they were way too bright to be airplanes and they were staitionary. i tried to take a picture with my mom's phone but it didn't turn out too well. as we were driving south the lights seemed to get brighter. i saw these lights for about 15 minutes, but when i came out of friendly's they were gone again. my family was starting to think i'm not soo crazy. this experience is just like my last... if you've had an experience similar to this contact me at brightlightsoverboston@gmial.Com. these lights had a possible disk shape to them and were about 3 miles

enjoy its lights. i estimate the plane's altitude at 10,000 feet going east/north east. as i was observing the jet, a huge triangle shaped object flew over my head toward a  more eastern direction. in comparing the altitude of the plane to the triangle, i estimate the triangle flying at about 4,000 feet lower than the jet at about 45 degrees angle, over my house and coming from behind me.  the triangle went over and passed over very fast however, i was able to see a black contour and round, opaque dark red lights imbedded in its bottom. there was no noise, and it flew into a few flimsy clouds.  when that happened, the red lights became dull, the craft tilted left and it disappeared on a easterly direction. i was breathless. in my life i have seen other ufo's as i worked, before teaching at the local college with virgil staff in california and did the nightly news for a bilingual station in san francisco.  i never saw anything so big nor in a triangular shape, flying so low and being so big.  i don't know if this can help you find out if last night (november 25), other people saw it also. i want to add that the craft had about 4 red lights on each side, 1 on the apex and about 3 on the base of the triangle.\r\nplease feel free to contact me at my home phone any evening.  during the day i usually have classes (i teach french and spanish) back to back.\r\nit was a very exciting experience, no fear only awe and curiosity of course. thank you for reading this report.\r\n\r\np.S. i estimate the whole experience lasted no longer than 8 seconds.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

 i was saying \"oh my god\" over and over.  then, it started moving towards the north, but it never turned or angled in any way.  we could see the triangle shape with the 6 lights the whole time it moved away from us.  it was moving at a moderate speed.  at the same time, my husband is calling my sister to tell her what we are seeing and she suggests i contact the news station to see if anyone else is going to report the sighting.  my husband used his cell phone camera to take a picture, but it was quite a distance away at that point.  i called the news hotline, but they did not receive any reports.  i, then emailed the meterologist, bob french, on october 9, 2008 at approx. 8:14 pm to see if he had heard of any reports of strange aircraft, or if he knew if there were any military aircraft in the area.  he responded on october 10, that he had not heard of anything unusual in our area.  my husband and i were shocked, excited, frantic, and so many other emotions.  my husband and i truly believe we saw a ufo, unless you can disprove what we saw.  unfortunately, the picture he took on his cell phone, only shows a small glowing dot.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:09:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":14068,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.9570411,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11262008-0021","longitude":-95.9088588,"occurred":1223607900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1223607900000,"summary":"Triangle shape with 6 orange lights-2 lights in each corner with steady glow.","tags":["triangle","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Madisonville, Texas","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:296382"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Lake Villa","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving home through a neighborhood on hot and sunny summer afternoon going about 20-25 mph.  out of the corner of my eye i saw something gliding in the air at the edge of the neighborhood near a pond/swamp and field.  i immediately thought(and still wonder if)it was a kite, but recognized as i focused that it was a few individual non-shining,metallic spheres that were about the size of a pilates/exercise ball each.  they were in a flat triangle formation, which did not change/falter the entire time i saw it.  the object/s was in constant motion. it was about 15 ft. high when i first noticed it and glided up near the side of a house and over the roof when i lost visual for a sec. because it was behind the house.  it then emerged from behind the house at about 25-30 ft.(high enough to go over a 2 story roof). it continued to glide towards the field which went up a shallow slope going northwest.  i watched it till it was out of view from going up and over this hill.  it glided very slowly(10-15 mph) and gracefully(like a bird enjoying the wind) the whole time. the speed was consistent/ no deviations. there was no sound.\r\n\r\na side note:\r\n   my mom was boating on my lake which is southeast from this sighting and said she saw \"something\" slowly gliding towards where i was(northwest) at the time of this sighting.  she didn't elaborate too much.  all she said was that it was metal, strange, and queit.\r\n\r\nthis happened around 4:30 p.M. in august.\r\nif it was a kite that i saw, the person holding the strings would of had to run through and over the field where this object glided over and out of sight.  a wild field full of cattails and other thick vegetation.
