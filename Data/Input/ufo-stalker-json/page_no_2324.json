located behind the house (my parents' house) located in oxford, ma.  we noticed some flashing in the window shades (shades were pulled down half way in the 2 windows).  we thought it was heat lightning, so we got up to look.\r\n\r\ni saw 3 or 4 balls of light hovering about 5 to 10 feet above the water down near a dock.  all the balls were rotating around an imaginary central point, moving clockwise (if looking down from the top).  all balls were white and were pulsating in sync from dim white to broght white.  then all the balls changed color simultaneiously to either red and then blue (or vice versa, i just cannot remember).  while they changed colors simultaneously, they continued to pulsate.  then all the balls moves in tendem away from the house moving in an easterly direction going behind trees and out of sight.  the balls rotated around the central point very slowly and the unit (all balls of light) moved away from the scene very slowly as well.\r\n\r\nnext, from some point behind some trees (but over the water)it looked like some sort of light \"scanned\" the trees as well as a trailer in which my grandmother was sleeping.  the reason i say \"scanned\" is because the pattern the light moved.  it started at the tree tops, and then moved in one direction (from right to left) and searched a lower level in the opposite derection.  it kept doing this slowly until the entire small area had been completely searched.\r\n\r\nfinally, the light from above the water (behind the trees)went out and almost immediately, a light from what must have been above the house had \"scanned\" the back yard in the same pattern as the woods...Back and forth, until an entire area had been searched.\r\n\r\nthen, the light went out. and it was over.\r\n\r\nthe light that scanned the area was an extremely bright, white light which i would describe as a bright powder white, with very well defined sides to the light beam, sort of like how a laser bean is a well defined beam.\r\n\r\nthere was complete silence during this whole event which was extremely odd.  no bull frogs, no tree frogs, noo breeze, nothing.\r\n\r\ni was comletely frozen in shock because i was so

south end of the island. i was driving on blakely ave ne heading south, it wasnt untill i passed blakely elementary school and came into the clearing, the road starts to curve left and  there is a hill off to the right of the road that i noticed an objects lights closer to the ground than normal. \r\n\r\n2. i thought it was an airplane off in the distance with its landing lights on and it appeared to be traveling towards me, this made me instantly alarmed because there isnt a runway around that area for at least 10 miles and not in the direction it was traveling in. from here i never took my eyes off it.\r\n\r\n3. i thought the airplane was traveling towards me off in the distance as i traveled further down the road i started to realize the lights wernt really getting bigger and it became apparent that this thing was not traveling at a speed fast enough for an airplane to sustain flight. so i started to slow down and focus on the object. at first, the object had four lights shining towards me, 2 on each side just like an airplane with its landing lights on .\r\n\r\n4. i realized that it was much closer than i had originally thought and moving in a way that was impossible to be human technology . i started to get emotional because i instantly recognized the outline of the shape when it became visible to the eye, the only thing i can come close to describing its shape is it very much resembled the mother ship from starfox from the classic nintendo 64 game and also on super smash brothers. it wasnt a 100% replica of the ship but thats the only thing i can describe it as. no other words would describe this object.\r\n\r\nit was moving towards me from over the water and i noticed the lights actually starting to move up and down in a pattern . the outer left light would move up and the inner left light moved down, the same with the right side. the outer light moved up and the inner light moved down. i didnt know what to make of it at first because i was in complete shock. the object soon moved over the hill and then it soon began to hover directly in front of me and i could see the lights were not actually in a straight line, there were two lights in the front part and two lights in the back, the only way that it could have been possible for me to see the lights moving in an up and down pattern was that the object itself started to tilt at an axis so the rear lights were actually lower in altitude than the front lights. the front lights were on a wider scale than the rear thats why they appeared as outer lights. as i watched it slowly move over me it couldnt have been more than a hundred feet over me. i rolled down my window and stuck my head out the window because it wasnt directly in front of me any more it was directly over me, as i looked up it instantly clicked that these guys wanted to abduct me of some sort and at that point i became emotional and i called my mom to tell her what was happening from there i was on the phone with her for the rest of the experience. as i went further down the road it starts to go down a hill and is surrounded by trees on both sides it started to follow me down the road maintaining its altitude of about 100 ft the whole time. at this point the lights were still in view in the same direction i had saw them before but the object started traveling at a trajectory that was impossible to be from our time, it started to move backwards without rotating like the front of the ship was watching the front of my truck the whole time. as i drove further down the road the object was in the same position, in my front windshield for about half a mile without losing its image of the 4 lights in the same position as i first saw it.\r\n\r\n5. at this point i was full on crying but still stable enough to describe everything to my mom as best as i could i couldnt believe what i had just witnessed and i knew there was no possible way for me to convey this information to others and not sound crazy. my mom just tried to calm me down and i knew she didnt really believe me, how would it sound if you got a call out of the blue and the first thing that person said to you was.. there is a ufo hovering over me right now!! i would automatically assume that person was delusional or drunk. so of course i didnt go around blabbing it to everyone \r\ni didnt dare mention it at work for a while because i didnt want everyone to think i was a nutter. it was a good job at the time, i eventually mentioned it to a coworker and the owner of the pizza shop, they reacted just as i suspected, just kinda brushed it off and sceptically agreed with me i didnt even explain its movements or it hovering over me. ufos had come up in a conversation and i said \"yea ive seen a ufo, while delivering a pizza actually\" and it pretty much was cut off from there. from there on ive only told this to close friends or people that are interested in that stuff because thats the only way for the person not to think you're insane... \"oh you saw the starfox mothership? wow you're just that special i guess(extreme sarcasm).\"\r\n\r\n6. as it was directly in front of me towards the end of blakely av, it started to hover back over my roof so i couldnt see it out my front winshield anymore, so i put my head back out the window and looked straight up and it was  gone. no trace. vanished. i stopped the truck and looked everywhere around me and it was absolutely gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

bottom. it had a red light on top, and was clear in the middle.  i can remember seeing the red glow in the interior i thought was a police radio.  i could hear that it was making sounds of static like the police radios do.  so immediately took it that it was a couple of police officers parked in the woods. i could see inside of what i then thought was a police car. i could even make out the outline of  a figure in the driver's see. i walked within arms lenghts of this vehicle. not for a second i didnt think it was a police. it was black till about the trunk hight of a police cruiser.  it had red/amber glow inside of it,about the width of a car windshield.  it had a rectangle red light on top of it about 4x8 in size.It was square/retangle at the back but came to a triangle at the top.  pyramid shape.   i paniced and said wtf and took of full speed. just as i turned i noticed a very bright amber light engulfed me.  i never looked back. at the time i have a cpl of warrants, and definetly didnt want to see a police.  especially in a dark secluded place.  after running to a safe place i took a few minutes to rationalize what i just saw. i knew one thing for certain, there was no way a car was capable of being where that object was. there is barerly access to 4x4 atv the road is awful and filles with deep mudpuddles a car could never negate. i also thought due to recent event, i have reason to believe that what i witnessed was a ufo.  i actually walked up on it arms length away.  there was now way that was a cop with the window down.. because if i could hear their radio, he could here me say wtf.. out loud and then me barrelling through the thick under growth.  i sounded like a spooked deer tearing through the brush. i was thinking at the time why arent they chasing me. everything happened so fast. one minute im looking up through the treeline following a red light, then next im 2 feet away from the red light. i can remember the  glow of the light that i thought was the interior of a car changing colors.  at first it was clear white.\r\nthen it was red then it was bright amber like the street light.  it flashed so brightly as i turned that i could not see anything. it took a second for my vision to come back and by then i had over ran the original trail i was following. while the light was clear like the interior light of a car  i could definetly se a single shape i took to be a driver.  it looked like when u look through the back  glass of a car. but ican remember only  seeing one seat. something else i can remember is that the radio never said anywords, it just made a jumbled static like sounds.  recently i took my wife to see the place where i seen the car/ufo?  i went there from the  track just to see if it was possible for a car to have been wherei saw it. that answere is no. it was at least a cpl hundred yards from the track to where i saw the strange object. at the time there was only a deer trail through there.  now there is a 4wheeler trail  giving the hunters easier access to that deer stand.  that night i new it was too dark to  get on the deer trail  so i just wanted to walk throught the young pines where i knew there was no under growth. and also like i said as soon ass i took a couple of steps off the main trial i was on, it was right there, arms lenght in front of me.  talk about close encounter.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14054,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.0212201,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11262008-0007","longitude":-92.7204643,"occurred":800595000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arkansas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,

late at night.  we jumped over the fence and walked up the western trail that leads to the bench at the top.  we sat on the bench a short while and admired the city.  then on the way down, we passed what was the estate that was in the park on the east side.  we passed the tennis court and i said to my friend, \"wouldn't you just freak if those old delapidated lights went on right now?\"  i was feeling a bit freaked out from the darkness at this level of the canyon coming down the eastern trail.  well we went around the tennis courts and started down the trail that is the deepest darkest part of the canyon and suddenly from nowhere, a huge, blinding extraordinary white light flashed...And i noticed that i took exactly 4 steps while the light shined and could see my shadow, and the shadows of the trees and all the plants around us.  at this part of the trail there are very large eucalyptus trees.  i actually could see an owl in the tree startled and flying off.  it sounded like everything scurried away at that moment around us.  on the 4th step, we both froze in fear.  it was so bright, and seemingly all around us and extremely white.  so, we stopped, now in pitch blackness again, looking at each other with complete fear wondering \"what the f@@@\"? with this i told my friend, \"i don't care what it was, just run!\".  i took him back up there the next day to see where it was because i lived just down the road and knew the park very well..And he swore there must have been some people or cops playing tricks.  but when we went back i verified that where we were was dead

fields to the west of aurora. we specifically went to look for strange lights in the sky, not really believing we would see anything. after about a half hour we saw a light to the west at an estimated mile away from us and about 20deg above the horizon. it was rotating horizontally from left to right about its axis, and we at first thought it was some kind of tower light. we soon noticed that the light wasn't rotating in a striaght line however, it started to spin around it axis slightly rotating clockwise, untill it was now going around an object vertically. soon it was rotating all the way along the edge clockwise, like it was spinning on all three axis. the light would appear along one edge and go across its face to dissapear behind it.\r\n we were all perplexed as to how a light could spin in every direction and not hit the arm that was holding it if it would have been on a tower. soon, very small points of light started dropping from undernieth the object, about 15 of them. they dropped slowly about the width of a thumb under the object, and then shot off in every direction towards the ground very fast, and were soon gone from sight. still thinking this had to be some kind of manmade device, such as fireworks from a tower or such. about 10 minutes later, all the small points of light returned to the exact spot the sped off from, below the object, and slowly returned to the larger rotating object. after seeing this we were all perplexed as to what this could be, but were now sure it wasn't man made.\r\n as soon as the last small light had returned, the space between the edges of the rotating light seemed to get smaller, and the light dimmer as if receding into the distance, untill we could no longer see it. none of us were drinking or doing drugs that night, and i

could see the stars in the sky .  as i looked up i saw a octagon shape street sign looking ufo in the sky.  at the time i didnt know what a ufo was but thought that the shape was different and wondered what it was.  it had no lights and was black  i saw no light on it at all and it was spinning very slow.  i could see the shape because the sky in the back was brighter than the object above our car.  then as i looked another one came up behinde it and connected to it.\r\n\\\r\nnow let me tell you this before zi go on.  this incident has bothered mem my whole life and i told only my children wife and mom a few weeks ago.  i also tried to contact seti for info about a stop sighn looking ufo that had no lights and they blew me off along with others.  monday i happened to be channel surfing and came across a ufo show.  i thought more crapabotu glowing ufo's.  i thought what about the one i saw then you had a segment that was exactly!!!!!!!!! what i saw.  though i didnt see like a separation of pie lights on the bottom.  now this is where my proof comes in.  i still have the email i sent out on my computer and can fax you a copy proving that this is what i saw.  i would like to

the house to pick our son up from ccd\r\nclass. this is over at 7:30 pm and just about 8 minutes away from our home. when she arrived back home @ approximately 7:40 pm she came running up the stairs to tell me that she had just seen the freakiest thing. so i asked her what she saw.\r\n  my wife told me she saw this black triangle shaped craft just sitting above the gas station at the corner of huntingdon pike and rockledge avenue on her way to pick up our son. the gas station is just a 1/4 mile up rockledge avenue from our house. she very excited by the way. \r\nwhen she was telling her story. she estimated it to be just 300 or 400 feet above the station. the craft was totally still and totally silent. she also pointed out that the thing was so low that she witnessed great detail of the craft.\r\nshe was observing this event while approaching the intersection through the front windshield and then while sitting at the red light she actually\r\nput her head out the window to listen for any noise. eventually the signal changed and she had to get our son. by the way there was regular vehicle traffic around no one else seemed to notice this craft just sitting there.  \r\n    on the way back from getting  our son she started looking for the craft again while driving and encouraging him to do the same. the craft was no longer over the gas station on the return trip. but when she made the left turn onto rockledge ave. she spotted it again moving towards our very house and then it moved off extremely fast and disappeared.\r\nwell, you could just imagine my disbelief in this story and amazement.\r\nso i went out side to take a look for myself with the wife and two kids on my tail.\r\n   it was night time but a well moonlit night. we went into the back yard and investigated the sky. in just a few moments my wife yells out there it is. sure enough over the trees towards the east was this big black triangle just sitting there still and quite. it was approximately\r\na 1/4 mile away. it had a light at each point of the triangle and a red light in the center of the craft. after a couple of minutes it started moving very slowly to my right which would be south. it moved towards the south for some distance still in sight then it moved back to my left for some equal distance then it stopped again.\r\n   i yelled to my son to go and get my binoculars. he did and comes back a few minutes later with a pair of his binoculars. well they are toy binoculars; i can't see any thing out of them. so i yell out these aren't \r\nmy binocs and tell my wife to keep and eye on the triangle while i go find my 10x50 binochs. so by the time that i retrieved my binocs and get back to view the craft 5 minutes have had to pass. but low and behold the triangle is still right there still just sitting there totally still.\r\n    so now i view this thing through the binoculars. it���s big and black\r\nwith a white light at one point , a red light at another point, and a green light at the third point. it also had a very peculiar red light that seemed to be spinning at the center of the craft. at one point the light seemed to shine into my binoculars and flash across my eyes kind of like a flash from a camera. my wife said that she saw a beam of light come out from the craft. we observed this thing for approximately 15 more minutes it was sweeping left to right and right to left all the while heading east. moving very slow and steadily. by the way there is a small farm due east of our house that is the location that the craft seemed to be hovering over.\r\nthe farm is called fox chase farm in philadelphia. it is a two minute drive by car from my home. i estimated this thing from the distance; i observed to be 300 feet long by 200 feet at the widest part of the triangle. hovering at 200 or 300 feet over the trees. but that is really anybody���s guess. i know one thing that it was real and i want to see it again.\r\n     however i was watching your program on the discovery channel last night. you featured the sightings that have been reported in bucks county pa. i was particularly interested in the description of the ufo made by the gentlemen last night. he described a kind of craft that was kind of like a pie. that he could see through the gaps in the craft when the heat lighting was illuminating the craft. well i thought this is where the triangle came from. it looks like the black triangle could separate from that pie ship. it���s just an idea that popped into my head and it is really why i decided to tell you my story. since bucks county is the next county over from montgomery county. who knows maybe our story may help you figure this thing out.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

minutes), but we didn't see it move any more. the light appeared much too bright to a planet, and it was near a very bright star or planet. i commented to my wife that it definitely appeared to be within our atmosphere. it seemed close, unlike the stars, but not just because of the brightness.\r\nmy wife and i have been interested in ufos for almost two years now, and we regularly watch the

was a passenger plane. then i realized there were many clues all telling me it was something else. first, it was a disc. i could tell its shape because it was outlined with small lights, similar to those seen on an airplane. then i realized how low it was. it was either very low or very big which, either way, means it was not an airplane. it was also moving at a very slow, constant speed. i do not remember what i saw when it left my field of vision. it may have simply passed over some trees out of my line of sight. after it was gone, i went to a couple of my friends to see if they had seen it. they said they had, and a few days later we decided to draw a picture of what we had seen. we all agreed; we had all seen the same object. while i was watching the object i don't think i really

village. just below new hope pennsylvania.The owners of the property  ( large farm)where the meeting was held had a dog that started acting up. the husband kept going out and saying something was out there. he came running in the house and up the stairs followed by 2 other guys all military from willow grove navy base stationed in willow grove. the one guy running past and up the steps said there is something out there and tempest ran off  infact ran the electric fence. this went on for a bit and i decided to leave. as i went down the driveway which runs about just less then a 1/4 mile. as i was going down the drivway i relised i did not have my headlights on. for some reason i looked to my right an noticed about 200 feet in the corner of the feild not far fron the farmhouse just below treetop level were lights, bluish and a pinkish while very small lights. i suddenly hit the breaks and turned my lights on and looked back and what ever was there was no longer. as i got to the end of driveway i got the creeps and gunned it out on the road ( 202) and headed south to go home. suddenly for about 3-5 seconds my truck started to vibrate then it was over. i continued south on 202 and comming up to peddlers village i noticed some bright lights over the feild on the left  and said to myself when the hell did they put that tower up  today. as i got closer i relised there was nothing holding it up. i drove by real slow lookking across the feild and there was what appeared two large black squares with what looked like round windows  ( short funnel like) the thing is from an angle you could not see the redish/orange glow from inside unless you looked head on into it. i sat there for what seemed like ever but prolb only 25 mins. looking at the three blueish whits lights comming out from the bottom onto the feild, and in the light where it hit the weeds it looked like daylight.. for some reason beyound me i was going to gwet out of truck and walk over to see it betterbut didnt.I sat at light where 3 other cars were watching at the light. i sat there looking back to see it again as we all were so i thought. even a car that was comming out of one of the restraunts. i must have sat through the light changing 3-4 times and noone moved so i went through the light and called the friends up the road to tell them to go check out what was down the road. they said when they got there nothing was there. the next day though the dog was found dead by driveway and was burried on property.. over the years i noticed where the object was by trees on farm the trees died just about 1/2 way down from the top... i know what i saw and know we dont have something that large as it was the size of two square barns connecter by a huge tube all solid smooth as lead black. im an artist so drawing it for someone who wants to know is no prolbem for me.I dont care what anyone says i know what i saw and it bothers me to this day. oh funny thing , this thing was in the air and did not move or make a sound at all not a peep till 2 other lights came on thats when i saw the tube connected both huge squares and got a real good look at the texture of this objest. smooth as black lead not a dent, rivet at all..Here its years later and i still find myself looking at nights hopeing to see it again. you ask what was my feelings, funny i thought im looking at something not from here and i was calm the whole time.
