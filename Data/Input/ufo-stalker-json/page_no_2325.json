the object to my right up in the sky. it was a clear night. the object caught my attention because it was bright and hovering but i didn't pay any more attention to it.  i got dropped off at my house about one half mile down the road and when i got out of the car in front of my house i saw the same object across the street from my house hovering between two houses.  i said to my driver who was a lt. \"what to hell is that\".  we stared at it fro about one minute and he said, \"i don't know what it is but don't say anyitng to anyone because they wll think we are nuts\". then he left.  i stood there looking at the object for about five minutes and then went and sat on my front porch watchng it fro about another ten minutes.  hard to gauge time because i was scared and fascinated at the same time. the object was quite large, disc shaped and had bright pulsatng lights around it.  the colors were amber, green, red and blue.  they were very bright. i could vaguely make out what appeared to be a dome on top but the lights were so brihgt that i coudn't see clearly but i believe the color of the dome was a dull silver. i had an eerie feeling that the object was focusing on me because no body else was around and it was a sunday night in the suburbs which means no traffic was out. the object was about 75 yards across and was hovering at about 100 feet. it did not move the whole time and there definitely was not any noise. i did not have a camera and even if i did i was too scared to use it. i got up and went inside and woke my wife up and showed her and when we both looked out the front window it wsa still there. my wife asked if we could take a vidieo with the old beta type recoreders but i told her no because i didnt want to have to turn on the light apparatus with the camera because it might scare the object away.  we watched it fro about ten more minutes and it didnt move.  when it did move it sped up and back at a speed i never saw before. then it seemed to just reappear at the new location.  about 5 seconds later it went up higher and forward and stopped fro another 5 seconds then up and out of sight at incredible speeds.  i never heard anyitng from the object as it moved and even today there is nothing that comes close to the speed that it moved.  it moved literally like the blink of an eye.  \r\n\r\ni was a seasoned law enforcement officer and detective and i spent a few years in the usmc working around helicopters and jets. this object was not a military aircraft and it moved wiht speed that is not possible from our aircraft.\r\n\r\ni never told anyonme about this for many, many years partly because if my lt. found out i was afraid to get him involved and i would be disciplined and parly because i didnt want people to think i was insame.  after your story aired about the sightings in bucks county which is wher my incident happened i feel more comfortablee talking about it. my only regret was that i didnt take a pic but i didnt own  35 mm amd the movie cames was antiquated and i didnt want to take time away from observing the object.  i do know that i was very frightened even though i was armed.  again i had the disitnct feeling that hthe object was studying me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14026,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.958955,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11252008-0033","longitude":-75.159389,"occurred":338624100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":338624100000,"summary":"Spotted

it dawn patrol. anyway, i was with a friend of mine and i was taking photographs of the even with no flash and long/open shutter on my canon rebel xt. i'm a photography student and i prefer my photos to be more \"organic\" than anything else, so i don't use flash. i was watching the balloons and taking pictures, and every no and then looking back at the photos to see what kind of pictures i was getting. it was about 5am in the morning when the races started. i looked back at some pictures to see this blue line moving across the sky. i understand that with the slow shutter likes move around, but everything else in the photos was still and it was much, much brighter than other stars and objects. i had started just watching with my eyes, not through the camera's viewfinder, and started to see the light moving around. it was not a plane. i noticed that it would move, stop, move, stop, move, stop, erratically. i'm a big believer in ufo's, as is my mom who says she saw one decades ago in new york. i, however, had never seen one. so i decided to open the shutter completely, set the camera on the ground and hold it still so that the camera's movement couldn't be a cause of the light moving in the picture. i caught it in pictures clearly about 3 times. but the blueish quick moving light wasn't the only one i saw. there was also a green bar that seemed to show up randomly in my photos that i saw with my own eyes a few times as well, this one seemed to show up more often in my pictures at home after the balloon races. i'm not positive about the green one and it's validity as some kind of ufo, but it shows up randomly and i've never seen this kind of light show up in my photographs, ever, and i know my camera. at my first sight of the blue one i felt confused and then realized what i thought it was a became excited and had to have more pictures. i was really grateful that it was dark and that i knew, as an experienced photo-taker, that a slower shutter would show its movements, not just a snapshot. eventually the objects randomly disappeared as morning came. it was awesome to see.\r\n\r\ni have more pictures for you guys if you want them, i gave the three that are, in my opinion, the best out of the bunch. none of the three are the green one, if you want to see those, i'll send them. they're also all pretty large photos, so hopefully you can zoom in enough

night. as i was looking up to the north (at about 8:15pm) i noticed a faint orange glowing cloud, like the glow from the interstate lights. behind the moving cloud (going south) were black spots/lines forming an arrow pointing south. between the arrow were diagonal black lines crisscrossing between the arrow.  every 5-10 seconds, the diagonal lines turned to scattered black spots, then back to diagonals, etc.  at first i was thinking it looked ike a flock of geese but knew after watching a definite pattern of thecdiagonal lines turning to scattered and back that geese do not have patterns that changed back and forth every few seconds   unless a person was concentrating on the sky as i was, it wouldn't be noticeble.  the cloud of cream/orange moved with the object like camoflauge at what seemed around 20,000 -30,000 feet i'm air. i know it was solid because it blocked out the stars as it moved and thecorange cloud moved exactly with black spots to keep it covered up.   i lost it from sight when it was far enough south to be covered by my tree.  i estimate it took about 3 minutes to cover from north to south and there was no noise.  i knew i did not have time to run into house and get a camera.   i immediately called a friend to describe the object and told her to let me know if she heard any reports on tv.  i've monitored the web and saw a similar report in canada and australia but notin the same time period.  i also reported it on a local site that tracks ufo sightings. how i felt when i saw it was complete confidence that it was nothing i had ever seen before.  i was nervous enough to immediately go inside, lock the doors and monitor the news and internet.  it didn't surprise me that no one else saw it because the camoflauge was so faint in orange color that it almost completely blended into the sky.  i wouldn't have notced if the black spots or lines wouldn't have penetrated through the glow.    i remember we had an ice storm during the morning hours about 8 hours later.  i had my annual eye checkup the next morning and was 20/20 without glasses.

time that i have seen this particular object. at exactly 1:25 am i was out on my deck peering through my telescope. as the motor moved the scopes declination, i noticed something of a blur. i quickly looked up, and to my surprise i saw what appeared to be a light(maybe white), long, cylindrical object moving very slowly at about 20 degrees above horizon. at first glance i thought it might be a missile because the moon was fairly bright and shaded what turned out to be a large portion of the object. as the clouds slightly shrouded the moon and the object turned counterclockwise i noticed that it was quite a bit larger that my previous assumption. it resembled a passenger aircraft with no wings, no tail, no discernible nose and from what i could tell and see in my telescope, no markings whatsoever. this object moved in all directions and pivoted on its axis allowing me to see it very well. there were lights but not like an aircraft. from what i could see, the only lights were on its nose or tail(one end as there was no way to tell which end was nose or tail).  the object moved in such a way that i have never seen before or after. most of the time it looked as if it just was creeping along but every now and then it would move so fast that it appeared to vanish and appear a mile or two across the sky in an instant. this got my attention as i have never seen something move that fast. it continued to creep and sometimes dart for exactly one hour and 22 minutes. i could see that the object was relatively close because i would occasionally loose it behind a group of clouds( i live up on the haleakala crater) and other times i noticed the same clouds behind the object. i would estimate the length at an astounding 700-1000 feet. the method i used to come to that length was, i waited for it to pass between myself and the crater and used some geographical features that i know to be approx. 100 yards in length. the object simply dwarfed the crater feature i mentioned, possibly 3 times as long. after watching it for almost an hour and a half, i thought it went behind some low clouds. it turned out that it did not go behind or into the clouds, it simply disappeared but with what i would call a trace. where i saw it last in the sky, the moon lit up the group of clouds that it went into, and there i noticed a fairly large but perfectly round hole in the cloud mass. i stayed out scanning the sky for another 30 minutes but the object did not return to the best of my knowledge. i had called my good friend and told him to look low on the western horizon about 15 minutes before it dissipated. i had waited to call him simply because his wife is pregnant and it was very late. after about an hour+ of viewing the object came very close to being over his house, it was then i decided to chance the wrath of his wife simply because it was so close to him that i thought he might be able to tell what it was. he ran to his lanai and looked but described the same as me except the size which he said was bigger than my estimate and absolutely no sound whatsoever! i had seen something very much like this about 8 years ago in the skies above malibu canyon road. it was the middle of the day and i was comming back from a surf session with a buddy of mine. we both witnessed it before it disappeared out of sight. i would have to say that given the close resemblance to the object i saw the other night, that this was probably the same type of object. i think that just about covers it....If you could venture a guess as to what i saw i would be open to suggestions.\r\n\r\naloha and ma halo for taking the time to read my account.\r\n\r\ngh           ","distance":"101-500

we told our family about it too they were suspicious about things of that nature. \r\n\r\nthat  same night i have seen it again! i was doing some homework and i was up late close to 12am. my bedroom was upstairs and my window was facing east. that night was a clear night except a white lost cloud in the sky in front of my window, as i turned off the light to get in bed, i looked out the window because my bed was right next to it and i have seen the cloud flashing in colors, yellow, red, and green (jumping light) through the cloud as they were spinning at fast rate. colors i have never seen in my life! they were so intense the closest thing i could describe to you it would have to be a rainbow. it was the same disc going towards cayuga lake direction. i went out of the house   to see if i can see it again. in few minutes  i have seen it again coming from the same direction as the first time going towards the lake again. it was flying at extreme speeds, i never seen anything fly that fast i know it was something the air force doesn���t have. it was flying very fast and it made a 90 degree turn without even slowing down and disappeared. it was gone in less then 5 second out of the night sky and that was the last time i have seen it. i told some of my friends about it and they have seen similar things at different times in other close areas (dryden ny). upstate ny lots of people encountered flying discs has something to do with the cayuga lake. \r\n\r\n2 years later after the first incident, i was in the same room  sleeping (my bed was close to the wall and window).I woke up to a humming sound, the closest i can describe it, would have to be  some kind of ventilator or vacuum. i was very tired that night and i thought that the noise it will go away whatever it is, it might be on the street (trumansburg rd). that noise it was going on for some time through out the night probably at least 30 min or so. i was waken up, i was going in and out of my sleep.  as i mentioned my room was on the second floor, and my window was facing e. the only light that could have enter my room was the sun. as i was sleeping i was facing the wall and a bright light illuminated my room just like you have brought the sun in my room. it was night time no day ! i jumped up and turned around to see what it was but i haven���t seen anything. the noise was gone and also the light that entered my room. next day i went in the city, it was about 15:00pm. it was a cloudy afternoon but through the clouds something caught my eyes, i could see jumping lights of different colors again, going e very fast and was gone in 2 sec.This incident was at about the same location as 2 years earlier. that was the last time i have seen anything. i thought i share it with you guys. thanks for taking the time to read. \r\n  \r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":14010,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.4500914,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11252008-0017","longitude":-76.5003807,"occurred":811753200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New York","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,  Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":811753200000,"summary":"It was a circle object silver/platinium color and glass half bowl on top with light inside.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/14010_submitter_file1__ufo.GIF"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Ithaca, New York","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:297265"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Washington","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It happend in the summer in the mnth of june, me and my girfriend and her cousin were in terrace heights on a canal road that over looks yakima. we were sitting in the car for about 2 hours talking about the days events and other none speciface topics. at one moment of a conversation i looked up threw my moon roof and noticed a bright light in the sky, at first i thought it was an airplane. i realized that the light had no blinking light like and airplane and was not moving so at that time i asked my girlfriend and her cousin \"what is that\" and i pointed at the moon roof towerds the object, they tried to look at it threw th moon roof but couldnt see it so my girl friend looked out the passanger window, as she did this the object at that time was the brightist light in the sky went from a bright light in the sky to a small dim star looking light, it started moving north in an upward direction until it vanished into the sky. me and my girl friend looked at each other and i asked her\"did u see that\"? she replied yes\" and i said\" what was that\"? and we both just stared at each other in disbalief. that was my first sighting of these lights and have abserd many more over yakima since.

think it was in the spring, because as i remember it was dark early and yet it was not vary cold, so i am guessing maybe march or april, the day,not sure. also the night was still, not common for that area near the west beach of whidbey island. as i waited i could hear a low pitched, low volume sound comming from over head. i looked up and could see what i thought was a plane flying over head, planes were common, because there was a naval air station and a sea plane base on the island. what was uncommon was the slow movement of the object, the low noise level,and the low altitude,it seemed to be just about three telephone pole lengths off the ground. i tried to estimate the by looking at the pole the street light was on.  the most important thing i was the structure of the object, the way the surface was assembled. it looked like bolts or rivets connecting plates to an unders structure.  the light by which i could see the details of the structure was not from the street light but moved with the object.  i could not see the size of the object because it was too dark.  i watched it for maybe a minute or two until it was out of sight.  when my mother arrived i told her about it, but she was not imperssed. i did't think too much more about it, until i became friends with an air force pilot, just a few years ago, and told him thinking that he might know what kind of a plane it was. his response was \"i have always wanted to see one of those\", i ask, those what? he answered a ufo, there arn't planes that can do what you describe. tonight i saw a program about you research

aviation aware. a student pilot and know what i see in the air. can usually tell you make and model of the aircraft, etc.  what i saw that night, i can only tell you what it was not!\r\n\r\nthat was one weird night!  me and a friend thought it would be fun to spend the night at the lake. it was summer and we were out of school.  we went in his car and were laying out on lawn chairs nearby the lake shore.\r\n \r\nno moon, lots of stars!  we were talking about \"wouldn't it be great if we saw a ufo?\"  please understand. there was nothing involved to make us \"see\" anything. no booze, no drugs, etc.  anyway, they tell me, no matter what you have been taking, when both of you see the same thing, then it must be real right?\r\n \r\n \r\nanyway, we were laying on our backs looking at the stars.  we saw a star track across the starfield.  that was probably an airliner or maybe a satellite.  hours went by and then, about 11:00pm (23:00hrs) mike said, for the second time, \"wouldn't it be cool if we saw a ufo?\"\r\n \r\nat that instant, i looked to my right toward the dam.  we were near the lakeshore and below the top of the dam.  normal camping/fishing/recreation place at the lake.  the top of the dam was maybe 50 feet above us.\r\n \r\ni said to mike, \"you mean like that?\"  silence!  we both stared in awe at what we were looking at!  it just came over the lake, not quite even with us.  it did not turn around but kinda hovered then reversed course and went back over the dam.\r\n \r\n \r\nwell, you can guess what we were talking about!  wow! what the hell was that?\r\n \r\nabout 5 minutes later, we had settled down a bit and i told mike, \"it's back!\"\r\n \r\ndid i ever tell you about what i saw over lake ft. phantom, near abilene, texas and dyess afb in the mid '70's?\r\n \r\ni can not tell you what it was. i can tell you what is was not.\r\n \r\nit was not an airplane, helicopter, hot air balloon, weather balloon, blimp, zeppelin, autogyro, etc., etc. i think you get the idea.\r\n \r\nnothing flies that slow, makes no sound and maneuvers!\r\n \r\nit came in low over the dam, approx 150-200 ft agl.  approx the size of a car.  maybe 20ft long, oval shaped and translucent!  no definite shape. like it was lit from within.  like it was a plastic ball with a light source inside.  it was a dull red color.  came over the dam, reversed course 180 and left the way it came.\r\n \r\nabout 5 minutes later, it was back.  it tracked parallel to us then made a right angle turn directly toward us. came within maybe 300 feet horizontally then made another right angle turn away from us then began to change colors!  i do not mean any marker lights changed. there were no marker lights. the entire craft changed colors, rapidly!  from red to white to green.  i could not tell any apparent time or color sequence!  craft then returned to dull red, made a slight angle jog in course and we eventually lost it directly over the power plant at the other end of lake ft. phantom!  total time of observation, approx. 20 minutes!  max speed of craft, maybe 20 mph.  normal speed, approx. 5 mph\r\n \r\nin the mid '70's there were no remote control craft like you might see today.  the only thing that could move that slow was a balloon of sorts or a helicopter.  a balloon could not make those maneuvers!  a helicopter can not make no noise!\r\n \r\nagain, i do not know what i saw. i only know what it was not!\r\n \r\ni know i am not crazy.  there was someone else with me who saw the same thing!\r\n\r\n\r\n as i said, it was in view for a long time!  i do remember trying mike's cb radio in his car and it worked.  no one, of course believed me, but the electrical circuits and radio freqs did work, unlike many other ufo reports.\r\n \r\nthis thing did, however, one thing many other ufo have done.  it went out of sight directly over the power plant!  i don't know what it is about power plants and ufo's but they seem to go hand in hand.\r\n \r\nnever moved fast nor changed altitude. moved in only 2 dimensions.\r\ndid not look like anything i have seen in the air before or since.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":14006,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.4522064,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11252008-0013","longitude":-99.7234239,"occurred":236584800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":236584800000,"summary":"Slow

15 yards from my house when i notice a silent flashing object on the horizon due south-east from my location, upon further observation, i notice it was a stationary sphere flashing in a green and blue multi-colored, at first i thought it was a border patrol helicopter or a uav which they a common in my area due to the proximity to the mexican border, the object did not appeared to be any conventional aircraft,  i thought that was awkward, and kept observing the object for a couple of minutes possibly two to three minutes when, i notice a smaller white light it either came out or fall off the object, i lost track of the smaller object because at that point i could not believe my eyes, i was mesmerize by the event i had just witness, i then notice the stationary green and blue sphere move up in an unexplained manner and disappear.  the whole event only lasted no more than ten minutes, i wish i would off taken some video or pictures, i thought about it, but my camera did not have a charge batteries and video camera was at my brothers house, i tried my cell phone camera but it was useless.  i know that with out pictures or video is hard to back up my case, i was by myself and i do not know of any other witness.  the weather that night was beautiful, with a real clear sky, and most of the stars were visible.  i have no reason to make this up, i am a current federal government employee that works at a local airport, i work day in and day out with airplanes, and i know how airplanes sound, how they look at night and at a distance etc., prior to my current employment i was employed at a local police department, and i am a amateur astronomer so i am familiar with the night sky.  and my residence is located outside city limits in the ranch country so i
