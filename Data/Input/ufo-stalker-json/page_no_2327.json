resembled a meteor or \"shooting star\".  there were no audible frequencies emitted. then the object began to stutter around in a relatively small radius from my perspective. after about a minute the ball of light just sped off into space at a very accute angle. i would estimate the object accelerated from 0 to several thousend miles per hour in less than half a second. i remember thinking \"finally i have seen one\".  if only it were closer to me i may have been able to make out it's color.  it emitted a similar wavelength of light similar to a\r\nxenon headlight of a bmw.  very

am trying to tell you is that this object was trying to communicate to me through the photos. as you can see \"they\" came up to me while being in the street. of coarse i couldn't see them at the

showed unusually high levels of boron. i have a hypothesis to follow the article.\r\n\r\ncommon uses of boron\r\nborax, the most common natural form of boron, has a wide variety of uses. borax is used in cleaning compounds, glass and ceramics, fertilizers, papers and paints, and fire retardants. borax is also used in enamels covering the steel of refrigerators, washing machines, and other like objects.\r\n\r\nboron nitride, or borazon, is a hard material and is used as an abrasive.\r\n\r\nboracic acid is used as a mild antiseptic.\r\n\r\nother boron compounds are used for heat-resistant glass, detergents and soaps, enamels, and medicine. \r\n\r\nboron is known as a very hard element. it is also very strong and light weight. boron is almost as hard as diamond, so it is used in place diamonds in many cases. boron is added to steel for extra hardness and strength at high temperatures.\r\n\r\nboron is conducts heat very well, and is a great insulator, thus it has increasingly amounts of technological appliances.\r\n\r\nboron also serves many uses in atomic energy. it is used in instruments designed to detect, and count slow neutrons. it also has a high absorption of neutrons, so it is used as a control absorber in nuclear reactors.\r\n\r\nmy hypothesis:\r\n    1.)if these are e.T.S mabe they need to extract boron in order to strengthen their bone structures to counter the effects of space that cause bone loss. but why not just beam it up from a drug store?\r\n     \r\nin any case it is interesting to see this element show up due to the technological applications it is used for especially the nuclear, and ceramics fields as i believe they will both in the very near future be used by us (if not already) to create craft with the magnetic and electronic powerplant properties neccessary to conduct these flight charactoristics. \r\n\r\ni would love to hear back from you regaurding my thoughts and share some ideas.\r\nthis was based on ufo's

something caught my eye. over the oklahoma state agriculture fields there was this shape with three white lights. at first glance we thought it was a cell phone tower of some sort and as we got to looking there was no base so it wasnt a tower. the object had three white lights at the ends indicating that it was of a triangular shape. the object was approximately 100,yes 100 feet off the ground. i then drove onto a side dirt road that was parallel with the field it was over. as soon as we turned on the road it was like it jumped or skipped about 100 to 150 yards.We then pusued the object for

for a little party, and it was all coming to an end.  i cannot remember exactly who was there but there were several of us in my driveway when the sighting occurred.  as we all walked in the driveway, as members of my family were going to their cars we noticed lights coming over my house.  the craft floated slowly over the my house and coasted at a height that seemed low enough, to my young mind, that it was possible to pick up a rock and throw it in the air striking the underside of the craft.  there were three lights in each corner of the craft.  the craft seemed to form a perfect equilateral triangle with the lengths of the sides at approximately 40 ft long.  as i looked with my peripheral i searched for a rock and before i was able to pick up a rock that i found, in my driveway the craft moved slightly faster and within a few seconds it wa across the street and about 200 yards away.  when it reached a distance of about 400 yards away it ascended and went out of sight.  this all happened in a matter of 10 seconds.  the craft was utterly silent.  this was without a doubt the most terrifying moment in my life.  since that day i have been scared to go out into

house in full darkness observing the night sky. the milky way was visible, and numerous distinct stars. i saw a small meteorite streak & burn up. about 2 minutes later, a round glowing object about the size of a distant star moved across the sky very fast, high, and without a sound. it eminated a steady white light, but also rhythmically flashed red light as it moved from the sw to the ne in a straight trajectory very quickly.  then 1 to 2 minutes later, a large bright white object appeared from the sw and also moved very fast ne in a straight path which seemed to pursue the first object. it seemed to be several miles in altitude, but was fully at least 10 times brighter and larger in diameter than the brightest star. it too moved completely silently across the sky. my house is in the country, and except for 2 dogs barking in the distance, no sound was heard. this object definitely was not a satellite nor a plane. both objects seemed to take up a stationary position, in a triangular configuration with a star, in the nnw sky, perhaps 20 to 30 degrees elevation from horizon. the largest object continuously pulsated white, green, red, blue, as did the smaller object.  i watched for 10 minutes and then left the property.\r\n\r\nhave there been any other reports of these 2 anomalies?","distance":"Over One

and some friends went on a trip to denmark. a close friend (i'm going to call him john) told me (a few weeks before this happened) that he saw strange objects in the sky back in sweden. i believed him and got interested. so that night in denmark, me and john were the only ones awake. all my other friends were asleep so me and john decided to go to the beach wich was located less than 40 yards from our hotel. the main reason was to search for ufos, becaus john just had a feeling that something was going to show up in the sky. so we went down to the beach and stood there looking up in the sky for about 10 minutes. what happened after those 10 minutes was the wierdest thing that had ever happened to me. we saw a huge flash that lit up the whole sky and the whole beach. the flash just came from nowhere and the night literally became daylight for about 2 seconds and then everything went dark again. suddenly everything became even more interesting. i wasn't scared, i was amazed.\r\njohn had seen this flash three times before so he didn't react in any special way. he just told me to keep looking up in the sky. so we stood there again, looking at the same part of the sky and a few minutes after the flash a strange \"light ball\" appeared in the sky. we both saw it and reacted at the same time. i don't know how to describe the motions of the object in a good way, but it was almost as if the ball was going down towards the water. it went in a vertical direction. it's really hard to explain but i tried my best. anyways, the \"light ball\" went extremely fast from point a to point b in 1 second and then dissapeared. we continued looking up and we stood there for almost an hour before another \"light ball\" appeared again. but this time the distance between point a and point b was bigger, i mean the ball flew a longer distance before it dissapeared again and it flew in a vertical direction just like the earlier one. i couldn't see the actual shape of the object since the light coming from the object was very bright. i just saw the object like a ball-shaped thing. after this we stood on the beach for one hour but nothing happened. it was really cold outside so we went back to the hotel and went to bed. but believe me, if the was better we would sit there on the beach the whole night.\r\n\r\ni tried to explain everything as detailed as i could, i hope you understood me. i apologize for my bad english.\r\nthis is just half of the story. the reason why i don't want to tell you the whole story is becaus it's a really wierd story wich started more than a month before this event and the story is out of this world so i guess people wont believe me if i tell it. it's pretty sick, trust me you're not going to believe me. if you wanna hear the story anyways you can contact me on my email.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

early evening view. that is when i spotted a light that was not blinking -- unlike all the other flying objects i ever see over my house.\r\n\r\nthe light had somewhat of a floodlight appearance emanating from it (i could make out a vague funnel of light), but it flared out quite wide, it was not a focused beam/tight-funnel like a spotlight.\r\n\r\ni expected to hear some distinct engine noise as the light was brighter than the other air traffic. it's altitude was difficult to judge, but it was flying higher than normal local private plane and helicopter traffic, but seemed lower than airliners from/to columbus.\r\n\r\ni could not make out any shape, it was just a bright light. \r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and cloudless, the object was brighter than an airliner, and at one point from my vantage, it looked to pass below an airliner. the only sounds i heard were the distant rumble of airliners (no helicopter beating, or anything else out of the ordinary).\r\n\r\ni could see two airliners in the same portion of the sky when this object was visible. one airliner was heading n-nw towards columbus, the other was moving se away from columbus. this object was headed ne, moved in a
