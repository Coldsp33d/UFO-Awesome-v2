and no moon yet, sometime during january of 2008. i was leaving home and happened to look up to see if any jets were flying overhead (i feel i need to explain this habit. i love to fly in small aircraft, and came close to getting my license before a medical condition made it virtually impossible to do so. so most anything about flying even down to watching planes fly over has become a hobby) and noticed a jet flying overhead to the southwest. what caught my attention was the sound of the engines, louder than usual and leading me to think it might be a large passenger/cargo jet or maybe a military jet of some type. these planes just have a different sound to them than the smaller passenger jets that use the evansville airport, but its hard to explain. i got sight of the jet, and noticed a smaller orange ball of light in front of the jet, and it appeared the jet was following this orange light. i watched for maybe a couple of minutes, looked away for a second, and looked back. the orange light was gone, and the jet was making a turn to the right as if it were breaking off pursuit. the really odd things were i only heard noise from the jet, and when the jet made its turn, it made about a 270 degree turn and left the area in a southeasterly direction as if it was searching for something. recall that i said it initially was heading southwesterly. now why couldnt that pilot have just made a 90 degree turn and gone directly to the southeast instead of making almost a full circle before going the desired direction. this jet was low, enough for the engines to sound louder than normal, and i could tell it was low by the look of the strobe and clearance lights on the plane. i noticed that there were no strobe or clearance lights flashing on the orange ball. while watching this event i had no thoughts at all about what i might be seeing, but shortly after this incident i realized i had probably just seen my first ufo. i am thinking that the jet was probably some sort of military craft because passenger/cargo jets flying over the city are usually quite a bit higher and also they are keeping to a straight line course and not making a turn like i described. its hard to explain, but i just had that feeling about the jet. the reason i looked away for a second is that my neighbor had opened his door and walked out on his porch and i looked to see if he was looking my way, but he wasnt. the jet and orange ball were both going at a speed that when i turned back to look at them again, they both should have still been in sight, but the orange ball was gone and the jet was making its circular turn.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

old satellites re-entering the atmosphere. i believe it was friday afternoon 10-10-08 somewhere between maybe 14:45 and 16:45. i was on my front porch and observing the high flying jets that cross overhead daily here in evansville. i noticed a very bright whitish light moving slowly from an easterly direction to a southwesterly direction, apparently at very high altitude.  what was odd about this is that while i was watching this object, i also noticed jets flying in the same close area of the sky. while i could see the wings on the jets, i could see no wings on the bright object. i also noticed that the speed of the object relative to the jets was very slow. i am guessing it took maybe 4 minutes for this object to travel approximately a 60 degree field of view. neither the jets or the object were leaving any visible contrail.\r\n i have observed the shuttle/iss traveling overhead two different times, and it seems that this object was moving slower across the sky, but it was just as bright. one other thing, as this object moved towards the sun, it remained at the same brightness.\r\ni went inside my house to get a pair of small binoculars and was unable to find them so i went back out on my porch to try and locate this object again, but by that time it had passed from my view.\r\n i am wondering if this might have been space junk re-entering the atmosphere, the shuttle/iss going overhead (the two times i saw this the shuttle/iss was going in an easterly/southerly direction) or maybe the much blamed weather balloon. or could it have been something else? i am kind of ruling out a meteor as this object was going way too slow and not leaving any kind of trail.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

hours while watching a movie with my wife and children in our living room, my wife sees through the windows a large red light rising above the roof of a barn across the street.  she says ���look at the airplane there! that is a weird place for a plane���. i looked immediately and saw the object. the red light was not blinking and appeared as a steady glow. there were no other lights that i could discern. the red light appeared round and was rising at about a 15 degree angle to the roof of the barn. then it suddenly started ascending at a 70-90 degree angle of climb at a high rate of speed.  i immediately ran to get shoes while my daughter grabbed my coat.  my daughter and i then went onto the front balcony and watched as the red object continued to rise from about 1000 feet to an estimated 10,000 feet, where it then stopped motionless in mid-air for about one minute. there was absolutely no noise during its climb. when it stopped at its apex, it looked like a large red dot star sitting in the clear night sky filled with stars.  \r\n\r\nas we are watching this now motionless red light levitated in the sky, to our amazement, a second red lighted object appears over the roof of the barn. it was travelling south to east at a slightly climbing altitude of about 500 feet for approximately 5 seconds. i estimate that it was about one to two kilometers away (6/10th mile to 1.2 miles) from our house (and the barn roof)and looked as if it had risen from the valley near the town of wiesbach.  the second red light object was following the same path as the first object when it too suddenly shot up at a 70-90 degree angle at an exceptionally high rate of climb. i estimate the size of second object to be about the size of a single engine airplane. the lighted object was round (spherical) in appearance and glowing deep red.  note: my wife was watching the second red object from the living room.)\r\n\r\nmy daughter and i watched in amazement as the first red light just disappeared in a blink at very high altitude. meanwhile we are watching the second object follow the same course as the first object, except it climbed at a faster rate of speed than the first, as if it were trying to catch the first object.  again, absolutely no noise at all from this object.  the second red glowing object rose to what i would estimate was the exact same position and altitude as the first object. it did that in approximately 10-15 seconds.  it then stop in mid-air and seemed to take up the same position as the first object.  it remained absolutely motionless in the night sky for about 20-25 seconds.  just like the first object, it disappeared in a blink of an eye.  \r\n\r\nthese were definitely not fireworks, aircraft flares, rocket motors, parachute flares, slap flares or any military ordnance. there was absolutely no noise, no smoke or flame.  they followed truly unusual flight patterns and trajectories. these lights gained altitude at very high speeds and appeared as if they were not influenced by gravity or wind. the red glow appeared as an intense illumination, no sparks, no smoke trail, just a bath of red light shaped like a sphere.  the second lit object was large, as stated above, at least the size of a single engine aircraft or larger and was in clear view.  \r\n\r\nmy entire family witnessed the lights. everyone thought it was a very strange event.

���what���s that���, someone else said ufo, we looked at the glowing fire orange object for a second and i and another person scrambled for our cameras? it was flying rather low, it was going in one direction, in a single line, just like a plane would fly in one direction, but this definitely was not a plane, or anything that i could identify.  the 3 other people i was with had never seen anything like that before either, it flew almost over us, just to the side at little.  it flew in a straight line, it was glowing orange, almost like it was on fire, the object was only visible to us for 2 to 3 minutes, before it disappeared out of site, so it was moving a pretty steady speed.  the object did not make any kind of sudden movements or go up or down in any way, it just stayed on a steady & straight path.  this happened nov.23, 2008 @ around 9:15pm in valrico florida near the intersection of lumsden ave and mulrenna ave., in a neighborhood very close to that intersection, and it was traveling toward the direction of riverview when it disappeared or faded away from our vision, also, the object made no noise that we could hear.  i would say that it looked like a glowing orange fireball meteorite, that was being controlled to move in a straight & steady path, and it did not operate like a regular meteorite at all, this object operated like it was being driven or controlled by something.  i will included the pictures i took, but they do not show what i saw with the naked eye, the only camera i had was my cellphone camera, so my pictures did not turn out good, i will try to get copies of the other photos taken by the other person.  also, when we saw this object, there was no planes or helicopters anywhere near sight and then about 1 minute later after the sighting, there was a jet flying overhead way up high, heading to where the object had just been, so maybe this jet was dispatched to locate this object if calls were coming in before that (perhaps, or maybe it was just a regular pre-planned flight?(who knows), but the jet probably did not see the object because it was flying to where the ufo was, not where it went.  all 4 of us were pretty stunned, and using words to describe it like strange, crazy, weird, unbelievable. \r\nalso, another strange thing about me, other than seeing a ufo is i have a raw piece of moldavite that has a lot of images in it, both with the naked eye and also in photos.  one photo i must included in this ufo report is my photo of a typical looking grey alien in the moldavite, if anyone wants to see the rest of the moldavite pictures, let me know at email:  leonardos-kryptonite@live.Com and i will email them to you, i have a total of 18 photos of this piece of moldavite that shows images like, angels, fairies, demons, nostradamus, a viking, 3 aliens, a wizard, barrack obama, plus more.  and, i happened to have the crystal with me during this ufo sighting because i was going to show my friend the piece of moldavite and some photos i had printed out later on.  for those who are not familiar with moldavite, it is a green glass thought to be formed after a meteorite hit the earth and splashed stuff up in the atmosphere and then the green glass rained back to earth in the czech republic (or something like that).  also, it is the stone of the holy grail and also the crystal of ���extraterrestrial connection���.  google moldavite for more info about this crystal if you want.\r\nso later after the ufo was long gone, my friend looked at the moldavite and moldavite photo of the alien and we joked about maybe it was the piece of moldavite that attracted them.  i hardly ever take the moldavite out of my house, in fact, this was only the second time it has been out of my house since i've had it about 3 years now.  i decided that if they come back and want the piece of moldavite from me, i will give it too them, no questions asked (or maybe swap it for a vacation to their planet if their friendly enough).  it might just be \"their\" holy grail. (who knows)?\r\nwell, in summary, i feel very privileged to have finally seen my first ufo, i love watching pretty much all the paranormal programs on tv.  can't wait to see my first ghost now!\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

with a solitary flashing light, which flashes once every second or two, moving slowly from south towards the north, rearing up to pass me overhead. i'm not paying too much attention to it, i was too focused on driving, but my lady told me, \"check out that plane.\" at which point, i look up through my windshield, as it's about ten seconds before it could pass overhead of my car. i realize how low it is, it's only 50-100 feet(i'm terrible at estimating lengths) above us, this scares me, as i believe it's a dangerously low flying plane. when i look up however, and when the light flashed, i caught my first glimpse of the object. i said out loud, \"that's not an airplane.\" second flash of light, i can distinctly make out the shape, that of which i have never seen in my life, and i come from a family with a history in aviation. it was like a skeleton, just composed of bars/supports, possibly metallic, and it was two times, possibly three times, larger than my car. the light flashed from the center of the object, and i could not see anything except for the supports/bars that composed the structure, no i'm not sure where anyone could possibly pilot the object from. it was silent, it didn't interrupt my radio signal, it flew right overhead, and there were many people on the state road who could of, but probably did not take any notice of the object at all. i kept driving, because there was nothing i could have been able to do, i had left my camera in bloomington. (oh was i furious. haha.) my lady and i just kept talking about how strange the aircraft was, and she kept watching it as i kept driving, she said it eventually stopped moving north, and started moving straight up into the night sky. she lost sight of the beast as the drive continued. she was convinced it was some kind of ultralight aircraft, but it was so much larger, and there was nothing attached to the structure, like a glider or anything. originally i thought the object was triangular or pyramidal shaped, but it was so large and i only got to see the front half of it, so there could be much more to the back end than i realized. when i came home, i told my father all about this aircraft, and he could not think of a similar object he's ever seen in the air. so i did some research of my own, and the only thing i can come up with that is similar looking, strikingly similar, but i believe a bit larger, is the lunar landing research vehicle. i believe that's what it's called, but for your sake i will attach a picture to this report, so nobody has to go out google searching.

brilliant  illumination  of  coloured  lights  less  than  quarter  a  mile  away. the  road  i  was  travelling  on  (the  a47) was  unaturally  lacking  traffic, the  time  was  approaching  2045, the  normal  time  i  usually  reached  this  part  of  the  road  system. i  first  observed  on  closer  inspection, now  only  yards  away.  a  object  quite  static  and  settled  upon  the  field  to  my  right. i  instictively  slowed  the  post-office  vehicle  down  to  a  stop  and  looking  through  the  drivers  side-window  saw  the  following,, { now  some  25ft  away)  a  cage  shaped  multi-coloured  highly  luminous  object. about  8ftsquare. there  was  a very  noticeable  sequence  of  lights  rotating  around  its  bars..And  they  pulsated  in  green\\blue\\red  fashion, that  is  to  say  each  independent  bar  on  this  cage-formation  turned  on  and  off  at  great  speed. at  this  point  i  decided  to  take  a  closer  look. after  releasing  the  foot-security door-lever  i  pulled  the  door  open  and  stepped  out. again  :supisiously: there  was  no  car  movement  moving  up  or  down  this  a47  road, there  was  no  audible  sound  whatsoever. i  proceeded  across  towards  the  fields  fence  so  was  then  approx  18 or  twenty  feet  from  this  :object?: my  right  eye  was  smarting  terribly  and  i  needed  to  rub  it  to  move  the  blur  from  my  sight. i  stopped  unafraid  and  observed. there  was  no  top  or  bottom  to  this  object  just  the  rotating  bars  around  its  cubed  form. it  was  roughly  8ftsquare. the  lights  had  dimmed  or  i  imagined  they  had, again  no  sound  just  colour. after  perhaps  two-mins  the  craft? rose  upward,  again  without  sound. it  ascended  to  forty  feet  and  then  dissapeared, as  though  into  a  time-corridoor. the  weather  conditions  were  perfect. no  clouds  clear  wonderful  night  sky. the  craft\\object  did  not  ascend  up  into  the  heavens, i  watched  it  de-materialise. for  a  moment  i  collected  my  thoughts  then  returned  back  to  my  van.Still  there  was  no  traffic. i  resumed  a  steady  drive  to  kings  lynn  sorting  office  and  said  nothing  to  no  one  about  the  experience.
