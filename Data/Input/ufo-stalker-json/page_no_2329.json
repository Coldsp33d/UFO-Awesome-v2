houses and they don't tend to stay up late.\r\nthe light was too big and was changing direction too swiftly to be a 'plane or helicopter. there was no sound from it. also, it was over a plain. my house is up a hill and i could see there was nothing below causing the light, plus it was behind clouds. the light moved from side to side and backwards and forwards a few times, but my dog had done his business then so i went back inside, unsure if i shoud do anything.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

work, and at around 10:15 pm i spotted an object that i cannot identify, so i am filing this report. i believe it was probably a meteorite or meteor, but as you will see below it does not fully fit into this category.\r\n\r\ni work in ft. myers, florida, and live in cape coral, about a 10 mile drive from work to home. i take a back route most of the way,, which is dark, with very few  street lights. all of a sudden i noticed a bright light going up from my right to high overhead, in front of me. my first thought was that someone was setting off fireworks, and this is indeed what it looked like at first. when fireworks are first ignited and shot off, they can ascend with a bright light and with a little wobbly motion. then they burst when they reach a certain peak. well this light started out like that, a bright light ascending, with the little wobbly motion like fireworks. however, when it reached a peak, instead of bursting into a fireworks display, it shot straight across the sky at very high speed flaming or flaring up as it went, as a meteorite would burning up in the atmosphere. then it went out and disappeared.\r\n\r\nso it appeared to be going up at first, then across the sky accelerating to a very high speed. i am not a pilot or very familiar with height or speed, but even when it appeared to level out and shoot across the sky, it really didn���t seem to be very high up in the atmosphere at all. this is one of the inconsistencies with the meteor theory. the other inconsistency, of course, is that it appeared to be going up at first, maybe from the ground.\r\n\r\nin short, i don���t know what this was, but i was looking in the paper and listening to the radio for reports or a meteor or an unidentified flying object in my area for that night. i haven���t heard anything, but i am sure of what i saw. the sky was clear, and anyway it was low enough to be under any clouds that did exist. if anyone else saw anything in this area on that night, i would like to hear about it. also, and this may be way off base, the next night there were several large helicopters flying around the area at the same time, and in the same general area.

heard.  the second object appeared to be much higher than the first. the first object was slightly less brilliant than the planet venus which was also still visible.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

were moving very slowly, approx. east to west, traveling directly across the flight path to bradley international airport. \r\n\r\nwhen i first saw these lights i was driving north on route 10 & 202, and noticed them to my right. i made a right down wilcox street to get a better view and realized at that point there was something extremely anamolous about them, so i stopped and was able to watch them in a parking lot for a few minutes. they were moving very, very slowly. the light furthest to the east blinked out, and seconds later a jet liner was gliding in to bradley! by then the other two were well out of its way, however, the people seated on the left side of the jetliner would have had an excellent look what i was seeing.\r\nthey were quite larger and brighter than stars, no comparison, pulsating blue/white light. they were not helocopters, since, 1.There was no noise, and, 2.There was no flashing red and green light which would have been absolutly required that close to the airport.\r\n\r\nin conclusion i grew up near the airport and have been watching planes and helocopters all of my life. i have seen military choppers flying in formation before, but military craft (blackhawks and chinooks around here) are really friggin' loud, and these afore mentioned craft were silent. i have also observed satelites, which are slightly brighter than stars to my knowledge, and move a bit more rapidly than what i witnessed. these were far brighter and, well, odder, than anything i have witnessed in my 44 years. goodnight and good luck. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" me and my roommate went camping for 1 night on the altamaha river. we were at a sandbar near powerlines about 2 miles from altamaha regional park in everett ga. we had fished for a few hours on the river, and headed back to the sanbar at dusk. shortly after the sun was completely down,and we had a beautiful view of the heavens. this is my favorite place to camp because its fairly remote; you can see planets , galaxies, everything the night sky has to offer. i have camped here, along with my roommate, for years, probably since 1999. we have observed tons of meteors and have done a lot stargazing in the past, but weve never seen anything unusual until last night. after arriving at the sandbar we made a fire, and i baited and rod and casted it out. as i was setting my rod in a holder in the sand, i noticed a light, bluish, similiar to a star, travelling over the treeline on the other side of the river at a very high rate of speed, horizontaly. i told my roommate to watch it while i grabbed a pair of high end binoculars. i could not make out a shape as this object was very far away. we passed the binoculars back and forth, and watched the object travel west to east for about 2-5 minutes, then it suddenly dissapeared. i knew immediatley that it wasnt a plane because it had no flashing lights. from this sandbar u can look through binoculars and almost make out the lights in the windows on passenger planes flying at night. after several minutes had passed, me and the roommate were talking excitedly, as this was our first-ever sighting and we were pretty freaked out, i observed another object exactley the same but coming from the south to the north. i pointed it out to my roommate and we watched it travel overhead for about 3 mins. it dissapeared over the treeline in front of us. several minutes later we watched yet another come overhead from west to east, same star like qualities as the others, and dissapear suddenly. i was pretty freaked out and told myself not to look up at the sky anymore, because i was having fealings of wanting to leave, but i didnt want to ruin our trip. i threw a cast iron skillet on the fire and cooked a burger. after eating, about 30 mins later, i layed on my back in the sand next to the fire, and looked up into the sky for awhile. the stars were very bright. suddenly, a bright starlike object just appeared in the sky overhead. i jumped up and ran down to the water and stared at it for about 10 seconds with my roommate. it was still for a moment, then it.. i can only describe it as blasting off, it flared white light intensly and accelerated at what had to be the speed of light vertically. gone just as quick as it had appeared. over the course of 20 mins we saw 2 more starlike objects appear, travel south to north for maybe 2 or 3 mins and dissapear instantly without a flash or any noise.These 2 were 1 after the other, not simultaneously. i must have watched too many x-files episodes growing up, because at this point i was terrified. my roommate was too. these objects were very high up, and posed us no threat, but they seemed so unnatural. ive obsereved hundreds of meteor showers from this sandbar, for years i have stared into this portion of the sky and have never seen anything like this. me and the roomie decided to hit the tent about 8pm. we were ready to just go to sleep and not see anything else. the temp was about 35 degrees, so sleep didnt come easy. i woke up around 9pm and just layed there wide awake for a while. around 10 pm i was really cold and couldnt sleep, so i got outta the tent and got the fire going again. as soon as the flames caught and the fire got big, my roommate came running outta the tent saying i was a lifesaver. no less than a minute later i looked over the river at the horizon, and saw an object orange to red in color. my roommate described it as orange or red, but flashing, or changing color. this one was like a disc or cigar, too far to make out a clear shape, but a whole lot closer than the other objects. this one really scared me. it travelled slower than the others, but still very fast horizontily over the treeline. it would dip, or go down behind the treeline then come back up over the trees, but still travelling horizontily. it dissapeared out of thin air after about 6 mins. i laid by the fire for a while just pondering what  i had seen. that night we saw one more starlike object travel overhead, very fast from west to east. not too long after that objet had dissapeared, i pointed to a clearing across the river in the treeline to show my roommate a falling star. but before the words even came out of my mouth, the object took on an s shaped path to the ground; it sorta snaked left then right. that was enough for me. i went to the tent and refused to come out until the sun came up. i didnt want to see anymore. i tried to take pictures and video of all these objects, but i had borrowed the camera the day before and didnt know how to set the night vision. throughout that evening we had observed aircraft flying overhead. the objects we saw werent comparable in any way to a plane; the majority of them were faster and brighter but farther away. we did hear the occasional roar of a jet, and saw some planes flying, but we heard nothing immediatley before, during, and after we had seen these objects.","distance":"20 Feet or

driving towards the oxford valley mall on oxford valley rd coming up to the trenton rd intersection (an open field then a seven eleven in the distance are on my passenger side).  as i was driving down oxford valley rd i couldn���t help but notice lights in the horizon to my passenger side.  what seemed at first it could have just been a helicopter, as my driving slowed down and the ufo got closer, i continued to dismiss it by thinking���  well, it is too big to be a helicopter, it must be an airplane.  it was just too obvious to believe it was a ufo.  this night on 11/20/08, it was cloudy skies, with light snow early in the evening.  at the time of this sighting it was about 7:50pm, and the craft was low enough to not be covered by any of the low clouds, that is how low the craft was, making it very visible in the sky as if it belonged there.   as it approached i realized it was shaped like a triangle, with a white light on each of the points of the triangle, a very clearly viewed blue light shaped like a ring in the center that was illuminating in and out as if the hole in the center of the ring was opening and closing with this blue light, and there was some possible other small lights at some point but was hard to make out because of the frequent movement of the ufo.  as i realized it was a triangle shaped object with lights on it, it became hard for me to dismiss what i was seeing as anything else but a ufo. the only craft i know i can compare it to is the stealth fighter, but stealth fighters do not have lights on them.  as my car is now coming to a halt in the middle of oxford valley rd, and as other cars continued to drive on by making it hard to hear anything other than the cars���  i finally realized one final detail that i cannot explain!  the way this thing moved!  the points of the triangle twisted and turned, flipped and flopped, left to right, and back and forth in every which direction, but never the same direction in a row; this movement wasn't fast, but was continuous.  a stealth fighter i can only imagine would fly straight.  while this object flew in one direction, its three points moved in many directions while the ufo seemed to slowly glide across the sky like it belonged there.  to go back for a moment, when it became most obvious what this was; the center point of the triangle was pointing up towards the sky and the blue lit center was facing out, not so much straight down... seconds later its center point of the triangle was facing straight down, then another change and for a moment i didn���t notice a blue light, then the next move the center point was flying straight like a normal stealth fighter would, with the blue centered light facing down towards the ground. the ufo had three points with white lights, and what seemed to be a solid black metallic triangle shape, with an obvious blue lit center that was illuminating. i could see how others would drive on by, as my first thoughts was it can't be a ufo, even when it started becoming more convincing, i couldn't imagine it grabbing people's attention as everyone rushed around in the cold, music on in the car, kids or friends to be distracted by. it was so obvious that people wouldn't believe what they were seeing anyway.  me on the other-hand, i was by myself, was in no rush, and had no distractions. \r\n\r\nwhile all this started to settle in as it almost seemed for a minute time stood still, it didn���t freeze long enough, as i realized it was moving away and that i had no proof of what i seen.  i thought quickly of possible jumping out of my car and making a big seen to grab other drivers attention by pointing in the sky, but a safe instinct jumped in mind and i quickly pulled my car into the seven eleven parking lot on trenton rd and oxford valley rd in langhorne, pa; where i jumped out my car and finally took out my camera phone.... then i thought there is no point of trying to take a picture and miss the last seconds of this move off towards my left into the far horizon��� it was just too late; the only image i would have had would have been a distant blur of lights.\r\n\r\ni immediately called family members, and when i later arrived home still shocked of this night���s event as i still am now hours later, i began searching on the internet for bucks county ufo, to see if there were any other witnesses to what i saw.  what i have found is that there has been much activity in my area over the last few months, it has even been broadcasting on the local news.  all of this was kind of a relief as at least i know i am not the only one who witnesses something unusual.  but the most important video is the following link  http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=kfiqvrshpyk  this video is supposedly from my area of bucks county, but wherever it is from, it is real! this is exactly what i seen tonight, except this video was said to have been captured on october 14th.  tonight���s date is november 11th, and i swear on all i have to offer in life i never seen anything like this before, and knowing what i saw was a true ufo��� alien or not, it is something very odd and this video is it!  is the government testing some new craft in this area?  either way i sure am very interested in watching the skies all the time now.  i do believe my view was better than this video and i saw it a little closer, but this video is real as i am a witness to this exact craft in clear sight. \r\n\r\nplease also see this video from october 8th, just a few miles south of me in the city of philadelphia.  it was in the middle of the day, but you can clearly see how there are three lights.  what most people may think that they are separate objects, but seeing what i saw tonight and how this thing moves, these lights are one triangle object moving in many directions.

difference between the star like objects i seen compared to what a your usual planes look like. it all begin just by me looking up into the sky, and gazing at all the stars that were out. there were abunch of them. excellent visibility so there was no way that i would have missed these objects due to clouds. the first one i seen was just cruising from the south to the north direction heading toward the red river. the object did not exzibit intelligent behavior. it went in a straight path just like a plane or jet would do, but it looked just like a star moving across the sky. no blinking lights at all! the object was not a shooting star, because if it was a shooting star i woudn't have been able to observe the object for 3 minutes and 15 seconds. this is exact time. from when i first seen this object i started counting from when i seen it until i lost sight of it. not to much longer after i seen the first star like object i seen another identical object heading the same direction as the first. the difference between the times were about 5 minutes. this object did the same exact maneuvers as the first object did. really no differences except that the second object i seen was a little smaller than the first. i could only observe the second object fro about 45 seconds. they went out of my sight when they got to out of my viewing range. nothing like what i seen with my friend

this earth.It glided with ease, i ran out onto the street to watch it fly over the city. it was so smooth and fast, going south over the city.\r\n\r\nmy feeling where of excitement, and fascination, my employee saw it fly over his home around the same time as i described. he chased after it down the street , pointing and getting people to look up at this ship. but the strange thing is that no one would look up. the object just kept on moving straight until i lost sight of it.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13878,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.04732,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-11212008-0017","longitude":-114.0480622,"occurred":1218861900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Alberta","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1218861900000,"summary":"This

orangish light, coming very slowly towards me, from a southeasterly direction. this didn't surprise me. i always look at the stars, especially in colder months and always noticed that many planes fly from that direction, over my house. i threw my garbage away and was headed back into the house when i noticed it rise up a bit higher. this is when i realized that it was a lot closer than i had first thought.\r\n   then i noticed it getting closer and now i could see a larger, dark mass behind the light. it was ann odd shape. conical in the front, sqaurish and flat in the back, similar to pictures of a space shuttle. i knew it was something out of the ordinary. it flew, very slowly overhead. it was so low that i could see lights from the nearby exxon mobile station reflected off of it. the thing that really surprised me was that it made no sound whatsoever, as it continued over my head and slowly dissapeared over the tree line.\r\n   you know when you see something that is out of the ordinary because your heart speeds up and your hair stands up. \r\n   this didn't scare me, it just was a bit unsetteling. but i have seen strange things like that a few times before in my life. i grew up in acme on a hill and seen ufo's three times before. one of them being what looked like a star, only it moved and stopped directly over me and two other people i was watching stars with. we ran. we were teenagers. i think it is great that more people are coming out about witnessing these things, whatever they are. now when you say you've seen something, people chime in with their own stories instead of telling you you're crazy.\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line

2:00 in the morning and i seen a white light pulsing in the tree. it was pulsating very slowly off and on. there is nothing that i can think to explain that. \r\n\r\nabout two or three years ago, i again woke up (around 3:00am)and looked out my bedroom window and there was this very, very bright star just hanging in the sky. just as i thought \"wow that is a bright star\" it moved below to an angle, so i thought \"that was just my imagination\", immediately after that thought it angled off obove again. then it started pulsating i believe red and green (could have been blue) colors and moving quickly (while pulsating colors) up, down and sideways with my thoughts. i felt as if it was reading my mind. i panicked and ran downstairs with my husband and hid under the blankets. during this peroid of time (months), i recall my husband was outside getting ready for work (around 5:00am) and he came in and said \"i just seen a huge owl in the back yard\". probably a coincedence!? the neighbor reported seeing an owl too. i never have. we live in a city.\r\n\r\nsince then i've once heard a tapping on my window (someone would need a ladder to do that)as i feel asleep watching tv. i woke up to it and i thought \"that was my imagination\". i dozed off again and the tapping started again. it sounded like a strong finger going \"thump, thump, thump\" (definitely wanting my attention). i awoke then this loud fire cracker bang noise came from the window too. this time my little dog ran to the window barking like crazy. i was relieved that it wasn't just in my head.\r\n\r\ni hear tapping in my room at night. i have a computer desk next to my bed and i hear like someone is tapping a pencil on my desk. \r\n\r\nas a child (9-10 years old) on july 4th (late 70's) we were outside lighting fireworks and all of a sudden this ball of light about the size of a tennis ball shoots at us (about the hieght of street light) and just sits there in the sky. my family was amazed, we thought someone threw a firework towards us and we were waiting for it to explode. it never did. it stood there while we continued lighting the fireworks (i felt like it was observing us). i didn't take my eyes off it while everyone was working on the fireworks. when the fireworks were done everyone just got bored with the light and went inside. i couldn't believe they would just go in when something so exciting was just watching us. i finally went in after because it wouldn't leave the sky and.\r\n\r\ni have so many more stories that i'm confusing as being paranormal or something more ufo/alien/abduction. my mother grew up in the san luis valley of colorado and has stories of fireballs in the sky. seeing lights in her room, a lot of weird things. i'm wondering if any of this is heredity. \r\n\r\nwe lived in haunted apartment (or was it?). i would kind of like some direction with all this.\r\n\r\nany suggestions or feedback would be greatly

season. you might note, that i have reported 1 previous sighting, which took place in 1981 and 2 recent sightings, one of them viewed by my husband.  i have several past sightings, starting from 1969 to present.  i have one very recent sighting to report, which i will post later, as it occurred in a different location and time period.\r\nthis sighting took place near wichita falls, tx, which is home to shepperd air force base.  date was sometime in the first months of 1969. i was with my boyfriend, the time was about an hour or so, after sunset.  it was fairly cold, totally clear weather.  we were just out and about, cruising around in the countryside.  quite suddenly, tom stopped the car and said, \"did you see that?\"  i had.  it was a bright, star-like object, which had streaked across the sky from the w/sw to e/se, in a flat trajectory.  the flight was much like an f16, only a whole lot faster.\r\nas we watched the night sky, we were situated to the north, looking south.  the object had come to a near stop in the e/se portion of the sky. it suddenly made a 90 degree turn to the south, then another 90 degree to the west and shot back across the sky from whence it came, disappearing in the distance.  this happened all in a matter of about 5 seconds.  then as tom and i continued to watch the sky in awe and silence, 4 more objects appeared in the w/sw, from the horizon. they streaked across the sky together and stopped just to the e/se of us, almost exactly where the first object had stopped.  from our vantage point, approx. 70 degrees above the se horizon and almost exactly where the first object had stopped.  they made several zigzag movements, all 90 degree angle turns, then the objects proceeded to the east at tremendous speed, disappearing in the far distance.  i might add that the terrain around wichita falls is fairly flat and at that time, the area we were in was all farm and ranch land.  we both had a clear view of the entire sky.  i recall no other aircraft in the sky.  both sightings lasted a totally of possibly 15 seconds.\r\ntom and i sat there in complete silence for several minutes.  we then looked at each other and began asking out loud, \"what the heck was that?\"  we both agreed that neither of us could identify these bright objects, so they must have been \"ufos\".  we were not scared at the time, only baffled and curious to try to understand what we had witnessed. \r\nlater that evening i told my mother about the incident.  she just nodded and said, \"exciting, isn't it?\"  evidently my mother had witnessed such things before and had never talked about it.  i can understand that.  when i mention i have see something odd in the sky, most people roll their eyes and look at me like i've lost my mind.  however, there has been exceptions and a few have told me they witnessed similar sights.  also, i would like to mention that the last time i spoke to tom was over 20 years ago.  i do not know where he is, or how to contact him but maybe he too, remembers that night.\r\nend report.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path
