them to finish. after lighting the cigg, i looked up at the beautiful sunset and noticed a bright light in the sky. at first i thought it was a star but as i stared at it i also noticed that is was making a beeline in my direction. it looked like one very bright orb. i followed it with my eyes as it flew over me and my house quietly. i turned back towards the sunset again and i saw another orb coming towards me. it looked exactly like the first one. i jumped up and opened my front door and yelled out to my daughter to bring me my phone. by the time she brought it to me, the second one was gone. my son and boyfriend came outside also. as i was explaning to them what i saw and where, a third one showed up. i open my phone and started recording. i followed it with my phone not moving my feet and when it was directly above me the orb like light turned off and the surface became solid black. it stayed black untill it flew over my house. i stopped recording thinking there was not any more. i turned and lookd in the direction they al came from and lo and behold there was one more. i started recording again and followed it as i did with the third. this time the orb like light stayed on the whole time. i stayed for about 5 more minutes to see if there were any more and there wasnt. i left out to eat with my family after the incident. i didnt do anyhing with the video convincing myself that i did not see a ufo and it had to be something else. then i forgot about it for about 2 months. one night i had a bon fire at my house and told my friends about the incident. they didnt believe me so i showed them the video. everyone was convinced that it is a ufo in the video. so i've decided to report it so it can be investigated because i would really like to know if i actually saw and caught a ufo on video!! i would rather not upload my videos online untill i find out if it is legit.

inside and grabbed my binoculars and ran back on the porch.I observed an absolutely huge \"space craft\" bigger than most football/sports stadiums.The craft was at least a 1000 meters wide and even longer.As it moved towards me it appeared to be moving forward in pulses.But when it passed over me it no longer appeared to be pulsing forward but was moving quickly and normally. there was a blue light or rod that extended for 200 yards in front of the craft.There were two reddish lights pointing forward set 500 meters from the center of the craft.There was no noise.The craft was very low around 10,000 feet,way too low for something that size to be seen normally.The rear of the craft was an elongated diamond shape with two huge white lights that might have been exhaust vents.They were 50 yards wide and between 300-500 yards apart!There was a row of flashing white lights that blinked and moved around the two rear large white lights.The entire craft had a deep dark blue-purple hue to it.There was a row of flashing lights around the upper and lower rear rim of the craft that were constantly changing colors from one part of the spectrum to another every half second.The entire craft was inside some kind of distortion field that completely blocked out the stars behind it as it passed over me. the distortion field extended far to each side in a gull wing(stuka)shape.To either side of the craft but inside the distortion field were two red balls of light that were not visually connected to the craft.I watched it with binoculars for about 20 seconds and got clear views of it and i immediately wrote up the sighting in my written journal so i would not forget the details as i would never believe something so big and silent could exist!\r\n\r\nabout 10 minutes after the craft passed over my house,i observed 3 or 4 military aircraft flying the same flight direction of the giant craft but at a lower altitude.Earlier that night at 11:30 pm there was a bright white

dslr,1/2000, iso 400, f8, at full 300mm, shooting specs. i was shooting the nellis afb airplanes coming in for a landing. i was looking north as some airplanes come straight down the vegas blvd to do 2 180 degree turns  and land at nellis, there was about 22 planes in this group. at about plane 18, i kept looking north down the blvd and spotted a light coming behind and out of the clouds. there were a few cloud banks in the area and i began to shoot, even if i couldn't see it, i still kept shooting, i managed to get 10 shots off in 10 or 15 seconds. i recorded a image on 9 out 10. the ufo is to far away,about 2 miles to say what it was. it was like a bright light, but when i blew it up, it looked like a smokey goldfish cracker. i blew it up to about 200 percent and it looked like a cloud of circular smoke. i probably don't have the best equipment to say what it was. and with so few pixels, well we don't have enough solid evidence other than it descending path, which can be calculated by time to say, yes this was a ufo. but the object started up at 1000 ft and pulled a 45 degree descent. and than just and disappeared. as the last frame shows it covered some distance really quickly that's why i was determined to just shoot blindly.  my feelings,, about the object, well i never believed that i have a chance to see a ufo. i knew it wasn't a airplane. the object just vanished after loosing cloud cover. it was over in 10 seconds or so. i looked at my time and it never clicked over 216pm while taking these photos. hopefully there is a tenths counter that some one can look in my data field and find out what the actual time, than you could get the speed. enjoy. for sure we are not alone. i sure hope this wasn't a airplane. there were all sorts of jets flying today. but a jet on its own, well could be, but they usually travel in pairs. who knows.

window seat. the sky appeared clear to the naked eye so i was unaware of the unusual concentric rings nor did i see the shar of bright white light above the tail wing of a parked aircraft during taxi on the runway. \r\n\r\nwhen i got to my hotel later that day, i started leafing through my pictures and picked up on these strange circular cloud formations. as i stared at the picture, i noticed the shar of light below the concentric cloud rings. my feeling is that this is a shockwave of energy seen only through my cell phone camera similar to when a space shuttle re-enters earth's atmosphere and breaks through the sound barrier. it seems like an unitdenfied flying object remained invisible as it either took off or re-entered near the denver airport. \r\n\r\nthe other picture shows dark concentric rings and gray distortions in the sky that look like smudges of light smoke. the distortions seem to lead back toward the mountains in the distance. the two pictures were taken within one minute of each other. note: if you compress the second photo, the dark concentric rings and gray smudges seen below are easier to see.\r\n\r\nif someone were to follow the exact taxi of my aircraft that day, the airport and/or satilite imagery might reveal more footage to corroborate this unusual camera incident. there should be ample airport security cameras that should have captured both ground/air traffic as well as weather conditions on that day. good luck!","distance":"Over One
