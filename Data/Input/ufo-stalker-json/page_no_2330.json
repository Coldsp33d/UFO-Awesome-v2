make sure my dogs were not going to wrestle too hard, and then looked forward satisfied that they were being good.\r\ni didn't notice it out of the corner of my eye at all, because the craft was just above swedish medical center, which has a bunch or red lights, because they have (it seems) constant helicopter traffic (flight for life).\r\nanyway i looked and saw this craft going maybe 5 miles an hour, like it was letting it self drift a little, and then within a couple seconds it zoomed off to the south. i was able to see it leave, but it was so fast, that if i would've blinked at the time, i might have only seen a trail of red light, hence the reason the picture of it in my head is kinda blurry.\r\nwhen i first noticed it, i thought it was the previously mentioned hospital's red lights, but no longer than a second later, there was no  doubt in my mind that it was unidentifiable, and i realized that i could not see a single light from the hospital, from where i was standing.\r\nit was a right triangle, from what i could see (meaning there was a 90 degree angle in it). it was faced south the entire time, and the lights were on the right angle sides that was the leading point.\r\nit happened so fast, that i could not count the lights, and in my memory they kinda blend together, since 2 out of the three seconds i saw it, it was moving faster. it had to have been no more than 300' above swedish.\r\nalso, it was really dim, i mean it would not have had light reflecting on any surface, i'd guess, but it was bright enough to make the reddish color glow..Kinda.  it's hard to explain.\r\ni was not scared at all, just amazed. i was filled with excitement shortly after, but i am proud to say that my emotions don't get in the way of doing what needs to be done (thinking on my feet, and making the best decisions, in very little time), so i was in the moment, and had no thought or feeling about it, until it was gone, and then i was amazed.\r\ni lost sight of it as it left going south, and from what i could tell, was aimed at the horizon, so i could not see it after a second or two, because of my neighbor's house blocking my vision.\r\ni stayed there, and didn't even move my head (for about a minute), so i could gauge where it was, and what direction it took off, and after i collected my thoughts, and went over what had just happened, i walked fast to the east, to see if i could see it around the house, , but i knew it was going to be gone already(judging by the speed it left), and it was nowhere to be seen. if i had been up higher, i might have been able to see it, but the hospital blocks my vision of the south horizon.\r\nthe picture i drew is not to my liking, but i am tired of working on it, and it's close enough. i just want to say that the lights were more separated than in the picture. i estimate the craft to be about 100-200' wide. and, it was lower than i drew, i could see all of it, but it was closer to the house, than i drew, and was bigger in comparison to the house, than i drew.\r\ni included a picture of where i was standing, at the best angle i could get to show you where i was.\r\ni wanted to be very thorough, so if you (internet readers) made it to the end of this report, then thank you for your time!\r\nany further questions are welcome, from any sincere person(s).\r\nthanks,\r\ndestiny","distance":"101-500

popular  estate, noticed  approx  quarter  mile  away  a  very  large  silver  star {four  points ] just silently  commanding  the  night  sky, which  by  the  way  in  dec  was  absolutely  void  of  cloud  or  haze, crisp  clear  night. i  looked  at  my  watch  time  was  as  indicated 2345, there  was  no  other  traffic  so  slowed  van  down  to  a  standstill. after  switching  off  the  engine  and  winding  down  the  drivers  side  window  i  commenced to  get  a  better  look  at  this  strange  silent  star. after  perhaps  two  mins  the  star  vanished, not  unlike  the  quickness  of  a  illuminated  light  bulb  suddenly  switched  off , still  there  was  no  traffic  and  no  percievable  noise  or  inquisitive  sightings  from  any  one  else. for  perhaps  a  minute  i  strained  my  eyes  in  the  night  sky  to  identyfy  anything  which may  have  been  a  repercussion  of  this  star. suddenly  i  was  rewarded,and  dare  i  say  it, not  in  anyway  frightening  i  observed  the  following  now  some  eighty  feet  above  me.. i  observed  an  oval  shaped  craft  some  thirty  feet  long  with  a  misshapen  type  of  dome  some  eight  feet  high  upon  its  upper  surface. the  colouring  was  very  distinct, kind  of  a  rusty  red  colour, like  metal  after  it  had  undergone extreme  tempertures. the  base  of  the  oval  craft  was  also  very  definable  showing  a  number  of  exhaust-ports  rather  than  lights, which  began  to  intensify  as  the  craft  negotiated  what  i  percieve  was  a  portal,a  gateway  to   inner-space. please  take  note.. this  craft  was  moving  uncannily  slow  four-five  mls  per  hour  in  earthly  terms. directly  in  front  of  the  oval  craft  immediately  as  the  orange  ports  rotated  a  \"doorway\"  was  created  by  some  release  of  unknown  energy. twas  not  unlike  watching  this  craft   dissapearing  behind  a  shaking  mirror  in  space, for  please  remember  the  night  sky  was  crisp  and  clear. again  because  i  have  also  been  privy  to  other  close  encounters  i  would  say  i  was  not  afraid  either  before  seeing  the  star  and  craft  nor  after. there  is  little  phenomena  of  this  kind  that  actually  could  frighten  me. after  returning  back  home  i  drew  strange  pictures  of  alien  orighns, perhaps  even  dimensional entitys.It  is  my  perception  as  a  psyche  that  the  star  first  sighted  was  not  a  star  but  a  portal  opening  within  two  space  times. i  always  have  and  always  will  be  available  for  stringent  tests, scrutiny  to  prove  the  validity  of  this  sighting  and  a  few  others,   ","distance":"21-100

it all on video. to see it with the naked eye, it doesnt seem to move but on the video it dances around, goes out then comes back on brighter. it is like a sphere with multi colors. on the video you can see something at the bottom of the light that looks to me like the top of a spaceship.It happened around 11:00 p.M. but was later the next couple of nights. we watched and videoed it for three nights straight. it stayed there for about 1 to 2 hrs. each night. there are three other witnesses besides me. my sister says it was never there before that time and hasn't come back as far as she knows. but here husband gets up early for work and they go to bed early. maybe she has just missed it. spencer, wva. is in the middle of nowhere. there are no industries or military bases there where we saw it, in fact there was nothing except trees. i would love to know what it is. i have tried and tried to get someone to listen but they wont.This was filmed about a year ago and i have been

dragon's. after shaking hand's both team's seperated and huddled on the side line's of wilder feild wadell park niles, oh. at that point the crowd got suddenly quiet and started pointing and looking directly up above the center of the football feild. about one hundred feet above the light's was a ufo disk shaped object motionless and no noise coming from object. at that point parent' started to pull there family's off the feild toward's the car's in a hurry also many of them scared. as i and other's were looking up across the street at the same height was a second ufo object of the same shape and size. they had white light's probally 3'x4' rectangular shaped circling around the edge of the two object's. i was the last person on the feild as i had to retrieve some football gear for my coach mr. al cirrello and mr. reggie giancola, also a few of my fellow player's. i ran directly under the object while keeping an eye on the ufo the whole time. my coach told me to \"hurry up and get up over here and go turn the main light switch for the feild off\" which was alway's standard proceedure. the object's were still sitting in the same spot's in the air. we then waited for everyone to leave the feild, then we got into the van and proceeded to pull out of the parking lot and onto exit road. we turned left and pulled over to the side of the \"bowl\" which was known as the practice feild. out of all that time the two object's had not yet began to move or make any kind of noise for about 20 minute's. are coaches said \"let's stay here and see what happen's\" they also said \"that you boy's may never see anything like this again\". \"we are older and have never seen except heard of something like this\". then the one ufo came acrossed the road and postioned itself right next to other one still never making any kind of sound. within a couple of second's they took off toward's the city of niles. only leaving a light trail then in too different direction's they made unbelievable different turn's and dissapeared. there was an art class from our high school, niles mckinley the teacher mr. bertolenni of which his student's were at stevens park that evening drawing picture's of the fall evening just by chance some of the student's noticed the ufo above the park and proceeded to sketch picture's of the ufo's that they had seen of what they sketched as fast as they could because the object's did not stay very long. there was alot of attention drawn to the sighting's for a couple of day's then it was part of history. since then i have been in the united state's marine corp during 1972 - 1974 of which at that time my m.O.S. was to go to school to learn how to refuel aircraft. during that time i had went to school and graduated top of my class in tank farm and aircraft fuel station's in the feild. i refueled many type's of aircraft and helicopters also vertical and horizontal flying jet's. i have never seen or experienced anything that move's or fly's without any noise while being so close from what i seen on that evening. i am now and alway's will be semper fidelias to my belief in ufo's noone or nothing can ever change that.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13853,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.2465369,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11202008-0018","longitude":-80.8174166,"occurred":-129762000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-129762000000,"summary":"Many

my name is brian anctil, i'm 22 years old. the first sighting was outside my work, it was augest 2008 around 9:00pm, i cannot remeber the day exactly, but i walked outside looked up and took notice of one of the brighter stars with a yellowish color to it, it was twinkling, so i watched it for a few seconds until it gave a sort of pulse, and went out, i watched the area for a little while longer and it never came back. i thought that was weird and told my girlfriend about it and some other friends, and we just thought it was odd. then oct.10,2008 around 8:00pm,i went out for my break with my girlfriend kris, who works with me, anyway, i sat down looked up and saw the same bright light with the same yellow look to it, it was on the other side of the building this time, so i pointed excitedly out to my girlfriend to look at it and she did, as we watched it, it moved straight up in a line and pulsed a bit and went out. at this point i think something odd is up, but now 2 of us have seen it and that was freaky enough. so at this point, i'm telling friends and family about it, thinking how odd it was that i had seen this thing twice now. anyway, so on oct 13, 2008 around 11:00pm, my friend branden picked me up to go for a drive to the beach to talk and hang out. so we get too the beach and we had a good view of the stars and it reminded me to tell him all about the last 2 sightings. i starting explaining but the call of nature was herd and i had to step out for a to go pee, so i stepped out and headed for some logs on the beach and did my thing, as i was looking up at the sky wondering if i was going to see anything, but alas, nothing, so i got back in the car and started finishing telling him what i had seen, when he jokingly pointed out the window and said \"like that?\" and it was the same bright yellow looking star, and i just say star because it was bright as hell and made no noise any time i saw it... so i said yes, it looked exactly like that, then i told him i would start to be freaked out if it just faded out, and thats what it did.    each sighing lasted about a min or 2,  same bright star looking object, moved up on one sighting before fading out. but all faded out in the same sort of way. feel free to contact me, i talk better than i type. sorry i have no footage, just other people who saw it. just figured someone should know something is going on over here.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

rounded a bend and noticed a large flash of orange light to the se over the leon river area south of i-20.  i caught the flash out of the corner of my eye, and it was gone in a second.  i began to wonder if i had really seen anything.  i passed under i-20 and continued into eastland on east main st.  about a half-mile into town after passing i-20, i noticed a small but bright row of three lights appear out of nowhere in the same area of sky--se off towards i-20 and the leon river.  the lights were close together and were white with an orange tinge.  at first i thought it was just a plane with its landing lights on (eastland has a small airport, and you see stuff like this all the time.  what caught my attention was the orange tint.  i had actually seen these same lights earlier this year january 15th on the same stretch of road.  on the jan. 15th sighting, the lights hovered atop a large cloud over eastland as i was driving into town on the same road.  suddenly the lights disappeared.  a minute or two later i saw them again in my side mirror.  they were behind me at the opposite end of the sky in the south.  the object did not travel from point a to point b.  it just disappeared and reappeared.  i did not report this sighting before.  i thought the hovering and disappearing and reappearing was strange, but i convinced myself that it must've been two separate planes with their landing lights on.  however, i change my tune now because i saw the same lights again tonight (nov. 19) and what they did next made me realize that they were anything but plane lights.)  back to the nov. 19th sighting:  after i saw the set of three orange tinted lights appear, they immediately appeared to merge into one large globe of orange light!  the globe was about the diameter of the original three lights.  at this point, the light was all orange, no white light.  immediately after the lights merged into one, it appeared that two more globes of orange light of the same size emerged from the one forming a string of three lights in a horizontal line.  a short pause passed and then a fourth orange globe appeared in the line.  this set of lights were of a different size, color, and were more widely spaced apart than the original orange/white object it had morphed from.  almost as soon as the string of lights appeared they blinked out all at once.  immediately, one of the orange globes of light flashed on and off in a different location at a higher altitude and to the left of the original object.  immediately after that, another one of the orange globes of light flashed on and off above and just to the right of the last one.  and that was it.  it all happened really fast within a matter of seconds.  i was driving as it was happening and didn't have time to grab my phone to take a picture or anything.  i almost had a wreck looking at it.  i was completely awed and fascinated.  i have never seen lights as big as those in the sky and the whole display took up a huge area in the sky, and it was really their behavior that surprised me.  these were not street lights or plane lights.  i actually saw the white strobes of two planes flying in the same section of sky as the ufo, traveling in opposite directions and these globes of light dwarfed those or any other plane lights i have ever seen.  the lights appeared and disappeared as quickly as you please.  they did not appear to be lights attached to one large craft; i could see no indication of the body of a craft.  they looked like \"disembodied\" lights doing really strange things.  after the sighting, i decided to travel in the direction of the object and got onto hwy 6 traveling toward carbon and gorman.  just outside of carbon i saw a cluster of white strobes blinking alternately in a repeating pattern.  the group of lights moved steadily and in formation to the east.  they moved pretty quickly and lost sight of them after a while.  i had never seen a cluster of strobes in such tight formation; however, i must concede that this part of the sighting could have a group of planes flying in formation.  the lights looked like your run-of-the-mill plane lights.  it's just unusual to see planes flying in tight formation in this area, and i've lived in eastland co. all my life.  but i do have to concede that this last group of lights could be explained as normal aircraft in formation.  however, the orange lights i saw were completely unexplainable to me. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

cigar shaped object in the sky with a black band around it's middle.  the black band covered about 1/5 of the total objects length. it was traveling at a constant speed west to east.  object traveled in a straight line.  object was orientated in-line with direction of travel.  the sky was completely clear and very blue. \r\n\r\ni first thought it was a plane.  as it got closer i noticed it had no wings or tail section. next, i thought it might be a bird (black body and white wings) soaring in the morning sky.  as it passed overhead and slightly north i realized the \"bird\" had no head or tail. and, it appeared to be a smooth surfaced cylindrical object with rounded ends. i heard no sounds from the object as it passed over.\r\n\r\ni have no idea how high it was, but object length was about one finger width at arm length when overhead. speed is also unknown. however, there were few nearby trees etc. and it took a good two-three minutes for the object to pass over. compared to my observation of a space station fly over here in houston on nov 20, 2008, it appeared to be traveling across the sky at about the same speed.\r\n\r\ni looked around the parking lot, but saw no one outside.  it was very cold that morning - about 32f. as far as i know i'm the only one to observe the object. unfortunately, i had no binoculars or camera with me.\r\n\r\nis it possible it was the space station and the cold morning air acted like a magnifier? seems unlikely, but i've seen \"inversion\" mirages over water that make houses, etc. 20 miles away and over the horizon appear to be only 2-3 miles away.\r\n\r\nany help identifying the object would be really appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
