turning onto hwy 105 that there were three bright lights that i casually thought must be lights from a tower and then i noticed the movement in the lights.  the lights weren't in a vertical position, they were in a horizontal formation. the light in the middle and the light on my right came closer to one another and then the light on the right started movement toward my car.  i was slowed to a crawl on watching this and as this light that seemed bright white, like the other two got lower and closer, i could actually see the bottom of this thing.  what i saw was big, triangular-shaped, made no noise, and was heading eastward at a very slow speed.  i was awed, scared, and shaking as i was alone.  i don't necessarily believe in \"ufos\", but i know that i saw something out of the ordinary for sure.  instead of going home, i went to my mother's home which is located a few blocks from our mainstreet with the two remaining lights in view the entire time.  these two lights appeared to be moving westward.  i got to my mother's home and brought my mother and one of my older sisters out to view these lights when a third light appeared again, close in proximity to the other two  lights.  upon seeing the third light moving toward us, but at a much greater distance than what i had witnessed earlier, my sister said, \"it's a helicopter.\"  then upon seeing the object appear to immediately stop, we witnessed the object shoot straight up at such a speed that it disappeared very quickly. no sound. the sky was completely clear and the weather is unusually cold for this time of year in this area.  we watched these other two lights approximately until 8:30 pm until they moved beyond our view on the city horizon.  i did see aircraft flying at the time of this ascent, but they had flashing red lights clearly visible underneath.  i don't know what i saw, but was dissapointed that there was nothing reported locally.  i can't believe that i'm the only one in this area to see these moving lights.  i guess i just don't want to think that i'm nuts all alone.  i did want more input on what i had possibly seen so i googled ufos and found this site.

thought this may be connected.)\r\n\r\nmy son was driving, so his view was mainly through the sunroof, which is tinted.  it was a saturday evening approx. 7:30pm may 21st, 2000.  shortly after we passed the collinsville exit, i saw the ufo, but at first wasn't sure what it was and said, \"what is that?  some kind of weird water tower?\"  it was about that height-barely over the tree top.  as soon as i said that, we were closer and could see that it was a ufo and we both exclaimed, \"it's a ufo\" at the same time.  my son pointed at it and tried to get a better view.  \r\n\r\nit was about as long as a big semi truck and about as wide top to bottom as a semi from the top to the ground.  the description on tv of the 1/5/2000 sightng is pretty accurate (though i recall the 1/5/2000 being much bigger??)  it had the windows (i believe four) like described.  they were tinted and like a big picture window.  (the windows at a local restaurant remind me of them, size wise, but i have never measured them.) there were red lights on the bottom-i believe three at the back (but might have been five, one at the front point, and possibly 1-2 more, midway on the craft.  one feature that i haven't heard on any of the other reports was a small square tower (approx. 15\") with a small rectangular window at the top of the tower.  the tower was at the front point of the triangle.  i felt it was a higher look out point.  it seemed to be too small for a human.  it was about the same height as the craft was from top to bottom.  it was dull black in color.\r\n\r\nnot a leaf moved on any of the trees as it hovered, no movement, it was just there.  with the windows tinted, we could not see inside.\r\n\r\ni can't speak for my son, but as i looked at the ufo, i felt that i was also being observed.  it was a very eerie and creepy feeling.  the hair stood up on the back of my neck and i had goose bumps on my arms.\r\n\r\ni have always enjoyed reading about unusual things ufo's, ghosts, whatever, so you would have thought that i would have been excited about seeing it, but my son and i were petrified.  we were not inclined to pull over until we got to the maryville exit (where we were getting off to see my daughter.)  at that time, we tried to see it again from the overpass bridge, but were not able to.\r\n\r\nmy brothers were both pilots f-4 and f-16, so i have been to my share of air shows.  i have seen the stealth, etc. etc.  it was my distinct impression that this craft had a more advanced technology than we have at this time. i also could not imagine a test plane being tested over a major interstate.  if it were technology that a foreign country has, i can't imagine they would risk being seen, and can't imagine what purpose it might have had in that location of mostly restaurants.\r\n\r\ni did make a sketch of it at the time, but have not located it.  i swore my son to secrecy regarding the sighting initially, as i didn't want my daughter to be afraid.  then, when we saw the show about ufo's over southern illinois, and started sharing the information.  \r\n\r\ni have heard others say, and it was true for me, that it was hard to quit thinking about it and i would (for example) see a semi truck and think it was about that size. having been interested in ufo's, i have looked out in the night sky, and would not have thought to look in the day light at tree top level!  that \"they are here, rather than out there\" was an eye opener for me!\r\n\r\nmy son is a well respected park manager and i am a licensed clinical social worker and work as a dcfs investigator.

have stopped the car immediately and opened a window. looked back at my parents to make sure they see the same. they just nodded. then we were just standing there or about 10 minutes and observing it.\r\n[size=2][side note - i was always into these kind of things, but i remember saying then loud - oh no, i'm not going there. fear of the unknown, i guess].[/size]\r\nok, so here is the object - two circles of white bright round lights, smaller one a bit lower than tne bigger one. lights onn both of them were circling clockwise i think (there was some disagreement about the direction afterwards). it hovered in about 50 meters, about 200 meters from the road.\r\nafter about 10 minutes it started moving along the road in the direction o marijampol��� (where we were traveling) and a little away. i started the engine and was driving for another 100 meters, then the road turns right. the object was fading as it moved, not because of the distance, but by itself. then it flied further away across the river and was still visible for some time. finally the glow of townlights hid it from our sight.\r\ni'd like to add, that that night was totally dark, but there were no clouds at all - the sky was full of stars.\r\nas for possible explanations, first thought was that it is some projection on the clouds or some light show.. but as i know that place very well, there isn't any such instalations, because its a farmland with a river valley cutting it across, no population on that side of the road whatsoever.\r\nbesides, sky was clear, object was very low and bright, and last - the lights were directed to the sides and the object they were circling around, had some volume - lights were visible only in front of the object and hid behind it.\r\ni will post my humble drawing for you to understand better and will try to get google earth coordinates to show you the place.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

noticed object in the distance about 40 degrees off horizon.  thought object at first to be a helicopter but noticed the lights were brighter (larger appearance), lights did not strobe as such and object didn't appear to be moving around.  there were a lot of air planes and a few helicopters flying around at the time as well, (note that deer valley airport is within 3 miles). i started to think that the planes were taking an interest to the object and it appeared that the planes may have been making some fly-by's of the object.  i arrived at my sisters place which was less than a mile from the location i first noted seeing the object. i looked up and still saw the object and was at about the same degree from the horizon but had been moving west during the drive and noticed it was looking brighter/larger due to it getting closer. the light would stay solid for a few seconds then dim and alternate at different frequencies.  i had my sister and her husband come out to look at it with me and we watched it for awhile and could notice it moving west very slowly.  noting the appx. angle of degree it was at and moving to the west the object may have been a 1000ft in the air. at about 7:45pm the object stopped moving and the light would pulse from bright to dim for another minute or so more then stopped and vanished. also noted, there was no sound to it, there were however plenty of planes and helicopters to compare the object to for the entire duration as they were in constant flight.  \r\n\r\nhave no thought to what it may be, only per my observation it was not an

going out to get the dog when i noticed a large reddish orange light in the ne sky. i thought it was a \"harvest moon: rising particularly covered by clouds. but when i looked closer i realized that's not what it was at all. it was a slightly cone shaped fire ball that would grow in intensity as the object would move rapidly either to the right or straight up.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nat first it was drifting to the left then would move rapidly back to the right to it's original position. it did that several times over about a 2 - 3 minute time span. i yelled for my wife to come out but she couldn't hear me so i ran into the house to get her hoping the object would still be there once we returned, and it was. she was amazed. we continued to observe the light object for an additional 5 minutes or so. during that time and on one occasion it shot dramatically in an upward and to the right. another time it shot straight up to about three times higher then the original position. each time it would make those really fast movements the reddish orange glow would intensify. after the one time it shot straight up, it slowly and erratically worked itself back to the original position and then pretty quickly just faded away. not as it were leaving but just faded away.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ni called the williamson county sherriff department as well as the franklin review appeal newspaper to see if anyone else had seen or reported this. from our position it seemed to be about 5 - 7 mile away, above the tree line and was about the size if 1/5 the size of a full moon. it was fairly large. i would have thought more people would have seen it but we were told by the authorities and the newspaper that no one else had reported seeing anything like that.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ni&#700;m 54 years old and an owner of a financial institution marketing company and not know to be a weird or crazy person who sees strange things. this sighting was a plane as the nose on my face. there was no mistaking this light was moving around like something i have never seen before. with plenty of time to watch it i tried to discount it has a hot air balloon or something like that but the movements explained that away quickly. i&#700;m only glad my wife was able to see it and backup my story.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

into a cloud. i snapped a second picture which shows the larger object in greater detail upon enlargement as a weird shape but still unrecognizable. the larger object is visible inside the small cloud and a few of the smaller spheres also are visible both inside and outside the cloud. see ufob.Jpg. time between photos is about 1 minute or less. upon enlargement, the spheres resolve to a bright center surrounded by a darker circumference. i verified the visual sighting with another person sitting beside me. the two pictures demonstrate that these objects are real and not lens dust. extreme computer enlargement is necessary to see these objects. an even larger faint black halo also extends way outside some of these objects, perhaps an artifact of the ccd and not a real effect. these

rd.\r\nconditions: after dusk.  sky moderately cloudy, clear, full moon, no visibility hinderances.\r\n\r\ndescription:  at about 9:10p.M. i was driving down burroughsville road when i noticed a bright object sitting stationary in the southern sky.  the sky was clear and all that could be seen was a bright full moon and this object, no stars were present at the time.  i then stopped my car on the side of the road to get a better look at the object.  i rolled down my window to get a clear view out of the passenger side door when the object began to move in an easterly direction.  i observed the object for about a minute, then it stopped.  the object stayed stationary for about another minute and then began moving again in upward motion.  the object stopped and then after a few seconds, began moving easterly again.  i started my car and then drove onwards down the road while making sure to keep an eye on the object as i drove.  there were no other visible objects in the sky other than the moon.  as i headed home, which was in a southeastern direction, the object continued to move with the same erratic flight pattern, periodically stopping and then moving once again.  i arrived at home and still saw the object off to the southeastern sky.  i called my mother and brother to come look at the object, which at that time was stationary.  the time was about 9:18.  we observed the object for approximately 10 more minutes.  from the time that i entered my house to inform my mother and brother, to the time that we returned outside, the object stayed in the same place.  the object then began to move after several minutes, and then began to move erratically once again.  the object moved upwards in altitude, and then would stop and move downwards and then towards the east.  i had brought out a pair of binoculars to get a better view of the object, and from what i could tell, it was shaped like an elongated circle which had lights going down the middle of its center going lengthwise.  the object continued to move towards the east and then stopped again.  it then ascended upwards and was gone from view.  i am absolutely sure that this object was neither an airplane nor a helicopter.  the object was able to hover and move in all directions unlike an airplane and it was at much too high of an altitude to be a helicopter.  no other objects or celestial phenomenon were present in the sky at the time other than the moon.  i have no other explanation for the object other than to say that it was a ufo.

the driveway\r\nestimated time of sighting: between 6:30 and 7:00 pm, shortly after sun set.\r\nwe have also had other sightings some similar and some completely different, within the past 2 to 3 weeks leading up to tuesday night 11/18/08. this night by far was the most activity we have seen in one night and this night by far had the most unusual and bizarre activity we had ever seen which is what prompted my report.\r\n\r\nthese are the occurrences my two sons and i saw in the sky on november 18, 2008 between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm with the naked eye.\r\n\r\ni was outside star gazing; we have been seeing unusual occurrences in the sky almost nightly for the past several weeks since the first unusual occurrence,i have been compelled to watch the night sky.\r\n\r\nfirst sighting (lasted about 90 seconds) ��� i saw a brightly lit object run through the sky from west to south. objects origination point is unknown; as object raced to the west i heard a strange high pitch sound. object disappeared after it moved to the west and out of my viewing range.\r\n\r\nsecond sighting (lasted about 2 minutes) ��� within 2 to 4 minutes following the first sighting i saw a triangle shaped craft moving from north to south, it appeared to be silver/metallic in appearance with no hard or sharp edges; all points on the object seem to be rounded in appearance as moved low over our neighbor���s house. the craft made absolutely no sound as it disappeared to the south over the tree line.\r\n\r\nthird sighting (lasted for a one to two seconds) ��� i was looking at the sky in the south direction and saw a star looking object fizzle out toward the east, this may just have been a meteor in the sky, but due the first two sighting i thought it should be noted. \r\n\r\nfourth sighting (lasted for a one to two seconds) ��� my two sons joined my outside shortly after the third sighting, i told them about the first, second and third sightings and instructed them to look towards specific directions in the sky, my oldest son i instructed to look north and northwest, my youngest son i instructed to look towards the northeast and i resumed looking to the south, southwest and southeast. as the three of us looked in different directions assuring we did not miss anything that may pop up in the sky for a brief moment my youngest son was looking toward the south and said he had saw the silver triangle shaped craft move from the tree line briefly and went back out of sight behind the tree line. i was able to confirm that he saw exactly what i did during the second sighting due to the fact the only information i had giving him about this object was that is was shaped like a triangle, he was never told of the color or what it appeared to look like other than shape.\r\n\r\nfifth sighting (lasted about 3 to 4 minutes) ��� my oldest son who was looking north and northwest alerted me to what he was seeing, my oldest son is highly into in astronomy and science and is the biggest skeptic i know. he always has a logical reason things that seem to move and look weird in the sky, however this time that was not the case. the object my oldest son saw looked like venus looks in the sky when viewable; the major difference was this object was more of a redder hue than venus is. now there is no mistaken that this object was not venus as the object was moving south to southwest and then to the north, as the object was moving it looked approximately the size of a basket ball the shape appeared to be spherical once the object turned to the north my oldest son stated it looked as if the object elongated and it began to grow dimmer, dimmer again and dimmer once more and then it was gone. it looked as if it completely disappeared or move out of the atmosphere so fast it was not viewable to us with the naked eye. \r\n\r\nsixth sighting (lasted about 3 minutes) ��� this sighting was indeed the strangest, shortly following the fifth sighting we had with the glowing spherical object, we saw another star like object in the sky overhead, this one was also moving in the north direction, the occurrence that made this one the strangest is not the shape, size, and movement of the object, it was what seemed to be chasing this object. not 2 seconds after we saw this object take off in the sky moving north, a jet or plane and i am not sure the type or if it was commercial or military took off after it. the object is was after was still moving in the north direction and the jet/plane was gaining on it, this went off for a minute or so and at this point my sons and i thought it was going to catch the star like object as it at this point was real close to it. as soon as the jet/plane caught up, the object immediately accelerated and shot up higher in the sky from the jet/plane. the jet/plane looked like it was trying to follow, but a second later return to the position it was at before the object took off higher in the sky. i am not sure if the object climbed to high for the jet/plane to follow, but it was very apparent, what ever this star liked object was it was definitely after it.\r\n\r\nour feelings about these events and the several others we have had in the past several weeks have been of excitement, baffled and very intrigued about what we are seeing. my husband, two sons and i are of sound mind and above average intelligence, we are very logical and not ones to jump to the conclusion that what we saw was in fact of alien origin, however what we have seen is nothing we can identify through first hand knowledge or through internet research.\r\n\r\ni unfortunately do not have any pictures or video's, my camera does not take good pictures in the dark and i do not have a video camer, however i will be borrowing my in-laws video camera tonight to have on hand just in case these objects show up again.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

there.  when in the corner of my eye i first noticed the bright object.  it took a few seconds to realize it was not a star or planetary object.  it was slowly without any noise whatsoever, gracefully moving from the southeast toward the northeast.  i also looked immediately to the sotuhwest where i knew that jupiter and venus were visible in the night sky.  then back to the object as it was continuing on it's path to the northeast.  it was at an altitude of about 1500 to 2000 feet best guess.  star like in appearance with very very bright and very white light.  highly intense light not like a light bulb but more intense celaner white light.  location is about lat. 31deg31min and long. -90deg15min. where sighting occurred. i watch airplanes all the time and this was not one of them.  there were no aircraft flashing beacons on this object.  i called for my daughter to bring me the camera so i could possibly snap a picture of object as it headed away.  just as i had focused the

i happened to look up at the sky to the east and saw a bright flashing object quite high in the sky. at first i thought it looked like a metallic object reflecting the sun.  i mentioned to my daughter that it was kind of early for the stars/planets to be out so soon and so brightly.  she saw it and said it was strobing and she saw colors - white, blue and red.  i then looked back over to the western/southwestern sky and could just barely begin to make out the two brightest lights at dusk, jupiter and venus.  we stood out there for about 20 minutes and i continued to watch both the strobing light and the planets.  as the planets became brighter in intensity, the strobing light became fainter until at just about sundown, the strobing light completely disappeared, and the usual planets and stars became brighter.  i didn't think stars/planets did that, fading away in the early evening sky.  for the next several days, i went back out to the deck and stood in the exact same place at the exact same time frame and i still have not seen that object return.","distance":"Over One

was about 75 degrees up to the south and east. there were some clouds and jet trails lingering. i ran inside to get my camera to take some pictures, (i have a video camera but all of my tapes are full)my husband got his binoculars. it seemed to be staying in the same spot. i took a few pictures then came inside to look on the computer to make sure it wasn't a sattelite or a planet, there were none in that area, there was venus and jupiter way to the south but they were still not visible to us. i grabbed my telephoto lense (3x)and put it on the camera to take more photos. the object had moved towards the north west and was straight obove our heads. just about then (about 5-10 mins after we first saw it) the kids came home and we had them look also, i had my son bring out the telescope and sight it in. looking at it in the telescope it looked like a large bright bubble and we could see a smaller sphere cicling it, what i saw looked like it was slowly swinging back and forth and what my son saw (he was looking at it longer) was that it was going around the larger object in a random erractic way. we couldn't see if it was attached by anything. the sphere started moving faster to the north and we could hardly keep it in the telescope sight. my son took the telescope to the backside of the house to try to keep an eye on it longer. i called my sister, and reached her husband, to see if she could see it from the next town over, they could not see anything but clouds. while i was talking to him the object went dim though i could still see it. my son lost sight of it. one of the clouds moved over it and at first i could still see it but then lost it as the cloud got thicker. we couldn't find it after that. i did get one picture that shows the smaller object. i am including that photo and the same one cropped and enlarged.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Appendage(s),
