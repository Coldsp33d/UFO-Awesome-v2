extremely fast and they appeared really far away.  we watched them for about 30 seconds and then they just disappeared.  the man and i looked at each other and i said to him \"that was really weird.\"

the same thing.  that's why i am contacting you now.  i don't remeber the exact day or month, i know it was april or early may because i stopped smoking on mother's day and haven't smoked since.  also the day was beautiful with a clear blue sky and long small clouds.  i remember the clouds because at first i thought the objects in the sky were clouds because they were so white.  i would have never thought ufo's but now that someone else saw what we did it definitely was something i would like explained.  it was the strangest and weirdest thing i ever witnessed for all of 30 or 40 seconds.  i remember it like it was yesterday and could still point out where they were in the sky.  it was like they were flying with a mission and heading

it goes:  i was about 18 yrs. old at the time living in southern california in 1977.  it was trash night, and the subdivision we lived in was not very brightly lit, so on a clear night, you could see the stars very clearly in the sky, as it was this night.  as i was hauling the first trash can to the curb, i noticed in the sky a v-shaped pattern of lights all moving in my direction very slowly about 2 miles from me.  i remember a patteen of about 7-9 lights in a flat, wide, v-shaped boomerang configuration, that were orange-red in hue, but did not throw a beam like the headlights of a car.  instead, they were subdued, like dim reddish flourescent lights.  the lights retained a fixed distance of separation relative to each other.  the group appeared to be about 2000-3000 feet off the ground and were slowly approaching my direction.  after staring at this for a minute or so, it was now about a mile away.\r\n\r\noriginally, i dismissed the issue as a group of helicopters flying in formation at night, on the way from, or back to camp pendleton marine base in oceanside, ca.  i walked back to the house to get another trash can.\r\n\r\nwith the second trash can to the curb now, the formation was directly over my head, still at the same elevation, and the lights were still moving in the same direction in absolute perfect silence.  not a single sound.  it was then that i realized these were not planes, helicopters, or balloons because now i could just barely see the outline of the large v-shaped craft that the lights appeared to be attached to.  it was just a silhouette against the backdrop of normal stars in the sky.  it was the lack of visible stars that i could make out its outline as it moved across the sky.  no other lights, markings, openings, protrusions, or anything else on the underside of this v-shaped craft.  it size was about 500-700 feet across and 200-300 feet front to back as i could judge given its altitude.\r\n\r\ni stood there for a second then immediately ran to the house in a panic, suspecting it was a ufo, and hoping this thing did not see me underneath it and come after me.  a few minutes later, i looked outside again to see that it had passed overhead and was still there, but heading away already a mile or so away.\r\n\r\nagain, i asserted to myself that this must be some military craft, and soon forgot about it.\r\n\r\nfast forward to 2008, i now see the exact ufo being shown on some of the discovery and history channel shows recently.  again, this story likely has little significance now at this late date other than a timeline for how long this type of craft has been spotted.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

not have visible wing-tip or tail strobes. as i observed the light over the course of several minutes, it became apparent that it was stationary (or nearly stationary, perhaps descending slightly) and that i was quickly approaching its position. the rate of my approach indicated that the light was low and near. these observations all ruled out most forms of airplane. the craft had to be vtol and relatively small.\r\n\r\nabout eleven miles out of town there is a ���tank farm��� ��� a filling station for fuel trucks. this is at the junction of mead creek road and highway 87. i found the light to be centered directly above the tank farm and very low. i did not rule out the possibility it could be a helicopter and i wondered whether the tank farm could have a helipad to receive some sort of business by helicopter.\r\n\r\ni slowed to approximately 30-40mph, muted my stereo and rolled down the window to listen for the beats of a helicopter blade. i could hear no blade nor any sort of engine roar. simultaneous traffic on the highway, consisting of two cars within the half-mile behind me, did not seem to slow to observe the light, but i obviously could not see what was going on inside them.\r\n\r\ndepending on the size of the object, it seemed to be, judging by my position and the stature of the gasoline tanks, only about 100-200 feet off the ground. clearly, this is only explicable if the craft were a small helicopter and was coming in for a landing on site.\r\n\r\nat the time, i continued driving. by the time i reached bird farm road, about another mile down highway 87, my inner fox mulder had clearly won and i whipped the car around and sped back to try and get a definite confirmation that the craft was a helicopter by either watching it land or listening (at a complete stop) for the sound of blade clips.\r\n\r\ni reached the location in less than a minute and passed it twice. no traffic was around, so i passed it both times at 10mph, radio off and windows down. there was no trace of the light or any craft anywhere in the sky or on the ground. there was no visible helicopter at the site and absolutely nothing was in the air. the cloud ceiling was very high and could not have concealed a helicopter that had just taken off. similarly, no stars were visible to camouflage the craft if it had taken off and achieved a very high altitude somehow in that short period of time.\r\n\r\nwhen i passed the tank farm the next morning (11/17/08) on the way to work, i observed that there is no place on the site that i could see designed for a small helicopter to land. \r\n\r\nthe physical description of the light is difficult. no features were distinguishable. if there were multiple lights on the craft, they bled into one, singular neutral-colored upside-down teardrop shape (which may have been due to refraction and not indicative of the shape of the actual craft). i could not distinguish wings or a tail. no blades or propellers were visible or audible. it did not exhibit any lateral movement. it seemed to have descended as i neared the position, but this movement was very subtle and smooth. it was definitely only a few hundred feet off the ground at most when i passed it, though i am pretty sure it was much higher than that at the moment i first spotted it.\r\n\r\ni had noted the time when i left town and again during and after the sighting. there was no ���missing time.��� the entire sighting lasted only a matter of minutes. \r\n\r\ni had also seen something similar in a nearby location when i was in high school, but later wrote it off as a (strangely low) helicopter. several ranchers in the area may have private helicopters, but the absolute noiselessness of the craft, its lack of tail or strobes, and the speed of its disappearance make that solution difficult.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

southern sky.  they were very large and we initially thought they were flares, but they would remain stationary,,, drop down behind a ridge approximately 20 miles away and come back to their previous altitude.  they had smaller red lights circling them and those smaller lights would go inside the larger orange lights then come back out and go down to the ground.  this went on for about 4 hours.  my mother father and some of our friends saw them.  a few weeks later my brother in law and his friend and i saw two of them on a mountain top closer to the ranch house. about 4 miles away and we went to investigate them.  they were on a mountain called groom peak which is south of highway 93 by the burro creek bridge.  they also were spherical in shape and orange.  they also released smaller red lights that were traveling down the side of the mountain and going into the canyons around the base of the mountain,,, they then would go back up to the orange lights and go into them.  we drove up to an abandoned ranch house that was about 2 foot ball field away from the lights and they were gone in an instant, no noise,  sometimes during the day we could here a deep rumbling in the distance toward the ridge where we saw the first 6 lights.
