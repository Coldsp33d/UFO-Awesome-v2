when i noticed a silvery football shaped orb (w/no exhaust nor features). it was a very clear, blue bird sky with the exception of the chemtrails. i yelled for my girlfriend to come outside and she spotted it also. we both agreed it looked more like an oval, football shape with a silvery luminosity that stood out in contrast compared to the chemtrails jets that were close to it. at one point in the beginning, i thought the object was going to crash into or nearly miss a chemtrail jets as they approached each other from opposite directions. i caught one good photo with my digital binoculars as it faded into the distance.\r\n by the way, i've come to relize that i've had contact all my life. my girlfriend has had quite a few sightings w/me and is now is convinced believer. she has had a dream (last feb-jan)where by a craft hovers over her  mothers' house as it drops geometric lights over the house and yard. similar to the levittown incidet. she said it was a very vivid dream. i have

downtown. i was driving and she was in the passenger seat sitting back and resting her eyes. at around 11:40 pm i noticed in the distance a light in the sky darting earthward in the area of bear creek park.  initially i thought it was a meteor as the elapsed time i saw it was no longer that about 10 seconds.  the object became invisible or should i say no light was emited anymore so i assumed it had flamed out and hit the ground somewhere in the area where i saw it fall. i would add that as it appeared to be large enough to make a definite impact i did slow down to see if from the freeway i could see any smoke or fire from an impact. as i drove by the area where i felt it had fallen i could see no signs of any type of impact. as i passed the bear creek park area moving west about 5 minutes later i noticed a bright light flying in the sky. i just kinda appeared out of nowhere.   like the object i had seen before i looked like a comet or meteor what was different however was that the object was moving upward towards the sky at a very fast rate so fast that with in about 15 seconds it just accelerated and disappeared.  to emphasize the upward  flight of the object was at first level with the ground then arched slightly upward vanishing as it accelerated. the light i saw from the object at both times was a whitish ball and tail with an orange glow emanating from the front part of the front.  i believe it may have been the same object i initially saw because it was coming from the area of the park where i had seen the initial object. once the object vanished the first words can remember saying was what the hell as i was shocked by what i had seen. my wife was not witness to what i saw as she was sleeping and to date i still havent told her what i saw.

stadium (sulphur high school)\r\nspecific date: homecoming night\r\n \r\n            i, along with my ex-wife and two friends from my same street were seated on the home team side of the stadium app. half way up facing east. during the halftime home coming events on the field i witnessed a 2 foot diameter orb traveling horizontally from north to south over the field. the object was not like the 2 dimensional translucent orbs seen in most pictures after development. this object was a solid 3d sphere, not a light. its color was a bluish green. it was traveling between 80 and 100 mph. the entire sighting lasted a little over 2 seconds. it traveled over the eastern hatch marks on the field and was slightly lower than the field lights. nearly ever person was focused on the homecoming court down on the field. upon seeing the orb i immediately notified my friends. two of the three were able to see the orb before it rapidly faded out of site. the object had very sharp defining edges no blurs or fuzziness, the inside seemed to be made of plasma, it was not extremely bright and flew in a perfectly strait and flat trajectory. the most interesting part of the story came later.\r\n            the next day upon seeing my neighbor in his yard i related the events of the previous night. to my shock he had a story of his own. he told me on the night in question at app. 1:30am he and his wife was up late watching tv, when all of a sudden he had an urge to get up and walk outside. he claims he had not heard or seen anything to make him go out. as he proceeded outside his wife also followed suit. they were both drawn to look westward towards my house. an oak tree stood just south of the southwest corner of my house. upon first looking toward the southwest corner of my house they saw nothing, then a small solid orb about 1-1/2 to 2 feet in diameter came floating out from either my bedroom wall or behind the west wall of my house. the orb floated up into the oak tree maneuvering around the large branches. after a few seconds the orb floated clear of the tree then stopped perfectly still app. 35 feet off the ground as if to let them get a good look at it. then all at once it flew upward and away in a southwest direction at a very high rate of speed until it could no longer be seen. i asked the wife if she had got up to follow the husband outside, and she said no, she had been drawn by a mysterious urge of go outside also. these are professional college educated people. the only discrepancy between their two stories was the color of the orb. he said it was bluish, she said it was greenish. i saw it as blue green. the orb made no sound and left no visible trail. there is nothing openly known in the industrial or military complex that can fly with no open ports or wings that we currently know of. the orb is particularly similar to the orb recorded on nasa tv  sts mission 37. only the color is different.\r\n\r\nbelow is a re_creation of what i witnessed.\r\n

brightly lit for about 30 seconds. i called for my wife to come out and see the objects. there were about 20 to 30 separate objects moving in close proximity of the orange lights location. each of the  smaller objects were small, but very bright cone of iridescent green which was readily visible. the \"green cones\" moved up, down, and sideways. the green glow would become bigger and brighter. a few seconds after that, the big orange lights appeared fairly close to where i'd seen them earlier, but it was clear that the big object had moved, and the green cones were all around the orange lights.\r\n\r\nthe big orange lights came on horizontally, one after another until all 9 lights were brightly lit. the second object, with the 3 lights, came on about 20 seconds after the bigger (9) light show was complete, but this time the smaller orange one was a considerable distance away. the green cones split up and some were clearly with each orange object. the bigger orange object was closer to us now and i detected two things i hadn't noticed earlier. the diameter of the orange light was huge and it appeared to have  spoke like markings like an old wagon wheel.  the other thing i noticed was the glow of orange light on what looked to be metal. my wife and i were convinced that the larger object was a craft of some sort.\r\n\r\nthe entire episode lasted about 20 minutes. the orange lights were repeated about six times. then everything disappeared as abruptly as they had showed up. we waited another 30 minutes, but nothing else appeared.","distance":"Over One

flying much higher and faster came flying between orion and the moon. at first i thought it was a plane because i could hear them. but when i looked at the wing span, i said to myself, that is too huge to be a plane, it was a vast distance between the 3 lights forming a triangle. \r\n\r\nthen just as i realized it couldn't possible be a plane, the 3 lights moved together laterally without touching but forming a very tight triangle, while still flying at an incredible speed. they continued in this manner for only 5 or 10 seconds then split apart again into the original formation. this gave me a slight feeling of nausea. it was incredible. \r\n\r\nat that point i ran to get my fiance to tell her to come look, but when she got out to the deck they were gone. they were heading due

flying craft that i was unable to identify.\r\n\r\nthe first thing that drew my attention to the craft was the hum of its engine. it was a kind of hum-flutter sound. i have military, law enforcement, and some flight training, so i was more interested in trying to figure out what kind of craft it was when i first looked up and saw almost directly over me.. \r\n\r\nthe aircraft was more or less in a kind of very slow moving hover mode.\r\n\r\nthe trees where i ride my bike are maybe 50 to 70 feet tall,\r\nthe craft was maybe another 100 feet or so above the trees. i���m not too good at estimating distances, but to me it was like looking at school buss maybe two blocks or so away. \r\n\r\nthe sky was very clear that night, and filled with visible stars, so the craft was very easy to see. i was directly under it traveling very slowly north on my bike, and the craft was traveling very slowly south  (barely moving). \r\n\r\nthe craft was triangular in shape, and had alternating red and white flashing lights all around it. they were evenly spaced about a foot or so apart on all three sides. the nose of the craft had a dished out area that contained a high beam light. i could see the beam reached out into the sky until it faded out. the light seemed to have the ability to turn as if it was searching the sky.\r\n\r\nthe body of the craft was for the most part just a dark colored area surrounded by the flashing lights. i really couldn���t make out any specific details. while i looked up at the craft i first thought it must be some kind of new helicopter (because it was so low and so slow moving, and almost familiar flutter sound of the engine), but it was not shaped like any helicopter i had ever seen before, or like any other aircraft i had ever seen before.\r\n\r\ni took my eyes off of the craft for maybe a second or two to turn my bike around from going north to going south, and that fast the craft was gone. it was a completely clear night, i could see the stars in all directions, and there was not a single aircraft in the sky. at that moment i was convinced that what i had seen was no ordinary aircraft. again, it was like looking at a school bus sitting in an open field maybe 200 feet away, then while blinking your eyes it is completely gone.\r\n\r\ni rode my bike around for a while to see if i could spot it again, but no luck. when i got home i called the local police department to inquire if anyone had called in to report seeing anything unusual in the sky. they said no, and asked why. i told them what i had seen and the lady i talked to sounded interested, but i���m sure she probably thought i was a nut���i felt like one just telling her the story.\r\n\r\ni also tried to call the local airport control tower, but got a recording that they closed at 9 pm.\r\n\r\nthe next morning i called the airport control tower again, and was put in contact with the lady who was on duty that night. i told her my story, and asked if she knew of any aircraft that might come close to that description that would fly in our general area? she advised me that there were a few craft in the sky before 9 pm, but nothing at all after 9 pm, and nothing at all at any time traveling north to south. she seemed interested, so we chatted about it for a few minutes. she mentioned that the nearby air base had a lot of traffic going in and out of it, but i���m not sure what ���nearby��� air force base she is talking about?\r\n\r\non the evening of the event i typed everything about the incident into my computer, plus date and time. i subsequently deleted the story, and was sorry that i did a few weeks later. now i am not absolutely sure of the exact day or date. \r\n","distance":"101-500

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"First i'd like to say that the only reason i'm reporting this is because i just saw the ufos over earth fayettevile incident episode and noticed that there were some similarities. my sighting took place the day after the episode aired and i did not know about the show until after my sighting, when i googled the terms \"fayetteville, nc\" ufo. i googled that to see if anyone else had posted on the internet about seeing what i saw that night. i wasn't as much interested in older sightings as i was interested in finding someone else who saw the same thing that night. after googling that, i saw a description of the show, learned that it aired the night before, and sought it out on the internet so i could watch it. \r\n\r\nmy story is extremely uneventful, but i figured i'd report it anyway as it could help to see the similarities in other cases from this area. myself and my boyfriend were traveling down bragg blvd, coming from downtown fayetteville, headed towards the sycamore dairy rd. intersection. i observed 3 large orange lights in the sky. higher than street lights, but low enough to catch my eye and seem strange. the road we were traveling on is quite a busy road so i kept looking around to see if anyone else was looking at the lights, it did not appear so. \r\n\r\nthe 3 lights were orange in color and looked almost identical to the street lights that line bragg blvd, and most of fayetteville. they were about the same size. my boyfriend and i first thought it was 3 airplanes in formation, headed towards us, with very large headlights or something. we couldn't stop staring at them, waiting to see if they are airplanes or if they zoomed away in true ufo fashion. these 3 lights were in a diagonal line, the highest light being toward the right, and the lowest light at the left. they were appx. a half inch apart from our line of vision. all of a sudden, the bottom left light disappeared in the blink of an eye and reappeared on top of the formation in the right. it happened so quickly, that we at first thought a 4th light appeared. but really, only 3 were visible. that happened again, in the blink of an eye the lights rearranged with a new one seemingly appearing at the top of the formation, but still only 3 were visible. \r\n\r\nwe could not see the lights moving. just popping up suddenly in a new spot, but the entire time they remained in the diagonal line and only 3. i am not sure how long this whole event happened. it seems like about 3 minutes, but it may have been shorter. i have seen planes dropping flares before and it was similar to that, except the lights stayed stationary and illuminated much longer than the flares i've seen. \r\n\r\nwe continued staring at them while traveling up bragg blvd when the light on the top right just blinked out. it was gone and only 2 lights remained. i'd like to add that nowhere near these 3 lights were any blinking lights like those on common aircraft. just these 3, large, orange orbs. they did not move, they were not traveling, they seemed to be hovering. then, about 30 seconds after the first light disappeared, the 2nd light disappeared. at this moment i decided to take my cellphone out and try to get a photo. only 1 light remained at this point and i knew my cellphone wasn't good at taking quality photos but i tried anyway. that is how i know the exact time of this sighting, because of the time stamp on my photo. i took the photo and the light is visible, although it is whiter and smaller in the photo. i was still looking through my cellphone about to take another photo, waiting for the camera to get ready, when i saw the final light blink out. it happened the same instance i snapped the second photo and in the second photo there are no lights. the time stamp on the 2nd photo is 3-5 seconds after the first and the light is gone. \r\n\r\nwe continued on our way and were heading towards where the lights were but did not see or hear anything else in the sky that night. it was slightly unsettling but mostly very strange. we do not know if this was some type of aircraft from fort bragg, but we both agree that this was not like any aircraft we've ever seen before. i will include the photo of the 1 orb that i got just before it disappeared. like i said before, it is quite unimpressive, but it is all that i have from the incident. there are lots of other lights in the photo, as it is night time and we are on a busy road. so i put a white arrow pointing at the light that is unexplainable.  i know it isn't a good photo, but at least it can give an idea of how low/high this was in the sky. thanks for your time.","distance":"Over One

weekend away from post.  saturday night my roommate gail rodriguez and i decided to take two of our friends out to a little bar at the south end of the strand which i believe is thomas dr.  my roommate and i wanted to come back to town to enjoy a carnival that was in town, so when we got to the bar, we dropped our girfriends off and agreed we would see them later in the evening.\r\n\r\nas we were driving north again on thomas dr. the first thing i noticed is that the bumper to bumper traffic that was normal for a friday or saturday night along thomas drive was non-existant. we seemed to be the only ones on the road.  no cars passed us and none was behind or in front of us.\r\n\r\nbeing an aviation buff, an air traffic control student at ft. rucker and an air force \"brat\" i had a habit of watching the sky for anything that moved.  i loved locating satelites.  but i saw something in the sky that night that i found odd.  there was a star, just a pin point in the sky that looked odd.  it was bright orange.  i had never seen a star that bright or that color before and thought it was odd.  gail and i continued our conversation and drive - but i kept glancing at the odd colored star i had seen and each time i looked at it - it appeared to be larger.  \r\n\r\ni thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but kept watching, soon it was almost as big around as the moon.  so i finally said to gail, \"have you been watching that star?\"  she asked if i was referring tot eh orange one.  i told her yes, but \"that's not star\"!  and we decided to pull to the side of the road and watch it.  \r\n\r\nstill not another car passed us on the road.  \r\n\r\nwe don't know how long we watched, but as we huddled together in the front seat of the car(with the doors locked) the thing got bigger and bigger until it seemed to engulf the sky from horizon to horizon.  it was the biggest thing i's ever seen.  we couldn't tell how close it might be, but it appeared to settle halfway into the gulf of mexico so it looked like a huge cake plate cover.  we didn't know if it was far enough away that it was hovering over the gulf and what we were seeing was the curvature of the earth - or if it had actually setteled into the gulf.  we don't know for sure how long we watched it, but when it was ready to leave, it lifted up from the survace of the gulf and rose into the sky at a very fast rate of speed.  no sound, no water dripping off of it, no contrail - just this enormous bright orange ball lifting quickly into the night sky.  from the time it started lifting, to the time we could no longer see it might have been 30 - 45 seconds.  \r\n\r\nstill not another car had passed us the entire time we were pulled to the side of the road.  \r\n\r\nshaking, we pulled back onto the road and continued our travel to panama city.  neither one of us spoke a word.  we dind't know what we had seen, but whatever it was, was not of this earth.  we elected not to go to the carnival, but instead chose to go back to the apartment we had rented and turn on the news to see if anyone had reported anything.  there was nothing on the news.  \r\n\r\nlater that night we asked our friends if they had heard of anyone seeing anything weird in the sky that night.  none had.  we continued listening to news broadcasts to find out if anyone had reported anything?  nothing.\r\n\r\nwe considered reporting it - but thought if no one believed us they might think we were emotionally unstable and get kicked out of air traffic control school at ft. rucker. so we kept it to ourselves.   \r\n\r\nwe talked about it often over the years until sometime in the 80's when i lost touch with gail.  bur if anyone can find her - i'm betting she'll tell you the same story.

towards proctor, tx on hwy 377.When we were almost to the red light to turn onto hwy 377 towards proctor hannah told me to look at the shy because there was something she was seeing that could not be explained. i turned and looked out the passenger  side window and saw an unidentified lighted \"object\" in the sky. the lighted \"object\" can be described as follows: a row of moving lights traveling horizontal in a straight line that appeared to curve or trail off to the right as it would fade. the row of lights was in a set of three a space and three mor lights. the lights were yellowish in color and larger than the stars out as well as larger than the planes and other miscellaneous aircraft in the shy that could be seen. the \"object\" appeared to be closer to the ground because of the difference in six of the lights in comparison. also the lights were very bright.  hannah grabbed her digital camera from her purse and handed it to me. the \"object\" appeared 4 separate times in 4 separate locations. it would be lit up from 5-10 seconds, then disappear and reappear in a different area of the sky. i made a recording on her digital camera of the object upon the second appearance of the unexplainable lights. the lights appeared tw0 more times but i was unable to capture it on camera again due to the fact that i did not know how to work her camera very well and it would disappear by the time i coud get the camera ready. the time between the appearances varied but were around 30 seconds between each one. the fourth and final time there was a space of a couple of minutes. this time the object was in motion moving downward very rapidly. the lights were vertical this time and it did not stay lit up for more than 5 seconds. the sky was completely clear that night as far as weather. when we arrived in proctor, tx, i entered handy's and one of the ladies that worked there asked me if i saw any lights in a joking manner. i was shocked because although i had seen it with my own eyes it was strange/exciting to discover we were not the only ones who saw them. i told the customers and employees around about what i had seen.\r\n\r\nend of

12:50-1:00 am. we were traveling northbound on superior road. when we arrived at the intersection of superior and mayfield road, i immediately noticed the brightest lights i had ever seen. i was a passenger and my brother was the driver. we were  stopped at the the light and i told my brother \"what is that\"!!! he looked at me and i seen the look of terror mixed with uncertainty in his eyes.As we crossed the intersection,there is a heavilywooded area know as ski hill. it sits behind a steep ravine and a basketball court which is at the top of the ravine. still northbound on superior, i told my brother to stop the vehicle. i got out and ran toward the basketball court. as i got closer to trees, i could see plain as day, something hovering behind the trees, and it was coming down into the ravine. i looked back at my brother and he stood outside his car door on total shock. i was so animated, like wtf!! i noticed the lights were not the type of lights that are on any type of helicopter or plane that i had ever seen. i made sure that i got a real (good) look at it too. there were like red circle lights that fluctuated to a bright white and back to red. it never touched the ground. it must have noticed that i seen it, because it started slowly hovering back up, coming out of the ravine. i am keeping my eyes on it as it slowly hovered around the treeline next to the basketball court. i ran toward the street(superior) and  steadily trying to get all the passing cars attention to look at the hovering lights!!! i then got back into the car and told my brother to follow the craft. we made a left on belmar street, another left on rosedale, and another left on to eddington which leads back to superior road. we still see the object and the lights are flickering even faster-still counter-clockwise. it is at least 80 yards above the treeline-making our way back to the intersection of mayfield and the next intersection of mayfield and monticello we still see the object..Then with lightening fast speed it zig-zagged motion and darted east and was gone...We were in awe..And i still get the chills when i talk about it. i finally wanted to come forward because i didnt want to seem crazy. i recently saw on ufo hunters the same object that i seen, was also seen in trumbull county..In 1994!

student on a navigation training flight. we were about 5 miles south of the chesapeake bay bridge heading sw towards bowie at around 10 am. the weather was clear and chilly with very little wind. this was the last leg of the trip and we had descended to 2500 feet and my student was doing well so there was very little for me to do except to help watch for traffic. i noticed traffic, approximately over baltimore, at around 7,000 feet. i'm guessing the angle of elevation was around 60 degrees. it's hard to say for sure what its altitude was because i couldn't make out any shape to tell what it was to help judge distance. it was just a small gray blob; about 1/8 inch at arms length. i pointed it out to my student and he acknowledged it. it was no factor to us and he paid no further attention to it. but i was curious because it didn't seem to be moving and so i kept track of it. on occasion there was a glint of sunlight reflecting from it. i was puzzled because helicopters don't often fly that high and if they do they don't hover. i gawked at it and wondered what they were doing. occasionally it would move a small amount very abruptly, or go up or down just slightly. i didn't think this apparent small amount of motion was due to any atmospheric condition, so it just made me more curious. about 5 minutes into this observation, as i was watching it and wondering what those guys were doing, it shot straight up so fast that i couldn't really track it with my eyes. it was out of sight very quickly. it didn't accelerate, it was just instantly going very fast and i know helicopters can't do that. i don't know of anything that can. this object made no smoke, left no kind of vapor trail, and i looked for a contrail above where it was and never saw one. i am certain that this object was not \"flying\", as in any kind of aerodynamic process, so the term ufo isn't accurate. i don't recall the name of the student that was with me and i don't know if anyone else witnessed this thing or not.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then
