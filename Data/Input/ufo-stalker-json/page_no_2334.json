winter.\r\n\r\ni walked several feet down the parking lot, towards the basketball hoop behind the apartment building.  i look up to see a wedge shaped object, with many flashing lights, hovering, silently.  i did not know what it was.  i stood there and looked at it for just a few seconds before having this 'feeling' (for lack of a better term)... i recall a sense of knowing that this thing was going to leave.  i didn't want it to go.  i reached out and said 'wait, don't go'.  as i reached toward it with my hand, it went from motionless to gone in a zig-zag streak of light.  there was no sound.\r\n\r\nas a point of reference, the apartment building was 3 floors tall and the object was hovering at about three times that height, back and off to the right of where the basketball hoop was located.  if i were to guess the size, i would say that it would have been close to the size of the apartment building.\r\n\r\naside from the obvious, there are some things that i find odd about this:\r\n\r\n1.  i was approximately 8 years old at the time, yet i was not afraid... really, considering the circumstances, i don't recall being terribly surprised to see the thing. \r\n2.  i did not run in and tell my mother about it.  i just went back to where my grandfather picked me up and waited.  i did not tell my grandfather when he arrived, either.\r\n3.  though i never 'forgot' it, i never had a desire to mention it to anyone until just the last few years.  the incident just sort of sat there, in the back of my mind.\r\n4.  shortly after this occurred, i was picked up and taken to my granparents house to get ready for the program and i recall having a headache that was so painful, i was crying and had to cover my eyes because any kind of light made the pain worse.  my grandmother had to put a warm washcloth over my forehead and eyes while i lay on a bed with the lights off.\r\n5.  i don't recall going to the program at school, or much of anything else that

north on interstate 5 for a few miles then proceed east on  highway 120.  during that jog on interstate 5, off to my right (east) i spotted what looked like a meteor coming in.  it had all the speed of the meteors you see in the perseid or leonid meteor showers.  it was much too fast to be a plane, based on my experience in the audience of a few airshows with the thunderbirds, etc.  there was no visible fire with this meteor, although comet shaped, with a tail nearly half way across the visible sky, the \"coma\" and tail appeared to be composed of vapor, like that which comes from the wingtips of a fighter plane executing a really hard turn. the trajectory appeared to be horizontal. within a few seconds, the meteor's coma was directly in front of our lane of traffic.  i looked at it and inside the coma of vapor was a definite mechanical shape.  it was sort of like looking at a disk brake's rotor edge on.  there were maybe six evenly spaced rectangular vents, or windows all along the rectangular body.  the overall color was matte charcoal gray, much like you would expect from a body that went through re-entry. i'm pretty sure what i saw was just a \"peek\" at part of the craft which was mostly obscured by the coma of vapor.  all this time, i was alternatively stealing a glimpse of the unfolding spectacle then rechecking the traffic that flowed along like nothing unusual was happening. about the time i saw the mechanical part of the meteor it was time to move to the right so that i could make the transition onto highway 120 so i lost track of the \"meteor\". i

smoker and i was flicking ashes out the window.  i had the car radio on, but it was not turned up loud and there was no music on---my habit at that time of night was to listen to talk radio.  \r\n\r\nthere were not many cars on the highway with me and i do not remember any cars near me traveling in my direction close to me.  i was focused up ahead as i was nearing the exit.  there were fairly dense trees to my right off the road.  i sensed movement overhead and looked up through my front windshield and just slightly to my right.\r\n\r\ni saw a huge dark triangular shape with red non-blinking lights gliding silently over the treetops, traveling north but almost as if it were following i-77 northbound (but next to the southbound lanes).  (my memory is a little fuzzy about the color of the lights---at times i see red lights in my memory, and at times i see white lights).  it was not directly overhead, but no more than maybe 20-30 feet to my right.  i could clearly see the outline of the craft and remember thinking it was not an airplane.  i also made note of the fact that the lights were solid and not blinking.  i put my window all the way down and could not hear anything---it was completely silent.  i estimate the craft to be about 100 yards across at the widest part.  it was clearly outlined against the moonlit sky.  it did not look metallic from my angle; i had the sense that it was black.\r\n\r\ni turned my attention to the road ahead and drove as quickly as i could to the curving exit ramp.  as i came around the curve of the ramp, i was going to end up facing north.  i looked in the direction i had seen the craft and (as large as it was) i expected to see the back end of it.  i could not locate the craft again and assumed the tree tops were in my way.  \r\n\r\ni looked in the paper and online after my sighting, hoping to see reports of other sightings, but i found nothing.  for a long time i just felt satisfied that i knew what i saw and it was nothing i had ever seen.  after almost 2 years, i���ve decided i want to report my sighting to someone just so my sighting is documented somewhere.  i���m not saying it was extraterrestrial, but it definitely was a ufo because i could not identify it, it was definitely flying, and it was an object.  could it have been a stealth bomber?  my instincts tell me that a stealth bomber is not 100 yards wide, but i have no idea.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:45","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":13738,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.3686645,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11152008-0021","longitude":-81.6379033,"occurred":1170237600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1170237600000,"summary":"I saw a huge dark triangular shape with red non-blinking lights gliding silently over the treetops.

watching the sunset and maybe seeing the \"green flash\" that's common at lower latitudes.  when the sun was very near the horizon and dim enough so that we could stare straight into it, i noticed that the sun seemed to have two oval shaped, black \"eyes\" much like the eyes on the prototypical \"happy face,\" \"have a nice day\" logo. the two vertical ovals were spaced about the right distance apart and their tops were lined up perfectly so that neither was higher on the \"face\" than the other.  someone said, \"oh they must be marine helicopters coming straignt at us.  but i didn't think any helicopter would have a perfectly oval profile.  also, if they were helicopters coming straight at us then the sun would appear to move behind them and pretty soon they would no longer be in a

the entire sun. as it was, the ovals moved with the sun until it had sunk below the horizon.  this would indicate that the earth was turning away from both the sun and the ovals.  i didn't even think about that at the time.  i just knew the ovals were not helicopters or planes.  only within the past month (more than 8 years later) did it dawn on me that only a ufo could be that far out from earth

a building would be so huge. also, there were no roads, dirt or paved leading up to the \"building.\" i had flown over meteor crater in arizona from approximately 30,000 feet. meteor crater is almost a mile in diameter and it appeared to be about the size of a nickle held at arm's length.  this boomerang thing looked about twice that length.  then i notice that the desert floor was moving under it.  that's when i knew that it was hovering and not planted on the ground.  i then pointed it out to my boss, who was seated opposite me.  we both watched the object until it was no longer in sight.

home when suddenly i heard a low humming noise from above me,i stepped off the porch to look up in the sky , when i noticed 7 to 8 bright red lights on what looked like a very large diamond or triangular shaped craft ,it moved very slow ,my house sits on the north east end of the san fernando valley in so. calif. the red lights were stationary and suddenly they began to move rapidly around the edge of the craft in a strobe like fashion , the object moved silently and stealth like in a s/e direction , i rushed in my house to call my wife yolanda and kids and also a friend ,who all came out to see it , i wanted to make sure i had other witnesses, because this was something unlike any thing i have ever seen in my life. my son david asked me dad what is that, and i had no answear.\r\n all this took place within a 7 min. time frame ,once my family and i resumed to observe the object for 20 mins. heading east towards the pacific coast , it moved very slowly ,all of a sudden this large object appeared to seperate into 7 smaller crafts,each had one white light with a red light encircling it very rapidly ,we observed these smaller objects fly off in different directions with one flying back towards our house ,when it was close enough i noticed that it had 4 white  lights on its underside and a single red light going rapidly around it, now here's where it gets more intresting ,this object along with another one headed west over some hills towards veterans park ,where less than an hour later around 10:30pm, a major fire began in the area where i lost sight of these objects the fire has caused evacuations and loss of homes,all the rescue helicopters in the air resembled \"nothing\",i repeat \"nothing\" looked like what my family and i witnessed,did this ufo have something to do with the sayre fire ? i'm feeling excited,and confused,i hope you guys find some answears to these sightings that took place an hour before this horrible fire started. my life will

occurred in hopewell new jersey in the early 1960���s. i was a young child 4-6 years old so it was between 1961-1964.\r\n\r\nmy father and i were driving back from the flemington fair in flemington nj, it was late in the evening and we were cutting through the hopewell nj area to get home to ewing township which is near trenton the state capital. \r\n\r\nthe hopewell area had lots of farms and tree filled areas. the ufo was hovering over a barn about 100 feet over the barn just about 500 linier feet off of the road. it was large about 500 square feet in size. the ufo was cube shaped with a few portholes that looked like windows in the middle around the object. the object had different colored lights around it. some were steady and some were pulsing dimmer and then brighter. \r\n\r\nplease note: i am now 51 years old and in sound mind. but as i am writing this letter with tears streaming from my eyes, i have huge chills flying up my spine. i also feel scared and very uneasy. this happens every time i think about this. i will continue.\r\n\r\nas my father and i drove passed this object i lost my ability to move and talk. i was sitting in the back seat at the time and i was almost totally paralyzed. my father just kept on driving. he did not talk to me at all until we arrived back at our home about 30 minutes later. i had no idea what a ufo was at the time of this sighting and i could not move or talk until my father and i arrived at home. \r\n\r\nafter we arrived home i could then move and talk again. i was hysterical and i cried and cried. i told both of my parents about not being able to move and talk which was mainly why i was freaking out. i also told them about the large object hovering over the barn and i explained that was when the paralyses started. my father never saw a thing and he thought that i was crazy to be acting this way. i can remember my mother yelling at my father telling him that i would not be hysterical for no reason at all and drilling him about what really happened. he just said that he never saw a thing.\r\n\r\nthis is my ufo experience! i often wonder if there was more to this then i can remember because it still affects me so strongly to this day. i am weirdly still afraid that this could re-occur. please share this with others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

bullet-shaped and smaller in size than the airliner.  this account is very similar to the one that occurred earlier in the evening in arizona (posted by the pilot).  because of that post, i decided to add mine, they are both very similar.  what struck me afterwards was whether the pilots or passengers in that airliner had witnessed the same thing. about an hour later, the weirdest ground-level fog

phone.  he ran into the house and told me to come outside, he thought a big animal was in my trees.  i go outside and he described to me what he heard.  as i was looking into my trees, very high in the sky, we saw a moving light floating across the sky.  we paid close attention to it as we knew it wasn't a plane or a helicopter.  the ufo disappeared within about a minute, just gone.  that made us start looking into the sky more.  about 2 minutes later, my cousin dominic pointed south and said 'ufo.'  i looked where he was pointing and in the sky, about a quarter of a mile away, was a huge black isocolese triangular ufo with 8 (i believe, maybe 7 or 9) red lights on the front, left, and right sides, coming at us with the v of the triangle in front, very, very slowly.  at first, it looked like 7 helicopters, with solid red lights, flying in formation next to each other, but that went away as quick as it came.  it was less than 100 feet in the air, and when it got over my backyard, the red lights started blinking very rapidly, like the way the red lights on a modem would blink.  rapid and untamed.  it took about a minute and a half for it to get from one end of my yard to the other, which is about 50 feet, so if you did the math on that you would figure out how fast it was going.  it was from the look of it about a few hundred feet across, and about a few hundred feet in length, and maybe 50 feet in height.  it was solid, perfectly shaped, very black, no sound, very close, we could see the technology which theres not much to say other than it was perfectly smooth and black, and the way it flew was unlike anything i have ever seen.  it glided straight, thats the best way to describe the way it flew.  it didn't fly unnaturally, that's probably the hardest thing to describe.  to get a visual, picture taking a backwards checkmark, giving it depth, painting it black, taking it off the page and pointing the 'check' at you, and putting red lights across the front of it, and making it the size i speak of, and you would be able to visualize what i, my cousin, the people across the street, and other randoms in my neighborhood saw tonight.  my cousin was calm about seeing this.  i was scared.  very scared.  i have never seen anything that big in my life save for a skyscrapper.  when you see something that big flying that close to you, knowing what it is, its petrifying.  i did not get a good feeling about it.  i would say its one of the, if not the most frightening thing i've ever seen in my life and to be completely honest i'm scared to go in my backyard alone.  when it got over my backyard was when the lights started blinking, which i got the feeling that they wanted us to know they saw us maybe or something, i didn't think that was coincidence but logic would assume it was.  i don't know what to say about that part of it, but that's the part that made me scared, that mixed with the slow pace and the closeness to me and my house.  i could've hit that thing with a slingshot, thats how close it was.  very, very scary.  we tried to film it but we didn't have time.  we wanted to see it.  we didn't get our cameras till it had past our house, and we caught the back of it on film with the lights in the front blinking, but it didn't come out too good at all.  in the hopes of filming it, we got in my cousins car and chased after it.  but with traffic at that time in la mixed with the other things in the sky we saw that night (which i believe there to have been more ufo's but i cannot confirm that because they were only distant lights in the sky), we lost it.  we ended up going to the park on woodley ave by my house to look at the other things we saw in the sky.  another thing i want to point out is that by the time we got to woodley park there were dozens of helicopters and planes in the sky.  dozens.  they were everywhere.  it was like an invasion of our own air force.  but, either way, we did lose sight of it and ended up going home.  we played back the footage we took but nothing came out.  i wish it did.  but other than testimony of me and at least 4 other people i know, there isn't any evidence of this other than my 911 call.  personally, it was a life altering event, truly.  i don't know if you got other reports about this thing tonight, but hopefully mufon can do what they do and find some evidence.  good luck.
