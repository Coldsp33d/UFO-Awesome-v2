altitude of approximately 1000 to 2000 feet and for a distance of 1/2 mile to 1 mile before disappearing.   there was a minor cloud cover on thursday evening, and it was well below that. the ufo was

ufo sightings that depict a saucer shaped object.  the craft was small.  seemed to look just like a small bullet-shaped cockpit with a \"tail\".  similar to shape of a single sperm cell with an illuminated cockpit.\r\n   9.  the craft traveled at a speed much slower than a shooting star but still faster than any known manmade craft.  i estimate the speed at mach 2 to mach 3.  \r\n\r\ni am a

minute and looked up standing\r\non my concrete porch.  i saw this silvery white line, like the ones that\r\nthey shine up in the sky to adverise a store's opening.  only this one was\r\npartly in the sky and above the ground.  it was slanted like when \r\nsomeone draws a white line, but the line was the size of the objects. i thought how weird as i saw it with naked eye.  than i went inside got my binoculars and peered thru them.  i saw the most incredible sight - one shiny sparkling light just sparkled back and fro, pulsating,a third of the way thru the top line and the other sparking sparkle was about a block down sparkled back at it and the white line extended on.\r\n\r\n it was if both of them were sparkling at each other the same time and\r\nthe one on the bottom, there was still a line below it, it was as if\r\nboth lights were on this strand of white light suspended in space.  i\r\nwatched it for a good five minutes or so and than all a sudden the line\r\njust dropped swiftly with both lights still intact, almost like a smooth\r\npiece of thread but this was a heavier bigger thread the size of the \r\nsparkles and it just floated every so smoothly all the way down until\r\nit disappeared behind a clump of trees.  at this point, i couldn't see\r\nbecause the trees and surrounding landscape covered everything.  it was\r\nso beautiful.  i have never seen such a display.  it was almost as if\r\nthese two round sparkles were magnetized to each other.  i could not\r\nunderstand how both of them could stand upside down in space one in\r\nfront of the other, sparkle at each other at the same time and than\r\nslowly everything white line and sparkles all float down at the same\r\ntime.  i called the faa, today and they had nothing in the skies.  i\r\ncalled and the police came out and went to check.  i drew a picture and\r\nleft it at the police dept.  \r\n   i do not believe those objects were planes, satellites or etc.\r\nfrom here.  they

facing me. we were talking about something when i saw a bright orange-yellow sphere break through the clouds and shoot towards the earth.\r\ni yelled out \"holy s@#t!!\" and pointed directly at the object. when i did this my co-worker instantly spun around to see what i was pointing out. almost instantly he yelled out \"holy s@#t!!\" just as i had done.\r\nthe object was heading almost straight towards the ground, but at a slight angle, and it was going faster than any airplane or helicopter i have ever seen. it actually appeared to be accelerating the entire way down. i looked for any flashing navigation lights but there were none. it was just a solid orange-yellow sphere,no tail, not pulsating or anything of the sort. i am pretty sure that the object was between myself and the mountain range by tooele, but there is a chance i'm mistaken about that fact(it may have been behind the mountains). the reason i'm almost positive it was in front of the mountains is because of how far i was able to follow the object before it dissapeared. if it were behind the mountains i would have lost sight of it a lot sooner. at the speed it was traveling there is no way any conventional aircraft would have been able to make this manuever without hitting the ground, but there was no explosion or sound at all. that is when the object left my field of view.\r\ni then asked my co-worker if he saw what i saw and he confirmed that what he saw was no conventional aircraft. he and i both used the term ufo simultaneously. after the sighting we were both too excited to say anything, we just ran to where we thought we might be able to get another look of the craft and stood there stairing for about ten more minutes. after we were fairly certain it wasn't going to make another appearance we went back inside and i instantly took notes of the time, and details of what we saw. \r\ni live in an area that is very heavy with air traffic so i know the behaviors of airplanes...And

went dark or possibly dissipated entirely. this happened 3 more times, i told my wife to go get the camera.  when the object neared the point of being directly over us, it looked to me as though it just dissapeared. when i stated this, my friend corrected me and said: \"no, it's lights are just off\". at that point i could make out the dark triangular shape in the sky as it passed over our house. when we went to the other side of the house, it could no longer be seen.

myself were sitting around eating while talking. i was facing the back of my mothers yard when i noticed a orangish-yellow light move out from behind the tops of a tree. it had no shape other than being a light. i wasn't sure if it were some sort of firework. so i watched it for a few seconds. the light moved along the street it was above and seemed to have turned at the intersection. there was no wind to explain its odd movement. after a few shocked seconds i told my cousins about it. they all sort of laughed about it but i told them it was still there. they turned and seen it as well. we watched the light travel down the road it turned on until it vanished from sight. we all were talking about it for a few minutes when i noticed a second light appear about the same place as i seen the first. the second light followed the same course as the first. the second light had me stumped so i walked to the back fence of the yard to try to get a better look. again the second shape had no shape other than a light. in shape i mean no body like a plane or such. just a bright light. it was daylight out so it was bright enough to stand out in daylight. i again watched the light travel until it vanished from sight. due to distance i would think since i didn't see it go up or down. several times i've thought maybe it was those parachutes with the little flares on them you shoot off around the 4 of july. only things that keep me from believing that is there was no wind and they turned at the intersection at a right angle.\r\n\r\ni had a second (or third if you count the first as two.) sighting on october 25, 2008. my girl-friend, my daughter, nephew, and i were coming home from a birthday party (around 8 p.M.). we had just turned off holt road onto morris street heading west. we went about a block to a block and a half when i looked out the car window (passenger side window.)and noticed a bright redish-orange light about 100 to 150 feet in the air. i told my girl-friend to look at it. we passed it up so i only got to see it for a few seconds. if it moved it did so at a really slow rate of speed. it didn't seem to have moved at all from first seeing it until i lost it to the tree line. my girl-friend dropped me off at home and left to go to a family members house when she called me and told me there were now three of the lights where we seen the first. from the time we last seen the first light until she called me about the three lights was about 5 minutes.","distance":"101-500

the golf course.  we were on barbara ave the golf course was to our backs.  i turned around to look at the kids and i looked up and saw this large object just as it went over the tree line.  i told my neice and my mom to look.  my daughter saw it when we pointed it out. i am unclear of the distance or really the shape of the object because the only thing we noticed were the lights.  the best way that i could describe them was they were in the shape of a pringle's potato chip or the brim of a cowboy hat but the lights were white and flowed kinda like trickling water.  we did not hear anything because it was high in the sky.  we did not watch it long because we saw the back part of it as it was going over the tree tops.  when the kids got back on the golf cart we drove down rebecca dr because it is more of an open area and less lighting.  but we never saw it any more.  i have no idea what it was but i know it was not a plane or helicopter.  my grandaddy said that it could have been a dirigible but the two shapes they have here in georgia are of a ball shape and a rocket shape.  this was not shaped like either.  i really did not have a reaction to it other than curiosity.  i just want to know what it was.  the uploaded file is a picture i downloaded from the internet but it's the best way that i can describe the shape.  the curved line above the bottom line in the picture is the exact shape.  i know it sounds crazy describing it this way but thats the best example i can find.","distance":"Over One

and its very country no airports or anything but trees and a few houses. i notice a huge thing coming from my left with 3 huge lights in the front. the bulbs lookied like they could be 6 ft or so in diamiter. this thing was only about 100 ft above the trees. i pulled over n got out of my car and tried to get a photo of it on my phone but i couldnt get the camera to turn on fast enough.  this thing had no sound at all hardly. very faint.As it got directly above me the 2 out side lights turned off n the middle one stayed on. i could see the beems from the lights through the fog or mist that was in the air n it traveled about 3-4 football fields distance infront of the thing flying. it flew very very slowly and kept going over me. i hung up with my girlfriend and called my mother to see if she could see it from her house in the next town over . she said she couldnt. so i called my uncle and he said he thought he could but in a distance. after a few min it disapeared behind the tree line and i could no longer see it. i have kept this to my self other than the few people that i told that night. then i heard about you and i thought i should tell u . the way i heard about u was on tv. also on a different show on tv you were on, i saw a re creation of the exact thing i saw. or atleast similar to what you recreated with extreamly close detail . i dont get on my email much but i do get on it.  i hope to hear from u and posibly figure this out. thank you very much. jason madara                                                                                        p.S. i forgot to mention i used to work for a major air line refuling pass jets and luggage and i know this wasnt any thing of that sort, it much much bigger. it scared me pretty good. i honestly did not have any clue what i was seeing. to this day i still think about it. and i still look to see if i will see it again and have not.","distance":"20 Feet or
