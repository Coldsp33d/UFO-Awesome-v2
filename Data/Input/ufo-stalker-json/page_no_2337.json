to gp home for the day. 2 boys looked out the window and said \"what is that\"? i thought that they were watching people outside the building or birds flying in the air. i walked over to the window and watched something that was expelling exhaust from the tail end. i then watched this object fly across the sky, get lost in front of the sun's glare and emerge more clearly to see what the boys had seen- that there was a dark grey straight line in front (it was making a shadow in front of itself), and it was expelling white exhaust from the back. it was hard to see what exactly was between the grey frontal shadow and the exhast, or if teh frontal shadow was indeed an \"object\". at the time, i made sure to look around the sky and saw 2 commercial airplanes flying normally under the \"object\". one of the boys said \"it looks like a missle\"- i had to agree. the \"missle\" was much higher in the air than the 2 planes, and was much much faster. it was heading south, but angled in an upwards direction. the three of us watched the sky until the \"missle\" was out of our sight. the bell rang, the kids were dismissed to the busses, and i remanined watching the white exhaust lines in the sky wondering what it was that i just witnessed. the sun was now making a circular rainbow glow in the sky that i still could see driving down the parkway on my way home. it was quite a strange

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Beaumont ca - while waiting in line to enter oak valley parkway (closest intersection beaumont ave) just as the night was getting dark, significant high cloud cover, i looked east to check traffic. my intended path was west, eventually south on beaumont ave. i looked east to check the safety of moving into traffic and happened to notice what i thought initially was a plane flying pretty much right above oak valley heading west from cherry ave., appx 1/2 mile away. the plane seemed rather low flying, maybe 200 feet in the air. i defined it as a plane due to the configuration of the lighting, wingtip lights both horizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\ntraffic was not clear, so i continued to scan east. i then noticed the plane had not traveled very far, maybe 1 block at best, for how low and close it was. the distance from cherry ave to beaumont ave is appx 5 blocks, a plane would normally overtake that quickly. apparently i was mistaken, it had to be a helicopter based on this information. i then observed the \"helicopter\" make close turns over the blocks surrounding the area to the south, very close turns. this reinforced my thought it was a helicopter.\r\n\r\nat this moment, looking at the configuration of the lights, i realized the layout was wrong for a chopper. i rolled my window down as i entered the roadway heading west to listen - not a sound. i heard no noise from any traditional airplane or helicopter. i am now in line for the turn at beaumont ave, craning my neck into my mirror and alternatively pivoting to see the craft over the area behind me. the vehicle has not really moved far from its original area, seemingly circled and returned to its original path. the lights did not blink like normal aircraft and was missing the really bright fast blinking white light i usually see on civilian aircraft.\r\n\r\nthe night was dark enough i could not make out the body of the vehicle, possibly. the lights were as follows: 4 red lights, 2 of which were not visible at all times apparently due to the orientation at the back(?) of the vehicle to my view, 2 lights on each wing tip(guess?) blinking at a very slow pace not in synch with each other (in fact one blinked off time with the other to eventually blink in unison for seconds, then well out of synch the remainder of the time). finally 2 \"headlight\" oriented lights, yellow/green in color and unchanging. none of these lights seemed to illuminate the vehicle in any way.\r\n\r\ni had no option to stop longer and watch, for safety's sake. i had to make the turn and continue on. my destination was the corner of beaumont ave and 7th st, appx a mile away.\r\n\r\nas i exited my vehicle at 7th st. i heard the familiar and incredibly noticeable blade noise of a helicopter heading my way. i could hear it well over a mile away, not military (as they usually are really loud and booming). as the chopper flew overhead i clearly saw the outline of the vehicle, its lighting not only appropriately spaced for a helicopter but also consisting of a familiar standard white quick-blinking light identifying it to me as a vehicle i am sure is just a helicopter. the white blinking light even illuminated the tail section. obviously much of this was markedly different from the craft i had seen moments earlier.\r\n\r\ni returned to the area where my first sight of the craft occurred 15 minutes later, no luck in seeing the craft again.\r\n\r\ni initially thought this was a standard aircraft, from a quick look. by the time i had made my left turn to head south on beaumont ave, i was somewhat concerned as the vehicle did not fit my expectations of an aircraft i knew. my family and i attend airshows regularly here in southern california. nothing related to my sighting made me feel comfortable in the thought it was a known vehicle, but nothing made me feel it was extra-terrestrial in any sense either. it could be experimental, but i cannot fathom why the test would go forward in this sleepy town, at night, in sight of a large group of people protesting prop 8.\r\n\r\ni have attached my photoshop representation of my initial view of this craft. again, i could not see a shape, so this is all based on the light pattern.\r\n","distance":"101-500

site i experienced a very strong electric...Drank to much coffee feeling until we crossed a certain point on the site. on the way out..(dark) i recieved a call that i had to go to work. shortly there after while still driving a yellowish large orb was pointed out to me where early i was told to look and there was nothing there. passenger in my truck used my surefire flash light and started blinking the light at the orb. orb stayed stationary. however shortly there after it seemed to release smaller sat ships. total sat ships counted was 7. at this point i was still not a believer. we parked the truck and after 10 mins or so of observing the sat ships i shut the truck off and turned off the lights.\r\ni then exited the truck and stood at the left front corner and observed 4 sat ships flying a stacked 45 degree formation. sat ship 5 was in this general area flying a diff path and making short but extremely fast directional course changes. these 5 sat ships were behind and to the right side of the truck. the 2 remaining sat ships flying to the right front of the truck. number 6 slowly came up over a hill and i was still thinking it was a helicopter until as it stopped at the top of the hill. it stayed stationary for a few minutes and then did a zip to my right which covered at least 10-20 miles in almost the blink of an eye. at this time i was in shock and utter awe of what was unfolding in front of me. i then turned to get a visual of sat ship 7 and it was now turning and flying slow like that of a cessna and then crossed over the top of my position at the front of the truck at a 45 degree angle and slightly of to my left and held that heading until it reached a hill behind me and then made a lateral zip of 15-20 degrees in the sky. out of all the 7 sat ships one appeared to be a control ship and this was made mention to me by the passenger. i also observed that these sat ships were like small orbs that blinked a red light to mimic our standard faa accident avoidance lights on all aircraft. the sat ships were also very bright....Not a white light but a high intensity crystal bright light. the passenger repeatedly flashed the sat ships with mentioned flashlight which resulted in several of the sat ships changing the red light to an orange and then yellow light. at this point i had to pry myself away and make myself get back into the truck to head to work. as we got onto hwy 6/50 and started heading back to town the passenger noted 1 sat ship seemed to be following the trucks movements on the far side of the highway...Ie: matching pace...Stopping and restarting.\r\nduring the drive back to town as the passenger was keeping a watchful eye on said sat ship my cell phone rang. i was unable to get to it in ample time to take the call. when i reviewed the missed call it was an odd number and no voice mail message was left. after 2 or 3 mins of mulling around the idea i called the odd number back. i recieved an automated verizon cell message stating the number was not in service. the phone number was 1-754-777-7777. the correlation to 7 numbers and since all the digits were 7's seemed to be more than a coincedence. that night when i arrived at the job site i did do a google search for the number and found more than a few references to the number and the general thought that the number belonged to onstar and or xm sat radio. but there was no confirmation of this found during the search.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13676,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.227409,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11122008-0005","longitude":-108.863503,"occurred":1224904500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1224904500000,"summary":"Mother

so more in the area. moving again off of any flight path. they were flying in every direction...Slow and steady. the lights were blinking bright white, red and green and seemed to flow in a circular motion. i took back roads home through radnor, strafford, and then to newtown sq. as i was driving i was looking up in the sky and these object seemed to be consistant two and three of them together at a time. when i pulled in my driveway i could still see them...To the north west of newtown sq (king of prussia pa area). there were two that seemed to be either circling or going back and forth in the northwest sky up until 9..Which is the last time i looked. ive never been into ufo's as a matter of fact, i wished i hadnt looked up tonight because now im scared to death. had to post though. i had to share this weird experience and see if others in the area may have seen the same phenomenon. the only person i shared with is my son..He saw them also. yeah...I wont be sleeping tonight...Guess

after my monday night class, which should have been around 9:20 local time. i was heading east from campus and as i got to a parking lot i saw two bright objects slowly floating down above a cloud, which appeared to be east of the campus. these objects were mostly white, perhaps with a dull yellowish tint, with a glow around the brighter center. at first i thought it was a meteor breaking up, (they were close together) but they continued to fall slowly, keeping shape and drifting in and out from each other. i was able to watch them for about 30 seconds until they disappeared behind the cloud. i���m guessing conservatively that they were anywhere from 5,000-20,000 feet in the air. \r\n\tafter they disappeared i began to search the sky because of the excitement and within probably 30 seconds of losing the first formation i saw something completely different, but much more intriguing. i saw, a formation of about 6-7 objects traveling in a checkmark formation across the sky. these objects looked like they were in orbit, and appeared like dashes ( - ) compared to the stars. this formation traveled from west to east, keeping a checkmark formation the entire time. i followed the

(see dep1).\r\n\r\nanyway, i yelled to my son to look up and he saw them as well. he also happened to have his binoculars with him (remember, we were there train spotting) and immediately had a closer look. a moment after he began watching them through his binoculars, they began moving on a generally sse heading. as they proceeded, they maneuvered around each other in a leisurely fashion, with the light surrounding the two ufos changing in both color and intensity. \r\n\r\nwe kept passing the binoculars back and forth watching in amazement as the two ufos tracked southward. then, from the north east came speeding a third ufo, identical to and joining up with the first two. shortly after the 3rd object arrived, they arranged themselves in the shape of a perfect equilateral triangle, then became perfectly motionless, simply hovering in complete silence. they stayed motionless for perhaps 10 seconds or so. (see dep2) they then began spinning around, once again in unison, then stopped - in unison - and continued along, moving ��� you guessed it - in perfect unison, on the sse heading. it should be noted that when they were spinning, they did so at a velocity sufficient to make these three distinct objects blur into what appeared to be a circle of solid, bluish-white light.\r\n\r\nfollowing the preceding display, they didn���t stay in the triangle shape for long. as they proceeded along their course, two of the three objects shifted their position relative to the third and formed a perfectly straight line. imagine an arrow in flight and you���ve got the idea.\r\n(see dep3).\r\n\r\nat one point, while my son & i were passing the binoculars back & forth one of the 3 ufos took off for parts unknown, but neither of us saw which direction it headed. the remaining two continued heading southward, eventually disappearing from sight.\r\n\r\n== analysis ==\r\n\r\nthese craft were in possession of a propulsion system far in advance of anything current earth-sourced technology can produce. their navigation was intelligently controlled and their movement was at all times purposeful. \r\n\r\nthe glow surrounding these craft was clearly the result of a plasma, arising in turn as a result of ionized, excited air molecules surrounding the craft. the glow had no characteristics not attributable to a plasma. the varying of both color & brightness resulted from varying energy levels and energy amounts, respectively, of the ionizing radiation produced by the ufo���s propulsion system. \r\n\r\nregarding this, the energy the electrons impart to each photon determines the wavelength, and thus color emitted, from 1.65 ev (red) all the way up to 3.26 ev (blue) or more. as well, with the increase of activation energy per unit area/second (power/unit area) generated in the vicinity of the craft comes naturally an increase in apparent brightness of the plasma. \r\n\r\nmaneuvers requiring increased thrust were always preceded by an increase in the plasma brightness, with a concomitant shift in the \"tone\" of the light emitted from a warmer (amber) white to a bluish-white.  regardless of the thrust required at any particular moment, the plasma remained sufficiently well developed that at all times it exceeded a critical-distance thickness (a few feet)  rendering it opaque to the light of its own emission frequencies. another words, the craft remained obscured by the plasma it generated. at no time were i or my son able to discern the actual object enveloped by the plasma, even with the aid of his binoculars. \r\n\r\nbased on the empirically-derived evidence provided by this sighting i can only conclude the three craft employed a vectored wave filed propulsion system, something that is, to my knowledge, beyond the reach of current earth-sourced technology. at no point did any of the ufos demonstrate any performance\\flight characteristics not consistent with the application of a vectored wave field propulsion system.\r\n\r\n== conjecture ==\r\n\r\ni���d like to wrap this up by offering some observations for which i can offer no supporting evidence, empirical or otherwise. another words, what follows is a collection of personal opinions, which may be right or completely wrong. \r\n\r\nwhen i first observed the 2 ufos directly overhead, i got the sense they were watching something. as to the questions what they were watching and why i thought they were watching something, i don���t think i���ll ever know the answer. as an aside, i���d prefer to think it coincidence that when i first spotted the ufos they were positioned relative to one another in a fashion identical to how my son & i were positioned (he was to my right and just a bit in front of me). \r\n\r\nwhen the 3rd ufo joined up with the original 2, they did so over a large garbage dump. i don���t know if it was coincidence or if this carried some significance. i also got the sense the three ufos were exchanging information. i should repeat here this is just personal opinion and i have no way of proving any of this.\r\n\r\nthe flight path chosen neatly skirted around buffalo and took them in a direction heading for the hills of eastern pennsylvania, which i thought would be ideal if minimizing the chance\r\nof detection was important. \r\n\r\nlast, this is

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was at home on a break from work when my wife looked out the kitchen window and said, \"oh, look! there is a ufo in the sky!\" \"ya, sure.\" i replied thinking she was joking. \"no!\" she responded, \"for real!\" she then said she thought they might be balloons again. the past several weeks we had some balloons from local functions in the community escape that could possibly fool some people at a glace.\r\n\r\ni went to the window and took one good look and new instantly these where not balloons. there were three bright white shimmering objects straight south approx 30 degrees elev. they were in the shape of a triangle with the top center one the brightest and almost appeared to be two overlapping. i would compare it to the brightest star or planet such as venus and approx 3 times larger in the sky. the lower left was very bright but not as big. the lower right one was half as bright as the left one and a little closer to the top one.\r\n\r\ni told my wife to keep watching while i got my video camera. canon xh-a1 hi-def set at 1080i 60i fps. by the time i grabbed the camera, inserted the battery and an hd dv tape and got outside to the patio to start filming, a good minute had pasted. i set the camera to full auto mode so i would not wast anymore time making manual adjustments. by profession i am a videographer and an independant filmmaker. i do alot of \"gun and run\" or \"shoot and scoot\" at weddings and events. this camera does very well in those uncontrolled environments. i asked my wife to get my tripod in hopes of getting a nice steady shot. in the mean time i steadied myself against the patio support post. the camera has a 20x optical zoom and would need to be as steady as possible on full zoom. i did have to turn on one stop on the nd filter plus there was no uv filter on the lens, fyi.\r\n\r\nas i filmed i noticed that there was a fouth object to the lower right of the other three and the three were in a wider upside down \"v\" patteren much like three aircraft in formation with the fourth man out military style, excecept if this were the case of actual airplains then they would be comming towards us, these seemed to remain in a fixed possition in the sky with no direction of travel. i noted that all high altitude jet aircraft that day were leaving very heavy vapor trails, these had none.\r\n\r\nas my wife returned with the tripod the objects started to fade in and out and the camera started to have problems staying in focus lock and i was having a hard time keeping in frame with the view finder. the objects instantly disappeared. i had a total of 46 seconds of actual video of the objects.\r\n\r\ni down loaded the video into my computer using sony vegas pro-8 software. upon evaluating the video on an hd monitor i could see that my camera took a little longer than normal to focus lock on the objects when i zoomed in. once it did i could see they had more of a white cigar shape with a faint blury smear to the left of each. the left object was now not as bright as the right and closer to the top one while the right one was a little further away and not as bright as it was when viewed at the kitchen window. halfway through the video i could see the fourth object got very bright at on point then faded with the others. when played in slow motion i could see a definate pulsing of the white light which seemed to totally surround whatever the object was at times.\r\n\r\ntowards the end of the video and enlarging the frames or zooming in tighter with the editing software, it appeared the bright white was fading and an actual object was taking form. on the last few frames zoomed in it almost looked like an airplane with no tail fin. a center body with left and right wings but no center fin. the camera could no longer hold focus and they where gone.\r\n\r\nat the beginning of the video i marked a reference point on one of the tree branches to the top center object. near the end of the video i marked the same two points. the objects were in the same position and angle on the screen indicating to me they had not changed position through the whole scene clip.\r\n\r\nabout an hour later a high altitude commercial jet was passing over to the north of us and the sun was reflecting off of it similar to the bright white light of the four objects except the jet was leaving a heavy vapor trail. curious, i grabbed my camera again and did a test shot to compair. the camera instantly focus locked when zoomed. i could make out every detail of the jet liner. the body, the wings, the tail and even the nose shape. the bright glare from the body was clearly distinguishable but not interfearing with the details of the craft. the glare was not pulsing or seperating.\r\n\r\nsince this event i have not found anyone who wittnessed the same in order to get validation and a position triangulation. it is my feeling that these objects were very far away and not in the local proximity. possibly so far that the atmosphere may have been playing tricks on light and magnification. also the sun would not have been side reflecting off them since they were to the south and not to the north like the jet was.\r\n\r\ni have been a photographer and videographer for over 20 years and shot a lot of aircraft and things in the sky both nightime and daytime. i have always beleived that most everything can be explained and have. however, i do know that sometimes an anomaly may occure that the common person cannot identify or explain. right now i cannot identify or explain this one. in all my years of expereance in the navy, a nasa certified electonics inspector during the apollo program, a law enforcement officer, envolvment in space communications programs, photography and videography this one caught me totaly by surprise and slightly unprepaired for the expereance.\r\n\r\nif you can come up with any information that would explain what this was\r\nor even what it definitly was not it would be greatly appreciated by my wife and i.\r\n\r\nthank you.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":13656,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.8857922,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11102008-0031","longitude":-111.7479521,"occurred":1226172720000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,

the interface ate my text, and i was too angry to type it again. btw mufon people, please use a better interface, thanks.\r\n\r\ni work on an airport, my office has a large window looking toward the runway and the wood area behind it.\r\non october 3, i was talking with a friend and looking in the direction of the window. i suddenly noticed a bright sunlight that was reflected on a shiny surface, it was something that was flying/gliding above ground.\r\ni first attributed it to an helicopter or a small aircraft in the aerodrome circuit, but when watching closely i noticed it was none of these. the object glided behind a patch of trees on a hill. i waited to see if it was reappearing on the other side of the hill but it never reappeared. the total observation time was approx. 5 seconds.\r\nthe object was spherical, exactly like the cockpit on a small helicopter (like a bell 47 for example) but there was no \"body\" behind it and no rotor either, only the sphere. the sun was reflected on it like it would be on a car windshield or a cockpit (it was a very bright day, and it is a carribean island).\r\nthe size and appearance were very much like a helicopter cockpit (i'd say 1.5 meters in diameter) it was flying above the ground, approx. 10 meters above and at the level of the trees. it was going very fast, i would estimate the speed to about 100 kilometers per hour or faster, faster than a small aircraft taking off or landing, but there was a strange quality to the flight, it seemed like it was almost gliding , it looked also as if it was slightly bouncing on the air, like a rock ricocheting on the surface of water.\r\n\r\ni could see no details or colors on the object because of the bright reflection. the appearance was like a cockpit or maybe a big weather balloon. \r\ni don't think that it was a weather balloon because it was going very fast and it was going in the exact opposite direction of the wind. it was moving parallel to the runway but behind it, outside of the airport.\r\nif i had to extrapolate its movement backwards, it's almost as it was coming from the sea inland (the airport is close to the sea).\r\nhelis generally don't fly in that area and altitude, and it was not a plane (or it would have crashed). i also rule out any object moved by the wind (like a balloon or a kite) because of speed and movement against wind.\r\nat the distance it was and behind the heavy soundproof window, there was no possibility for me to listen to a possible noise.\r\ni was alone to make this observation.\r\n\r\ni work on airports, it's the second time i report something unusual on this website. for the other report, search the database for an event in france in 1993.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

they had to be the brightest in the sky. the lights didn't move, as i wathed them i noticed what looked like a small satellite light passing by the lights. the sat light kept moving in a straight line until i couldn't focus on it anymore. then i looked back at the two bright lights. another sat light was passing the two lights.. at this time i started thinking something was kinda weird.. that sat light moved passed the lights almost like it was following the previous sat light. after i couldn't see the sat light anymore, the two bright lights started to dim until they vanished. i was pretty excited to see something so strange, cause about two nights before i saw something else very ufo like...\r\n\r\n   two days ago i think. i was walking home from work.. it was about 7:30pm and i was halfway home walking through woodward park. i decided to look up at the sky, and i saw something. to me at first it looked like a shooting star, and i can't explain it quite right but it looked like instead of falling it was going up?? or like horizonaly towards me?? i didn't have much time to think about it because as soon as the light dissapeared it reapeared and shot in a different 90 degree

at 8:00 in the evening.  i was loading food into the back of my van and after loading my first load i turned to go back in and get a second load.  my eyes as i turned were immediately drawn to three bright amber lights, bright and large in the sky that shone towards where i was standing.  the light didn't reach to where i was standing, like in a flood light.  my van faced kind of south, thus when i was standing next to the side of my van i was kind of east.  the lights were above the tree line, just almost at a 45 degree angle up.  i stood for a moment trying to figure out why a plane was so low and then realized it was not moving, just there in the sky with these very bright amber lights.  i called my husband to come out.  he came out and saw the same thing.  suddenly the lights went out and all i could see was a small green flashing light.  it started moving towards the southeast, fairly quickly.  when suddenly a second set of lights came in.  at first we thought it was an airplane as it was blinking the green light, but, all of the sudden there were three bright amber lights show on it.  then, all of the sudden the first object was back in the same location with its three amber lights on.  they faced each other with their three amber lights on and it was like they both just sat there.  suddenly a plane came from the direction of the airport, which would be the direction the second object came from, kind of puttering along, like a small engine plane.  first we thought it might be a third object, but as soon as we heard the puttering, we realized it was truly a plane, not an object.  then we realized we hadn't heard any noise from these other objects which all of the sudden, as soon as we heard the puttering, turned off their amber lights, both put on their green blinking light (only one green light on each object)and the first object zipped away (literally was gone in a flash) to the southeast and in about three, maybe four blinks was gone; the second object did the exact same thing except it went to the northeast.  the puttering plane continued on its journey to the southwest.  we stood there for a moment, just watching the sky, wondering what we really had just seen.  neither one of us saw anymore than the amber/green lights...Could not see the shape of the object or any thing else about it.  the whole event lasted about ten minutes.  neither myself nor my husband had any feelings of being scared or even nervous about what we had seen; it was a feeling of being curious.  after standing outside another 5-6 minutes, we resumed our packing and one more time, before we left, we gazed up into the sky to see if we saw anything else; we didn't.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
