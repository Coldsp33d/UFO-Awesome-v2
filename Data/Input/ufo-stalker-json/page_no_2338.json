(note:  my neighborhood is not in any flight path in or out of the airport.)  after the call, i went back outside and the lights were gone.  a few minutes later, a couple of police officers stopped by to check this out further.  in response to their questions, i confirmed to them i had not been drinking, was not on any medication, etc.  i explained what i saw and said i simply wanted to know what the lights were.  the officers were apologetic, respectful and i felt they believed me.  they said they would keep an eye out for these lights during the remainder of that

11/09/2008 and prior to that on 10/24, 10/25/08 and 08/03/08.  my background is highly technical and i have been around aircraft and helicopters all of my life.\r\n\r\non 10/24/08 at approx 2300 i went outside to retrieve something from my truck and as i returned to the house my attention was caught by a fast flashing star (i thought) above a tree line.  i had seen this type of star twice before, once in beebe, arkansas above a dirt racing track while racing was being held and again in galveston , texas shortly before hurricane ike.\r\n\r\nthe two previous sightings of this odd type ���star��� showed no overt movement and i attributed any change in location due to the earth���s rotation.\r\n\r\nhowever as i looked at the latest ���star��� object on 10/24���it wobbled. i immediately thought the wobbling was due to my own head movement, so i pressed my head against the cab of my truck to steady my equilibrium. \r\n\r\nthe ���star��� object still wobbled so i yelled for my girl friend to come outside quickly to verify what i was seeing. she indeed verified the movement i saw. that���s when i ran to get my camcorder.\r\n\r\nwhile i was mounting the camera on the tripod my girlfriend shouted that the star went below the tree line.. as i went back outside she stated now it���s coming back up above the tree line had it been a windy night i would attribute the wobbling to be movement of the trees. however, there was absolutely no wind. cool crisp, clear night. zero cloud cover.\r\n\r\ni taped the ���star��� as best i could and we returned to the project we were working on, with the intention of checking on the ���star��� in a few minutes. which we did and it was gone.\r\n\r\nthe ���star��� flashes quite rapidly, giving off red, blue, green, yellow, white, orange colors in rapid sequence.  almost as a beacon to make sure it is seen. the area where it was hovering is a major flyway for commercial aircraft. and, in fact, several aircraft did fly overhead during the sighting.\r\n\r\nthe ���star��� was seen again the next night by my girlfriend and myself. we joked ���there���s our friend again���. it was above an event we were hosting. same atmospheric conditions..\r\n\r\ni am curious if other people are noticing these odd ���stars���.\r\n\r\nby the way, i was able to tape all three ���star��� events.. not the greatest quality but i have them.\r\n\r\nin addition, on 11/9/2008, my girlfriend and i were on our way to dinner at a benton restaurant. my friend was driving. time, approximately 5 pm. three commercial aircraft were in single file in the flyway above benton, arkansas heading southwest. i had binoculars with me and was watching the 3 aircraft, when i noticed a dark object in the direction of the aircraft through the binoculars.  we pulled over in a parking lot westbound on i-30 to observe more closely.\r\n\r\nthe object was not visible at all with the naked eye and only with binoculars. the object was at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizon. my friend had more powerful binoculars and was able to see the object also and it appeared to be stationary and hovering. we observed the dark object for a few minutes and then decided to move westward on the i-30 service road to see if we could get closer.  after a couple of miles we pulled over again in a vacant parking lot and again observed the object.  either the object had moved toward us or it was hovering and we had driven closer to it.  it was now at an angle of approximately 75 degrees above the horizon.  my friend said she saw a white light on the object. i did not see a light. however she had more powerful binoculars than i.\r\n\r\nthe object was clearer at the second location and appeared to me to be a black triangular shape at altitude unknown. my friend kept repeating that there was a white light on the object. again, only visible with binoculars.  while placing my binoculars against a light pole to steady them, the object disappeared.  neither of us could find it again. i can say with certainty that object was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter or weather balloon or even a leo satellite.\r\n\r\nin summation, it appeared to me that the object was quite large but at extreme altitude above the flyway over central arkansas. the rapidity with which it disappeared is puzzling.\r\n\r\ni am considering calling the little rock national airport to see if their radar had detected an unknown southwest of the airport over benton. i don���t expect a positive response if i do.\r\n\r\nalso, i read recent reports of light flashes, blue green, in the little rock area and also in houston, tex near the beltway 8. on 8/3, i witnessed a deep blue flash in texas city while sitting on the balcony of my motel. it was quite close and very quick. the flash appeared like a comma lying on its side with the head and tail pointing downward. was alone and the event was so quick i couldn���t have alerted anyone else with me in time to see it.\r\n\r\ni have always joked that i had never seen a ufo and if i ever did then everyone would start seeing them.  let���s hope so.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

my group and i experienced.\r\n\r\nmy fiance and two good buddies of mine where traveling to houston motorsports park located off of beltway 8 and lockwood friday night when this event happened.  we where all having a good time and talking about what our race car we had just finished would do that night at the track.  then about 5 minutes down lockwood right after the rail road tracks it happened.  i noticed it first then the others passengers noticed as well.  we were all quoting wtf!!!  a giant green/bluish flash/streak just appeared off to our left in somewhat of a darkend field and that is what made it so obivious.  it was so fast and then it just disappeared.  the funny thing this was about 200 feet away from our truck.  another interesting fact about this occurance is this streak just appeared and seemed to have a path of about a 45 degree slant.  i'd say it started about 70 feet off the ground and continued on it's slant travel and disappeared at about 10 feet of the ground. it was so bright that it stopped us immediately in our tracks.  it was a neat experience and all of us kind of just hung around for a bit hoping to see more of the unexplained.  i've always been interested in ufo's and i'm not sure if we saw one or not but nonetheless it was an exciting moment of confusion for all of us.  things just dont' appear and disappear that fast in normal

another aircraft but i could not see wings or a tail, which should have been observable at that altitude. what i saw was a thin line of silver with red across the middle two-thirds. no lights of any

observing anything anyway. i did not hear any noise but didn't consider that unusual as i would not expect to at that height. i watched the object for about a minute and a half and was surprised that it stayed in roughly the same area for that time. if i had held a quarter at arm's length, it would have taken approximately 8 quarters to have covered it. as i watched, it appeared to bank a bit upwards, showing more of the red \"rim\" and then simply wasn't there. as i recall, it was a sunny day but slightly overcast. i assumed, if it was an airplane, that the disapearance was an optical illusion. i did ask my husband if he knew of any airlines whose planes were silver with a red stripe down the side but he could not think of any. my feelings during this sighting were primarily those of curiosity and confusion. after the sighting, i was vaguely uneasy and kept stopping and looking back and around the sighting area to see if i could see it again, see it emerge from the clouds, see a contrail, anything so i could explain it to myself..But didn't.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then

above the treeline to the left of the road and ahead of us. it was large about the size as the on coming car head lights. it seemed as if it was moving to cross the road in front of us but it never did, it looked as if it moved toward the hwy and stopped and hovered above the trees, like it was waiting for us to drive past it.  after watching it for about 1 min. i got our jvc dv recorder and began taping it thru the windshield. the light would go behind trees and emerge as we were driving toward it, going bright then dim but not in a regular pattern but randomly. i taped for about 2 min or so till we were passing it to our left. i stopped taping [not following it with the cam as it was going up and out of view in the windshield, thinking it was just a plane.) as i was looking at it out the top of the windshield as it was going behind us for a split second i could see the triangle shape, lights on the 3 points[white,red,and blue] and a bright white light in the center. i had my wife stop the car off the side of the road and i got out to tape again, and the object was moving up the far side of the hwy 59[to the n] at a high rate of speed away from us, like it was running away. i was standing with one foot on the door sill and taping over the top of our van. i could see the two colored lights flashing as it went out of sight behind the tree tops. this section of tape shows very little due to the lack of light, but you can see some one frame flashing of lights. my wife also saw the triangle shape as we went past it out the drivers side window. the tape is about 2min 20sec long and i transferred it to my pc using win dv 1.2.3 and have watched it frame by frame. the light was changing shape and color[i'm sure some of this was the cause of movement on my part holding the camcorder in a moving vehicle shooting thru a windshield]. i have dial up internet and could not send a copy that way, but i would like to make a copy available for your review if you are interested. i have also copied it to my liteon dvd recorder/player and then to a dvd in this machines hq setting. i have captured some frames from the video to my pc, but the quality is very poor. it looked like a bright star to the naked eye, but watching it in the video it was changing shape and color every frame. we were meeting cars and cars also pasted us as we were on the side of the road stopped, i sure hope others saw what we did and report it. i am sending the paper we made as soon as we got home before watching the tape. i am also sending the paper we made in 2007 when we also saw

was young. i lived in poland, city of gdansk suburb of dragana, seventh building top 5th floor. this is one of those things that stuck with me for life. i remember it like it was yesterday eventhough it happened years ago. i never tell people bout this just because...Well just because of what it is. i woke up, somehow, in the middle of the night. i felt, heard...I dunno how to describe it but it was this very low hum. it was pulsating very slowly, and systematcally. it was coming from the out side so i ran to the window. we lived on the top floor of a 5 story apartament building. all the buildings were only 4 story so i could clearly see over them.When i got to the window i saw a light. it was moving slowly over our building and that sound just kept on going. all of the sudden it just jolted ahead. now keep in mind that i was young so i can't really tell how far it went, but it went far very fast. i could still see the light and it stoped. it stood still for a seconds or minute at the most, then out of nowhere it moved at a 90 degree angle to the right really fast. then it stopped again. next it shot back to where it was originally. it stopped again. then it moved back towards out apartment. it was following the same lines of travel. it kept coming toward me. it started to speed up but was still moving kinda slow. as it got closer the sound started to come back. the noise was never loud...Its hard to describe it. it was like i felt it more then hear it, but it was there, something was there making it. it went right over the top of the building, i ran to the back to the balcony. i remember the clock it said 130 and it was pitch black out side, no stars no moon. my dad was sleeping on the couch in the living room as i ran by i tried to wake him up, but he didn't even move or respond in any way. when i got to the balcony i saw it. it was getting farher away and then it just...Like disapeared but not right away. it was like i dunno a train going into a subway tunnel but a lot faster. no trail just no tail just gone. i never felt affraid, i was more mezmorized then anything. i still remember that \"sound\" what ever it was i remember how it made me feel like i was at ease and really relaxed. next day i told my dad about it and that i tired to wake him up but he just told me that he didn't even remember me tring to wake him up. another thing is that i didn't know what a ufo was. i was young and we lived in poland back when ussr still had some hold on us. i never saw et or any ufo movies. we just got the smurfs from the us and that was a huge deal. i really hope that you belive me because i know what i saw. there is no way that it was a dream. this is one thing that i can remember from my childhood so clearly. i can still remeber it like it was

not something which i naturally felt comfortable doing.  only after tracking the mufon site for several days after this event and noticing the numerous sightings reported the same week including several back around stevensville, tx was i persuaded to come forward.  \r\n\r\ni flew down to san antonio on an annual business trip sunday oct 19th.  arriving at the airport i picked up a rental car and traveled through the city and started southwest in the direction of eagles pass for the night.  i left the interstate onto texas hwy 57 toward the mexican border town.  \r\n\r\nsoon after leaving the bright lights of the interstate exit i noticed out of the corner of my eye that a supposed plane was tracking the path of the 2 lane highway. i assumed that it was just a low flying airplane using the road to navigate its course.  at the time that i first noticed this craft it was a solid white glow.  the object was approximately tracking my speed until it came upon the first radio tower and it seemed to slow down somewhat before resuming my same speed.  about this time i noticed that this supposed plane had no position lights or anti-collision lights.  my attention was further heightened as the craft passed and slowed down for another radio tower and then started to dip in \r\naltitude before regaining its previous path.  it was at this time that the object started changing shapes and colors at the same time.  the object changed from a small white glow into a much larger rectangular object showing colors of blue and green.  the occasional oncoming traffic kept their speed and if they noticed this object-they showed no signs whatsoever.\r\n\r\nthis went on for several more miles with me paying closer and closer attention to the object and never slowing down on this desolate road.  i finally came to some curves in the otherwise straight-stretch of road.  trying to drive and pay attention to the object became more difficult as i entered the first curve.  i noticed that rather that continuing on a straight course--it too had followed me into the curve making up the distance and growing in brightness and intensity.  not only was it glowing now but it was casting its light on my vehicle.  after another curve or two it followed the same pattern of growing much closer and cast its light in my direction. by now i was completely unglued.  still the occasional oncoming cars did not seem affected in any manner.  \r\n\r\nsoon after the curves i passed a couple of convenience stores in a wide spot in the road. the object had changed shape again and was now oblong or cigar shaped and had now turned red in color.  i continued down the road until i finally came to the town of la pryor.  i did stop now at a convenience store in the middle of town as the craft moved on slightly ahead of me and paused to hover at the western edge of town but still within my sight.  \r\n\r\ni did not know if i had the nerve to continue on even though i had a guaranteed hotel reservation 40 miles ahead of me in eagles pass.  too late to cancel my reservation now and i had not passed a hotel since i left the interstate 40 miles back.  traffic had become less and less frequent on this sunday evening as everyone must have been home with their families.  what the hell was i doing here and why was i being singled out?  do i dare get back on the road and chance an abduction?  i hung out in the convenience store for a few minutes and came out hoping that the object had moved on but it was still there just outside the few lights in this small town. was i the only person who had seen this strange object?  why did it not just keep moving?  \r\n\r\nafter waiting outside for a few more minutes a tour bus pulled over at  the same convenience store and parked for a few minutes.  i thought that i would just wait until the tour bus pulled out and follow him to the border.  if anything strange happened on the next stretch of road--at least there will be witnesses on the bus.  about the same time the tour bus was pulling out an 18 wheeler came through town with 2 cars behind him.  as the bus pulled out behind them, i was right on the bus' bumper.  there was no way that i was going to let these vehicles out of my sight after this craft had been tracking me for 40 miles.  \r\n\r\nthe object resumes its course as soon as i pulled out of la pryor.  now it was following an 18 wheeler, 2 cars, a tour bus and myself in my rental car.  these other drivers were not wasting time, in fact the tour bus passed the 2 cars on this 2 lane highway and i was pleased just to keep them all in sight.  our little convoy went for about 10 miles until suddenly the craft abandoned its parrallel course with the road and took a more southernly route and took off at a much faster speed.  i watched it until it moved out of sight heading for mexico.  i became convinced that i was being singled out for a possible abduction.  certainly glad that it never came to that.\r\n\r\ni made the final leg of the trip without any further incident and checked into the holiday inn express in eagles pass as planned.  needless to say, i did not get much sleep that night thinking about my trip to this border town.    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n     ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

of people. moments later, a man near by pointed and shouted, \"what's that, in the sky?\" at least 15-20 people who were outside on the deck looked in the direction of the man's finger. there are scattered, blinking lights in the distance. they were airplanes in the sky from the airport that was located just a few miles away. but, between the blinking-airplane lights was a circular object about 10,000 feet away.  initially i thoguht it was another airplane. but this object was stationary and not blinking. the doughnut-shaped object had 9-12 white lights surrounding the outter edges, and appeared to be a little smaller than the size of a blimp. the object was stationary for a moments at a time and would make sharp, sudden movements vertically and horizontally, traveling from 500-5,000 feet in distance. it appeared to reach as low as 500 feet from the ground. the object would also change degree of the craft itself, making a \"ring\" of lights visible periodically. it traveled a distant radius of about 5,000 feet for around 4-6 minutes. myself, and the crowd of skeptics on the deck witnessing this event were confused and anxious for anyone who could answer the daughnting question of what that was. i reached for my digital camera and started recording the unexplained pheonomenon. moving through the harbor, the craft became less visible and was shortly consumed by the lanscape.

is working/filming for a company that produces a haunted house- the cutting edge haunted house in fort worth, texas.\r\n\r\nwe are currently producing a documentary on the haunted house industry and have accumulated over 55 hours of raw footage for the documentary thus far. i am the cinematographer for the documentary. we are filming the documentary on canon gl1 cameras.\r\n\r\nthe owner of cutting edge purchased skytracking (rotating spotlighs) lights this year for advertising the show at the haunted house. earlier in october we wired in the skytrackers and turned them on- they are quite spectacular.\r\n\r\nthe night that we turned them on, for the first time i believe, i filmed 2 ufo's, one of which descended out of range at the end of the footage. the 2nd ufo executed a very uncanny aerobatic maneuver. both ufo's are of the bright-orange-pulsating-orb-variety. i have about 10 minutes of footage of the entire incident and there are many witnesses, given i was filming customers exiting the haunted house.\r\n\r\nat the time that i first noticed the objects- i was filming people exiting the haunted house out of our 'foam room' which consists of large soap bubble machines. the objects came out of the south/southeast and were tracking northward/northwest.\r\n\r\nthis all occurred near the i-30 / hwy 287 interchange near downtown fort worth, texas.\r\n\r\nat first we all thought it was a blimp because there was no sound emanating from the craft/lights whatsoever and because both objects were moving so slowly. i didn't even film it at that point- but then the object bringing up the rear starting performing eye-catching maneuvers which made it obvious that they were not attached to the same structure, among other things, and i started filming the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nboth objects very much resembled the type of red/orange tower lights which you can view on most radar and antennae towers, aside from their slow consistent energetic pulsation. in fact- if they had not been moving i would have assumed that's what they were.\r\n\r\nthe rear object- after performing an incredible maneuver, appears to change direction and move away at a rapid clip to the east/southeast until it disappears from view, at which point i focus on the front object.\r\n\r\nthe best way i've thought of to describe the actions and motions of the ufo's- or at least how i described them to roland herwig of the faa when i called him to request radar information from that evening (he told me i'll probably have to file a freedom of information request and possibly pursue legal action to get radar reports, etc...), is 'rapid horizontal displacement', but that really doesn't do the maneuvers complete justice.\r\n\r\nat any rate, i am aware of your professionalism and expertise, and am contacting you because i believe we have very intriguing (and i know totally authentic) footage. i have always believed there was something to the ufo phenomenon but this is the first time for me to ever personally witness something so convincing. i really still have trouble believing i got it on film.\r\n\r\nwitnessing the event was an incredible but surreal experience. i'm convinced what we filmed is either 'secret air force' classified craft or 'unknown craft'.\r\n\r\nyou can hear several of the witnesses on the footage and there are interesting perspectives expressed.\r\n\r\nthis has been on my mind since the night we filmed it. it's really quite something.\r\n\r\nat the end of the footage- when we have lost track of the rear object- the remaining object descends straight down in a deliberate and controlled fashion. i am hopeful there were other eyewitness reports you may have received that could match up with what we filmed.\r\n\r\nthe descending object should have been easily viewed (observing east viewing from the west) from the i-30 exits of beach street, riverside exit, and it appeared to be right over the oakland or brentwood stair exit area in fort worth. we were filming all night and i had to get back to work after the objects moved out of range of view, so i'm not sure about the exact time but i'm fairly certain it was between 9:30 pm and midnight.\r\n\r\nwe had the objects under observation for between 15-20 minutes. there were a core group of witnesses around me which numbered around 40- half of which were staff- half of which were customers. there were perhaps more but i know i can get in contact with at least 10-15. \r\n\r\nagain the objects never made a sound and appeared to move through the sky like fish move through water. their motions were very fluid and completely silent.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with

finish their business.  i was looking up at the moon, which was about a 3/4 moon and fairly bright. it was a clear, cold night. out of the corner of my eye i saw what i immediately thought was a shooting star.  i shifted my sight so i was looking directly at it as it finished moving over me, and was then in front of and above me.  i saw that it was definitely not a star, shooting or otherwise.  it was a perfect ring, of bright light, with a point of bright light in the very center.  it was moving quickly, but not as fast as a shooting star would, and i didn't see it burn out.  it sort of slid, or glided across the sky, and over a tree in the yard behind mine, which is when i lost sight of it.  i tried to see any flickering or lights of any kind through the leaves of the tree, but it was gone.  it was totally silent, and had only bright yellowish ring of light with point in the center.  no blinking red or blue lights.  didn't look like a spot light or search light, or like anything else i have ever seen.  i have lived at this location for eight years, and i let my dogs out frequently and always stay out with them.  something very different.  i felt sort of bewildered, or stumped after  saw it.  i looked over to my neighbors yard, as she had been out a few minutes before, to ask her if she had seen it also, but she had gone inside. i stood there for a minute, searching my mind for what it may have been before i realized i could think of nothing, (strange feeling) then i went in and told my husband and daughter what i had seen, and he came out so i could describe it to him.  he suggested i check the internet to see if anyone else had seen it and reported it, so here i

military fighter jet. (this was unusual because of the low altitude over a residential area and the fact that not many military aircraft are ever seen in the area). the jet appeared to be circling the area instead of just passing through. i continued to see many low flying aircraft flying low in the area which were likely military aircraft as well, as they appeared to be very large turboprop aircraft and one large helicopter. around 5 pm, a large orange/white plane that appeared to be a coast guard twin engine turboprop aircraft flew directly overhead. (the first that i have ever seen in the area).\r\n \r\nat 5:22 pm, a stationary object was observed to the west/southwest about 60 degrees above the horizon. the stationary object could best be described as appearing star-like to the naked eye except that it was too bright and in the wrong part of the sky to be saturn or venus, which were not visible at this time. already having binoculars in hand due to the \"air show\" that had been taking place for the past two hours, i took a better look at the stationary \"star-like\" object that looked very unusual and bright to be a star, and appeared to reflecting the sun.\r\n \r\nimmediately upon looking at the object with binoculars, it was apparent that the object was not a star, planet, or a moving object. the stationary object was totally dark or gray on top and extremely brilliant like the sun only on the very bottom underside of the object. the overall shape of the object was round like a ball. thinking the only \"logical\" explanation for the object might be that it was a balloon sitting still with the setting sun reflecting off it's underside, i decided to watch the object to see if i could tell if it drifted any like a balloon. i braced my elbows on top of the frame of a patio swing to ensure i had a stable view of the object. after locking down my binoculars on the object for about ten seconds, the object shot off due south barely visible due to the high speed of it's acceleration. \r\n \r\nthis makes over a dozen unusual \"sightings\" that i have personally observed in the westlake, louisiana area in the past six months.
