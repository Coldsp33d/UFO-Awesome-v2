no, too high. motorbike? no chance. van? still too high. truck? maybe, a lamp on the roof, but i can see the sky all around the damn thing. stars were visible all about this blue-shining orb and that meant if it was attached to any kind of mass as we understand it, it was most certainly invisible to my eyes. \r\n\r\ni quickly sidestepped the ten yards or so to catch up with steve, not wanting to take my eyes off this enigma, and spun him round. \r\n���get a load of this man!��� \r\n\r\nto say i was excited would be a gross understatement, because whatever my everyday consciousness thought of this event, it was being over ridden by a curiosity of a type i had never experienced before, nor indeed have i in the thirty odd years since. \r\ni turned back to the orb, it still hung there like some all seeing eye, protecting the road we had just traversed, then it suddenly shot off to our left with no visible acceleration and into the field opposite which adjoined the edge of the forest. i tried to anticipate it���s flight path as it swooped low over the vegetation, and found myself tensing ever more as it flew straight at what looked for all the world like a tall, wooden privvy... (outdoor loo for those who don���t know), but it was probably a tool store of some kind. curiously enough, in later years after much reading and research into this kind of scenario i was to find out that structures like this are a relatively frequent factor in incidents such as this, and it might not have been at all what it appeared to be. \r\n\r\nthe impact, however, wasn���t what i was expecting, for it flew straight into the shed without even damaging it���s surface, let alone shattering it. but by far the most disconcerting aspect was, it did not come out of the other side. considering the object���s velocity, well, what can i say? with my obviously limited understanding of physics, i leave it to those better qualified to try to unravel this tiny portion of the overall mystery. \r\n\r\n���let���s go and have a look, man?��� i said, to steve, unable at first to take my eyes off this shack, but when i realized there had been no answer, i turned to see him moving swiftly away toward the muddy/orange tunnel within the trees as fast as his legs would carry him. \r\n\r\nmore interested in what was going on behind me than in front i turned back to the shack, steve already forgotten, just in time to see the orb fly back out of the front of the structure, no damage still, and back over the brow of the hill and into the young treetops which edged the forest on my side of the road. therein it danced about manically, no curves in its manoeuvres, all straight lines and angles and making a complete mockery of inertia as we understand it - if indeed there was anything sentient, or sensitive equipment, therein. \r\n\r\nas much as i hate to use a clich���, i will say, i felt compelled by an invisible force to break through the shrubbery and stand below it���s manic ballet in amongst the branches, and in retrospect, i feel the invisible force came as much from me than from the object. quite simply, the need to know! \r\n\r\ni stood there mesmerized by this thing���s antics, completely unaware of time, space or anything around me. then, suddenly, a voice entered my awareness and told me to... ���turn around and go home,���... but where the voice came from, whether it was an audible voice, telepathy, or indeed my own imagination, to this day i do not know. indeed, i probably never will! \r\n\r\ntrouble was, i didn���t want to go anywhere, i hadn���t finished whatever it was i thought i was doing, (observing something so outside my whole belief system, maybe) and i fought the urge to turn and do as i was bidden, not realizing that what seemed to be a polite request was a gentle command which ���would��� be obeyed. i walked stiffly away from my vantage point, completely against my will and ever fighting to remain, disappointed at being thwarted and seeming to have little control over my own body and mind. \r\n\r\nnext thing i know i am back at the side of the road, completely oblivious to what has taken place and wondering where on earth steve has gone, i had no memory of anything at that time, including the appearance of the orb or being in amongst the trees watching it���s manic ballet. as far as i was concerned he was still walking in front of me as we approached the forest, but now, he had just simply ���vanished���. yet strangely, i wasn���t too bothered by this either, like some aspect of me was still too busy with far more important matters and my best friend of the time would have to take a back seat until it had finished. \r\n\r\nso, i walked slowly through the forest road, a strange calm had beset me and i was oblivious to the daylight creeping slowly across the sky until i emerged on the other side. by then, a huge, rusty, orange sun was half above the horizon, soon to be teetering on it���s edge by the time i had walked another mile. but, though not aware of it at that time, the sun should not have been rising yet. i had not even witnessed the pre-dawn. \r\nit would be fair to say that even the most unobservant of us are a little awestruck by sunrises and sunsets, but this one, for me, seemed the most glorious of all. eventually i stopped and leaned on a gate to watch while it was still optically bearable to do so, and i became completely enrapt as i watched dark, purple patches form on it���s surface, ever growing and blending together, contrasting with the remaining orange in sharp, delineating lines to form the image of an embryo in the womb. \r\n\r\nhow long i stood there, i don���t know, most likely until the sun���s light became intolerant to my eyes. but, even now thirty years on, i can remember a sense of complete unity and understanding with and of absolutely everything. like a rush of adrenaline it hit me. in words, thoughts, imagery and sound, and whatever other transmissions for other receptors we human beings possess of which we are conciously unaware. \r\ni ���knew��� everything! \r\ni ���was��� everything! \r\n\r\nand believe me, i knew everything was alive, even the most inanimate of objects. in the parlance of my generation, the only word i can use to describe the experience, is transcendental. \r\nsoon i was to find myself trudging away up the road again toward home, suddenly extremely weary to the point of staggering, yet still strangely detached from the reality around me. \r\n \r\n\r\ntwo: home \r\n\r\nhow i got to the vauxhall roundabout ... near ellesmere port ... i will never know. i have no memory of a lift, but i do have a vague memory of thinking i was seeing people walking on the grass verge toward me on the opposite side of the road, as i went, and some even seemed to have pet dogs with them. they usually turned out to be bushes or shrubs when i got close enough to focus properly. next thing i am fully aware of, i am sitting wearily at the vauxhall roundabout, it is 6:30am and my feet and legs are stuck over the kerb and into the road. large lorries are hurtling past, beeping their horns at me to get me to move my legs before they are crushed. i slowly become aware and drag them reluctantly away. \r\ni felt extremely ill by this time, i had no energy at all. not even enough to stand and hold my arm out to hitch for a few minutes, let alone walk the ten or so miles home. i needed a telephone. my father would have just finished a night shift and, though it would have been a tremendous blow to my kudos at that time to ask help of a parent, i felt justifiably ill enough to do so. as luck would have it, there was a red telephone box directly behind where i was sitting, across the broad roundabout pavement and against a wall. i phoned, and my father, not too happy at being called out after a sixteen hour shift came out (bless him) and picked me up. i saw his look of anger change to one of concern as he pulled up in his brown humber sceptre, leaned over, and opened the passenger door for me, his first words were, ���god, son, have you been run over or something?��� \r\n\r\ni can only suspect that i must have looked as bad as i felt, but there were no broken bones or anything conducive to his suggestion. \r\nit should be said here, that at this time, i lived in what would have been considered a ���commune��� in those days, and though never anti-parent, it just was not cool to go back to your folks��� home if you had left. but my dad took me back to the family home and put me in his bed, and there i stayed for almost a week, in a strange sort of delirium for which i can still find no source. \r\n\r\nit would be true to say that i remember very little of that time, but the bits i do remember seemed so poignant to me, even now, that i think they might be more than pertinent to any person who might have had a similar experience. what i remember is as follows... \r\n\r\nfor most of those days i was unconscious or semi-conscious. my thoughts, when lucid and wondering how i came to be in the family home, always taking me back to delamere forest and this damned blue light. for some reason, as i slowly recovered, i could now remember seeing it, telling steve about it, seeing it go into the shed and not coming out the other side. i could remember it coming back out again and following it to the young trees at the edge of the forest, standing underneath it, watching and waiting for ... something! \r\n\r\nthen, absolutely nothing until i was commanded to go home! \r\non the few occasions of lucidity in those strange days, i would raise the blankets and look at the lower half of my body. from the groin down it was like there was intense sunburn. my legs seemed red raw from it. then i would try to rationalize it. my mind would ask, how the hell did this happen? i was, and still am, built like the proverbial pencil, (or pipe-cleaner to those who remember such things) and certainly wasn���t given to sunbathing or anything remotely like that. i, even though now i don���t give a damn, would have been too embarrassed to show my legs in public. so i would search my memory for a reason for this. and always, in those few days at mum and dads house, for how these strange symptoms had come to be. \r\n\r\nalways, it led me back to delamere forest and the blue light, and, for those first few days, when i remembered it, i would fall unconscious again for hours! \r\n\r\nas i recovered however, from the bodily symptoms at least, i ceased to black out at the memory of that strange, physical law-defying orb, and grow in strength. determined to get to the bottom of the experience. \r\nafter all, my best friend of the time was with me, and if anyone had the answer, or at least a partial (or impartial) explanation, he should. \r\nbut before i go any further, i should explain here, that at no time, between whatever that experience was and steve vanishing into the forest, did i see him. not on that day, nor on the days i was ill in my parent���s house. i should also add that i could never understand why no one in my family called a doctor in to find out what the problem with me was. i would also like readers to know, though some of my family will never admit it publicly, that several of them have had ufo type experiences too, over the years, though i think they are too frightened to speak for reasons that are obvious to us all. \r\n\r\ni know and understand that! it has taken me thirty years to write this and no one would believe how many times i have tried, finished it, and binned it! \r\nmaybe it is the right time now! \r\n \r\n\r\nthree: in search of steve \r\n\r\nupon my recovery after a week or so, i intended to return to my room in the commune, only to find the landlord had packed my bags and they were waiting in the vestibule for me. he would not let me over the threshold, nor indeed would he tell me of steve���s whereabouts, which, in my young excited mind, was far more important than being homeless. all he would say was that my friend had returned on the day he had disappeared from the forest in a terrible state of mind and left immediately, instructing all never to tell me anything about him, his whereabouts, etc., for a long time after that event, most of the people in that commune who had been friends shunned me and would rather not have been seen talking to me. \r\n\r\nand so the plot thickened. \r\n\r\nyou can imagine what was rolling over in my head. why? \r\nas it happened, steve���s parents lived literally at the bottom of the road and, needless to say, that was my first port of call. i should add here, that these were good and decent people who always had time for steve���s friends, me included, but the reception i got shocked me. \r\nmum came to the door when i knocked, with dad close behind her and they sidled up next to each other as if to block entry. the look on their faces said it all. they were panic stricken. \r\n���he doesn���t live here any more!��� mum blurted. ���and he never wants to see you again!��� \r\n���but why ever...?��� and the door was closed gently in my face. \r\nso off i trundled - doubly confused, a bin liner full of junk, back to my parent���s house to try and piece together what the hell was happening to me. i had not anticipated any of this, how on earth could i? as far as i was concerned, steve had vanished down the road into the forest while i let curiosity get the better of me. we were good friends, neither of us violent for all our biker trappings. not given to argument for the hell of it, and most certainly not on the edge of a forest in the dead of night. \r\n\r\nwhat the hell was going on? \r\n\r\nwhoever i discussed the incident with, particularly family, would say, keep quiet about it, don���t tell anyone. others would sneer derisively at me like i was some kind of lunatic, but i was not deterred. if only i could find steve, then all would be revealed. \r\nand my search over the wirral continued. a week, two... three... by four i had all but given up. then, one day, by pure chance, in upton, i walked around a corner and there, about a hundred or so yards away, was steve, sitting on a wall chatting to two girls. \r\n���steve!��� ���steve!��� i shout as i walk ever swiftly toward him, ���tell me about the blue li....!��� \r\n\r\nthen the girls turned and started screaming at me, ���leave him alone, leave him alone!��� people at the nearby shops were turning to see what was going on but i watched as an ever pallid steve seemed to visibly ���physically��� shrink, as if he wanted to be swallowed up by the very wall itself. i had never seen fear like this, i think i could even smell it. it was a horrible experience to see a friend like this and know in some inadvertent way, ���you��� are the cause of it. even if you don���t know how. i stopped dead in my tracks and said something like, ���i just want to know what happened in the forest, man...��� and with that, he leapt off the wall and ran as fast as his legs would go, up the road and round the nearest corner. the girls stood guard behind him, shouting more abuse at me and making sure all in earshot were witnessing the event before sauntering off after him. \r\ngob-smacked would be an understatement, and i certainly wasn���t going to go after him if he was so afraid. but what was it he was afraid of... \r\n���me?��� \r\ni\r\nt was a few weeks later i was to bump into steve, in the street, for the last time in my life, and needless to say, the first words out of my mouth were about the forest. his response was, ���danny! if i ever see you again, i will kill you!��� \r\nand with that, this, my once best friend turned away and walked out of my life. \r\n \r\n\r\nin conclusion \r\n\r\none can imagine the questions i have asked of myself about this over the years. did i create a screen memory to cover some terrible incident that happened between us as we hitched back from bristol all those years ago? an incident that caused steve to run away from me, after of course, setting my legs and groin alight for just long enough to give the illusion of sunburn. or did he pull out a ray gun he threw together in the outside toilet of the commune one boring sunday afternoon when we were all skint, and blast me with it just long enough to do a limited amount of damage so that i would recover? and, hopefully, on his part, never seek vengeance. \r\nunlikely, isn���t it? \r\n\r\nbut there is fear and fear and the fear i saw in his eyes and demeanor on the first occasion was palpable, almost material in it���s manifestation, if that makes sense. \r\n\r\non the second occasion it was equally palpable, but resigned. it was like the threat to kill me was a last ditch attempt to rid himself of me forever and he didn���t really give a toss what the consequences of that statement might have been. \r\ni respected that need, and still do, if indeed he still lives. \r\nwhat did ���he��� witness? \r\nwhat happened to ���him.? \r\n\r\nas to the incident in the forest, well, i still haven���t got to the bottom of it. but the consequences of it on my life haven���t necessarily been positive. i think for anyone who has experienced anything outside reality as the majority understand it, our world, and particularly our society, becomes a dark and desolate place, it���s beauty tainted by our collective actions. speaking this view, when in truth it is obvious to all, earns no kudos in our society and my inability to lie about what i perceive has killed off just about every relationship i have ever had because i cannot allow myself to join in with the selfish ethos of our crumbling society. all i seem to perceive are the negatives in us, myself included, and i believe this incident, real or imagined, has been the source of an isolated existence without the power to engender positive change for myself or any one else. \r\n\r\nthe overall feeling for me, is that i am here to witness something of immense magnitude, as indeed i suspect we all are in these times. whether that observation is to be a positive or negative thing, i don���t know. the only comforting fact i can find, is that the nature of all things appears to be cyclic. these times are not good and they are becoming steadily worse worldwide. i think it probable that the collective human psyche is aware of this and the knock on effect is that the majority of individuals are grabbing what they can, while they can. \r\n\r\nwhy i directly attribute the aforementioned to this little blue light, i really do not know. i have purposely avoided mention of the et hypothesis because i do not remember what took place in the missing time. i do however, suspect... \r\nbut you must judge for yourself! \r\n \r\nin truth \r\nk. j. daniel \r\n��� k.J.Daniel - 13 october 2004 \r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13579,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.200102,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-11072008-0004","longitude":-2.885265,"occurred":46427400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":46427400000,"summary":"Impossible to shorten event","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/London","timeZoneName":"Europe/London","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Chester, England","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:307391"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"St George","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was pulling up to my friends house in my car, which was facing the mountains over where mesquite, nv is. its pitch black over where these mountains are and it is also a very dark area where my friend lives. there was nobody around cause its a very quiet neighborhood. anyways, i pulled up in my car and went down to shut my car off and when i looked up again i saw approximately 9 very bright lights about 30 degrees above the horizon in a perfectely curved shape. these lights where very bright. i stared in absolute amazement and in absolute shock at what i was looking at. i have never seen anything like this before. after about 30 seconds they started to dim starting with the outer lights first in the formation and ending with the middle light, so it dimmed going in. i hurried and got out of my car and about 5 seconds later i saw two bright lights glowing next to where i saw the first lights. also, this thing i saw never moved... it was completly still and so was the 2 lights i saw after the first bright 9. i went and grabbed my friend but we came out and saw nothing. i then looked at a plane flying high level in the sky and just one of the lights on this thing was easily 20 times brighter than the plane itself. whatever it was it was massive. it was very scary because i felt as if this thing was looking right at me before it disappeared. i tried to film it but i was in absolute shock and couldnt get my camera phone out in time before it disappeared.

was nearby, west of the interstate.(my friend was driving, by the way.) the aircraft's white lights were very bright; approaching from the east, off to our right, it looked like it would be awfully low when it passed overhead. i even became a little concerned, but then as we drew nearer, i was amazed to find it was stationary! as if suspended in mid-air, not much higher than the normal height of power lines, in my estimation, and so bright i couldn't see anything but the lights. completely baffled, i watched this configuration as we drove past it and when looking back at it, it appeared to be a single row of lights, at a right angle to the highway.  all of the lights were white except for a red one, slightly off-center, if i recall correctly. though it was a clear night and visibility was good, the lights were too intense to see any structure behind them. they reminded me of stadium lighting. and i wasn't aware of any sound or vibration despite its close proximity. \r\nunbelievably, my

something out of the corner of my eye.  up in the sky in the northeastern direction i noticed this large looking glowing orange orb that just seemed to be hovering.  it was not very far up in the sky because when i continued driving down the road, the trees got in my way of seeing it.  i continued to stare at the ufo in disbelief when i got back into view of it (truthfully i was in shock).  when i got to the intersection in which i was turning left, more trees got into my view of the orb and i lost sight of it.  however, as i began to head north and there were no more trees in my way (towards downtown deleon), i quickly looked to see if the orb thing was still up there but instead all i saw were what it looked to be three jets with blinking lights in the exact spot where i saw the ufo.  i am still in shock that i actually saw this weird glowing object.  i know from experience in the past that military aircraft often use this aerospace in this general area to practice manueavers and also, set off flares.  but i promise ya'll what i saw tonight was not a flare.  hopefully someone else saw what i did.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13574,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.1127243,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11062008-0021","longitude":-98.5288925,"occurred":1226025900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1226025900000,"summary":"Giant

orange / red, but low to the ground.  as we walked the object appeared rapidly moving closer and more bright.  as we arrived at .2-.25 miles north of old stonington we stopped walking and observed the

25 and 45 up degrees from ground.  the object was very large, larger than a house, estimating about the size of a football field.  the shape of the object appeared to be symmetrical and oblong with a ratio of 3 high x 10 wide.  it appeared that we were seeing the side of the object and maybe some of the bottom.  reddish orange lights were present in the center of the object (these lights had been clearly distinguishable well before we stopped walking).  there was about 4-5 lights in the center of the object.  the lights were in a horizontal line.  the lights were not extremely bright and did not light the ground; but were large lights (not like a bulb, but rather a lit area).  after about 5-10 minutes the center area appeared to open, like a door, opening from left to right.  the center area was much brighter and whiter (faint orange).  the opening and bright area was observed for about 2-5 minutes.  this brighter light may have gave light to the ground and ourselves (although a specific beam of light was not observed).  the light immediately went back to the 3-5 dimmer lights and the object was gone.  it did not leave in a direction - it was just gone.\r\n\r\nno sounds,

of nov. the 5th, 2008. a bright flashin green and red light combination caught my eye. i live on a private rd, as there is no traffic, we have a habit of watching the air traffic. there is lots, as we are located near several airports. the lights came from the south moving to the north and it struck me \"what is that?\" the lights were very bright. i started to go get my husband, but hesitated as i thought i might miss whatever it was. i watched it start to turn east and noticed a bright white light, like a plane headlight following it. i walked around the north side of my house and through my bedroom door i called my husband out, as i realized whatever it was it was moving very slow. he came and immediately started saying the same \"what is that?\" it moved very slowly, smoothly, with no bouncing or shaking. i studied it and saw one main bright green light and two blinking red lights, one to the front and one to the side facing me. i tried to focus on the actual craft, but it appeared to be darker in the center... just a black mass. its hard to explain that. the other white light continued to follow it, and maybe even point towards it, maybe trying to see it? the white light looked like every other plane coming in for landing, same red and green landing lights on it, same white headlamps... then both objects turned back towards the south, and continued on that way. we kept watching them until they flew behind some trees and we could no longer see them. we then began discussing what it was, and i wondered if it was a plane that close why didnt we hear it? just then maybe 10- 15 seconds after we could not see it, you could hear a noise similar to a helicopter, but without the chop-chop of the blades. but it was a sound i have never heard before. and did not last very long at all. i have seen a lot of planes, helicopters, personal aircraft everything out here... and this contradicts everything i have seen before. if it was a plane so close for me to be dazzled by the green and red landing lights, i should have heard it. (and i have never seen such a large craft so low to the ground) if it was far away to leave the trailing sound, it should have been a twinkly white light with flashes or red or green.... and the sound, doesnt add up either. i dont believe this was aliens. ;o) but i am wondering if it is connected to the stephenville lights, or the local military base, or both. i will continue to look and see if i see anything else, but i just wanted to report this, as nothing like this has ever happened to me before. one more note, i dont know if this matters, but my 2 dogs and my neihgbors dogs were barking the whole time i could see it, not before, and not after... thanks","distance":"Over One

50, the moon was half-full, rather bright, and as i looked at the moon i noticed a really bright \"star\" a little down and to the left of the moon.  it was so bright that it seemed odd to be able to see a star like that with the light of the moon also being bright.  so, i drove on and every once in a while i glanced up to see if it had moved, thinking it might be a satellite or some military aircraft or something of that nature.  \r\n\r\nafter about 10 minutes, when i got on interstate-30, about 6 miles northeast of greenville, this \"star\" was a little bigger now and it was changing from purple to blue to red to yellow and then a very bright fiery orange color.  i slowed down very slow as did several other vehicles on the interstate.  as i fumbled around for my phone the object was growing larger.  i also noticed a plane near the object (in the sky it looked near it but i have no way of knowing how close they really were) and it was a tiny little blinking light compared to this \"star\" object.  that's when i began to feel scared and i finally got my phone unhooked from the charger in my truck and was initially thinking about taking a picture of the object but on instinct i dialed 911 emergency.  i don't think it was the fact that i didn't understand what i was saying, but more the fact that with the elections and all this could have been some kind of terrorist attack of some sort.  when the lady answered, \"hunt county emergency...\" i looked up and the entire object was gone.  totally vanished.  you could see a sort of foggy, smoky looking film in the sky beside the moon where the object had been.  it was strange, as if the object \"heard\" me making the call and disappeared before people could get evidence of some kind.  i felt as if i was a very small, insignificant speck in a large universe at this time.  i described everything to the woman and she said it sounded like a meteor or something.  i have seen many meteor showers in my life but never have i seen one coming into the atmosphere for 14 minutes.  also, this object never moved.  it just expanded and grew into the size of a b-b pellet in the sky with changing colors and mainly a bright orange around the time it disappeared.\r\n\r\ni need to disclose that i have been seeing these types of phenomena here in texas since 2005, when i first moved here.  this is the first time i have ever reported something to authorities or public figures because i am going into a professional career and i wouldn't want people to think that i was strange or hallucinating or something.  this has been going on for quite some time and i can only speculate as to what is really going on in our skies above northeast

husband joe, was in breckenridge, texas, at our farm just outside of town.  i'm house sitting at his dad's farm in eastland county, so joe called me to see how i was doing. as we were talking, he was sitting out on the porch, looking at the stars in a clear sky. suddenly he saw a bright light way up in the night sky, traveling from the ssw to the nne, moving very fast.  faster than any jet and much higher up.  he was very excited (for him that is unusual), telling me what he was seeing.  i am located only 45 minutes sse of him, so with him still on the phone, i ran outside to try and see it myself.  unfortunately, by the time i got outside and my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, the object had already disappeared.\r\njoe described the object as brighter than any star in the sky, including the planets. he said the object did not \"twinkle\" but remained a constant brightness, like light reflecting off a mirrored surface, or possibly that it produced it's own steady bright white light.  it appeared at that distance, to be the size of a grain of rice and approximately the same shape (ovoid or cigar). he estimated the altitude to be over 80,000 ft. and traveling in a straight line, nne.  the object had no navigation or anti-collision lights. from his perspective, the object passed to the east of polaris (north star) and simply disappeared.  he did not believe it was a jet, or a satellite and it was traveling to fast to be a weather balloon, which we both has seen in the past. total viewing time was approximately 90 seconds.\r\n\r\njoe was in the military for 13 years, in army aviation.  he has seen and been able identified all sorts of man-made aircraft.  he told me that he has never seen anything like this before and i consider him a very knowledgeable

also getting closer to the object.  thats when i knew it wasnt a plane.  first off ive never seen any kind of plane with lights like that, i also noticed the lights were blinking one after the other, but very dim like. at this point i slowed down a little and rolled down my window wondering if i could hear a plane engine, thinking it could still be a plane.  i didnt hear an engine but i heard a weird beeping noise that seem to be beeping as the lights on the ship where blinking.  after all this i would still maybe think it was a plane, but the one thing that spooked me and made me think otherwise was the fact it was hovering.  it didnt make and fast movement, and it could have even been moving slow, but it was hovering for sure, it was a very windy night and as it was hovering i could see it swaying back and forth fighting the wind.  about two years ago i spotted a ufo which slowly flew over the city, that was the biggest craft weather it be a plane or ufo that i have ever seen in my life.  the craft i saw last night was way smaller, like the size of a small plane, but all i could see were the four lights, i couldnt make out any other part or shape of it.  once i took a

middle of a cornfield. there were approximately 10-12 people out there. i was standing with two other people talking to them and happened to look up in the sky and noticed a bright white light that was stationary. it was a clear summer night and visibility was excellent. i observed the light for a few minutes and notices that it began to change colors in almost a strobing pattern while still remaining stationary. the object flashed from white to green to red and to blue. the other people noticed this as well. there were no other stars in the sky or any other aircraft either. we watched this object remain stationary and change colors for approximate fifteen minutes or so. a friend of ours needed a ride to his home in peoria and asked if i could take him there. i agreed to and he and i and my younger brother and another friend got into my vehicle to leave for peoria. i was driving,the guy who was going to peoria was in the front seat, and my brother and his friend were in the back. as we left the area where everyone was congregated, we started driving down the farmer's lane towards eden rd. the farmer's lane was approximately 1/8 of a mile long until it reached eden rd. we had gone several hundred feet when all of a sudden my brother and his friend started screaming about something coming after us. my brother started crying(literally) and yelling \"please don't let them get us!\". they both were freaking out and were extremely distraught. i became a little frightened as well and i saw in the rearview mirror they were both looking at and pointing at the sky on the driver's side of the car. i looked out in the sky and approximately 300 ft. away and about 250 to 300 ft. in the air i saw a huge object in the sky. we had our windows down due it being a nice summer out and this object made no sound at all. it was parallel to the vehicle and following us silently. the object was as large as a farmhouse if not bigger, and was diamond shaped and was a dark color. there were whites that were kind of distorted near the bottom of the object and it appeared that were almost porthole like windows with white lights emanating from them that were encircling the object near the center of it. we were probably traveling at about 10 to 15 mph at this time and when i saw the object i hit the gas and began going very fast to about 45 mph. we were flying down this grass farmer's lane which was very bumpy as well. the object kept up with us and stayed paralle to the car and continued to make no sound at all. we finally got to eden rd. and when we need i made fast hard right onto eden rd. because this led to highway 116 which we were going to take into peoria. when we made this hard right, the object made a sharp fast ninety degree turn as well and with no sound. it was  a short distance to 116 and the object went higher into the sky. i sped down eden and when i got to 116 i blew through the stop sign due to no traffic as i made another sharp fast turn onto 116. as we go onto 116 and sped towards hanna city the object had gone out of our view. i then saw the object come over the top of the car and shoot off into the sky at a very high rate of speed. we followed its path into the sky and it went very far out and high into the sky and then appeared to stop again and once again resembled the extremely bright white light that i had orginally witnessed at the beginning of this encounter. i told them to keep an eye on it and i did as well and as we drove the approximately 8 miles into peoria to my friend's house it followed us all the way there but remained the bright white light. all of us were extremely shaken up and could not believe what we had just experienced. i dropped my friend off and we decided to take a back route back to the farmer's lane on eden rd. we got onto route 8, which is a dark, untraveled road at that time of night. we still saw the bright object in the sky as we made our way back. as we continued on, near resevoir blvd., i saw someone walking alongside the road. i slowed down and crept past and we noticed that it was someone we knew, our friend winston who lived about five miles away and had no reason to be out there around 12 or so at night on a desolate country road. we pulled over and asked him what he was doing and he appeared very disoriented and was acting very weird. he got into the car and we proceeded on our way. he said that he had this compelling impulse to just leave his father's house and to make his way to that area and that he had even taken a bike from a yard to make his way over there. he said he didnt know why he did but he just felt like he had to. he also mentioned that he was scared while he was by himself and that he felt like there was something in the woods following him and watching him. we told him our story and as we finally made it back to the farmer's lane the light was still there. when we got back, everyone was surprised to see winston and saw how excited we were. i told them the story and then pointed out to them the stationary bright white light in the sky and told them it had followed us back. a friend of ours said thats a just a star and we didnt know what we were talking about. as we watched the object for a few minutes, it began to slowly move and then accelerated off into the night sky and disapppeared and we never saw it again that night. i looked at the person who had doubted us and said \"oh yea, thats really a star huh?\" what we saw that night i have never seen anything like it and do not know of any aircraft or objects that are man-made that could possibly explain what this was. i am college educated and a reasonable and sensible person as well. i have seen other lights in that area over the year that resemble what we saw that night but never have i seen anything as close as we did that night. if you have any questions or need addtional information please feel free to contact me at your convenience. i have told this story to many people throughout the years since this incident occurred and i now feel like this is important enough to be shared with so maybe it can be explained or help somehow. i have seen other reports of sightings that have matched what i saw since i had that encounter and it leads me to believe these could be similar objects. thank you for your time in reading this report and i hope it is detailed enough so that it may be of some assistance to you.\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),

yards from their property.At first he thougt that some kids where playing whith some kind of a remote control flying toy, but it was too big about 6 feet tall, and then he called one of his sons and asked him if he knew what the hell that was,and his son screamed \"a ufo\" and ran into the house. he stared feeling a little nervious but he tried not to show it and called his son to come out and asked: how do you know it is a ufo if you never saw one before? but he also knew that it was something out of this world because it wasn't making any noise and it didn't have windows or wings, it was moving slowly over the little river and over a tequila factory near by.They kept waching it for over 20 minutes floating back and forth, and then stared flaying away very slowly following the river course.He said it was very bright and it had little \"cuts\" as if was cover by lots of little mirrors like the sphere they used to put on top of the dance floors back in the 70's. he is a pretty honest guy and knows the difference between an airplane a helicopter or other human made object and he said that whatever that was it wasn't form this neighborhood.I know he is telling the truth.

 i always thought i wouldn't believe until something came down and shook my hand.  but i can no longer deny what i've been seeing for the past year.  i drive at night all the time as i'm a night person.  so i know what stars look like, i know how a plane looks and flashes and how fast they move but this isn't like anything i'm used too seeing.\r\n\r\nit was in middle of january, a tuesday, and i was driving from allen,tx too my friends apartment in denton.  i was going down hw 380 and this is a road i drive all the time at day and night so i'm extremely familiar with the area.  it was around 11:00 pm-11:10pm  there weren't many other cars on the road but me which was slightly odd but it happens from time too time.  as i passed the intersection for hw 377 i saw a very large, very bright, triangular object in the sky in the north bound direction.  it appeared too be falling fast and i mean really fast. now as you pass 377 there is a large hill and i lost track of it for a split second when i was at the bottom of the hill.  because it was falling so fast i first thought \"oh my god!! a plane is crashing what should i do!\"  but as i reached the top of the hill i can see that it is now hovering.\r\n\r\nright after the hill there is a bridge to get over the edge of a lake.  the object went from several hundred feet in the air too an abrupt hovering about 80-90ft above the lake about 50-60ft off of the edge of the bridge.  i could have thrown a rock or baseball and hit it was so close.  the object was triangular and gun metal colored, not shinny, like coal almost like it could have had some texture too it. it had 3 bright lights, one at each corner and a bright red light in the middle it was about the size of a 747 but maybe a little bigger area wise as it was solid.  a plane has clear wings and a tale this didn't, it was just a large triangle.  clearly when something that large is falling that fast and then stops in mid-air, just stops and starts to hover it can shake you and it scared the hell out of me.  but i slammed on my brakes too stop and see what the it was and i stopped in the middle of the bridge.  no one was coming behind me or infront of me at the time so i seemed to be the only one there.  i watched it hovering for another thirty second and i decided to get out and i tried not too take my eyes off of it.  i got out and got too the rail of the bridge. this is i noticed it wasn't making any noise.  it was completely silent then about 10 seconds later it tilted up slightly in my direction it wasn't standing straight up more like a 30-45 degree angle then vanished right infront of me!  i was staring right at it and it just disapeared like the greatest magic trick i've ever seen!  something that big doesn't just become invisible.  i can't explain what i felt.  but i sat there stunned still for another minute or two looking searching the sky, the ground, the lake anywhere i could but it was gone entirely.  shortly two cars passed, one in each direction.  both slowed down too about 30mph from 60mph as they passed me and came over the bridge it seemed like they were looking for it.  they both looked out over the lake and pointed at me as they passed but they didn't stop.  i think they had seen it too but i obviously don't know for sure or who they are etc... \r\n\r\ni had another siting with a friend about two months later.  it was at the end of march and i had only told him because he's my best friend and he was the only one i could trust to not think i'm insane or something.  but we were driving down the same road headed back from denton towards allen this time.  and as we passed the dallas north tollway on 380 we both witnessed the same object. it was only about 10 miles from the other siting.  but it certainly was the same shape, same three lights, same red light, and about the same size but it was farther away this time but we were able too see it for a greater amount of time.  we were driving for about 4-5 miles able too see this thing in the air.  we thouhgt plane or helicopter but then we noticed that for about 2 minutes it didn't move at all.  then we thought light on a pole so something doesn't hit it but we drive that road all the time and we know there usually isn't and hasn't been since that night.  plus it was so high more like a plane but a low flying plane.  so we ruled out all we could think of.  with-in the last mile we watched it entently until we passed it.  it was still about half a mile from 380.  we were not alone on that road there is no way we were the only ones able to see it but again i'm not sure if anyone else on the road did.  no one had stopped and before we could stop to watch, it vanished just like the last one did.  we were looking at it and was about to stop so i looked forward and he said foley it's gone.  this time i did lose track of it for a second and he said the same thing but it was 100% gone when we looked back.  and neither of us said anything too anyone about it.  until now obviously.  \r\n\r\nhe said he \"doesn't know what he had seen and leave it at that.\"  i asked him if i reported this if he would also but he wont.  but he was there with me!!  and he does know this event happened.  \r\n\r\ni'm not sure what's happening too me really, but in august i had seen it again on the back road too my house on country club rd.  it was about 4:00am and it flew right over me stopped over a housing development and the crossed back over the road and over the top of me two more times before taking off into the atmosphere.  same thing triangular, three lights, red lihgt in the middle and it wasn't a plane, a plane doesn't just stop and then start going the other direction and then into space.  and i really have this strange unsettled feeling like i'm being followed or watched.  i know it sounds crazy and stupid but there was one night that i lost track of about 3 hours of my night and it was right after there was this extremely bright light outiside my room.  i was playing poker online at about 1:00am and all of a sudden there was a light that filled up my room i thought it was a car with it's light on my window but i'm on the second story and when i looked outside there wasn't any car and the light went away about 5 seconds after i started looking out the window but it could have only come from above me because i couldn't see anything on the ground in position to hit my room with a light.  so it had too come from above.  but the next thing i remember after that is that i woke up and it was like 4:30am, and again about 3 hours were gone.  \r\n\r\ni know what a skeptic would just say that i fell asleep playing poker but i never had before or since.  and i'm always up playing cards so this was a very normal night other than what happened too me.\r\n\r\ni can't explain what has been happening to me but in know i'm sane i know i'm smart and i know i'm really scared!  i didn't know what else too do other than report to mufon.  i've watch all i can on tv and i've heard similar reports and similar experiences but i feel powerless to do anything about what i'm seeing and i can't stand that feeling.  i honestly don't even know what this will do but i can't stand doing nothing but be afraid anymore.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":13558,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.2227412,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11062008-0005","longitude":-97.1260283,"occurred":1199862600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1199862600000,"summary":"I've scene 3 ufo's in the past year!!!

i had no explanation for this and it really freaked me out. over the summer i also think that i just had bad sleep insomnia but every night i would wake up at 3am. i would then either go get a drink or just put my head back down. before i knew it, it was 7am and i was wide awake. now before summer i would always sleep in until the afternoon. there was no way you could get me out of bed before 10am. ever since then i have waken up at 7am. i have witnessed more and more ufo's. i don't know if anything is going on. personally i think i had a sleeping problem or something because to this day i wake up at 7am every morning no matter what time i go to bed; however on those nights i would wake up at 3am, i would go back to sleep, and what felt like a second i was awake and it was 7am.

turned onto rt.78 off of i-74, my usual route.  soon after turning onto this road, i saw in front of me, and up in the sky, what i initially thought to be a guided missle because this was the only thing i could relate to at the time.  i rationalized that the rest of the \"missle\" couldn't be seen, since this was the only thing that made sense to me.  terrified, and believing this \"missle\" could hit somewhere around galsesburg, illinoi (an hour away), i pressed the gas pedal of my car to the floor hoping to make it home so i could see my husband one last time before the \"missle\" hit.  i've never been so terrified.\r\n\r\nit was difficult to estimate just how high in the sky it was flying, but it was about the height of a tall chicago building.  moving too slow to be an airplane, and traveling horizontal to the ground, i ruled out a meteor too.  it was just something very brightly lighted and sort of glowing red/orange.\r\n\r\ni watched the object for only a short amount of time while it was in front of me and then soon right over my car, traveling in a more or less straight line heading west above illinois 74.  when i turned around to see if it was still there a few minutes later i could no longer see it.  \r\n\r\ni really didn't expect to make it home that night (because i thought this some sort of disaster), but when i did arrive home about 10 minutes later i thought my husband would be able to tell me what the object was, figuring the local television stations would have broken into regular programing to comment on this emergency.  but to my astonishment, my husband had heard nothing.  i didn't report this to anyone, feeling rather silly and thinking no one would believe me.  \r\n\r\nnow, i wish i had called the authorities and would very much like to know if anyone else saw this object that night.  surely others saw it since it was so huge and unusual but i've never heard any more about it.\r\n\r\nlinda","distance":"101-500
