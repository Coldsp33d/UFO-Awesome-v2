to my left. i thought it was a helicopter at first, but realized there was no tail or rotor, and no sound. it was slow-moving, wobbling and seem to almost change shape (thought it was mostly oval). i am tempted to think it was rotating. sometimes an outer edge seemed to catch a reflection from the sun, either top or bottom, but not at the same time. the edges seemed rounded, like an oval. it was mostly dark and dull colored though sometimes seemed faintly maroon or reddish brown. at some points, for a split second, it was invisible and blended in with the sky, which you can see from the attached videos. \r\n\r\nthe object was definitely smaller than a helicopter, and could have been closer in size to a canoe. it moved in a steady path, never changing altitude. i took a photo at 10:57 am and finished taking video at 10:59 am. the object came from the east, going west, but i last spotted it north, going past my condo building. the object was closest to me in the photo and the first video still frame, attached.\r\n\r\ni only have an iphone, so i snapped a photo and two videos. i had zoomed as much as possible for the first photo, and then took two videos, each about 30 seconds long. the videos are very unremarkable, and my apologies. you have to really strain to see the object moving from center-right to the left. i took screen screen-grabs of the videos and circled the object, to give you a reference point of where to look. there really isn't enough resolution to make out much of anything, but as you can tell from the videos the only sound is ambient noise from outdoors, not the sound of an aircraft or drone. the only thing the video proves is that the object blends into the blue sky for a split second, a few times, as i described. i am certain it wasn't a balloon because it maintained a steady path at a consistent altitude. it wasn't jerky or lurching - it was an a steady aerial path. what is this? i desperately tried to see rotors but there was nothing that i could see, only the oval-ish shape.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

on my balcony and saw a craft between  the tree's there's ano opening, at first i thought it was one of those  drones i know two guy's that have them and they both spy on people so really was looking and it wasn't that it was a dimond shape with bright light's then i saw like a blueish green and a pinkish red light's on the right outside of the dimond and like the dimond was inside a square then

the tree's i kept looking then i saw another craft above higher up in the sky then another one and one more so three after i saw the the first one they were bigger and shaped different than the first ones these one's looked the same. i ran down stairs told my dad we went outside all of the sudden plane's stared to pass by one after another different shapes and sizes i took my phone with me and tried taking a photo the only thing was coming up was a speck that kept moving on myphone so i took a picture of it twice then i thought, maybe i can video tape it. what we saw in the sky didn't come

eye.  it looked like a chinese lantern so i jumped out of bed and ran to patio door in living room. was going to go out on deck to watch it go by. as i got to the door, i froze in spot as i saw another one coming right behind it about 15-20ft. i had so many thoughts going through my head at that time, but i knew i did not want the 2nd one to see me.  i backed up in the dark hoping it would not see me. they both were about 3 feet out from the deck and about one foot higher than the railing. they were about 2-3feet high and kind of flat on top and rounded on the sides. as it went by, i looked under it to see if a candle was lit and it was a solid object. it glowed yellow orange and it would change to orange yellow but not to were i could see the color change. i think it saw me at that point as the 1st one was now at my neighbors deck and took a sharp right to go over the field and then to the back of the grade school. as watching them, i heard an airplane coming above and looked up and then back down and they were gone.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

pointed above our fence & directly where we first saw the lights. needless to saw we were amazed beyond belief at what surfaced, blinked, come into focus & disappeared, & reappeared in a second, & yes, even shot beams of light downward. my husband is a skeptic when it comes to ufo's, but this evening may have made him a believer! what we were watching sure looked like round disk with something circular on its bottom. we back up to a street & a few cars did pass by, but the focus of my phone camera was difinitely way upwards of up towards the sky. you can hear our a/c unit kick on, as well as, our squeaky back door! my husband retired to bed, & when my arms gave out i said, enough for tonite. i was thrilled to have the footage & watched over & over. i repeated almost the same thing the next night. but their course had changed from the west to what i think is a little more northwest. i just turned to my right & started shooting over the connecting fence. where the first night seemed more like one or two interacting; there may have been four coming into the frame. i didn't stay as long as the night before, but my husband said, we had enough adventure for those two exciting

thrifty foods after getting grocery  and  observed irregular beautiful  glowing large star in sky it was stationary and seemed to stay that way for about five or so minutes.  until it started to move in bizarre way i  observed two other objects similar to the east one was stationary and one of the objects seem to be hovering around it in a counter clockwise like motion. before the stationary object  became also mobile as well the two objects  seemed to move towards the original stationary star  i was observing. i tried to video record and photograph these objects with my cell phone the photo's were unable to capture the objects however i was able to make  two  short recordings of these objects although the two secondary objects do not seem to have appeared in great detail i think this was due to the  elevation they were at the weather conditions were mostly clear with a few  clouds. the three objects  seemed to be interacting with one another and  quite aware they also seemed to avoid collisions before two of the objects elevated and departed at high speed i lost sight of them nor do  i know there direction as they departed out my sight in high speed. the one original object i was observing seemed to head towards mount tolmie in a south eastern flight path at high speed as  it ascended out of my sight. \r\n\r\ni originally thought this object's to be a bright star when they started to move i was perplexed i thought they might be ball lightning or  possibly drones of some kind or some sort of surveillance craft however i dismissed this after witnessing there odd air maneuvers their size  appeared to be   quite large and bright. i also  wondered if they might be some sort of foo fighter?\r\n\r\nthe encounter lasted less then 10 minutes. i have no idea what they are however.\r\n\r\n\r\non may the 14th at 10:34 i noticed two gentlemen looking at as i was catching the local bus to get to work  the sky and was shocked to see the same sort of stationary star like object  i began to speak to one of the  gentlemen as the other man departed. as i started to record what i was seeing on my cell phone the clips included are short as i had to get to work unfortunately  and i do not know the witnesses name. however he did say he thought the object was the moon however it seemed to be low in the sky which he thought was odd and that grabbed his attention as something did not seem right. he also told me when camping on denman island   last week  he  was by the shore and noticed similar objects however over the  ocean and descend into it \r\n\r\nthe aerial star like object we both observed for a period of 10 minutes  departed at high speed into the east.One thing i do find odd though when recording the  object in the sky  it made no sound however when viewing my  cell phone video later as the object starts to move  there is a strange audible sound which i cant explain.","distance":"101-500

from a laying down position, it suddenly stopped mid-flight and reveresed direction and erratically zig zagged away!\r\n\r\ni was stunned really because it seemed to react to my seeing it but it seemed so far away or maybe it was very small in size.  when it first came into view above me, i wasn't even thinking \"ufo\" as it was just a white dot which could have been anything really.  but i was just amazed that whatever this thing was, moved as fast as it did when it reversed direction and disappeared!  \r\n\r\ni thought about how a balloon would move if at that height and i could see a balloon change direction in the wind for sure but this sphere\\orb accelerated so quickly as to challenge any conventional drone or other air device.\r\n\r\ni read reports of orbs and ufo craft

which is beside a set of glass sliding doors that afford a broad view of the eastern skyline. i was looking at the weather, as it is a partly cloudy day and looks as though there is the chance of rain, when these two anomalies came into view (out of nowhere it seemed). they looked like large black plastic oblongs, with a red light at their forward end and they were travelling at roughly the same speed as conventional aircraft, side by side.  i mentioned them to my dad, because they were so unconventional and by the time he had got to his feet to see them, they had gone behind the trunk of a tall gum tree in the neighbours back yard (the tree only has a trunk roughly fifty centimetres in diameter). i expected the two oblongs to reappear on the skyline for dad to see them, but they didn't, it was as if they had disappeared into thin air? he suggested that they were probably just wind borne rubbish and that they had fallen to the ground, but had they been wind borne rubbish, they would have been travelling from north to south, instead of against the wind.\r\n\r\nthis is not the first anomalous object that has been observed in the skies over this region, which is very near to

feet tall.The craft also had two small round globes that were following it just behind and above the disk craft.The saucer and its two round companions all met up with a massive triangular shaped craft that was a 1000 meters long on each side of the triangle.This massive ship had a round subdued light at each corner.The space behind the massive ship was distorted in the shape of an egg and the stars were blurry looking through the distortion field.I estimate the altitude was 80,000 feet,well above normal commercial jets but still in the lower atmosphere.The four all seemed to merge together and then move away to the north.I could no longer see the saucer but the two globes were visible above the rear of the giant ship.They all moved north into canada until out of sight.Except for the

with no sound. with no sound is what gained my attention, as i looked closer there was no air craft lights, wings, tail, or nose??? it looked like a cigar shape with no rounded ends, the ends were flat. the craft it self was 400 to 500 feet long, and 150 to 200 feet in diameter. the whole craft was solid chrome with a red stripe through the center, the red stripe looked to be 30 to 50 feet from starting from one end, all the way down to other end and stopped at 30 to 50 feet other end. height of red stripe was between 30 to 50 feet. within the red stripe was a row of windows which was in center of height of the stripe, which looked to be a 15x15 or 25x25 windows size that went through the full length of the red stripe itself. as the craft traveled pass by me there was no sound, as i seen the windows i could see what i thought were people, but as some looked like people some looked different as people but like lizard, hard to understand seeing two type of what i was seeing in same craft. there was a light glow from within craft, but the crafts chrome would seam to have large flashes as different times. it moved slow like a blimp would move like they were watch seeing? the last bright flash i seen from craft, it was no longer there, just gone....No sound of any kind the whole time, of 55minutes to 1 hour and 15minutes i watched this go on. it would move and stop, then move

i have always been intrigued by astronomy and the possibility of life that exists other than how we know it. i can say with certainty that this was not a planet.
