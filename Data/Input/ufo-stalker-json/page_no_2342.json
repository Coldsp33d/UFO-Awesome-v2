a family ranch about 30 miles north near a small town called san isidro. my friends and i been planning to spend the night there since we have a ranch house on the property. this year was unusual in that opening day of deer season fell the day after halloween so that night we were pretty much occupied going to get togethers and what not.At  we ended up leaving the city at around 1 in the morning and arrived at the ranch house at around 1:30 a.M. i was with 5 other indvidual riding in the same vehicle which is my 2000 ford excursion. we arrived at camp decided that it was better to stay awake than to risk not waking up in the morning. all of us stayed up and made a fire under a tin porch and we barbecued fajtas,sirloin, and burgers. we stayed up cooking and playing poker until we decided it was time to start going so we loaded up on the truck and left the house at approximately 530. once arriving at the first gate which is hitched with a chain my freind go down to open the gate and i drove through and stopped to wait for him go get back on. it was during this pause that i observed a large ball of color changing light which appeared to be static in the sky and appeared to be to the right of the ranch house and facing more or lees south east of our position. i observed the light morphing into different colors without any pause between transitions the lights were literally morphing into different colors and hues or green blue, red, violets within fractions of a second it seemed almost like  a kaleidoscope sparkling in the sky. i got down from my truck and grabbed a pair of bushnell 10x32 binoculars and observed the light continuing to morph with light seeming to glow left to right and many horizontal angles. i did not believe what i was seeing so i asked my other friends to see if they were seeing the same thing they all said they were witnessing the lights change color and we identified the colors we were seeing aloud simultaneously. after about 5 minutes i witnessed the light seem to move positions and move towards the left hovering just right of the ranch house the light seemed to be about the size of large red antenna bulb but there are no antennas in that direction and the light seemed to be only 2-4 miles from wher we were aty hovering at the end of a filed and past a path of the woods. i considered the what the light could be but it was too close. large and colorful to be a satellite or planet or even star. considerations towards oter aircraft maybe be considered but the lights i saw continuously changed and morphed lights  and seeme to hover for extended periods of time and slowlya nd progressively hove. the lights were so bright i could not distinguish solid distinct shape but it seemed round and some what cross shaped in nature. after viewing this 20 minutes we decied we had enought and that it was getting late to go into the deer stand so we took off and i observed it from afar through the mirror as we road down the road.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13549,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.3797874,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11052008-0010","longitude":-98.8203046,"occurred":1225545000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1225545000000,"summary":"Multi

seemed to be above the delaware river from where i was.I asked my fellow employees if the were seeing it also after i got a much relived yes to my question from the south i heard the sound of a jet but could not see it the buildings blocked my view,then i could see a jet from the south go straight for the disk at high speed, the disk just went straight up and the jet went right through the spot where the disk was the jet veered to the left and the disk slowley descended back to its original spot the jet made a wide circle around center city philly and made a second run at the disk again, the disk just went straghit up and the jet went around the city  again the disk just came back down slowly to its original spot ,then my co worker- who was in some service of the military said that it was a nasa jet because it had blue tipped wings i saw the blue tips but i dont know that stuff. the jet reapeared for the third pass at the disk this time the disk went up and slightly away to the east and was gone. but here is were it gets interesting my heart and my mind was going nuts i made my deliverys the i stoped at a friend house for lunch and on the tv on the news the were saying and i

sky at that time (i counted 6 airplanes complete with trails at the time).  scanning the horizon while stopped at a traffic light, i noted 2 more airplanes with trails in the distance.  i then glanced up high in the sky out the driver's side window and happened to see a shining light, very small but up much higher than the airplanes.  it was zipping along at a much faster rate than the airplanes were flying.  it had no trail.  i shouted to my grand mother \"do you see that!  look!  look!\"  unfortunately my grandmother wasn't able to see the light from the passednger seat as it was above her line of vision due to the roof of the van.  not only that, but she is legally blind in one eye and has somewhat limited vision in the other.  i realized that the light was so small she probably would not be able to see it anyway.  i did not bother to try to photograph the light as it was very small and i doubted that its image would have been recorded on my camera (which i now carry with me, just in case - but not enough zoom power to capture the light, i guessed).  moreover, it was moving at such a high rate of speed that i also doubted that i would be fast enough to capture it in a photograph if i pulled over, as it was moving in the opposite direction.  the light turned green and i had to move on, and thus quickly lost sight of it.  when we arrived at our destination, i scanned the sky for the light but as i expected, it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\njust to be sure in my own mind, i have a few questions.  are satellites ever visible as small reflective-type lights during the day?  do satellites appear to move faster than planes?  this thing was so high up i suppose it could have been a satellite, as it was moving at a uniform rate and was moving in a straight line.  the light did not appear to be a meteor as it was not descending, nor did it have a tail, nor was the color of the light red (it was plain white, like a reflection or just a white light) but do meteors ever appear as white lights in the sky?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:25","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

project at the beach off of seabreeze blvd. in fort lauderdale, florida, usa, i noticed north of where i was standing at lat 26���6'44\"n and lon 80���6'15\"w, at between 10��� to 20��� altitude, a round, brilliant, gold and white ball moving on an apparently south-east direction and holding its altitude.  \r\n\r\ni trained my camera at the moving element and zoomed in as much as i could with the normal lens i had on the camera at the time, following the element's south-east path.  in total, i took twenty-two (22) pictures of the ufo's sighting, sequentially numbered from _mg_1669.Jpg (@11:22:04 am) through _mg_1690.Jpg (@ 11:23:09 am).  \r\n\r\nthis was no weather balloon, especially as evidenced in files _mg_1686.Jpg (@11:23:00 am) and _mg_1687.Jpg (@ 11:23:03 am).  _mg_1686.Jpg shows the element still flying at a steady speed, after which it disappeared totally; it went 100% invisible, right before my camera eye, as shown on file _mg_1687.Jpg.  \r\n\r\ntoday's flying ball looked in some aspects very much like one i photographed from the same location on 15-sep-2008 and later on reported to several ufo-information-gathering web sites, including mufon.  during that first sighting on 15-sep-2008 i was shooting with a different camera that allowed a better close up of the brilliant flying ball, while capturing two more orange-with-transparency flying balls.  \r\n\r\nsoon after today's sighting, more precisely at 12:06 pm, i contacted h���ctor trujillo, mufon's field investigator in the area, from my cell phone and told him what happened.  i told h���ctor i would copy for him all the picture files, untouched, straight from my camera's memory card onto a cd, which i already did.  \r\n\r\ni am uploading with this report to this website three of the 22 pictures mentioned above.  the first one (# _mg_1669.Jpg) shows the general location of today's flying ball with relationship to the beach, sky and buildings in the area.  the second (# _mg_1675.Jpg) and third (# _mg_1683.Jpg) pictures are blowups or magnifications of the better of the remaining files, showing the flying ball.  bear in mind i didn't have a telephoto lens on my camera; i was shooting with a wide-to-normal lens (18mm - 55mm).  \r\n\r\ni am mufon's journal subscriber no. 13121.\r\n","distance":"101-500

time kicked in, so there was still the dusky watercolor of twilight in the sky. i check out what's in the heavens as i drive to and from work; catch a meteor or watch aircraft every now and then. my drive time is approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes each way - st. cloud, mn to the twin cities and vice versa.  i had just passed the silver lake road exit on hwy 694 and was heading west (and north) towards st. cloud. there's a lot of air traffic through the 694 corridor, as i am not far from the international airport, and something odd caught my eye as it was flying parallel to my car and i could see it from underneath. i can't say at what altitude it was flying or the exact size, but i can say that the majority of other air traffic was either taking off or coming in for landing were approximately at same height.  i was able to keep my eye on the object until i got close to the east river road split, where it banked off to my left and i lost it behind the skyline. the traffic behind me was probably not happy with me; but there was no place for me to stop - and i didn't want to cause an accident. the shape of the object was triangular, it wasn't so much the shape that

assembly plant in edison, nj, from 1991 to 1995. i was responsible for night-time security of an outdoor staging lot filled with new vehicles waiting to be loaded onto specialized railroad cars each morning. part of my job was to walk through the lot and place inspection slips on the dashboard of each vehicle. one night while i was carrying out this procedure, my attention was suddenly drawn to a brightly illuminated section of cloud cover overhead. my first thought was that it was just a spotlight being tested for a store opening or some other such event. i panned the horizon, looking for a beam of light eminating from the ground, but no such beam was visible. as i continued to observe the lighted area of clouds, i felt strongly that the light source was shining through the cloud cover from above. here's where the story gets really interesting. while looking directly at the illuminated section of clouds, the color of the light changed instantly from white to red. it remained red for approximately 10 seconds, then instantly changed back to a white color. after approximately 10 more seconds, the light went out as if someone threw a swith to turn it off. the area of lighted clouds was stationary throughout the duration of the event - no movement whatsoever. i am still convinced that the light source was eminating from above the cloud cover and shining through the clouds form above, not reflecting off the underside like a spot light. i am a graphic designer and i have an advanced knowledge of lighting effects - reflection, refraction, ambience, etc... no light beams were visible. there was no noise at all  - just dead silence. i worked as a night watchman at various locations for almost 15 years and i have witnessed meteors, lunar eclipses, planes, helicopters... you

from the family across the street larry, dennis and one of the girls either evelyn or joyce heifner and i took them to the grey base just over the hill from where i lived at 615 plum st novato calif. to see the base that was there.  at the time i was greatly impressed by the base and was strongly attracted to it.  we went to the ratty old grey house that served as one of the entrances to the base and we saw the following sight.  a landed smaller ufo was sitting on the ground behind the old house.  it was the same type that i and larry, dennis heifner and steven laycock explored when we found it empty on the same hill side in another event.  at the foot of the ladder of the ufo that was behind the old house were three young human women in bubble hair dos that were kind of huddled together and acting subdued.  one of the twin young men that i have mentioned in other postings at the mufon site was talking to  a grey a little ways away from the women.  the young man was about 20 years old white dark hair and had an over all italian look to him and was dressed in dark clothes.  the grey was a classic grey.  as we watched things from the edge of the surrounding brush in the back of the house i became very concerned for the safety of the women that the young man was selling them in effect to the grey.  the man had a big smug grin on his face and was a vicious predator in appearance.  very dangerous.  the grey saw us and paniced and said \"look down\"  so i looked down at the ground.  the grey was furious that we were there seeing what was going on.  my sister who was younger said \"dont you hurt my brother\"  she was young but she would have fought for me.  the grey said \"go away and stop bothering us\" and that is about where my current memory of the event stops.  i have selected this event out of many because of the multiple witnesses and the presence of a landed ufo, other adult abductees, the human like man working with the greys and the presence of the grey.  the ufo is as i have described in postings at mufon.  round with a dome in the center. tripod landing gear hinged at the edge of the thing, stairs coming down from the center a ring of vents on the out side edge. tail on the top part.It was the color of the dry grass on the hill at the time.  the event establishes the presense of greys and ufos at the house and the fact that human like beings were working with the greys probably as agents in our society at that early date.  it also establishes that abduction were being carried out by the human like beings.  at the time i was very concerned for

dangerous.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13526,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.1111098,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11042008-0010","longitude":-122.5684932,"occurred":-360295200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-360295200000,"summary":"I

object crossing from west to east. it was boomerang shaped, with 6 very intense blue-green lights on the leading edge. it was travelling at a very low altitude, about 500 feet above the ground, at approximately 30mph. it was completely silent, and blotted out the stars as it passed over and out of my line of sight behind the neighbors homes and trees. i was so excited when i realized i must have seen a ufo, i ran inside and woke my wife, who asked if i had the telescope handy. i am an astronomy buff, and had considered bringing out the telescope, as the sky was very clear. too bad i didn't, as i would have gotten a good close-up look! this morning i called the boca chica naval air station, which is quite close to me, just across the highway (busy us1) and a few miles east. they had no knowledge of any object, but did tell me two helicopters were in the vicinity around that time. in the past they've had surveillance blimps at the base, so initially that's what i thought it was, until it moved closer. i live in a suburb just north of key west called key haven, where there are few street lights and little other light interference. there is no place at the air station for something this large to land, so i doubt it originated there. i find it difficult to believe no one else has reported this (so far), and i even called the local newspaper, \"the key west citizen\", to ask if anyone had called them about it. i have a background in surveying, so i'm able to fairly accurately judge distance, angle, and size - this thing was huge, and passed almost directly overhead. i don't drink or do drugs, i have a degree in biology, and i work as a construction estimator and occasionally do autocad drafting.  i'm a \"show me\" kinda guy - n0-nonsense, logical, and pretty straight-forward. this is definitely a first for me; i've always tried to keep an open mind, never saying never, but i will never forget this experience. with or without my telescope, i will always be looking for a repeat performance. one of the guys i spoke with at the base said he'd check the radar data and call me back, but i doubt he will.","distance":"101-500

up to see what if anything is visible. i have witnessed orange spheres on various occasions in various formations. they appear as if a light switch is turned on and disappear as if the switch is turned off. sometimes they come on all at once and sometimes one at a time. as you can see from the photo they are quite bright. the ufos seem to flicker which may be the effects of the atmosphere. the only time i see them move is when they reappear in a different position. i have no clue how high they are. one of the first sightings was in the early spring of 2006 at approximately nine pm wherein i saw three spaced similar to the two in the photo. when i shined a green laser at them they disappeared and instantly reappeared with five and formed into a huge \"w\" in the same area of the sky. the fact that they disappeared and reappeared may be coincidence, if they are located approximately one-hundred miles from my location. if they are that far away they would have to be huge. on another occasion i saw six in a very odd lopsided rectangle. i was unable to get photos of that event. every sighting occurred at approximately ten pm on tuesday. i never heard any sound. on a number of occasions i have seen and heard six to twelve f-16's from luke air force base heading in the direction of the lights. i never felt threatened or danger. just a strong curiousity of where and what they are. the photo was taken using a canon rebel 35mm using a 75mm to 300mm lens, on a tripod, time exposure of 4 seconds.The photo is not changed in any way and yes i do have the negatives.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":13522,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0500581,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-11042008-0006","longitude":-111.0868711,"occurred":1213593300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,
