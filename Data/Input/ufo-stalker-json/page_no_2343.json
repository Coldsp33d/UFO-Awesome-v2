stop light. i was looking east, and noticed a bright, metallic appearing object in the sky. i could see that it was bigger than a point, but i could not determine its shape. my first thought was that it must be a mylar balloon floating up from some birthday party, until i realized that it was not moving, and this was a very windy day. i kept staring at it, wishing i had a pair of binoculars or something, because i wanted to know the shape. then i noticed that the stop light changed, and i looked to the street, and started to cross. when i got near the curb on the opposite side, i looked up again, and it was gone. i would estimate that time i spent walking was no longer than 15 seconds. i sure wish i had my eyes on it when it disappeared. i would like to have seen it if it went away at a high speed or something like that. to this day, i wonder what it might have been. my best theory is that it might be an aircraft landing light pointed directly toward me, which was turned off while i was crossing the street. this was broad daylight, so i am not sure i would have seen an aircraft landing light at this apparent distance. if it was an airplane, it had to be very far away to appear to be hovering like that. this is an old story, and i just thought i would mention it in case it meant anything to anyone who might have been in that area at that time. i know it was no later than 1995, in the summer, and i am pretty sure it was in the afternoon, which means the sun was behind me. that might have been why i thought at first it was a mylar ballon. a mylar balloon would reflect a lot of sunlight under those conditions. balloons usually rotate and move around, but this light was very steady. the time of the entire event was about 2 minutes.\r\ni had a friend in that area who says he saw 3 lights in a triangle formation flying very slowly over the rock quarry he was working at on the night shift. it followed the bottom of the valley where this quarry was located, and stayed at a very low altitude. i now think this description fits one of those big black triangles seen at night. i don't know when this was, or exactly where, but it was near castro valley. he was an old salt of the earth kind of guy who was not likely to make up stuff like that. he was near retirement at the time i knew him. i am sure his sighting happened a few years before the thing i saw there.\r\nthe county is just a guess. i am not sure which county castro valley is in, but it's in the bay area, near san leandro and oakland.","distance":"Over One

it passed over the brighness of the object suddenly changed to a faint red dot. i could track this dot as it proceeded north east. i lost it as it passed behind the neighbors house. the object made no noise. \r\n\r\ni called my father at 6:58pm after the object left my field of view. he lives about 20 minutes in that direction and i asked if he would go out and look west. hoping he would see this

sunny, clouds on the horizons, bulk of middle sky clear.\r\n\r\neye witness location: west sedona, az., near the safeway grocery.\r\n\r\nufo location:  \r\n\r\nstarting point: flying, north of west sedona, perhaps slightly northwest.\r\n\r\naltitude:  layman's guess, at least 1000 feet, but perhaps a few miles or more depending on actual size of craft.\r\n\r\ndirection of travel:  appx. east/northeast at first, and then began to move to the north.  towards the end, it appeared to come back south a bit.\r\n\r\nspeed: very, very slow.  even the local tourist bi-planes fly faster.  this could be equated to a bi-plane seen way, way off in the distance.\r\n\r\nat approximately 1:40 pm, i looked up from where i was sitting outside, to see a black hawk  of some kind, flying maybe 50 feet up.  as i admired the bird, and followed its' flight, it led me to this unknown object in the sky.\r\n\r\nmy first inclination was that it was a large piece of paper trash, such as a sheet of newspaper, that had been kicked up by the winds, as does happen sometimes.\r\n\r\nit did not, and never did at any point appear to be like any kind of plane i have ever seen, although i kept a close eye on it, trying to look for signs that it might be a plane.\r\n\r\nthe physical size was perhaps that of a medium altitude jet.  for comparison, the highest flying jets appear to me to be pinpoints of light in the sky, while with the low flying ones you are able to make out wings, tail, engines, ect.  this was too small to make out details, but significantly bigger than the 'pinpoints of light'.\r\n\r\nthe reason why i thought it was a piece of trash at first, was because of its' erratic pulsating light that it emitted or reflected.  it was immediately apparent that this was not a plane,  helicopter, balloon, or any other kind of man-made flying object.  it immediately reminded me of the thousand other times in my life where i've seen newspapers and other trash blown high up by the wind.\r\n\r\ni at first assumed that the sun light was simply reflecting off of this piece of trash, and because the object was being 'blown around', and possibly changing shape, as a sheet of newspaper would, it would explain the erratic pulses of light coming from it.\r\n\r\nhowever, as i continued to watch, my curiosity grew, as this began behaving less like a piece of trash, and more like a controlled object.\r\n\r\nits' flight path was stable, moving laterally across my vision, and its' speed and altitude  appeared steady.  the flight path of blown trash is usually very erratic, while this object sustained its first path for at least 3-5 minutes, before switching to the northerly path.\r\n\r\nat this point, i began to quickly rule out the 'trash' theory, and moved on to the 'large white bird' theory.   a large white bird, with shifting wing angles, might explain the pulsating light, and the very slow speed.  but are there any large, white birds in arizona?  at the time of writing this, i do not know, but i've certainly never seen any before now.\r\n\r\nthere are plenty of the black 'hawks' that fly around, like the one that led me to this ufo.  and as this ufo was fairly high up, it would have to at least be the size of one of these hawks.\r\n\r\nthis black hawk that led me to the ufo, seemed to lead me to two other comparisons, almost as if it was trying to help me make this report!\r\n\r\nthe next time i saw the hawk, it was probably 1000 feet up, or more, and it allowed me to compare the sizes between them.\r\n\r\nthe 3rd time, the hawk seemed to point out two other jets beginning to come across the sky.  the first things i noticed were the contrails.  i saw about 6 different jets around different parts of the sky over the next couple of minutes, and they all had contrails.  the ufo did not have any form of contrail.\r\n\r\nnow i will try to describe the pulsating light coming from the ufo.  it did not appear to have a regular pattern to the pulse, however it could have, but i would have needed a video camera to determine that.\r\n\r\nthe pulsating light would actually completely extinguish regularly, so that the object could no longer be seen at all.  this pulsing light was the only thing making the object visible for me.  now, this was in bright sunlight, so the object may not have been actually disappearing, just invisible to my eye when the reflectivity was low.\r\n\r\nthe pulsing of the light would 'switch on' in two different ways:  1) quickly, like a flash, and 2) more slowly, kind of fading in, like a dimmer switch.\r\n\r\nthe light would remain on, for perhaps a half of a second, and then fade or flash back out, and out of my vision.  the light never remained off for more than about half a second either.  the pulsing was continuous.  in fact, it quickly reminded me of the navy movies i've watched where morse code is flashed by submarine towers at night and in the fog.\r\n\r\nas the object began to move north, it seemed to get a little bit smaller, as one would expect.  but then it did appear to come back towards me for a bit at the end.\r\n\r\nafter i had watched it for appx. 7 minutes, i decided to run and get my video camera.  when i came back out, however, i searched for 10 minutes and was unable to locate it.\r\n\r\nthis is probably the first bona fide ufo i've ever seen, and nothing else that i have ever seen, or heard described as normal by aviators fits what i saw today.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:07:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

sphere. it was the friday before easter 1968. we were traveling to nm to visit relatives. we left ogden after work on friday. we traveled in the evening because traveling with 2 little babies was easier at night. we were traveling south and were approx. 20-30 miles past moab heading to monticello. we were the only car on that stretch of highway in the church rock / looking glass rock area of the desert. it was dark with no other lights in sight except our headlights. i'm estimating it was about 11:00 pm when all of a sudden the whole surrounding area of the desert lit up like daylight. i don't know where it came from but we could see through our windsheild a huge orange pulsating light hovering right above us. it was about 30 ft. in diameter and approx. 20-40 feet above us. i remember telling my husband,\"stop, it's going to hit us\". he braked and we just stared at it for what seemed like an eternity but it was probably only a minute or two. we did not hear anything or see it coming at us, all of a sudden this huge ball just appeared above our car. after a minute or so the light/sphere just sort of bounced over a couple of times to the east and disappeared over a mountain. the only comparison of what we saw that night would be like a bright orange sunset in the dimensions i described. i remember we were very scared and drove to monticello, the nearest town and parked in front of a downtown business and waited for dawn to continue our trip. we were just a young married couple with two little babies and it never occured to us to stop and report what we saw. we have always wondered if anyone else saw this. after this my husband and i became very interested in ufo's and to this day i wish i had documented every detail and the exact time everything happened. my husband disagrees with the time of sighting and thinks we lost some time that night. a few years back i wrote down everything my husband and i remembered from that night. this is the best recollection

fireplace at approximately 22:15 on a cool clear fall evening. we live north of dallas in mckinney texas, with an unobstructed view to the south. i have grown up around aircraft and i am very knowledgeable about most types of air planes. our house seems to be located in a position that gets a large amount of care-flight helicopters either directly over, or very near our location. we were watching the air traffic coming and going out of love field, dfw and addison airport, always trying to figure out who was going where. we noticed what we assumed to be a care-flight or a private plane headed directly towards us from love field (due south). it was a bright red/orange light that resembled a bright landing light or a spot light on the front of a helicopter that was pointed towards us from a distance of approximately 10 ��� 15 miles and at a low altitude of 500 ��� 1500 agl (above ground level). after several minutes, we noticed that the aircraft never seemed to get any closer. at that time i got my binoculars out to get a better look at what was going on. the only thing that i could tell was that the red/orange light was all that i could see. i thought i should have been able to see a rotating beacon and anti-collision lights. after a total of approximately 5 - 6 minutes, the light moved due west. now that i had what should be a side view of the craft, i knew that i could see the rotating beacon and the anti-collision lights. not only were there no other lights, the spotlight seemed to still be pointed to the north. this is when we both knew we were seeing something that just wasn���t quite right. it was moving to the west at about the speed a fast moving helicopter would be going at a distance of about 5- 10 miles. after a few more minutes, it stopped again. trying to rationalize what we were seeing, i thought a larger aircraft descending out of the south towards love field and then turning towards dfw (this may be possible due to the runways at love are 33 ��� 13 and dfw are 36 ��� 18), but we still couldn���t figure out why the light was that bright and moving that slow. the light was now standing still over dfw for another 4 ��� 5 minutes. as we were both watching this thing, it went due south over the horizon in a fraction of a second. after we could see the light move over the horizon, i had the feeling that the light was much larger and higher than what we had first assumed. i now believe it was approximately 5,000 agl, assuming that it was indeed over love field and dfw. the size of the light was approximately the size of a bb at arm���s length. the next morning we anxiously watched the news for a story on this light over dallas, there was no mention of anything. i called the towers at love field, dfw and approach control via land line and no one knew anything about what we had witnessed the night before. \r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

my truck and pulled up to a stop sign and heard a low ocillating sound that i thought was from my truck but it was not the same sound pitch. thats when i look up out of my windshield and saw an object moving over and perpendicular to hwy 515 going south approx. 300 to 400 feet above the ground. object was triangular in shape and the leading two points had faint low lights on each two points. the single rear point had two lights together. one was reddish and the other was a white light. i cannot remember if the rear lights were blinking or not. each leg of the triangle was about 200 to 300 feet apart. i saw the rear lights first then a second later i saw the faint front lights. i'm not certain that the lights were connected but it seemed to be so because the background of the sky was lighter than the foreground of the craft. i thought maybe this was a helicopter but i only heard a faint sound of a low pitch ocillating sound. i thought maybe the front lights were from the rear double lights and that it was a reflection off mist in the sky but it was a clear night. the object moved slowly about 40 to 50 mph. i first thought that this was one of the silent military helicopters but realized that there are no bases close by. as i drove onto the main road i lost sight of the object. the location was about 5 miles on the north side of blue ridge, georgia going north toward blairsville, georgia.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

after returning from taking her mother around the corner for a walk.  mother was wheelchair bound and the day was so beautiful that witness said she was enjoying the warm winter day with her family members.\r\n\r\nwitness was looking for birds to show her grandchild who liked the activity.  the trees were bare of leaves and there were no birds in sight.  the sky was clear blue and sunny.  as witness was searching the sky, she noticed an object in the sky that looked at first like a tool or an upside down screw.  she thought to herself .. \"what the hell is that?\" and asked her niece if she saw it.  she said her niece got frightened, said she didn't see anything and went in the house. \r\n\r\nwitness continued to watch the object.  there was no noise, no sound, and the object was getting closer to her, very, very slowly.  as it came closer she saw that the object looked like a short lighthouse, wider at the bottom and smaller at the top.  it was just slowly flying in the sky at what witness estimated to be maybe 5 mph.  she described the object as being old and rusty looking, reminding her of something midieval, with no windows or doors visible.  as it approached closer to her view -- which she states \"i never turned away, kept looking at it the whole time\", it dropped closer to earth.\r\n\r\nat this point, witness said she saw a metallic flash, like the way a pie pan would flash in the sun, and the object turned brilliant like glowing metal.  it began to change shape as she watched. first, it looked like a dumb bell and continued to glow. it then changed into an hourglass shape.  she noticed that seagulls began to fly around it attracted, she said, by the glint of the shiny metallic shape.  witness said that the seagulls began to glow as well. then, the object turned into a box shape, changing into the same color as the seagulls, like it was trying to camouflage itself. then it went back to the hour-glass shape, and began to move west in the direction of port st. joe.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

wastes anyone's time. --- it was two days before my brothers 10th birthday. my parents had taken him to el paso to shop for gifts. i stayed with my grandparents. i was 12. my grandma was sick so i spent a lot of time outside. i rode my bike everywhere. on this particular day i had eaten breakfast and headed out on my bike to \"explore\", my favorite pastime. i headed up to the foothills to follow gullies and rabbit trails, look for coyote tracks, whatever. i had been out awhile. i remember thinking i was getting hungry and it was getting late in the morning. i should get home for lunch. my intention was to go back down the wash, the way i had come, but decided to climb the bank and see if there might be a shorter route. i climbed to the top of the bank and that's when i saw it. it rose from behind the hill to my right. i would guess i was about a quarter mile from the hill. i remember thinking initially it was a giant balloon, it rose slowly like a balloon would, but it was the oscillation that bewildered me. it moved like a decelerating quarter that had been spun on a table, as the quarter slows it does that weird warped wobble, that was the movement this thing exhibited. it was a good size, it was disc shaped, no humps no bumps, nothing, it was non-descript and brown like paper bag or cardboard box brown. it rose, stayed stationary for a bit. it moved left about 3 lengths, then back right, then straight up. i watched it until it disappeared. as it  headed up, it rose slowly at first and then got faster. i have no idea how long i watched it. i put down 5 min but it could have been a couple minutes either way. i got a little scared, climbed back down and got home fast. my father was working at holoman afb on the high speed test track. he had taken me to several air shows and we spent a lot of time looking at planes and stuff. i told him about it later and he said it was probably nothing, so i just kind of blew it off. i always wondered what it was. i've never seen anything like it since. i hesitate to even report this. it seems so silly but maybe someone else has seen this thing. who knows, maybe my encounter will add credence to another���s.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

from a buddy's house a little after 1am.  i pulled in my subdivision, and when i was turning onto my street, i saw two bright white/orange lights off to the northwest.  i stopped my car at the intersection, and watched the lights for 2-3 minutes.  they were moving very slowly, but surely were headed right towards me.  while they were still 2-3 miles away, i quickly pulled in my driveway and got out to have a wider view.  they were moving northwest to southeast, but when they were about a mile away, they turned straight south.  i kept my eyes on them, and they moved ever so slowly closer.  by the time they were as overhead from me as they could be, they could not have been more than a half mile away, maybe 2,000 feet in the air.  when the first one passed, i saw one large orange oval light on the bottom, 6 more round white lights in the middle, a smaller red light on each side, and three white lights on what appeared to be the tail \"wing\" of the craft.  it was emitting two orange contrails, about the length of the craft, that could not be missed, they were very luminescent.  after the first two crafts passed, i looked back to the north, and i saw another emerge above the trees, and as it passed, another one came into view.  all of them were following the exact same path, almost like planes in a flight pattern near an airport, and all of them looked identical.  the odd thing about this was i've never seen a plane with this many lights on the bottom, especially with an orange light, and i live a good 30 miles from ind airport.  none of these crafts made a sound as they passed overhead, which is also odd because of the close proximity of them, and the wind was blowing straight in my direction, which would've helped any sound emitted reach me.  if they were jets, they would have easily been heard.  the same goes for helicopters, small private planes, etc...  it made no sense to me what i was witnessing.  i saw no more of them coming after 15 minutes or so, so i proceeded to go inside.  i watched the last part of conan o'brien, and on my way to go to bed, i peered outside one more time.  strangely enough, i saw one more craft, identical to the first four.  it followed the exact same path also, and it was going quite a bit faster than the first four, almost as if it was trying to catch up to the others.\r\nthis was my first time seeing any kind of unidentifiable object in my life, and to see 5 of them in one night really overwhelmed me.  i couldn't sleep at all, the curiosity of what those crafts were was too much for me to control.  whatever i saw, it was not conventional whatsoever.  the sight of them has been burned in my mind conitinuously since the sighting.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
