high level missions in that part of the state most of the year and we became quite used to seeing aircraft doing bombing runs and refueling tracks.  after i joined the af i found that our barn had been used as a visual sighting aid during those runs.  during the month of october my church decided to have a hay ride on our farm and i was the elected driver of the small case tractor that would pull the hay rack.  the ride lasted from just before dark to well after dark.  in the pasture during the return to the yard my brother who was also riding on the tractor with me tapped me on the shoulder (it was too noisy from the exhaust of the tractor to talk) and pointed to the sky.  when i looked up i saw a flight of several triangular shaped objects each with 3 round white lights on the bottom with one light at each apex of the triangle. i believe there were 6 black triangles flying in formation of one in front then two behind then three behind that.  on seeing them i turned off the tractor and started talking with my brother.  we were wondering what they were.  i asked the people riding on the hay rack about them but none of them could see the objects.  it was a very bright moonlit night with very light cloud cover.  so light and the clouds so thin you could see the stars and moon thru the clouds and they left a shadow on the clouds.  the triangles were above the clouds but it appeared they were very close to us.  they made no sound and were moving in a direction of wnw to ese relative to us at about a speed of 10 to 15 knots.  my brother and i watched for a few minutes then as they were moving away i started the tractor. we never spoke of it again until almost 30 years later.  my initial feelings were wonder at what they were that quickly turned to boredom.  i got tired of watching them and then went about my business.  my brother remembers this happening but is very reluctant to talk about it.  the odd thing is i will watch a known airplane for several minutes and i had better things to do that night and then never mentioned it to the person that was with me for that long.  thinking back on it now i don't remember anything after starting the tractor to drive away.  that is the last of my memory of the evening.  i remember events leading up to that very well.","distance":"101-500

did post-grad work at the university of chicago in social service administration where i earned an m.A. in 1972. today, i'm  a board certified clinical social worker, where both my wife and i run a specialized therapy program in los angeles for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.  our clinic  provides applied behavior analysis therapy to autistic children.   i'm only telling you about this, so that you will be aware that i am not some \"nut job\" writing to you about ufo's. \r\n\r\nnow, the reason for this email:  on september 14, 2008, my wife and i were sitting in our living room and had turned the tv on to watch 'monster quest' on the history channel.  the show was titled, \"china's wildman,\" and was reportedly supposed to have been a video of someone living in the remote area of china.  the show however, was not on that subject.  rather, we found ourselves watching a documentary of a sort on the 9/11 attack on the world trade center.  we later found out that the show was called \"101 days that changed america.\"  the video was excellent and reportedly was filmed by amateurs who had their video cameras at the time and were able to film the attack on the world trade center.  it contained some of the most amazing footage i have ever seen of this tragic event.  \r\n\r\nwhile watching the video, i noticed that besides the filming of the attack on the world trade center, there were also a significant number of ufo's  spotted  simultaneously as when the attack occurred.  i mentioned this to my wife, who is  basically \"indifferent\" to ufo's and psi phenomena.  my wife susan, who is from england, has little or no interest in these topics. i only mention this to point out that, when i told susan that there were ufo's in the video, she thought i was nuts.  however, when playing the video back and freeze framing parts of the video, susan, with all of her indifference and skepticism, admitted, \"yes, there are ufo's on this video.\"  we both became quite excited about it.  i then got out my sony cyber shot, 7.2 mega pixel camera and filmed some video clips right off of the tv.  you can hear both of us screaming throughout the film clips  i am a rank amateur in filming anything, so i was really glad that the video actually came out ok.   i sent clips of the video to youtube.  actually, i uploaded three video's to youtube.  i had a lot of response on one video (several thousand hits) and much less response on the other two.  interestingly, most of the responses i got were people who thought that they were looking at either birds or fighter planes or.....That \"i was nuts.\"  i was surprised, not so much with their observations, but with the lack of response of anyone who also \"saw the ufo's.\"  i could not understand it, other than to think that one of the reasons for this might have to do with people's \"belief\" systems i.E. they refuse to acknowledge something as 'strange' as a ufo because it goes against their own belief system i.E.'they cannot exist, therefore they don't exist, therefore, what i am seeing must be something conventional such as birds or jets etc.\"  after getting only a few responses from viewers regarding seeing the ufo's,  i decided to 'freeze frame\" some of the shots of the ufo's and then send them to coast-to-coast and put them on \"flickr\" with a link to the youtube videos and vice versa.  i then began to get some responses from others who did see the ufo's.  \r\n\r\ni have attached a zip folder that contains many of the freeze frame shots that were uploaded to flickr. i also sent the same photos to coast-to-coast and to jim maars and ryan s. wood and  but have not heard back from anyone as of yet. i also emailed the history channel and asked them if they were aware of the ufo's on that particular video which they aired.  if so, i wondered why no one said anything about it.  i told the history channel that they have a responsibility to the public, to at least mention this and/or, let the public know if anything on the film was \"doctored.\"  the history channel and coast to coast never wrote back.  i still have the original broadcast on my dvr.  as soon as i figure out how to record it on a dvd or a video tape i will then have a copy for posterity!  \r\n\r\ni would like mufon to look at the freeze frame shots i attached to this email.  tell me what your opinion is of these. i thought, that since the ufo's were spotted and filmed during the 9/11 attack, that this was very significant, not just to those of us in the usa, but really, to everyone in the world.  the video was seen by millions, and is available to the public. considering that the 9/11 attack on the united states was one of the most significant horrible events of all time, and considering that ufo's in mass, were reportedly present \"at the site of the 9/11 attack, i would think that this event (i.E. 9/11 + the ufo's) would be seen as something very significant for all of humankind. \r\n\r\n as i said, i have the original video on dvr on my tv set.  if the ufo's were in fact present during the 9/11 attack, as i believe they were, than why is there not more discussion of this? with all of the reported cases of ufo' in the literature, including that of mufon, i would expect that this event would be something that deserves a thorough investigation.  what better investigators could there be, than mufon!  with all of the reports of ufo's + worldwide interest in the phenomena + the sighting and filming of ufo's at the exact time of the world trade center attack, i would say that there is no better time than the present for doing a full scale investigation.  if it's a fraud, then the millions of people who saw the video should be aware of that. if, on the contrary, the photo's are real and no hoax was perpetrated, than by all means, this information should be on every tv news show in the nation and the world!    i just cannot understand why the ufo phenomena at the world trade center on 9/11 is not talked about.  i can't even get a response from the history channel regarding the video they showed nationally.  could this be another conspiracy in the making?  i'm just asking.  for something this significant to the entire world, i would think that there would be tremendous  interest in it.  one ufo on the film is so clear that you can make out the demarcations on the craft and, can actually see the color i.E. bronze.  that particular shot was taken of the ufo right in front of the world trade center after the initial attack.  these craft were moving so rapidly, that i really doubt that anyone would have the sophistication and the equipment to \"fake it.\"  why would they do that in the first place. there is absolutely no mention of this event in the media i.E. the ufo's that were present.  \r\n\r\nif you think that this event is as important  as i do, perhaps mufon can  bring it to the attention of the public. i look forward to your reply.\r\nthank you for taking the time to check this out!  i hope it's useful.

there was no bright star (or planet) in that location, i first thought it was the iss but it wasn't moving.  it was about the same brightness as the visible planet (perhaps venus).  it was red to orange ...I best describe the look as if the colors were liquid.\r\n\r\nthen, it blinked off ...Then back on in the same location.  about 5 (or so) seconds later, it reappeared in the s at about 15 degrees off the horizon.  blinked off then back on then disappeared.\r\n\r\nwhen the light first blinked on, coyotes started barking loudly (i know that sounds strange) ...When it went off, they quit.  \r\n\r\ni stood there probably another 3 or 4 minutes scanning the western sky and saw a faint con trail in the remaining sunlight at a very high altitude probably 45 degrees off the wsw horizon and that puppy was moving!  made a \"comma\" shape then disappeared ...The con trail disappeared quicker than one from a plane.  a minute or two later, another con trail made the same \"comma\" shape only going downward.  it disappeared quickly as well.\r\n\r\nthen, i saw three bright lights (lined up) and appeared to be from one \"craft\" blink on then off ...Repeated two times.  a couple seconds later, another three (like the first three only more orange) blinked on then off more towards the south.  if it was from the same vehicle, that thing was going fast to get from point \"a\" to point \"b\" in that length of time.\r\n\r\nwhen the lights started flashing, there were no jets (other than the odd one or two headed to dfw) but maybe 10 to 15 minutes later, there seemed to be multiple

connector\" run to everett, when something caused me to look up.  there, in the pre-dawn blackness, directly above me, i saw a large, dark object passing over, in a general south to north direction.  this object, while appearing to be at a relatively low alititude (hard to judge accurately in the dark), was completely silent; i heard no sound whatsoever at any time during this sighting.  this object was large, and had a generally circular shape, but with protrusions on the leading edge.  it appeared to be black, or, more like it was colorless and was somehow \"reflecting\" the color or the night.  on its underside there were two equally-sized circular openings which glowed in a phosphorescent green.  this was a glow and did not appear to be any sort of lighting, as we normally see it. my guess is that it was suggestive of some sort of energy source, or some other, unknown application.    these openings were large, each taking up about half of its side of the underside of the object.  other than that i could see little detail.  i did get a good enough look at its starboard side to see that it was definitely three-dimensional.  whatever it was, i would estimate that it was flying at about 200-300 miles per hour, at an altitude of less than 2000 feet.  i watched it for a good 4-5 seconds and then it disappeared into the night.  now, i have done 20 years in the military, and have observed numerous types of aircraft in a wide variety of applications, including day and night close air support under combat conditions.  i have been around military aircraft (and in them) long enough to have a pretty good idea what they look like, move like and sound like.  this fella is clear outside the scope of my experience.  i left me feeling kind of dumbfounded.  i didn't feel

the object was 3 spheres connected together, in an l shape. they appeared to be roughly 10-15 feet in diameter, accept for the end sphere. that one looked a tad smaller, about 8-10 feet in diameter. it could be the way the configuration was that made the last one appear smaller, but it appeared that way. it was moving very slow. it had no typical flashing lights like a helicopter or small plane. there were however lights on the object. very dull lights on the spheres, bright enough to give me a view of the shape. i almost ran off of the interstate looking at this, i didn't want to take my eyes off of it. as it passed me i saw it in my mirrors, and it had a slow pulsating red light, almost a glowing effect. i was able to keep it in view of my mirrors for a few minutes. i regret not getting out and really looking at this. i was , i guess, stunned, trying to explain it away, in denial? i then turned around and started to see if i could catch up to it, and could not find it again. shortly thereafter it started to rain and there were a few flashes of lightning in the southern sky. i then proceeded home.

visible than usual.\r\n\r\ni noticed a large round and very white ball crossing from east to west moving much faster than an airplane would.  it appeared to be a fireball. when i first saw it, i was

was a large meteor and it was going to crash into a populated area.\r\n\r\nit moved in a straight line, it did not appear to lose altitude, the light seemed as if i was looking at more of a light bulb

confused, then concerned, then just amazed.  the amazement came when the object simply disappeared with no change in altitude, no fading, no trailing pieces.  i watched for a few more minutes but nothing else happened.  it disappeared at what i would describe a 2 o'clock position, and i remember thinking that i did not want to lose sight of it behind a tree.  the leaves are off the tree.  the

see how clear or cloudy it is. i see planets ( whith lights that don't shimmer ) all the time and lately the last few months two in sky at different points. so,one night i look up towards the top of the hill i live on and seen three bright red lights in same area in sort of triangular formation and thougth they were planets. not the first time. then i thought to myself , how can three planets be in same location,what are the odds of that? i don,t know why ,as a paranormal/ufo inthusiast , i did not think this was a ufo sighting , as i got an ominous feeling  ( not first time for that either ) right away. it did not appear to have any movement and was too distant to tell if there were stars in between lights.Thius was appx. 10 p.M. on oct. 20 , 2008. i have seen a few strange things in my time , and have feelings of being watched ,since i was a kid , but almost always in the town i live in , but no real evidence of visitation , although , i would not rule that out.  i can hardly believe that i did not record this event in some manner, as i just wanted to ignore my spooky  feelings and not be scared. i admit that i often get spooked at night while watching ufo activities on t.V. or on internet.I also don,t believe that it took me a week to realize this as i watched a ufo story ( the triangular lights of 2004 story ) on the history channel wed. the 29th of october , 2008.I do remember that i seen this at another time , can,t give exact date , but think it was in september,2008,only in the exactpolar opposit in the sky,over hill,towards greensburg. i would judge by the size and distance that this was a locally situated phenominom, as usally i can only see a smaller area of sky,through the mountain clouds in a circular area.But,it was an unusually clear night. is it possible for there to be three planets in same area? the lights were diffintly  red in color and planet-like in size and brightness.I have always believed in ufos being real,weather or not extra-terestrial or not ,but this night i just didn't want to believe because of the ominous feeling i got when i realized that how can three planets be in that close of formation and i ran inside and locked my doors and windows.Also from time-to-time , i get a sharp pain in my left elbow and can feel something under surface of skin , although i was told that there was nothing there by doctors and have lost time and awakened in slightly diferent areas of wherever i was at the time.But not days just a few minutes or hours. also, i live about 10 miles or so from site of kecksburg crash and have had others tell me they seen things that they couldn't explain. why is there not people camped out in whitle strieblers back yard to see if he is really being visited/abducted,? was he proven a fake? i'd like an update on that please. also,what's up with bob lazar? wheres he been?And what's new in the corsco

lights in the sky. i had never seen anything like it. i was on the cell phone with my brother who was approx. 20 miles north west of ranger and when i started hollering at him about the lights...He ask what direction and i told him toward the dam at lake leon...Then he could see them. he had never seen anything like it either. the lights were big...Maybe softball sized in my windshield at their most intense. they came and went...And it was almost like they started small and then ballooned to wards me...Getting bigger and more intense. the color was kinda amber or at time a white with a reddish aura and smaller colored lights blending in or kinda around the bigger light. i know i am not describing this well...But i just have never seen anything like it. my brother said it was almost like the marfa lights..But not quite....That this was bigger and more intense. i was glad he seen it...Because my husband thought i was nuts when i got home. i live on the other side of the lake.\r\n\r\nabout thirty minutes after i got home...We had three low flying planes circle around the lake and then fly over our home. this was kinda odd as they were circling and very very low....But they were definitely planes. my parents who live over close to chaney high way said when they first seen the planes there were four and they separated. three went to the lake and one went back from the direction it come...Desdamona area.\r\n\r\ni went inside and posted that i had seen weird lights on the eastland spin. time was round 8:30. about 8:45, my brother called me and he had gotten home (he lives out close to the lake too). he told me to go out side and see if i could hear anything weird. once outside...First thing i noticed was all the dogs in the neighborhood were barking and the cows in the pasture behind my home were all bawling. my lab was worked up...Jumping off the porch and running around the yard and then back to me. his hair on his back was standing up...And he was shaking all over. this lasted about 10 minutes and then he calmed down and all the barking of the neighborhood dogs subsided. my brother said his dogs were howling and one kept chewing on her leg. \r\n\r\ni don't know if the animals acting odd was related at all...Just thought that was interesting. overall...Last night was one of the weirdest nights i have ever experienced.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional
