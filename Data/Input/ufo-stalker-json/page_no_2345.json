i don't think so but maybe?  the difference between the two nights and the object in question was definitely two different things to me.\r\n\r\nover the last few months, during the days, i have been seeing things in the sky that i can't classify as airplanes.  i can't say exactly what i have been witnessing, but the events are striking me as something other than typical aircraft and typical aircraft behavior.  if you want specifics on these efvents, i can get more specific.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time,\r\n\r\nwife: 42\r\nson: 9\r\n\r\nbrent dougherty","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":13393,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.5539143,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10302008-0016","longitude":-117.2139232,"occurred":1225371600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1225371600000,"summary":"Viewed from bedroom window by wife and son","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Murrieta, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:311677"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"De Leon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving from mineral wells to comanche texas on hwy 16 south. i was approx. 3.5 miles north of deleon texas when a huge pbject appeared in the dark night sky. it was hard to tell the size and exact shape because it did not las long, it was probably 2-3 football field lenghts in size and had 3-5 bright oragne lights that were appox.  the size of a bus that rotated from left to right and was followed up by a bluish or greenish light then disappeared. i pulled over when i saw this and told the person that i was on the phone with that i had to go becasue i saw something weird and wanted o concentrate on what this was. i watched it for a long time after it disappeared and all that i could see was two bluish or greenish light that were about 1-2 football field lengths apart that moved across the horizon at very fast speeds up and down unlike any movement seen in the sky before. i decided to start driving again because it never reappeared and i felt stupid sitting there thinking about what i saw. not sure what it was and can not believe that i am even reporting such a thing but, figured what the heck, this might be something that could help out.

this is what i can tell you:\r\n\r\nat about 7:50 pm, my friend and i went outside to smoke a cigarette. we were looking at an unusually bright star, concluding that it was probably a planet. we were discussing what planet it might be when i looked above it and saw a flashing light. i thought it must have been an airplane, but when i looked a bit higher, i saw two more. what was very strange is that none of the blinking lights were moving. they were very far away, so i couldn���t tell for sure if they were just moving very slowly. then, the highest one started to rise upwards, and we realize that it was coming towards us. we watched, and the weirdest part is that it was completely silent. there is a small-craft airport in town, and we are used to hearing planes. this object made no noise at all.\r\n\r\nit kept moving towards us until it was finally above us and then past us. we looked up and noticed that it was shaped like a triangle with a light blinking on each end, one light red. i thought they might be government planes since palin was in bowling green today. but they were so close together that it just seemed off. the one traveling above us kept going, silently. we looked back to the other two- one was gone, the other (the lowest one, the first i saw) was still in the same spot. \r\n\r\nwe kept watching the moving one and then the third reappeared (or a fourth appeared, i can���t be sure) coming from a completely new direction. they were less than an inch away (from where i stood, it looked this way), slowed down a bit, and then kept traveling on. \r\n\r\nwe watched for 4-5 minutes.\r\n\r\ni went inside to turn on the news and fire up my computer, but of course nothing was mentioned. i have never looked up anything online about ufos before, and this was the first site i came across. \r\n\r\ni went back outside about 3 minutes after i stopped watching- the first object that i saw was gone, the one that moved over us was very far into the distance, and the third was also gone.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

(kxan) - two austinites believe they saw a ufo flying over austin in october. they said they have the videotape to prove it. carl lancaster and doug mccullough were both outside their apartments in central austin on middle fiskville road oct. 8 around 9 p.M. when they both saw three bright lights. lancaster said he saw a red light and two white lights that flew in a zigzag pattern across the sky. \r\n\"it was just incredible and just unexplainable,\" said lancaster. \"the lights flew on top of each other and then side by side.\" \r\nmccullough captured the mysterious lights on his home video camera. \r\n\"we've got proof,\" said mccullough. \"it's great to finally capture something on video.\" \r\nlancaster started waving at the lights, and he said they responded to him by flying on top of each other and then side by side. \r\n\"it was a ufo,\" said lancaster. \"e.T. probably!\" \r\ntorvald hessel, austin planetarium's executive director, closely examined lancaster and mccullough's video. he pointed out the lights made a zigzag pattern across the power poles. \r\n\"shooting star, meteorite,\" said hessel. \"it's possible, but i wouldn't be able to explain the zigzag movement.\" \r\nhessel watched the video twice and even watched it frame by frame to examine what looked like two lights on top of each other. he said the lights could have been from an airplane or helicopter, although he said that was unlikely. \r\n\"it's obviously two lights, which is interesting,\" said hessel. \"no idea what it is, probably not aliens over austin.\" \r\njust recently in stephenville, texas, high school student andy monrreal was hanging out with friends when he also recorded what looked like a ufo. \r\n\"you could see the oval shape,\" said monrreal. \"got my friend, i said 'dude, you got to come look at this.'\" \r\nmeanwhile, austin bergstrom international airport officials said they had no reports of any mysterious objects flying over the city the night lancaster and mccullough saw their ufos, but lancaster and mccullough said they have all the proof they need. \r\n\"when i see one, i'll believe it,\" said lancaster. \"i saw not one, not two, but possibly three that night.\"\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13389,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":31.9720288,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10302008-0012","longitude":-99.8999131,"occurred":1223449200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1223449200000,"summary":"Ufo

as i was checking out the skies my hose faces the south the objeck cought my eyes in the southwest i thought it was a star till it started getting brighter then i assumed airplane but all other planes in the area had stobes flashing even the ones that were far i could see the strobes when the object got even closer i ran inside called my wife and kids to come see this that way they could wittness the objecton the way back out i grabed my bonoculars wich are 10*50 power we all looked at it through them yet i could'nt compare it to any other air borne object that i've ever seen it seemed like it was higher than the planes comeing in for a landing yet lower than the one's approching the metroplex the object when over head didnot make a sound yet was traveling at what seem like the speed of a fighter jet at about 10 thousand feet plus or minus acouple hundred feet the object was so bright i still had a hard time makeing out what it looked like it was sphere to disk type with what seem like a space between top and bottom it traveld in a direct line twards the north east tere was no breeze that evening after it went over head i went inside to call a friend that lives to the north of the airport to sere if he could see any thing but he was a littl;e to late to see it because as it moved over head i realized it was trveling a lot faster than what i figured because it seem like it only took it a couple of minutes to disapear to the north east a couple of days later i mentioned it to my mom and she told me that she seen on a hispanic channel were thay mentioned that several people in

saw an unidentifiable light phenomenon in the sky. we were at the grape st. dog park in south park, san diego letting our dog run around. we were relaxing in the northwestern most area in the park sitting in the grass and noticed that there were several large hawks flying around eying the dogs in the park. we have a small dog and there were several other small dogs in the vicinity so i was watching the hawks fly around when i noticed what looked like a star in the sky north of where we were. i thought at first it may have been a plane or a helicopter coming in, but the object was stationary and appeared to be changing its orientation as it sat there. i have no better way to describe it than to say that it looked like it was \"flopping around\" or \"crawling\" in place and the sun reflecting off of it was illuminating different aspects of it (keep in mind it was very small and far away). the grape street dog park is almost directly east of downtown and the airport (which is on the bay on the west side of downtown) and airplanes do circle around and then approach the airport from the east, so we thought that maybe it was just an airplane or helicopter approaching us which would explain why it appeared to be stationary, but within a few minutes, a plane came in and it became apparent that this object was very very far away in comparison to the size of the planes coming in and the object was much higher and further away and in a different location than anything else we saw (and stationary). we noticed after a few moments that there were now two light objects. the original object was the larger of these two and the smaller one appeared to split off from the larger one and do a circle around it before stopping at about the 4 o'clock position in relation to the large object. both objects then moved very slowly across the sky until they were obscured from our line of sight by a tree and seemed to be a little smaller once they were visible as if they were moving away from us. once they emerged from behind the tree and were visible again, the smaller object had moved to about the 8 o'clock position in relation to the larger one and then disappeared completely after a few moments. just for clarification, this thing was really small and looked like a star and the movement that was discernible at first was not now apparent and we were left watching a point of light that was very difficult to refocus on if you looked away. the movement had ceased at this point for a few minutes and the object was stationary. after a few moments, the light was indiscernible and i thought it had vanished. i moved closer to the center of the park which was east from our original location and was once again able to locate the object. i watched and filmed this object for quite a few minutes but it was not visible in my camera's viewfinder (digital still camera with video capability) so i was just pointing and praying something showed up, as the object was visible to the naked eye. i did get footage of the object after i moved locations, but it doesn't look like anything except a really bright small star in the middle of the day. this object moved too slowly to be a plane crossing the sky (at any distance)or shooting star, and much too quickly to be a star or planet. it moved and then stopped and stood still for a few moments twice in the period of time that we watched it which is not something that you would expect from a star or planet or shooting star. we had to leave the dog park soon after the object moved the second time but it was still just sitting in the same location not moving. i didn't really want to leave but i sincerely thought that it was not going to be visible on film as i couldn't see it through the viewfinder so i didn't really mind. i live about two miles north of the dog park in north park with no large trees around to obstruct your view and as soon as we got home around 4:45pm-5:00pm i scoured the sky for this object but it was no longer visible anywhere in the sky. i am attaching some of the footage that i shot of this object, but once again, there is nothing visible in most of it. i know someone else had to have seen these things in the middle of the day and i thought it prudent to report this in case i could corroborate someone else's claim. out of the six separate clips that i have, this thing is visible in only two that i am attaching. i am attaching the last video solely for the audio as it was taken almost as soon as we spotted the object and you can hear my girlfriend describe what she was seeing as well. the objects are not visible but you can hear us talking about what we were seeing as we are seeing it. i must apologize for the language on the last video and if you are easily offended just skip the last one- sorry! i must add that my girlfriend just graduated from ucsd with two degrees and that i am about to start attending ucsd next year- we are both college educated and have both seen our share of planes, helicopters, stars, shooting stars and planets.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

very bright. brighter than stars. the lights were vertical with space between them, and it seemed like the outside lights were spreading further apart. since i was driving and couldnt stop on the bridge, they soon were out of sight for me. and at the time i thought it looked weird but thought that it could just be flares. so after i crossed the bridge they were out of sight for me. i realized that my pizza delivery destination was near the water, where i would be able to see it, if it was still there. when i was able to see it again, there was only one light. i got out of my car and moved to where i could see it best. from where i was standing it looked to be over the port orchard area, but it was difficult for me to tell distances. i stood and watched it for about 3 minutes. it was very bright. and was basically still, not moving, except for small movements in a kind of wobbley way. after about 3 minutes, the light slowly dimmed. then all of a sudden it started to move. it moved to my left, which would be to the east. as it moved it got dimmer and dimmer, and then started to blink like a plane. then it just looked like a plane at night moving to the east until it was out of my sight. as soon as it started to move i said \"what?\" out loud. after this whole thing happened, i delivered the pizza and had to hold back from telling the people i was delivering to. then i

sonic booms because they rattled the windows and were \"felt\". the lights i saw were not lights on an aircraft.  they were too bright and too large.  they did not appear to be search lights of any kind i have ever seen. the lights were the wrong color to be high intensity type observation lights which are bright white. i believe that the towns of gorman or de leon are (as the crow flies)in the direction that i saw the lights. the lay of the land to the east is too flat for these lights to be on to the ground. i was not upset by this. mostly puzzled. i have been interested in the night sky and astronomy my whole life and i have never seen anything like this. this is a rural location and the closest neighbor is approx 1/2 mile to the south. my wife phoned me @ 5pm the next day saying she overheard someone talking in a cafe in comanche tx saying they had seen strange lights the same night.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13371,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.2706904,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10292008-0032","longitude":-98.8286719,"occurred":1225248300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1225248300000,"summary":"A

the light, asked my wife to grab the video camera from the back seat.My wife couldnt find it so i proceeded to turn on my emergency flashers and get it myself.Once we got the camera out and on the object it started to move towards us freaking my wife and myself out because we had kids in the car and did not know what to expect with all this going on,i had yet to begin recording and as soon as i hit the record button the bright glistening light dimmed out like theater lighting and began to move away while only showing one solid red light and one flashing red light.The object flew across the

in the early 90s i photographed these lights, and although with the naked eye they look like stars they look like large blobs of white light beaming; two ramps of blue green light; saucer shaped with dome and a small white round light.  some of these objects would hover then dart up into outer space at a very high rate of speed.  these type lights are less common.  i felt nothing unusual photographing the objects, as i never did filming them for around 2 years.  in 2003 i bought a camcorder, and filmed the objects at a culdesac nearby where i live.  they always showed at around 8:30 pm up unto 10:00 pm.  they appeared sometimes in groups of three; they hover silently for minutes at a time then slowly move on their way; some look like jupiter; some connect and disconnect from each other; some have an eye inside that surfaces for a short time looking around in a circular motion on the inside surface of the object then disappearing inside; some show a very fast black surface storm going over it that looks like carbon.  i was able to see these characteristics being that i have a digital zoom on my camera.  i was able to get right up to them.  sometimes the objects show at dusk.  i filmed a ufo, at the same place, that flared out from a dot of light 7 times.  and at around the time i stopped filming i turned around after filming, and i saw a big round white light 50 feet from me.  it was only about 20 feet altitude.  i said out loud, \"what the hell is that?\" as i started filming it i felt a strong telepathic presence all around me, except for the middle of my back.  somehow i was able to see into the ufo, and i saw three aliens in it.  one was a doctor, and the other two were workers.  i do not know how i knew that.  they were watching me in a small monitor, and the doctor said, \"what is he doing?\" then the object slowly lifted outward high into the sky then it stopped.  then the doctor said, \"he's not doing anything.\" then the object moved on northward going behind some big trees.  the doctor alien's skin was darker than the workers, and his eyes were a little different than the workers.  the workers had grayish skin, and their eyes were egg shaped.  in the 25 years i lived here in garden grove i had 5 alien close encounters where 3 took place in my apartment.\r\n\r\nengland paranormal investigators thinks my film is amazing and fantastic.  they told me that i captured a lot of unusual and interesting things.  in fact having the largest paranormal website in england they wanted to make a hour cd out of my film.  i have 8 hours of footage, but i did not use a tripod.  however for some reason mufon does not care about my reports or at least does not contact me about any of them.  only in 1994 mufon of o.C. did 2 investigations with me on the lights that were at the time coming a lot.  they were coming in 2 at a time.  in 45 minutes we saw about 90 of them.  at the end of the 2nd investigation mufon covered up telling me that they were airplanes, and disneyland fireworks.  3 years later i spoke on the phone to ron rehger who was also a mufon investigator.  he told me that those lights are in mufon's records as \"unknown\" meaning ufo.  and peter davenport from the nuforc told me that none of the materials i sent him are alien related.  recently i offered him my 8 hours of footage on dvd free.  he did not even say thanks, but advised me to put it on the internet for others to see, and to see what they say.  and in the 80s i sent him my first 2 photos where the objects stopped under a lamplight.  he told me i sent him lamplights returning my photos.  you can clearly see the oval objects under the lamplight.  in fact i sent those 2 photos to the ufomrc in roswell, new mexico.  doctor burleson there analyzed them on a data base computer, and confirmed to me that they are round.  he sent me the data base printout that i still have.  and seti told me i filmed aircraft.  so i do not expect any attention for this or any report i make about the ufo/alien subject.  i am doing this because i am bored, and for personal reasons, so the subject might be better understood.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13367,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.7776953,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10292008-0028","longitude":-117.9330377,"occurred":1106541000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1106541000000,"summary":"Strange

binoculars three separate orange lights that appeared to be jets with landing lights on moving west from dfw.  as the jets switched to regular lights i was about to pull out of an dirt road and stopped to make sure no traffic was coming.  i happened to look south where the jets should of been and right at that moment three (one on left separated by maybe half a fist to two other objects on the right) bright orange lights appeared.  they were in the southern sky, maybe 20-25��� up from the ground.  put the binoculars on them immediately - i had a camera but i knew that i had no good chance since it is an older digital and does not do well in low light.  i watched both objects; on the right there were two dots - the dot on right would 'disappear' and then reappear to the left of the first dot.  it did that 2-3 times.  the other object on the left was a bigger dot, bigger than venus looks now in the sky.  as i watched it, another orange ball appeared to come out of the main object and move away just a little bit, and then another (i think) came 'out' of it as well.  i was freaked because i had finally seen something i had always watched for!  they did not move, just sat there and did what they did.  and then they just blinked out and were gone.  i stayed and watched a little more but that was it.\r\n\r\nthe previous report i had filed with mufon turned out to be a
