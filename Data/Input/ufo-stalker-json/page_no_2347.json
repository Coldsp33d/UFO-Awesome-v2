2-3 in the morning.. i had been on the road alone for hours.. when i saw lights coming up behind me pretty fast..They seemed like normal sized headlights at the time. i was just relieved to not be on the road alone anymore.. i noticed that one of the lights on the vehicle behind me kept flickering brighter than dim..Then really bright..As it got brighter it seemed to grow a little larger but not a huge amount bigger.When i looked in the rear view mirror the two lights became one.... im tryin to figure out what was goin on thru my rear view mirror but then at the same time watch the curvy road in front of me. the the light was considerably larger but then shot up high in the sky.. i tried to see where it went thru my mirrors but was unsuccesful. then i saw a huge blue beam of light come down onto the road behind me and start catchin up to my car..There was no odd sounds that i could hear or remember... i drove as fast as i could while screamin and crying because i was terrified.. im not sure what else happened.. i remember finally finding a town with a light on.. i ran inside and asked a man in a little motel if they ever saw strange lights.. i dont remember his answer..But for some reason it was now 5 in the mornin..I called my friend to find out how long it would take me to get to moscow... he said another hour.. i was scared to get back on the road but even more terrified to stay where i was.. when i got to my friends house and told them what happened they seemed unphased. they told me that \"they\" wont hurt me that \"they\" were just checkin me out.  2 girls in the

(population of about 500). it was about 7:00 to 7:30 pm. this was about late october or november so because of the daylight saving time change it was already dark made even darker by the fact that this street is very shaded by trees. as a matter a fact it reminded me of so many other times i had walked this same street, it would be so dark that the only way i would know how to gage how close to either side of the road i was is i knew if i left the pavement to my left and felt gravel i knew to go a little to my right and visversa. we could see the street light at the top of the hill and as soon as we got out from under the shade of the trees we would be able to see just fine.\r\n\r\nmy friends name was frank and we were going to my house just to hang out for a while.  i was walking on the left with frank just to my right, when just about a third of the way up the hill there was a bright light the best way i can discribe it is it was just like someone was right above us and flashed one of those old flashbulbs like the cameras back then use to have.We both by instick took one step and dove for the ditch, me to the left and frank to the right.I remember thinking this is going to hurt when i land, because i kwew the ditch was washed out and deep my side of the road, frank on the other hand would have a soft landing because the ditch on his side was not only shallow but was grassy.I do not remember hitting the bottom of thr ditch,next thing i knew we were back walking up to the top of the hill. \r\n\r\nfrank didnt come to my house, i took a left to my house which was just in sight . i  remembered thinking as he walked away, i sure am glad i'm home because i would be scared to have to go on alone. my next thought was i hope they(by they i knew i ment  aliens) dont get him again, because i thought everyone would think i had done something to him. when i walked in the door the first thing i saw was the clock, it was about two hours later than i thought, then i heard my mother in the kitchen and was afraid she was going to ask why i was later than i had siad i would be. lucky for me she didnt, because i some how knew i was not supposed to tell any thing that had happened.\r\n\r\nwhen i went to bed a lay there and i knew i was supposed to forget everything that had happened,but i was still concerned about frank getting home alright.So i made a deal in my own mind, i thought i will forget everything as soon as i see frank at school monday(this happened on saturday). so monday morning i almost forgot but after second period which was about 10:00 am i remembered and asked a friend. have you seen frank?\r\nto which he replied yes there he is right there, do you want him? i said no thats ok.\r\n\r\ni then forgot everything, for about 15 years then for some reason in my late twenties i remembered what had happened , but only the beginning and the end , nothing inbetween.\r\n\r\ni never asked frank about this because shortly after this happened he moved \r\n away. i have often wondered if he remembers

we parked in an open area. it was quiet and dark out that night because there wasn't many homes or businesses there to illuminate the area. \r\nwe first noticed the ufo when we saw an extremely bright light in the sky. it seemed as high as the other stars. we thought it was a star and spoke about how bright that star was. we listened to about 6 songs on the radio and talked when i noticed that the star was moving. i told the young lady i was with that it was moving and she told me i was seeing things and waved her hand in front of me. she then sat up and saw the same thing i was seeing.

my 78 impala and i jumped out of the car to see this thing. the object was massive, dark in color and triangular shaped. it moved quietly with no sound approximatley 4-5 mph over the top of the car.

stephensville which is only a few counties over. once we realized that we were seeing the same things here in freestone county from a distance, we decided to report the sightings. we still cannot believe or grasp what we have been witnessing. we are on a ranch in a rural area and observe many things in the night sky (jet patterns, satellites, meteor showers etc.) but have never seen things like these.\r\n\r\nhere is the information we sent to whitney ashley at the empire tribune in stephensville, this is about the second sighting oct. 28th. i had already been in contact with her about our other sighting october 21st. we also observed strange things in january 2008 but did not report those to anybody. here is a copy of what we sent to whitney:\r\n\r\nour back porch is right off our kitchen, we have four dogs on the ranch and i went outside to give two of them a treat at exactly 8:20 pm. i have gotten into the habit of scanning the sky because of what happened last week. as soon as i looked to the south west (in the direction of temple), an object was very evident suspended just above the horizon. i watched it briefly, it was large (i was seeing it from far off), it had a definite red glow and had a faint strobe effect with a whitish blue light emitting around it. at this point, i called out to andy (my significant other) and he came out and started watching it too. he said to go inside and see exactly what time it was. we watched this thing hover just above the horizon from 8:20 to 8:33 pm, so we were able to observe it for a long time. we actually wanted to get into the car and get closer but we knew it was so far away that we would probably lose it. instead andy went inside and got his rifle with a high powered scope on it to use as binoculars. we both looked at it through the scope. we could clearly see an oval or round object that had a red glow, it pulsated. what ever this was, it was big because we were seeing it from a great distance from where it actually was. occasionally it would throw a whitish blue light. we could see other air traffic way high above it (planes fly along i-45 as a normal route). this looked nothing like what else was in the sky. we really could not believe our eyes. it finally just looked like it disappeared over the horizon (or lowered itself to a point we could not see) at exactly 8:33 pm. we wrote it all down when we returned inside with the intension of contacting you, we wanted to know if others saw it too!\r\nthis was totally different than what we saw last week. i am curious to know if others in our area are seeing this but so far i have not heard anything. i am the curator for the museum of freestone county and have been researching some information that was sent to me about sightings in the late

years old and had bs'd my way into a job in which i had no skills. one skill i needed was typing so i had immediately enrolled in a night typing course which was in fort worth, texas. i was traveling home on i-20 east. there was not much traffic that time of night. as a matter of fact i do not remember any traffic being present at all which now seems rather strange to me. all of a sudden there was a huge light that was the brightest light i have ever seen, before or since, in my life. while being a bright light it also seemed very white. i slowed down to see what it was but could only see the light. i then realized what the light was showing me. there was a mattress in the lane ahead of me that i would have never seen which would have caused me to have an accident. i pulled to the side of the road forgetting about the mattress and rolled down my window. my first thought was that it was a helicopter but there was absolutely no sound. when i say no sound i mean no sound as in any normal sounds of night or traffic much less a helicopter sound. i wasn't scared. as a matter of a fact i felt a feeling of peace like i have never felt. all of a sudden the light was gone. i went straight home and called carswell air force base in fort worth, texas to report what had just happened. the man they had me talk with said there was absolutely nothing in the area but yet he then questioned me about the whole incident. i never knew who else to report this to until i saw the show \"ufos over earth\" and got the name of your organization. a few months back i came in on some tv show that someone had reported basically the same event in the same time frame and area. unfortunately i didn't know who to contact about that show. what i experienced back then was the most awesome and

goose bumps... i had to stop the car..  i got out and looked up in the sky where it was, and nothing was there.. i looked all around in the sky.. nothing. i just remember having this feeling at the time of wonderment,amazment,astonished, maybe even a slight fear. i remember feeling like, wow, was i at the right place, at the right time.. from the first spotting the lights to when it vanished in a flash of light all occured within approx 15 seconds.. this was a very short,but very memorable experience..  needless to say, since then i have always kept my eye on the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13349,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.5119761,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10292008-0010","longitude":-87.9656098,"occurred":974318400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,  Star-like,  Other,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":974318400000,"summary":"Driving in my car i witnessed a sparkling object far off in the southern sky, seconds later a bright flash and it was gone.","tags":["flash"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"New Lenox, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:311751"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Forest Hill","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"In 1977/1978 i was living in forest hill, texas. i only remember the approx. year. i was only about 21 years old and had bs'd my way into a job in which i had no skills. one skill i needed was typing so i had immediately enrolled in a night typing course which was in fort worth, texas. i was traveling home on i-20 east. there was not much traffic that time of night. as a matter of fact i do not remember any traffic being present at all which now seems rather strange to me. all of a sudden there was a huge light that was the brightest light i have ever seen, before or since, in my life. while being a bright light it also seemed very white. i slowed down to see what it was but could only see the light. i then realized what the light was showing me. there was a mattress in the lane ahead of me that i would have never seen which would have caused me to have an accident. i pulled to the side of the road forgetting about the mattress and rolled down my window. my first thought was that it was a helicopter but there was absolutely no sound. when i say no sound i mean no sound as in any normal sounds of night or traffic much less a helicopter sound. i wasn't scared. as a matter of a fact i felt a feeling of peace like i have never felt. all of a sudden the light was gone. i went straight home and called carswell air force base in fort worth, texas to report what had just happened. the man they had me talk with said there was absolutely nothing in the area but yet he then questioned me about the whole incident. i never knew who else to report this to until i saw the show \"ufos over earth\" and got the name of your organization. a few months back i came in on some tv show that someone had reported basically the same event in the same time frame and area. unfortunately i didn't know who to contact about that show. what i experienced back then was the most awesome and peaceful event that anyone could experience. i do not know what it was but i do know it was real, very real. whatever or whoever it was saved me from what could have been a horrible accident. it could not have been some thing from this earth.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":13348,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.6784777,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10292008-0009","longitude":-97.2637112,"occurred":249800400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Texas","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":249800400000,"summary":"Brightest light i have ever seen in my life yet it was white with absolutely no sound.

i've always felt a little weird about telling my friends about this since as you can imagine how it sounds to someone who has never seen anything.  \r\n  i remember everything about this event other than the exact date.  it was warm outside and i was a senior in high school.  so it had to of been early fall 92', or late spring 93'.  it was between 12 midnight and 2 a.M.  i was playing basketball outside in one of my friend's parent's driveway.  there was 4 of us playing.  after playing for about an hour we were thirsty, so the other three went inside to get a drink.  i stayed outside because i felt uncomfortable about going inside since my friend's mother had yelled at us earlier about being too loud.  i continued to shoot the basketball in the driveway.  after a few minutes i started to notice this \"humming\" sound.  it seemed to get louder and louder and then seemed to be coming from above me.  i then looked straight up towards the noise, that's when i seen the disc.  it was hovering above me at about 50-75 ft.  it was just above the tops of the big oak trees that were in the yard.  it was made of metal, i would say aluminum.  i would place the diameter of the disc at 20-30 ft.  it had one light in the center of the disc, a blueish/white light.  it wasn't a spot light like you see on t.V., it was just a light like on airplanes.  it looked like the skin of an airplane.  pieces of aluminum sheets.  to me it looked man-made.  i'm not sure how long it had been hovering above me before i looked up, but i do know that after i looked up i said aloud \"holy s***\" and before i got the whole phrase out it took off.  i have never seen anything move that fast before, especially from a dead stop.  it shot off to roughly where the road was at the end of the driveway.  a distance of about 20-30 yards.  it's hovering height remained the same.  it moved that fast in the blink of an eye!  it came to a complete stop too.  i know that inertia would kill someone inside after doing what i seen it do.  i started walking down the driveway towards it, kind of in disbelief.  after i got about half-way down the driveway it started moving slowly over the trees and houses, like it was done with me or something.  i jogged down the road for a while trying to keep it in sight but disappeared after a while towards the north-west.  when i got back to the house, all the guys were outside questioning me where had i been and why i was out of breathe.  i told them what i had seen, but i could tell they didn't believe me. i haven't seen anything like it since.  this all took place by wolf lake, outside of the city of muskegon.  \r\n\r\ni would like to know if any other reports came from the same time in the same area.  this has been something that's kind of haunted me every since it happened.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

was a very clear sky and i thought i would enjoy it for a second.  i spend most of my time inside and wanted to take a look around.  i tried to find the big or little dipper unsuccessfully.  then i thought i saw orion.  which reminded me of an argument i had with a friend over the constellation.  but below orion's belt (or what i think is orion) i saw a small cluster of stars.  it looked pretty, but i couldn't say i saw that ever before.  i thought it must be some constellation i didn't know.  but it was about 5-7 stars in a group.  i decided to watch in for a few moments when i noticed that the stars were moving.  the group of stars moved as a whole across the night sky.  they seemed very far away and difficult to be certain at first, but they moved as a group in different directions.  the stars moved very slowly and without a sound.  i also noticed that not only the cluster moved, but also that 3 or 5 of the stars would change position.  the 'object' appeared to be in the shape of a cross or letter 't'.  only two stars that never moved made up the tail or the 'i' shaped part of the cluser.  the other 3 to 5 stars would disappear and reappear in a similar orientation.  there was no blinking and all the lights appeared the same size.  i watched this for about 30-45 minutes, taking several breaks inside to warm up and get my camera.  i thought about waking up my wife, but she would think i was being and idiot.  so i took as many pictures and video as possible, however my camera did not capture much at all.  on film, i feel they would have looked like stars.  i did watch for long enough to notice that i made its way across the sky partially.  it went from the east headed west, but never crossed over my head.  it would occassionally fully stop and change directions.  i grew up in the country and watch the star for many nights.  i know what an airplane looks like.  this was far different from anything i have ever seen.  i called a hotline who told me this was a star.  but i am quite sure that stars don't move and don't move in a group. my feelings while watching this were excited, cold, interested, in awe, anxious and wanted to wake the neighborhood and my wife.  i took several photographs and video and made several trip inside because i had watched for so long.  i did not lose sight of the object, it is likely out my window right now!  but it is cold, i can't seem to document it and no one else seems to care.  i don't feel comfortable calling local news and be made to look foolish in my town.  i am a fairly well respected individual. i do not know what this was and i am not saying it was alien.  it was an unidentified flying object to me.  thanks for your time.  i hope this reaches someone in time so that other may view what i viewed.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then

a fighter jet kicking in over head. that got my attention. a cold front had pushed through the previous day so the humidity was around 26% and no clouds. i threw on my jacket and went outside to see what was up because they are not supposed to be kicking in after burners at that time of night over the city.  my backyard faces north. as i was looking north, motion to my right caught my attention. at this point the sound of the jet was gone.  i noticed three objects spinning and dancing around each other but traveling fast in one direction going from north to south. they quit dancing around each other and one disk dipped below the others. it then changed to a color as i would discribe that like a florescent light. the red was vivid and bright. the actual sighting took no longer than 5 seconds at the most.  but the thing that stood out in my mind was the absolute quiet.  we do have an air force base in our town. so, if what i saw is ours.....Yay for us.\r\n\r\ni later thought it may have been geese or other large migratory birds caught in one hell of a tail wind but the accrobatics of these disks were just too rapid.\r\n\r\nafter the sightings i went back to bed knowing what i had just seen was out of the ordinary. this makes my fourth sighting in my life. my first was when i was 6. my second was when i was 12. my third was when i was 22, in the air force and was in

happened.  there was no sound during the entire event.  after we saw the last lights disappear, we saw a plane flying through the same air space where the lights had previously been, and we could

our home.  we were travelling at about 45 mph at the time of the sighting.  most of the road is lined with trees except for an occasional home, business or other clearing.   we were driving past a parking lot that is accross the street from a local ski area. my husband happened to be looking in the direction of the parking lot and quite suddenly two sets of very bright lights appeared in the sky just over the tree line at the back of the lot.  he screamed \"what the heck is that!\", i had been talking to my children in the back seat and turned my head to see. the lights were in the sky, fixed, with no movement.  we later believed they must have been \"attached\" to the same object since they seemed so fixed.  they were very low, less than one tree length on top of the tree line about 100 yards away from our vehicle.  they looked like two \"sets\"  with four lights each, similar to those in an outdoor sports stadium.  they were actually larger than the lights at the local high school stadium.  their appearance was so sudden and bright we were slow to react and continued to drive for 15-20 seconds before we pulled over.  during this time, our view was again blocked by the tree line.  when we pulled over there was nothing there...No lights, no sound.  we went home and stood outside, convinced we had just seen a ufo.  our children continued to ask us what was wrong, why did we pull over and why were we using so many bad words!  we could not explain how these huge light would suddenly turn on in the sky from no where.\r\n\r\nthe next day my husband went back to find a reasonable explanation (construction lights or new parking lot lights??) there was nothing.  there are condominiums behind the parking lot and my husband randomly drove around and asked people who were outside if they had seen any strange lights the night before around 8:00.  one couple looked at him very strangely and said that they had seen strange lights (stadium style) at 9:30 the previous night but not in this same spot.  they happened to be driving 15 miles away on another road (route 112). they thought they were passing a newly constucted building but realized there are no buildings on route 112 (it is national forest).  they also said they saw the lights appear twice, turn on and off in the sky and appear again a few miles down the road.\r\n\r\nover the next two weeks we told many people and heard from 3 others that they had seen some strange lights in the sky that evening but all had seen it from a distance (a mile or more).  one person we told said he heard strange \"hovering\" sounds behind his house over the trees around the same time.  he said it sounded like a plane hovering and passing back and forth over the trees.  he looked outside and saw nothing.\r\n\r\nwe are hoping to find others who have seen something similar or, even better,would be a reasonable explanation for this sighting.  we certainly can't think of one!","distance":"101-500

or a moon or clouds it was very clear there was only 3 lights on the sky in the form of a triangle i stood there for about one minute looking at it and then i ran back inside my apartment to tell my wife about it so that she could come out and look at it so that when i told her she wouldnt think i was crazy. and i also got my binoculars so i could see it better and when i went to look at it and focus it right it was gone, when i came outside i saw it again and when i tried to focuss on it with my binoculars it moved at a very high rate of speed it moved to another position in the sky but it was stremely fast then i took my binoculars of my face and sure there it was at a different spot then were i had seen it to begin with then when i tried to focuss on it again at where it had moved to it moved again back to place where i had first seen it then i saw it for about 30 seconds and i ran back in the house to tell my wife that she had to see that cause it was something that u dont see everyday and she was still to scared and denied to come outside with me so i got mad at her cause i really wanted her to see it so i ran back outside and it was still there but there was no more movement by that time my heart was pounding so hard cause i had no clue what it was and i said to my self there is nothing in this world that can move that fast and just be standing there and i was really scared i was shacking my eyes could not believe what i was seeing and just like that in the blink of an eye it was gone i didnt see it leaving or nothing i dont know if the lights just went off or it flew away i have no clue just that fast it was gone. but what really inpressed me was the speed it moved with it was something really out of this world and i could not sleep for a whole week or
