street light situated on the block across from me facing west. i always catch the light out of my eye because it's a light an it's dark. now through the tree line i noticed a white light, very bright and just thought it was a plane, i have alot of plane activity above my house because i live in close proximity to midway airport.  now i finished my smoke an for some reason looked back in the area where the light was and it was still there. i said to myself that's strange so made my way towards the light. i crossed the street and noticed it had some mass to it so i hopped my neighbors fence and got closer.  i observed that it was hovering and made a hissing sound which was very smooth sounding. as i started to come out of the tree cover i think it saw me so it started to move back north east. i made my way back to my house and thats when i noticed it was dropping in altitude about 500 yds above the tree line and moved where ever it wanted.  as it made two to three slow pauses and then flew right over me. i couldn't believe what i saw, it appeared to be shapped like a smashed oval and had a huge tail or like a dorsal finn on its back end. this lasted for about 3 to 5 min, i was amazed. the next morning i explained this to my wife and thought nothing of it until, sunday oct 19 night at 11 to 11:30 pm.  my wife and i went out in front to smoke, she went out first and me second. i looked in the same location that i saw the object on fri night and to my utter surprise there it was and not just one but two. so i said \"ok kris tell me what that is\"  and sher said \"i dont know\".  so we watched for about a min and kristy said should we get the camera and i was already on my way.  as soon as we started to take photos they started to move. we photographed them together and then chose the one situated to the right. we chased ans shot at the same time.  it came low and in towards us and then moved away. it did choose a different flight pasth in comparison to the first night.  my wife said as we were shooting shots its like they dont want us to photo them, it would speed up and slow down, and it emitted a terrific light arrangement from it when it began to move.  it also seemed likr it change shapes, it was awesome.  the other one began to move and came right towards us in our direction.  my wife was scared and i was too as it moved at us, we decided that now is a good time to get in the house.  we got 9 different shots.  as the second one came over us it was very quiet but you could still heard it, just like the fri night event.  my wife said it was a plane but all the evidence and the visual make-up of the object eliminated that observation. it was low enought to get a visual look at it and know what it looked like.  we looked at the pictures and have showed them to people and nobody can explain, everyone says its amazing.  the best part is that the camera has a zoom in feature so you can really examine the shots. let me know if you want to see them and we can make an arrangement.  i still look in front every night at around 11pm but have not seen anyrthing since.  i did some research and found sightings reported on line starting oct 9 in chicago ridge, oak lawn and orland.  so your the expert and have experience with this phenomana contact me and i'll let you see the photo.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nsean collins

out to my girlfriend that i had never seen stars like that and they seemed too bright because the visibility wasnt the best that night.  we watched them for about 30 seconds as we drove.  after 30 seconds the top object suddenly moved in a northeast direction for a few seconds and then completely vanished.  about 10 seconds later, the bottom object followed suit and completely vanished.  i

c-something. anyway, i love to watch all planes. day or night. the first night i was sitting doing a 1000 piece puzzle. it sounded like an army plane flying over. but, i had no desire to go outside and look at it. the time had not changed.So, it was dark by 6 or so then. then, next night, i was home alone. my husband had taken a friend home. i was sitting doing the puzzle again. i heard an army plane. so, i flew open the door and went out on the front deck. right above the trees, i could see these huge orange 'round' lights. they were not strobbing. but, flashing. they were not hurting my eyes to watch them. i started trying to count them. up to maybe 12. i decided not to concentrate on counting. but instead, just stand there and watch this thing. i could see nothing else, but the orange lights. it went on a straight slow course. as it went over the trees across the way. i could still see the lights. but, could not hear it. i mean, ususally ufos are silent. this was very noisy. it seemed like it was huge. just like the army planes.\r\nwhen my husband got home, i asked him if he saw it. he said, no. it was not reported on our local news. we don't get a newspaper. but, i forgot to look the paper up on the computer the next day.\r\ni was thinking about running in the house and getting my camera. i was thinking, this being a ufo to me, it might know what i was doing and turn it's lights off. so, i just stood there and watched it. i saw where it went, when it went over the trees across the way.\r\nthe next day, i went outside and looked. there is a low gap in the trees and that is where it went over. \r\nnow, it could have gone near the river and banked and landed at the airport. that is what i was thinking. i was wondering if the control tower at the airport, even had this thing on radar. it had to have crossed our local road. then, maybe it hugged the woods. so, no one else saw it. it had to have passed over the town of elkview. which is very small. someone else in elkview had to have seen it, unless, like i said, some how it just stayed over the trees and woods.\r\nwell, earlier this year, when the ufo was sighted in texas. they said, on our local news. that it had orange lights straight in a row. i didn't think too much about it. until they reported it the next night. while the news man was still talking about it. i called the station. i told the lady, that is what i had seen the march before. she said, someone might call me or come out, but they never did. i should have called them back or emailed the news man and had this report keep going. then, maybe someone else would have spoke up and said, they saw it too. \r\nwe lived in va, starting in 1998. in 1999, my son and girlfriend were visiting us. it was the day after thanksgiving. we had gone to walmart. we came home about 4. we stopped at the mailbox. there were two jet trails. right inbetween them, i said \"look\". there was a silver flat object, just hoving over our pond. my son and his girlfriend said, they would get the mail and walk back to the house. it was 1/4 of a mile. we drove down to the house. but, if i had looked up. i could have seen it real close. i mean, it was up kind of high. but, the house was not far from the pond. i thought about my camera, but was afraid to go get it. i never looked up either. guess i was afraid too. my husband didn't either. he said, it was just a plane. but, gee it was round and had no wings and it was just hovering. anyway, my son and his girlfriend, kept their eye on it and it had never moved. then, they had to pass a patch of trees. they said, after they passed the trees, the object would be gone and it was. she wanted to go fishing at the pond. i sat on the ground and just watched the sky. i would say, there were more jet trials that evening, then i had ever seen. everyone went in the house. i looked out by the pond, one for time, before dark and swear, there was a jet trial, shaped like an 's' with 3 jet lines through it. i told everyone, but no one came outside to look. all we could see of this ufo was just a little sliver of the side. since i didn't look up, we coudn't see the bottom. we couldn't see a top. it was flat, flat, flat. all we could see was this little side silver.\r\nthen, maybe that same year or the next year, it was new years eve. we were at the girlfriends house near ft. myers. it was like 70 degrees. it was 9:30 at night. we four were just standing in a row talking. there were two stars, that seemed evenly spaced. they looked a little slanted to us. but, i said, maybe it was straight because of the curve of the earth. anyway, my husband noticed a red light. just a red light, he said, it was going moc 3. it was on a straight course. one star was brighter than the other one. i kept calling them 'headlights'. well, when the red light went under the duller one, it brightened up. we all saw it. it was saying like. \"t is okay to enter this air space.\"we thought maybe it was a mother ship. i think after moving back home to wv. i could still see the 'head lights'. but, i don't think i can see the where we live now. we live out in the country and lots of hills and mountains. but, i am happy we live were we can see planes and army planes going to land at the airport.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

do remember the event and want to make a record of the sighting.\r\n\r\nmy friend joel and i were standing alongside state hwy 16 just outside of senoia, georgia. it was a very dark night and if i remember correctly there was no moon. joel and i were facing north and were just standing and talking when out of nowhere - we did not see where the craft came from - there appeared this very, very large object just above the tree top level.\r\n\r\nthe object was more horse-shoe shaped than triangle or boomer-rang shaped and it was glowing with an intensity that made it appear white hot.\r\n\r\njoel saw the object first and when i looked at it i just could not look away. i was dumb founded. it took a minute for me to realize what we were looking at.  joel said, \" what in the world is that? \" to which i could not respond.  \r\n\r\ni was struck by the fact that though we were less than 100 feet from the object there was no noise.  silent. the object was not making a single sound. no hum, no vibration, nothing.  \r\n\r\nas the object passed over the trees the tree tops were illuminated and i could clearly, clearly see that the tops were waving back and forth. there must have been some air or motion coming from the object that had caused the tree tops to sway back and forth.\r\n\r\nthe brightly lit large object continued to pass over the trees going in an east to south easterly direction which would have taken it over griffin and spaulding county. we watched it until it was out of our sight.\r\n\r\nto this very day whenever i watch some program or read an article about ufo's and ufo sightings i remember this event. the things that most stand out in my mind concerning the object are:\r\n\r\nthe size. it was big.\r\nthe brightness and white hot intensity and glow the object gave off.\r\nthe complete and utter silence of the object.\r\nthe glow from the bottom of the object - heck it was glowing all over.\r\nthe way the glow lit up the tops of the trees - which were about 60 feet at least or more in height.\r\nthe way the tree tops swayed.\r\nthe way that once the object was gone from sight - the area returned to darkness.\r\nhow dumbfounded i was and remain at what i witnessed.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

was august 30, 2008 and it was approximately 11:20 pm at night. i was coming down the main highway that leads to the street i live on. i saw some lights flashing, but first thought was that it was an airplane. our city has several airports and a military base. second thing i noticed was a car parked along side the road. i thought it was possibly broken down being the area it was in. as i got closer to the turnoff to the street i live on, i noticed that the car i had assumed was stalled, started up and it was going fast. as i was approaching my street, the car turned onto my street and was going fast. i thought it was some kids checking the speed of their car then. as i turned onto my street, that is when i got a bettler look at the light that had been flashing. it was not like anything i had even seen. as i drove down the street (it dead ends) i noticed the car that had sped in front of me pulled up to the end of the street and the occupants had jumped out. i slowed down and stopped in the middle of the street in front of my house and got out of my car, as i was trying to watch this object with the lights and the people in the other car. it appeared to be two males, and one got out of his car, climbed up onto the hood of his car, and stretched his arms up to the sky like he was asking for someone to take him. this object with the lights was now in better view, and it appeared disc shaped and it had lights that went all the way around. the lights would flash in sequence all the way around the object, but they did not all flash off and on at the same time. the lights seemed to be grouped together by three. three would flash, and then the next three would flash and it did this over and over only taking about 20 seconds or so to go completely around the object. it was hovering and not moving.  it made absolutely no sound. i noticed a very faint light blue light that may have been radiating beneath it, but may have been coming out of it.  it appeared to have a metallic look but did not appear to be bright or shiny. \r\nthe male standing on the hood of his car started waving his arms high in the air and the other male seemed to be trying to discourage him. i hollered at the time and told the man on the hood not to do that, it might zap him or something, not knowing what this object was. the other male shouted and was wanting to make sure i was seeing it as well. the object i would say was about the size of four homes without the yards. most homes in the area are about 1800 sq. feet. i wanted to go inside my home and get my camera, but if that object zapped that man, i wanted to see it. now i understand why more people do not get pictures. you are afaid if you leave, it will do something and you will miss it. it stayed hovered there for maybe 1 1/2 minutes or so, and then began to move very slowly to the southeast of our city. the males got back into their car and backed up and took another street to go and try to follow it. i got in my car and moved it into my driveway and went inside to call and report it. before i did that, i logged online and checked the police and sheriff's calls to see if others were reporting it. i did not see where anyone was, so i waited for a little bit and checked again and saw no report of anything about it. i began to think that if i was the only one that reported it, people would think i was crazy. if i had seen where someone else had, i was going to. i never saw or heard anything reported about that night. however, i was told about a month later, that someone had stated they had seen it too.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Path then

sky looking east. i sat down and looked out the window after i lit my cigarette.  all the sudden there was this large white strobe light, not blinking, a strobe.  the light was large and very bright which is what caught my attention immediately. it was moving south to north. the light flashed three distinct times. i was thinking at the time that this was too big and bright. i kept looking for any other color light like plane, but i never saw anything other than the big white strobe light. after the three flashes, the light went solid white for a moment and then disappeared right in front of my eyes. i jumped up to look closer, nothing.  there was not one single cloud in the sky!!!!!!!!! this is when my heart rate went through the roof. i have never over-reacted to an aircraft that may look odd.  for some reason this caused my adrenalin to sky rocket.  i did not see anything else that night, but then we went to bed not long after that. the whole event lasted about 30 sec.

shape.At this time i was looking straight up.The traffic noise in town had stopped and it was as if i was the only one there.I then saw that the object had a sort of aluminum shine,but not quite a shine, and was about 15,000 to 20,000 feet up.Then another like object came into view next to the other one.I looked around me to see if anyone else was close so that i might ask them if they were seeing the same thing.But no one was in the back yard but me.Now this is downtown lawrenceville,ga. very noisy but i was hearing nothing.It was as if i was told to watch.As if time stood still while i was watching.These not quite round,not real shiny ufo's were side by side and not moving.I could not believe my eyes!\r\n   i have no idea how long this went on but i watched until one of the ufo's turned on its own axis and just sort of disappeared at the speed of light or faster. the other ufo,by this time i was sure nothing like these were in our airforce,stayed for a short while and then turned several different colors and disappeared. i was shocked to the max.Why was i seeing this happening and who could i tell? i served in the army,army aviation,and had access to a lot of army and airforce bases that you normally could not get on.Nothing and i mean nothing the u.S.A. has looked like what i saw.I mentioned this to several of my close friends who are very open minded and was

Forest","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"The details are somewhat sketchy as it was a long time ago and of the two of us who saw it have slightly different versions of what exactly we did see. two friends and myself were going out for the evening, i do not remember where we were along, what the date was, or even what time of year it was.  i think i remember it being in fall, but i am not even sure about that.  in fact, i can���t even say what year it was as i tried not to think about it for a long time.   i believe that it happened some time between 1995 and 1998.  we were heading east on a main street that traveled through an oak forest / crestwood / midlothian neighborhood  ( i do not remember the street or which town exactly).  i was in the back seat behind the driver, and the other two were in the front.  it was dark out and a mostly cloudy evening.  at about 11:00 from our position and approximately 45��� above the horizon two of us in the car saw the flash of blue and red lights through the clouds.   it lasted for just a fraction of a second.  what i saw and what one of my friends saw are slightly different.  the third individual did not see anything.  he may have closed his eyes at that moment, and it did happen very fast.  at least that is the only reason we can figure out as to why he did not see it.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw was two rectangular shaped lights (side by side) that burned through the clouds as if the clouds were not there.  the one on the left was red and the one on the right was blue. if i were to estimate the ratio of the rectangles, i would say 4 tall by 6 wide.  they flashed only once and in succession with a slight overlap. the lights had a strange appearance to them.  from what i remember, they appeared to have a very solid appearance.  kind of like if your were to take an led light and blow it up to the size of a billboard.  it is difficult to explain, but i guess it looked as if it was a gas filled light (kind of like neon or fluorescent) but shaped like a panel, not tubular.  as i said, it only lasted a fraction of a second.  the clouds, houses, roads, and everything else in the area was lit up like it does when lightening strikes, only it was purple.  it was just the one occurrence, and i do not remember hearing any noise.  \r\n\r\nmy friend who also saw it (the one who was driving) says that he saw it slightly different.  he claims that he saw the same lights moving in a spiral motion around each other as they rose into the sky.  i believe that this was just his head movement causing tracer lines or light trails.  he was driving and had to direct his vision to see it.  i was already looking in the general area and had my head rested against the window of the glass.  i think my view was better, but who knows.  \r\n\r\nwhen we both saw it, we each had a similar kind of ���what the hell?��� type of reaction.  the other friend who was in the car did not notice anything.  we discussed it for several days, but never reported it.  eventually we stopped talking about it because we never could figure out what exactly we saw. \r\n\r\nthe thing that i remember the most about the night was my position in the car; seeing the shape, color, and intensity, of the lights; the flash of purple lightening surrounding the lights, the position in the sky; and my reaction to what i saw.  the date, the town, and the road, i am not sure about.  i do know it was in the approximate area of (oak forest, crestwood, midlothian), illinois and for some reason, i know that we were driving east.\r\n\r\nas for whether or not it was extra-terrestrial, terrestrial, or environmental, i have know idea.  i tend to lean more toward either strange lightening or even some odd reflection of police lights ( i do not know).  i will not be disappointed if i find out that what i saw was not anything otherworldly.  i guess i am just wondering it you have ever heard of this type of sighting before.  i did some research online for it and i could not find anything that sounded like my story or description.  i am just wondering what i did see.  any feedback would be appreciated.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

have seen / heard / know about other aircraft that flies over area .)\r\n\r\n     what is so strange is that from the very first faint sound of this  sound it's flying very very fast !!!  as from the first noticeable detection of it  till it's gone is from 4 - 8 seconds .  that means as if it's going from horizon to horizon or from edge to edge of audible sound detection .\r\n\r\n         i have seen civilian and also spotted military aircraft that have flown over and tracked them with a scope and they last  sight and or sound  usually for 15 - 30 seconds .\r\n\r\n      just seems like someone is testing / has / or is using some new type jet engine ( scram jet  / pulse jet  etc )   \r\n      the only visual sightings i have had is that some nights i have seen a object about the same brightness as a average star but traveling very fast  horizon to horizon  in 6 - 10 seconds  ( no sound ) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    just a bit of info  ( not related to anything i have said or reported )\r\n\r\n     in about early 2008 a man walked into the uhrichsville , ohio 44683 police station and reported that a lighted object flew above his truck and that his truck stopped  / stallled  after the object left it started . he walked into the police station to make a report and they all started to laugh at him . at this point he left without making a report .\r\n  this was a broadcast from one of out local radio stations news casts ??\r\n\r\n               jerry leskovec      jleskovec@hotmail.Com

totally amazed, as it floated, unhurriedly towards a small stand of landscaped dogwood type of trees, float behind one and disappear. i thought, \"i just saw an orb.\" i looked up more information on orbs when i got home, but have never been quite satisfied with information i found, because this was not an etheric looking ball, but physically solid looking.I know this is not an extremely dramatic sighting of something out of the ordinary, except to me, but i was watching a ufo story on discovery last night (in fayettville,nc)and i immediately took notice of the drawings of the huge, orange spheres that were shown and realized that was the same color orange and looked like what i saw, only much, much smaller. i will always believe this orb was aware that i was there watching it and maybe even wanted me to see it.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
