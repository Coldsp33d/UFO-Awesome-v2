a flock of birds. none of the lights blinked. they all stayed pure white. along the outter all the lights where straight and defined the triangle shape. but there were some set out from the outter lights. i watched it for a few seconds then started asking others to looks and see if they could see it. asking if i was just seeing things or if they saw it too. i literally pulled a friend down buy me to try and make her see it. but with all the powerlines and few trees no one could see it. it kept moving on a straight path until it did finally dissapear behind some trees. i started asking friends there if they knew if birds could reflect light. because it really is the best way to describe the lights formation. it was like a flock of pure white glowing flock of birds. no one including me didn't hear any noise. my girlfriend immediatly asked me if it was just a plane. i said of course not. we would have heard jet noise and the lights i saw looked to be higher up than the planes are coming and going from our airport. i have researched in vain since seeing the lights. trying to find out if birds really can relect light or if there have been ufo's sighted that look like the one i saw. and honestly the ufo's that were sited over lubbock texas back in the 50's seem to be the closets i can find of a ufo documented that i have found that looked like the one i saw. except the one i saw the lights were bunched closer together. the the outter line of the > then a couple rows of lights out from the outter lines. i hope i have conveyed good enough what i saw. it has really thrown me for a loop. i feel so odd seeing something unexplainable. i want to know i'm not crazy and others have seen what i did or there is an explenation for what i saw. but i am not believing that just birds reflecting light is what i saw!

va, friday oct 24, about 9:30 pm. i was driving my usual route on the edge of the dismal swamp. my favorite route, old mill rd, is a lonely dark curvy road, with no traffic lights. the sky was a beautiful dark blue. i think the moon was full. the sky was patched with large fluffy white clouds. it's close to deer mating season, and deer run across the road, so my eyes were closely following on the road. above a clump of cyprus and oak trees, i noticed what i thought was an oddly moving jet airliner. i say odd because it moved much slower than a helicopter and emitted no sound. it was also to low to be an airliner. it wasn't a blimp either. the aircraft displayed about 7 large lights on each side of the chevron or triangular shaped craft with a green light on my left as i looked up. as i stated before, the sky was bright, but it was night.I was not afraid, but curious. the craft soon flew over trees that obscured my view. the last time i saw something strange like this i was around 12, 1973. my brother told me to wait while he went in the house to get daddy. heck, no! i went with him, when daddy came out it was gone. it was shaped like a shallow bowl on top of a saucer. the aircraft had many windows and lights all around and red lights on top. we saw this aircraft two more times the summer 1974 with my eldest brother and a neighborhood kid. i live 20 miles from norfolk naval, oceana air naval and langley air force base. i have lived within the proximity of naval and air force bases all around me all my life. i have seen plenty of planes, jets, helicopters, stealth

was just a little kid living in vidor, tx. i now live in orange, tx. i know that this story will probably not do you guys any good, but i feel like i need to finally tell it. up to this point, i have only told my fiancee of this event.\r\n\r\n\r\nit was a nice summer night and the skies were clear. i use to live in a house that my parents built with a nice 5 to 7 acre lake behind it, secluded from town. i was six years old at the time, i am now currently 19, soon to be 20. i remember exactly what happened on that night. my parents were inside the house along with my older brother. i was in the backyard playing fetch with my black lab, named tucker. growing up, tucker was my best friend. i remember throwing the ball and racing tucker to see who could get to it first. of course he did, so we started wrestling for it. at that time he stopping playing and let out a soft whimper. i thought i had acciently hurt him. as i was asking him if he was okay, i noticed that he was looking up into the night sky. i then turned my head and looked up and saw the aircraft that i knew, even at that age, was not an airplane or jet. from where i was there were 8 orange lights, apart from each other, making a circular chape. in the middle was one large orange circular light. thinking back on it, the large light was the size of a football field, and the smaller one's were 50 yards wide. all of the light would be bright for a second, then the next second, they would be dim. it was stationary just for a brief moment, then all of the sudden it started zooming through the air with no sound at all. it traveled one direction for about 2 or 3 seconds, then disappeared. i was so scared that i grabbed tucker's collar and ran inside to my room. after that, i was scared for months. so scared that a part of my hair turned grey from the amount of stress the fear was putting on me, and i still have the greys in my hair to this day. as i am writing this, i am feeling the fear that i had forgotten. when i see the gray patch in my hair, i sometimes think back to what i saw that night. at that age, i knew what aliens and ufo's were, but like magic, i thought it was just make-believe. but on that night, i knew what i had saw. ever since that night, i have always shown a keen interest about the truth that is out there. i know what i saw, but was afraid of what others may think, so i kept it to myself until i was 15. i told my girlfriend, who is currently my fiancee about my encounter. but now, with all of the ufo sightings out there, i don't think people will be too quick to judge me now. this is the first time i am telling this story to the public.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

sitting on my balcony i began to see strange lights strobe in the western sky. the strobe was not continuous, but just a single flash of light here and there, much like a camera flash. i became very curious and decided to sky watch that night till after midnight. i saw a half dozen events that night where a single white light appeared at high altitude, then slowly traversed a hands-width distance (est.) before fading out. \r\n\r\nthe next night(saturday, oct. 25th) i decided to sky watch again, being intrigued by these events. shortly after dark i began to see the same events unfold again. only this time, the strobe flashes was pretty much all i saw till a few minutes after eleven. at that time, i was looking to the western sky along the i-40 corridor when suddenly a luminous object was descending about a half mile from me. initially, i can only describe it as a vertically destorted glow worm. the object was silent, and appeared to be veiled in a thin cloud of vapor as it moved. i called out to my wife to come and look. as she stepped out it was maybe 100 yards from us, and at an elevation of maybe 400 feet. at that point the object had leveled horizontally into a cresent shape and was moving easterly into the belleview community at 20-25 mph. within a minute the object had moved silently out of sight. the object appearance was a soft luminous glow. the sky was clear, the temperature was upper 40's, there was no wind at all this night, and we both witnessed this reality that defies our logic, and has challenged every sense of reasoning.

10/24/08 at about 10:20pm i was parked in a parking lot in the downtown indpls. area since it was a slow night. over the downtown horizon and in what appeared the be the northeast quadrant of marion county (indianapolis), at what appeared to be about 10 miles away from my location, i observed about 10-15 circular, amber/orange lights, floating or flying upwards and into the wind. i could not tell if these objects were leaving the ground or just rising from a lower altitude because of my view being obstructed from the buildings downtown and the horizon in general. initially i saw 3 of these objects rising, they looked like they were equally spaced apart, but at different altitudes. i dont believe it was one unit, but rather 3 seperate objects. about 20 seconds or so after the first 3, i observed 3-4 more of these objects ascending in the same manner as the first 3. then shortly after, i observe about 6-8 more of the same type objects following the same path. i dont believe they were hot air or helium balloons because i wouldnt think they would fly into the wind, however i am no expert and they may be capable of just this. it was a somewhat rainy and cloudly night, however not raining at the time, but after they objects got so high i could no longer observe them. i am not sure if this was due to the clouds blocking my view, the lights going or buring out or some other reason. i did not see any mention of this on the local news. i also seen what appeared to be a commerical aircraft heading towards the objects path. the aircraft and wind was going from west to east, and the amber lighted objects were going from east to west at a somewhat gradual pace or variance. the objects cleared the aircrafts path about 20-30 seconds prior to the aircraft arriving in the area. i assume the aircraft had just left the indianapolis international airport, located on the westside of indianapolis. i also sent an email to the indianapolis star to inquire as to whether any one else has reported these objects or if there might have been a legitimate reason for their presence, but so far i have not heard back. i attempted to take cellphone camera picture and video but you cant see the objects due to poor camera quality in cellphones. again maybe these were balloons or something else not unusual, but i have seen this before. i also want to mention that several hours later i did see what is mistakenly called a \"shooting star\" in the same direction as the objects. this was unusual to me because of my earlier sighting as well as the fact that this one appeared to be brighter and close to the ground than any previous shooting star i have seen before. i know they really arent stars, but rather meteorite pieces or somthing like that. but the shooting star could just be a coincidence. thank you in advance for your time and consideration in this matter. hopefully it gets figured out and its some simple explanation.\r\n ","distance":"Over One

our grandparents farmhouse watching the sky. he was around 14 years old. i was too young to work hard on the farm but he spent the day working in the tobacco field and was tired. he fell asleep as i was still looking at the billions of stars above that night. looking eastward, the horizon was lit with a thin line of light shining from the town of wilson. it was around 10pm. suddenly a glow rose above the horizon and proceeded to come toward the farm. i quickly noticed that the glow was 3 balls of fire moving at a high rate of speed at about a thousand feet above the ground. there was no noise coming from them. the ball in the middle was twice as large at the two others on each side of the middle one. in a moment of maybe 6 to 10 seconds it moved from the horizon and went straight overhead and into the opposite horizon. i was so excited that i tried to scream to my brother but nothing would come out. i shook him awake and gained my voice and told him of the incident. for several minutes we watched hoping it would come around again. we had thought that maybe it was going around the world! after maybe 15-20 minutes he fell asleep again and i continued watching the sky. as god is my witness it happened again! and again i was too excited to voice myself right away. all i could do was shake my brother and tell him again. i really don't quite remember what happened after that except that we eventually went to bed. the fireballs never came back again. \r\n\r\nthe reason that i'm reporting this now is that awhile back i was watching a ufo show on tv and one of the reports was of three fireballs going over russia in the late 1950s! i can't help but think that i saw those very same fireballs on my side of the earth. so i'm writing to try to find some possible confirmation about this. could you tell me if you have any reports of something of this type around this timeframe?\r\n\r\nthank you,\r\n\r\nphillip batchelor","distance":"501 Feet - 1
