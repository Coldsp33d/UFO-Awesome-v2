3. at first i figured it was an unknown vehicle as there is a military base in our town. it's like it knew i was there and could see it. i couldn't speak i was shocked although i felt joy afterwards and no fear. when it seemed the craft noticed me it moved diagonally and very smooth behind a nearby cloud. it was so quick smooth the way it moved i'm not sure how it was possible to be so powerful yet so quiet. no beam was emitted it really seemed like more of a test drive the way it avoided me. my spirituality durastically changed from christian to agnostic soon afterward. i was so happy to feel like there was other life out there but i'm not ruling out our own technology. i lost sight of the object behind a cloud and did not see it shoot up or come out of the clouds. the undocumented flying object was triangular shaped with 3 lights inside each corner and descended right above me . although at first the light was in the middle.

&#8206;2017, i was witness to a ufo over the skies of lincolnshire in england on a long stretch of road between the villages of gosberton and dowsby.\r\n\r\nit was a cool evening and almost dark, with no street lights nearby and very little around me apart from flat fields which are typical for this part of the country, with only the odd tree and a few bushes to break up the dull landscape.\r\n\r\non the night in question i was travelling from gosberton to the market town of bourne, by way of dowsby, while at work as a supermarket delivery driver. while travelling west along the long fen road i noticed a small, white light in the sky directly ahead of me, completely on its own. at first i paid it no mind as it just looked like any other star you would see in the night sky. but shortly afterwards i began to wonder why there was only the one star with no others visible at the time.\r\n\r\nthis puzzled me and, seeing as i had a good bit of spare time before i was due to make my next delivery, i decided to pull over and take a short break. the road was deserted and so i parked at the side to relax for a few minutes. i was intrigued by what i was seeing and was wondering why only a single star would be visible. i thought about it for a short while but then came to the conclusion that rather than being a star, it is probably the international space station. after all, it seemed to be too close to be a star.\r\n\r\ni took out my phone and, seeing that i had a 4g connection, googled “space stations” and the first result was the website for nasa's \"spot the station\" page, which i tapped on to see what information the site contained regarding what i could see in front of me. i looked around on the website out of curiosity and found a list of about twenty different times that week that the iss would be visible from my location. i looked at the time and it was &#8207;&#8206;18:41 pm.\r\n\r\nwhat puzzled me was the fact that this time wasn’t listed on the website for that day. i forget the exact times but i can say that they were all am times, with no listings for pm or evening times. i thought this was quite odd and assumed maybe it was a mistake on the site, so i tried to find any other lists of times that would correspond to my sighting for that day. again, the two other lists of times i found online were exactly the same as the first one.\r\n\r\nit was at this point that i began to wonder if what i was seeing actually wasn’t a star or the iss, but something… else. but what, exactly? i wanted to try and find out.\r\n\r\nother thoughts began to occur to me. was there another space station that i was unaware of? i assumed there was only the iss, but i supposed it was possible that any country with a space program could have one; russia, china, india… so again, i googled “space stations”. turns out there are a few, or have been. like i thought, china does in fact have two up there, the tiangong-2 and the defunct tiangong-1, so that makes for a total of three. however, upon looking for the tiangong-1 & 2 visibility times, they too did not correspond to the time it currently was.\r\n\r\nso… it’s not a star or a space station. perhaps it’s a planet? i knew that mercury, venus and mars could be seen by the naked eye and upon googling it, i learned that both jupiter and saturn could also be seen. \r\n\r\nso was it one of these planets i was looking at? time was getting on a bit now and i would have to make a move soon if i wanted to stay on schedule with my deliveries, but i had to know what i was looking at.\r\nback to google, i typed in “which planets are visible tonight from lincolnshire uk”. it loaded for a moment and then the list of results came up, but this is when the truly bizarre thing happened. before i began reading or tapping on links, i looked up at the small white light in the sky, still hovering where it had been, and then… it vanished for one second. gone. then it came back for probably two seconds… and then it was gone again. it didn’t come back.\r\n\r\ni was stunned. what the hell was that? where had it gone? it couldn’t have been clouds passing in front of it, the disappearance was too sudden. i felt excitement and anxiety, with a good helping of puzzlement as well. i waited around 5 minutes for it to reappear, but it didn’t. i would have waited longer, but sadly i needed to continue on with my delivery run and was beginning to fall behind.\r\n\r\nthe object in question can be seen in the center of the sky in the attached photo. i am kicking myself that i did not get it on video, but at least i was able to get one photo before it vanished.","distance":"Over One

sitting on my front porch swing which faces west. i had just moved to florida 2 months ago and i was enjoying the warm evening and the night sky (more stars than ny where i came from). suddenly, i saw two bright orange orbs come from the south west. they were traveling at an even pace with each other but at a slight distance apart (one in front of the other). the one in the front disappeared behind trees. at this time, another glowing orb appeared from the same direction traveling faster than the other two. it seemed to be \"catching up\" to the others. the second orb then went behind the trees.  the third, still at a faster pace, a few seconds later, then disappeared behind the trees.  there was no sound from the lights.  i have a direct point of reference as to the size of the lights: about 1/4 mile away there is an electric tower with a flashing red light on top.  the orange lights were approximately the same size as the tower light, but they seemed higher in the sky.  the whole scenario took maybe 30 seconds before all three of the lights disappeared from my line of vision behind the trees. i cannot be positive they changed direction due to trees, but it did seem they made a soft westerly turn. as soon as i saw these orbs/lights, my first thought was, \"holy s- - -! i'm seeing ufos!\"  i got chills and gooseflesh. i don't believe i even blinked during the time i watched.\r\n\r\ni called 911.  two deputies came about 15 minutes later even though i told 911 this was an \"fyi\" and they didn't need to send anyone over. the deputies asked me a few questions.  i
