a bright light flashed in my eyes. i turned slightly to my left to see where the flash came from, and to my absolute horror, a ufo descended from some clouds not a mile from my home. i was frozen in fear, and i said \"but mother said that they do not exist, they are just in the movies\" to my sister, who turned to see what i was talking about. we both stood frozen as the ufo descended from the clouds, leveled out and headed in our direction. it slowly moved along the length of our street, coming to a halt directly over the house across the street from where we were standing. the ufo was perhaps 10-20 feet above the house. the ufo was perhaps 30-40 feet from edge to edge. i do not remember seeing windows, but i remember thinking that they were watching us because of windows. i was afraid that \"they\" were going to kill us because we knew that they really did exist. we stood frozen looking at it for what seemed to us forever, but was more likely only a minute or two, then the ufo tipped up on edge, and just disappeared up into the sky. my sister and i ran into the house, screaming, and when our mother came running, my sister fainted. i was crying and shaking, telling mother that we saw a ufo, that the aliens knew that we saw them because it stopped and \"looked\" at us. mother said to call the police, and when the operator answered, she said that they had received over 350 calls reporting a flying saucer. i remember my father bringing home the paper the next day, and there was an article on the bottom of the front page about the ufo. i so wish that i had kept that newspaper!","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Window(s)","flightPath":"Path then

the street lights went out. at first it felt like a blackout but my house still had power. i looked toward the back windows and the entire backyard was as bright as day with some sort of green light. the light lasted maybe 60-90 seconds and could be seen through windows on all three side of the room. the light then went off like a switch. i was curious as to what happened so i went outside and looked in the forth directgion towards a hill up the road. then the light came back on i could see a glowing white light on the other side of the hill i jumped onto the hood of the car in my driveway. i could hear at this point a humming noise i had the sense that something was happening on the other side of the hill. i ran back inside and grabbed a phone incase it was an accident or something. when i got back inside the light was back i ran toward the road and started to head up the hill i stopped because i saw headlights coming. im waiting for him to stop at an accident. he kept coming so i wanted to see if it was a squad car or  a citizen that might tell me to call 911. the car as moving at what seemed like the posted speed limit of 35mph. i looked at it as it passed me it was dark with dark tinted windows. i saw it hit the brakes and turn around. for some reason i decided to go inside and watched the car pass at the same speed back up the hill. i never saw any first responder reds or blues on the other side of the hill but a squad car did pass my house some miniuets later with silent blues coasting at maybe 45mph down the hill and into the distance towards the town line. at some point what looked like a long wells fargo truck and a dark suv passed by in a 2 car convoy.\r\n\r\n     when i thought about it later i became convinced there was no accident. i never saw any response from law enforcement that would suggest this. it looked to me like they were looking for soemthing or quitely performing some task.\r\n     \r\n     the green light i describe was like nothing i have ever seen. my mother the next morning said she awoke to the humming and the light on the forth and rear side of the home. i was outside in this light and it seemed to come out of dark matter or space itself. there was also a bright white light diagonally across the road near the doorstep of a neigbhbors house at one point. this light could easily have been a flashlight inside the home although i never saw it moove. \r\n\r\n     this event cannot be explained at this point by any man made source i know of. my mother remains convinced that something unhearthly occured around 230am lastnight near her home. there was never any thunder lightning or high winds witnessed durring the even.

the summer months,of 1991.A girlfriend and i,decided to go on a picnic,it was the weekend.We contacted a friend,and asked him to join us.He agreed to do so,but he would come up in his own car,and would meet us there later, with his pregnant girlfriend, at the time(i e-mailed him to ask him the date,month,and year.The reason i did so, was because i did not recall the time line,i e-mailed him a couple of days ago,oct.23.08 to ask him..Since,his girlfriend was pregnant.He would remember,he told me 1991,in the summer months,date,time no clue!!!).Anyways,we packed a lunch,and were headed to st.Jovite,in the laurentians.Its a place i use to go fishing,since the mid 80s,with the buddy,that was to meet us later.It was a beatiful day,sunny,a very slight breeze,from west to east.There were some clouds,but few and far between.It was warm.We got to our destination.It was in ste.Jovite,in the laurentians.It was ruisseau larose.This stream was fed by lake sauvage,and others...For location purposes.I believe highway 329 or 327 to get there. alright,we take the gear and stuff, outa the car, and head up the path,to a little lake,that the stream made...This took about 30-45minute walk up the mountain,to get there.It was a beautiful setting.The lake was maybe 700ft length by 300ft wide(approx.)we sat at the southeast end,overlooking the lake at its length...Watching where the stream flowed into the lake.At that end of the lake,the stream flows down into the lake,the elevation,maybe 45 degrees.This description is for later corrolation,to the height of object off the ground.So were sitting there,enjoying the day,the scenery,and awaiting our friends to come up.As were sitting there,i notice,to my right(say northeast)this object,appox.100/200ft above the tree line.The object was maybe 2000ft to the right of us.It was moving very slowly up/down, jagged,erratic,shinny then flat,from east to west.I remember thinking,i know this might sound bizarre.I thought to myself,\"huh!,how people could throw there garbage in a prestine area.I thought what i saw,was a wrapping from a cigarette pack,the cellophane shinny/flat,with the suns reflection.Again,i've learned, that, that was a protection system from the rational, to kinda make sense of the irrational.As i watched the object moving towards the west,moving up/down,erratically.And, the thoughts of the wrapper.The rational kicked in, and i started thinking, how can it be,there's a slight breeze from west to east,can't be a piece of garbage...100/200ft above tree line,were up in the woods,its erratic movements,etc.. i had these thoughts firing in mind, as the object moved ever so slowly,moving up/down, shinny/flat.I analized.I knew,what it was..I quickly turned to my girlfriend,and said,\"look at that!\".She asked what it was?And said,that she was looking at it,too.I blurted out, at a million miles an hour,my thoughts.I told her,that i thought it was a piece of cellophane,then,that it couldn't be,because it was above the trees,slight breeze from west to east.Anyways,the object was moving from east to west.She was in awe,and glued to it, as i was.While, we fired our views at each other.The object continued its path, until it was directly in front of us.It was at the other end of the lake(about 700ft linear).And,from level of the lake(45 degree elevation reference)maybe 200ft above the ground.Anyways,the object stopped in front of us,hovered,went from shinny to flat.While it was hovering,we were still captivated,in awe,discussing what we were seeing.When all of a sudden,i reach for my eyes(cause,i could not see)and i say,\"my eyes,i can't see!\" i heard her say the same thing...About her eyes.What i experienced was,as best as i can describe it,like when you have cable problems,and the channel your watching is off air,and all you see is snow,or black and white dots.This is what i saw.I lost time/we both did.The couple that was to meet us,were heading towards us.I don't know how much time elapsed.I just know we both looked at them,not even mentioning what had just happened.Its funny,that,i e-mailed my buddy for date of event/time.He remembers going but everything else...Not much.When we left at the end of the day.My girlfriend and i discussed it,we went to a video store to lookup the phenomenom.We rifled through the videos on ufo's.When she landed on a picture of the object,that ressembled what we saw,she freaked in the store.The object seemed/looked metallic.Its shape was like,kinda/sorta a diamond,a star,it was shinny,then flat.It looked as though it strecthed from up and down,or from side to side.The feelings i experienced were excitement,happiness,vindication.She was scared,frightened,excited.She did not believe what had just happened.She...Is irish/catholic background,it scared her a great deal.I said vindication,because all the years of telling the first two sightings,and seeing peoples reactions.Also,i had told my girlfriend of my sightings,she believed me cause she loved me, but told me one time, prior to our sighting,that people thought,i was like the village idiot.This because, i would tell people of my sightings(the first two).

you are a serious credible service, i decided to let you know what i saw/heard.  also - with as many things that are occurring with evidence in stephenville, i thought there may be other reports during the same timeframe.\r\n\r\nin 1985-88, i lived north of stephenville about 4 miles along highway 281, towards morgan mill.  it was a dirt/gravel road that was known since some guy at the corner had his own uphostlery place - don't upholstery i think.\r\n\r\nthe timeframe is very vague - because it was a long time ago.  the facts of the timeframe are winter - because it was pretty cold, and 85-86 more than likely - because my parents were in new mexico and they wouldn't leave me home alone if i was younger.  more than likely - 1986.\r\n\r\ni was inside my house, either watching tv or messing around with some board game when i heard a low vibration sound - like a very low bass humming.  as it got louder, i went outside as it was obvious it was not in my house.  the night was super dark - no cloudcover and no moon (new moon, i guess).  there were stars everywhere.  i heard the sound coming from the north and looked up in the sky but saw nothing.  the noise was getting closer - not necessarily louder - and i still was looking for anything.  no lights - nothing.  \r\n\r\nthen what was weird, i realized whatever was making that sound had no lights.  whatever was making the noise, was in a \"black out\" or \"lights out\" mode.  the only way i could tell this was that as the noise went over me, all the stars started to disappear - as if something was blocking the view.  the only way to describe the object is a very long rectangular shape.  if i had to give measurement, i'd say 50 yards wide (at most?) but at least 200 yards in length.  it's difficult to say how high it was.  if i had to guess, i would say somewhere between 50-100 yards...But that is a very limited guess.  it went south over our area (this is just west of hwy 281) and as far as i could tell, never increased speed (i'd say maybe 25 mph) and never turned on any lights.  i lost sight of it when i couldn't tell if stars further away were being blocked from view.\r\n\r\ni thought maybe it could have been a blimp - but weeks later i thought - what the hell would a blimp be doing in stephenville, at night, with no lights on?  i thought about reporting it, but i never went further with that thought.  even though i have always been fascinated by the unknown, i can honestly say that high school, girls and friends had a higher priority in my life.  \r\n","distance":"101-500

outside.  did not pay much attention to it until it moved.  i then ran outside to get a better view of it.  the bright star looking object would move but would stay positioned in the sky like a star for a long period of time.  then suddenly it would move again.  similiar to like a bee moves in the sky or a hummingbird.  right to left in small almost unnoticable movements.  then from time to time it will move up and down.  \r\nthe object or (ufo) is about 30 - 50miles from my home.  usually i stop watching it when clouds come in and cover it or it goes behind a tree.  i had seen it outside 3 days in a row.  and the last two days it has been raining and cloudy.  however, this evening the sky was clear again and it is out there again.  i notified the local news channel asking them to check it out, of course they don't believe me.  they said it was the planet venus!  how ridiculous!!  i managed this evening to get my video camera out.  and got some good footage of it.  it is incredible when i would zoom in on the ufo, it had definition and would change yellow and red and orange and then would get small then expand.  the object is west of where i live. i live off of 29, about 2 miles from the lynchburg airport. there is a lake in the back of my yard and an open view of the sky west of where i live.  and that is where the ufo is at.  \r\nhopefully, if you get this message in time, it would be great to get some good camera's out here to see the ufo closer.  for some reason it seems like it is just staying in the same spot.  unsure how much longer it will stay where it is.  but seems to be coming out about 7 pm or so, right when it starts to get dark.  and then i can't see it after about 8 - 8:30pm or so.  \r\n","distance":"Over One

after i was almost done i looked up, cause  i always looked up at the sky, and i see something out of the corner of my eye, so i looked in that direction, i immediately knew it was a ufo, as it was not too far up in the sky, matter of fact, it was close enough to where i can see its outline, it was a narrow triangle, with 3 huge round lights, 1 in the front, 2 in the rear, and to the ufo's right side was a small round white sphere trailing it precisely side by side, at that moment i could not believe what i was seeing, i was standing between 2 apartment buildings just in complete awe,i was wishing i had a camera phone or just a camera on me but i did not, and i wasnt going to run inside and look for 1 and miss the ufo when i came back out, and i wasnt about to follow it as i didnt want to be abducted lol, so it passed by out of my sight and i just went back inside, my mind was going crazy, didnt know what to think :(, anyways, we have a naval base nearby and i wanted to call them to let them know a ufo was headed in that direction, i couldnt find their contact numbers, so i called my stepfather who is a pilot and tried to see if he could call someone there for me, he didnt believe me and said \"sometimes there's things in the sky that play tricks on our eyes\" i was like man, im not retarded, i know for a fact of what i witnessed. it was such a clear sighting that i was scared. i've been into ufos for a very long time, im a 28 year old male and have been waiting for the day when i would see my 1st ufo, but i wanted to see one from a distance, and not so close, i was

notice two bright objects, one slightly brighter than the other one nw of my backyard.  they seemed to me to be too near to be stars, but looked just like bright stars, strangely out of place.  that's what caught my attention at first.  one was slightly lower than the other one also.  at first i thought they were stars, they were very still.  suddenly they dimmed to two very small points of light and started to move, in unison, one after the other to the west!  i looked at my watch, it was 06:38 am in dark nightime skies.  sky was absolutely clear.  i was flabbergasted once they started dimming.  this was not a slow dimming, it was steady and quick.  i have seen strange things in the sky before, but nothing that would make me sit down and report it.  there was no sound, and the brightest object was as bright as venus, dimming to almost invisibility.  several things bother me from this sighting.  these two objects were not aircraft, were not stars and were not satellites due to their flight characteristics.  i'm familiar with civilian and military crafts in my area from san antonio airport and lackland ab.  these objects looked like stars with no navigation lights.  they sat motionless in the night sky, dimmed and started moving away at a fairly fast speed.  i was torn between grabbing my 7x35 binoculars and staying back watching the objects, but did not go into the house in fear i would loose the objects since they dimmed.  they went over my house's roof and became undetectable in the sky.  \r\n\r\n  ","distance":"Over One

am prone to looking skywards for the weather, as i walked outside i looked upwards to the north a bit, basically directly over island point, i saw two bright orange lights in the sky, i never really took much notice of lights in the sky round here because the cairns international airport is only about 50 km from here as the crow flies, but these were different, they weren't moving or altering. because i thought this was a bit odd, i went back into the restaurant and got the owner, to come and look too, he thought it was a joke at first but i convinced him to come outside and check it out, two of the waitresses also came and looked. so, these two lights were still in the same basic location the were in before i went inside (3-4 minutes)and as we all stood and watched another 3rd light appeared from behind a cloud to the east a little and moved in an irregular line towards the other two lights. which then also began to move slowly into a rough triangle formation and then they slowly seemed to just all go out together.\r\nmy boss tried to take some photo's on his phone, but they didn't come out.\r\ni was not going to rreport this sighting, but, just tonight myself and another person witnessed another strange occurence just forty km from the last one. i have told some of the locals and fishermen about this, they have their own stories, and so do the local indigenous people.\r\n\r\ni have to say i was sceptical about this subject.. till now even after years of spending nights outdoors both recreationally, sleeping under the stars and during a 15 year security career... i have never seen anything like this!\r\njust 3 yrs ago i remember laying in bed looking out my bedroom window at wonga beach, to the dagmar range to the west and wondering why, over an uninhabited, jungle covered mountain range, and under a clear sky, flashes of light were eminating like distant lightning from the tops of the mountains lighting up the night humidity.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional change,Path then

watched the \"star\" began to get brighter, then suddenly dimmed and went out, then, suddenly came back on... this happenned a couple of times, when the light appeared to go out, there was a glow on the mountain top below where it was seen.. also during this happening, while the light was flashing intermittently there where what looked like little shooting stars darting across the sky from different points, directly towards this flashing star. after about ten minutes of this some clouds covered the top of the mountain, when the clouds cleared, the light was gone alltogether the object made no obvious movements.\r\n\r\nneither of us had ever seen anything like this light in the place this happened, it was no star, or planet or aircraft, the light was bright white and had no other

the size of a quarter (from my backyard) west of grand junction, colorado. i grabbed my digital camera and zoomed in as close as i could and observed a diamond shape. as i watched, two more lights, one on each side, appeared. i thought it might be inbound air traffic to our regional airport, but the light did not progress any further, but instead seemed to recede or become smaller. i continued to watch the lights and observed the two lights on the sides go dark. then the object turned red, and then amber. i observed the light for a half an hour, then went inside to get warm. i observed it from inside the house a little longer (15 minutes or so) and then it went dark altogether. \r\n    the following night approximately around 2000 hrs i looked in that same direction to see if anything was there, and it was there in the same area of the sky. i told my wife and she came to the back porch to see. i grabbed the camera and zoomed in on it and snapped two pictures, but all that the pictures showed was a squiggly line. my wife grabbed a pair of binoculars (8x21) and i watched for 10-15 minutes. i observed the diamond shape again through the binoculars. sometimes it appeared as a sphere and the diamond shape would not be visible. i trained my binoculars on a star nearby to compare. the observed object was much brighter than the star. the object turned red, and then amber, then appeared to recede or become smaller. i entered the house to watch some more, but the object went dark. i flashed my 4d maglite flashlight at it 3 times to see if it would respond, but nothing else was observed. i sat on the couch and watched t.V. for an hour. i returned to the back porch around 2200 hrs. and the light was there in the same area of the sky. i watched it for a short time (approx. 5 minutes), and told my wife about it. i returned to watching t.V. and did not observe anything else that evening.\r\n   tonight, 10/24/08, i noticed it again around 1945 hrs. doing the same things: changing size (or receding), changing colors, and hovering in the same spot.I decided to see if anyone else had reported it to mufon so i called mufon colorado and continued to observe the light while on the phone.\r\n   i have military experience (u.S.N) and i was stationed at an air base and i have never seen any sort of military aircraft doing these sort of manuevers. i know helicopters can fly backwards, but i have not seen them turn red and amber, or turn into spheres of light.
