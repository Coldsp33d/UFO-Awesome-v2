(i'll include my youtube footage; if you listen closely you can even hear my camera zoom, but nothing from the orbs at all)\r\n\r\nthey were not flying high at all, app. the same hight as a helicpter.\r\nthey were not big at all; maybe 10-15 meters, altough hard to guess with a crystal clear sky. from these guesses could be concluded that they were going at a speed of 150km/h, steadily, but moving not in a tight formation; the moved a bit to and from eachother.\r\nthey did not move at wind-direction; west-southwest by east-northeast, making a wide turn to the north.\r\n\r\nup close (they went allmost over our garden, so we had a good look at it) they were more yellow, with a deep orange core. radiating from the middle like a fat star.\r\ni drew a picture of what i saw in photoshop: http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=ywdircpbizq \r\nas we stood there my husband said \"look; there are a whole bunch more coming!\" our original 3 or 4 were now joined by 5 more!\r\nfrom the garden i rushed back in to get my camera, but we only had our sony t10 (so poor quality, i apologize). i also put that on youtube: http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=hipdcelnjhk\r\n\r\ni kept filming (with a short pause as they went behind a treetop) untill the were gone over the rooftops of our block. we went inside, a bit stunned, and realized we might see them from upstairs, the streetside of our block. we did not spotted them there at all, maybe because they turned further to the north (along the roofs), maybe they were behind the tree (close to the neighbouring house) that was blocking our sight, maybe they just vanished.\r\n\r\nwe had no fysical respons to it, but were (understandably) a bit in awe, excited, and did not understand what we saw at all, just that that couldn't have been from earthly origine. we are quite down to earth people i think, haha.\r\n\r\ni expected it to be the talk of the day, as they went over a vast populated area. but as we learned: most people kept quiet to not be the town-fool.\r\nalmost directly i got online (as soos as five minutes), curious to what it may have been, and thinking there would be people that saw these to here. nothing like that, but these orange orbs seem to be spotted here in holland quite often.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

was the summer,i believe it was july,maybe, august.It was a warm evening.The sky was lit full of stars.I was in the park ,with a friend of mine.The park was in front of our house.So,that evening,my friend and i,decided to sit on a park bench(on its back rest)and we proceeded to imitate chickens(there cackling,etc..).We were kids!Anyways,after a few minutes of cackling.I notice this stationary white light ball,in the sky, to my left,at say 70 degree angle to where we were.So,i yell out to my friend,in excitment,\"hey,look at that!\".We both were glued to this white light ball(that's what it looked like from the ground).The light started to oscillate,it changed colors...Yellow,red,blue( a mix of those colors )they had a neon/irredescent glow to them .I was in a state of awe,mouth wide open,and looking.I believe my friend was in the same state of awe.The object stopped changing colors...Returned to its white color,and proceeded to streak across the sky, above us,it went back and fourth,so fast, it left a light trail.It would go back and fourth,stopping on a dime.Then,it did the same,but,diagonally,still connected to the previous light trail.It did the same thing,went back and fourth,leaving a light trail,and stopping on a dime.My eyes never left the white light ball,same with my friend.The object, continued to complete,what i described to people,as the letter z in the sky.It went so fast,that the first two light trails were still lit up.When the third line(if you will)to the letter \" z \" it scribed was finished,it stopped on a dime.It stayed stationary for a couple of seconds,then shot up...Straight up,at incredible speed, and disappeared.I right away, broke it down to logic,even at that age.There were no clouds,for image projection.There was no light beam from ground to sky.There was no sound.There was no form to it,other than the white light ball.Nothing could move that fast and stop on a dime.In the 70's people had modest homes,thus,no holographic machines.We ran to my house, told my dad,he said (along these lines)oh that's good.The next day.My friend tells me,that his parents said,\"it was a plane!\".I said to my friend,there was no noise,there was no clouds for image projection,nobody could afford a holograph machine,that planes could not move like that...Back and forth,and stop on a dime...Etc,etc...Through the years,while telling this story...I had a hair raising moment.When describing the light trail that the object left behind,and the letter it resemmbled to up in the sky, \"the letter z\".I realized that looking from the ground up...Its the letter \" n \",and not the letter \"z\"(reading it from say, east to west in the sky,stretched out away from you looks like the letter \"z\",but viewing it, the way the object wrote/scribed it, south to north.,it is the letter \"n\" in the sky.. understand).If you take the letter \"n\" and put it above your head, it looks like the letter,that starts my family name.This is my second sighting...From my first to the second,there was wierd things,maybe around 6-7-8 years of age.Things around my bed,short purple or blue hooded and other ones, long stringy,taller.I use to scream my head off,i guess nobody heard.I would wake up the next day and all was forgotten. i will submit my third sighting, shortly.I'm sorry, if all this seems strange,well,imagine seeing these things, and people think your out there.��������������� ","distance":"101-500

away from it. the hull plates appeared to be 300 feet wide by 500 feet tall and the angle of the ship i was viewing had about 25 plates on its lowest row. it was still comming. the ship was traveling very slowly at this time; apporoximately, .25 miles per second and about 200 feet off of the ground. by this time, the terminator was stepping into the air and it was begining to come down toward the ground at me. i still could not run from it. when it stopped , it was less than 1000 feet away from me, standing there. its hull wall was a silver grey now in the dusk of the terminator. it stood for

that this thing was a considerable distance beyond that and floating at equal level to the clouds. even though it was clear where we we're their we're clouds of in the distance.\r\n\r\nin my oponion you had two choices once you saw what we saw. you either make up some excuse like what one person did and said it was fireworks or you eventually go crazy. if you can't come up with an explanation and you can't deny that you saw it then it would turn your world up side down. everything that you we're taught goes completly out the window. \r\n\r\nyou draw two conclusions from this either it came from another solar system or the government isn't telling you the truth that space travel between the stars is very possible and they're doing it at this very moment.\r\n\r\nwhat we saw was very real. the friend that i talked this over with was a fellow cab driver. in vegas it's very hard to get job driving a cab after talking to him we found that we saw the exact same thing how is that possible considering what we saw was impossible. he even saw it from the beginning and i saw it in what i consider the landing mode. it's impossible for me to see things and it's next to impossible for him to see things. we weren't tired or drunk and we're trained observers. this is what i saw.\r\n\r\ni was pulling into the show boat hotel. normally i go directly to the cab stand but this time i saw a fellow cab driver looking over his cab like something was wrong. so i decided to stop and ask him if everything was all right.\r\n\r\nhe said yes but look at that. i looked where he was pointing and saw nothing. then my body completly froze. i thought i saw a shooting star but then i immediately said hey wait a minute a shooting star doesnt go directly up wards. \r\n\r\nwhat i saw was sparkling crystals in the shape of a star much like a fire works display. they we're about the width of a 747 pair of wings from one end to another. you could see the crystals very clearly even though you we're most likely about 10 miles away. the crystals didn't start from the grown up but started at cloud level. the crystals slowly fizzled away they went straight up for maybe half a mile difficult to judge though from the distance we we're away. when they finally faded an orange ball appeared about the size of a helecopter. \r\n\r\nfrom this orange ball more crystal lights came out this time they we're bright red. they came straight forward then curved slowly down and when those lights faded another orange ball appeared. so now we have two orange balls about a half mile apart about the size of a helicopter.\r\n\r\nthen more crystal red light came from the second orange ball and shot straight across forming a perfect triangle.\r\n\r\nnow you have three orange balls about the size of a helicopter aprox half a mile apart forming what looks like a perfect triangle. then all of a sudden the lower right ball looked like it was beginning to rotate and it just vanished.\r\n\r\nwhat i saw lasted about 2 or 3 minutes the lights that looked like fire works display lasted maybe only seconds. theiir was absolutely no noise that you could here. if it was fire works display like one person stated where was the noise and why did it last only a short time.\r\n\r\nwhen i talked to my fellow cab driver he saw the same thing that i saw to the letter. however he saw the strange lights come down from the stars and that must have looked very strange indeed. he rushed home and reported it to the news and never came back to work. it must have affected him immensely. it didn't start to bother me till i lost my job and had time to think about it.\r\n\r\ni know that we don't have anything that can display fireworks from a mile of the ground and that can form a what appears to be a perfect triangle.\r\n\r\nmost likely the reason why no photographs we're taken is because you had to be looking in the right direction at the right time. the flashes of light probably didn't last that long and when the 3 balls appeared they fairly far of and perhaps most didn't see that aspect of it. also if you did see the lights your body most likely went into a state of shock you wouldn't have had time to get your camera ready.\r\n\r\nthis was documented on the 10:00 news on i believe to be saturday 13, august 1994.\r\n\r\nwhat's your explanation \r\n\r\n  \r\n","distance":"Over One

oval shaped boject in the southern sky heading northward at approximately 1000 feet above sea level. the light was constant and did not emit it's light into it's path or to far away from itself. it was completely silent. that was the reason i watched it. because it was silent. i live in the ;anding approach path to san jose international airport and i see planes all the time. every day and i usually only glance at them for a second or two but this night i kept looking because i could not figure out why i felt impelled to watch it. i thought it was strange that it was silent. i then thought maybe it's a helicopter, but where are the flashing lights? there were non. no landing lights or headlights. just it's own amber light and it made no sound whatever. it approached from south to north at 1000 feet and i watched it do that in a straight line for approximately 20 seconds. it seemed to be going slower than an airplane or a helicopter. when it came to the area of our house it made a slow left hand turn and began heading due west and i was staring directly at it and it then simply dissapeared. just gone, just like that. i was excited and told my girlfriend to come running but it was gone and she didn't see it. she believes me though. this is the first time i have seen something like this. nothing in this area moves like that and all the aircraft have landing and directional lights. all of them! except this thing. oh, there were no trees in the way of my view and it was a clear night with no clouds at all. there was no reason for it to dissapear. very strange.

was driving i looked out my side window, looking towards the east. i saw what looked to be a bright missle like object streak up and towards the west. i hit the breaks on the car and watched. the missle like object was leaving a bright trail (orange/gold in color). the trail was long, from the point that i first saw it, just above the horizon, and followed the object until it disappeared. this lasted approximately 4 seconds. when the objet disappeared immediately so did the trail.\r\nit traveled in a straight line going upwards in a slight angle heading west. \r\nmy first thought was that this was a missle, since i had seen similar when i was in the military, but the trail on this was nothing i have ever seen from any missle being fired. also there was no sound associated with this object. if a missle, i should have heard a rapport. the object looked like it came from the ground but i cannot be sure of that. due to the size of the trail (about 1/4\" wide from my viewing point, it seemed to be fairly close.

(ie: pick a spot on the sky hold your arm and hand out \r\nto mark it with your finger - then measure about 6\" from your \r\npointing finger away from the original spot)\r\n\r\nat one point it completely faded out, and faded back in \r\nreappearing about another relative 6\" away - but almost instantly.  \r\nthis process was repeated intermittently a few times.  \r\n\r\nit travelled from high mid sky facing west (about 70 degrees from\r\nhorizon) to almost disappearing over the horizon within about a 30 \r\nminute period.\r\n\r\nwhen it began to get nearer to the horizon from my vantage point, the colors began to slowly (yet rapidly enough to notice) fade from whitish-amber to oranges, reds, and randomly between these colors.\r\n\r\ni'm hoping there will turn up some other reports and hopefully\r\nfootage from others.\r\n\r\ni'm going to try and post this on some of the other\r\nufo sighting reports websites.\r\n\r\ni'm currently downloading video footage from my digital\r\ncamera.  it was at night w/ a consumer camera - so i'm not \r\nhopeful... especially after seeing the still image.\r\n\r\ni'll attach the untouched still that i took once it was near the\r\nhorizon and flashing colors.  of course it's night with no\r\ntripod - so it's the typical snakey/curly light trails pic - ie:\r\nuseless.  [descrip: there is grass/field at bottom, then telephone \r\npole... and the orangy/reddy light trail thing is what resulted \r\nfrom the camera when aimed at the color changing sphere on the \r\nhorizon]\r\n\r\ni mainly wanted to log this so when other reports turn up, it will \r\nbe good to have for cross referencing.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":13182,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.3343079,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10232008-0005","longitude":-79.5230877,"occurred":1224725580000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball,  Flash,  Sphere,  Star-like,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1224725580000,"summary":"\"light\" type sighting in central/southwest va, us -
