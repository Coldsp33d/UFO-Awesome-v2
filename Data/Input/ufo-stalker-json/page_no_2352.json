pm and we was watching tv. then we ear an small aeroplane flying abobe and low (cesna tipe) and we go outside to the terrace to see it. we see the plane with the position lights going from south east to north west. there was hight clouds and the sky looks yelowish because city lights. we stay looking at the plane until it was far away over the city buildings. then we saw two pair of tree circle lights appearing at the same altitude of the plane, from the right (north) going toward the plane. i realize about some facts that make me think these two objects was not planes or copters. in the first place the tree lights of each object were palid yelow an circular, two lights in the botton, and other in the top, like a triangle.  the lights of the objects were not flashing, like the cesna lights, and not red green like in a plane. more odd was that the object lights were perfec circles, not common lights with that you see with filaments (like the cesna lights). also the two objects were flying around the cessna right and left, and right, and the lights configuration never changed. if the lights were placed in wings the perspective would make change the triangle in the rotations, but in this case, the triangle have the same visual configuration, no matter wich movement the objects make, also them change direction too quick for a plane. the cessna plane looks not to realize the objects were there, or if the pilot see it, he not chage the course and follow straight. about two minutes after the objects appear they go away for the right (north). \r\nthe following days i was

moving and made no noise (at least no noise audible over the loud bus engine). it had four sides, but was more of a triangular shape. like a diamond, almost. there were five lights on it, four being bright white lights, one being a bright red. the craft itself was a dark color. the white lights were on the edges. there were 3 at what i assume was the back of the craft, one at the front tip, and the red light was in the center. well, naturally i locked my eyes on it. it wasn't moving, but the bus evidently was. the bus kept going, though if i could have stopped it i would have. we went down a

seminary in lincoln il. we were in the kaskaskia river bottom land, on a gravel road. my wife thought she saw something in the sky before we entered some trees by the river. i said, \"that must be a helicopter or an airplane.\" she said, \"that was no helicopter or an airplane!\" we crossed the wren bridge (a plank affair in those days) and up a steep bluff in our vw bug, past a farm house, then turned right on a road--actually, a dusty, two-wheel track. we were heading for the blacktop road to ramsey il, a tiny town on route 51 north of vandalia il and west of where we were. suddenly my wife yelled, \"what's that?!\"  i stopped the car and looked off to my left. there was a huge thing, the size of a big ranch house, floating in the air about 1/4 mile away. we stared at it and began to be afraid. \"what is that?\" she asked. \"i don't know,\" i said. we sat and watched it about 20 seconds. suddenly, it began moving toward us! we were terrified. i was frantically trying to get the vw in reverse, but in my panic i couldn't find reverse. she yelled, \"turn off the lights!\" i did. the thing stopped. it sat there slowly floating, maybe 400 yards away. it had transluscent things that looked sort of like windows, and a light would blink in one, then the next, going from left to right. both ends of the thing had a red glow. now i had a 35 mm camera that i had been using to do night photos of the moon, clouds, and other things. it was loaded and in the back seat, but in our panic, neither of us even thought of it until much later. we watched the thing for maybe a minute. it slowly tilted up away from us, and then went off to the west at about a 45 degree angle into the sky, silently and with tremendous speed. it disappeared in about a second. \"what was that?\" we kept asking each other. i put the vw in gear and went on down to the next turn, a left turn. just after turning left, my wife yelled, \"there it is again!\" i almost ran off the road. i stopped and we sat there and watched the thing for about 2 minutes. it was again back near where we had been. it floated there for a while, tilted up toward the west again, and sped off at great speed.  all the way back to lincoln il my wife kept watching the sky. i said, \"we've gotta tell someone.\" we ended up going by my major professor's house for my masters degree. he was up, studying. we knocked softly on his back door, and he came to the door. i said, \"we just saw a flying saucer.\" he invited us in and went and woke up his family--his wife and two daughters. they came and sat at the table. we sat at that table and recounted the whole story. his wife said, \"why don't you tell the police?\" i said, \"they don't know us; they'd just think we were a couple of wierdos.\" their kids, though young at the time, remember that night to this day.

maybe). no sound emanated from it. it stopped and hovered. we could not see any movement from the trees below (like propeller prop wash). the object must have been several meters long at minimum and a few meters thick, the shape of a fat piece of pie. no holes, bumps, etc. were visable. there may have been lines or shapes drawn on it.  \r\n\r\nsuddenly, another object appeared (from around the ridge line) sort of like the first was playing snap the whip and pulled it along. it was a white faintly glowing sphere (smaller). it disappeared behind the triangular object. the objects (one now unseen) remained in place for at least one minute, maybe two.\r\n\r\nmy wife says it twinkled (i didn���t see this). then, in a flash, it backed up and around the ridgeline from where it came. we looked on hoping to see it again, when we caught a flash to our left. it reappeared where we���d previously seen it. again, only faster this time, it backtracked so quickly we could barely follow it. a few seconds later, we caught what we think was the object ���skipping��� towards the western horizon, turning right (northward) and shooting into another mountain range (across the valley). \r\n\r\nfor the record, we had taken about two sips each of wine up to that final point. we were never fearful ��� more like utterly amazed. while sorely tempted (sometimes we feel as if we are crawling out of our skins), we have told no one, including family, of the event. it has changed our opinions of ufo���s (we now watch the shows on tv), and have read more on the internet. \r\n\r\ni think it was a government project. she doesn���t know what to think. previously, in 2000, we witnessed another strange event from hawksbill (another mountain in the shenandoah national park). however, it paled in comparison ��� that time an object flying straight and level in a north to south direction that flared and trailed some sort of glowing material for a second or two). \r\n\r\nwe saw mufon on tv. i figured someone else may have reported a similar event on or about those dates somewhere near the park or in the valley. we will follow the mufon website in hopes of seeing something to the effect. thank you for your time and consideration. \r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

farther?","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13154,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4322615,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10212008-0026","longitude":-79.689615,"occurred":1224570000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1224570000000,"summary":"Large

star-like objects about 25-30 degrees up above tree line (about an inch at arm's length apart).  thought they were strange, not only for being so large, but it puzzled me that i didn't recognize what constellation they could be in... as i wondered, the smaller light on the right faded to nothing (in about 2-3 seconds), then the larger left one did the same.  the sky had some clouds that were white floating randomly across... thought perhaps a black one had passed in front, so i waited for a couple minutes while the other clouds moved across, and this was not the case... they were gone.  i call them the \"greensburg lights\" because that was the direction they were in from my house, and because their action was exactly like video taken of the phoenix lights in the way they faded out.

chasing it.\r\ni live in oxnard,calif. up the coast from los angeles on the way to santa barbara. at about 7:45 pm i stepped outside for a  smoke on the front lawn.My house faces to the east on the east side of the city.\r\ni looked up into the sky as i am prone to do because i am a sky watcher by nature.\r\ni glanced to the north and noticed an object flying from the northwest toward the southeast. from santa barbara/ventura direction toward l.A. area. it was dark out at this time so i couldn't make out the shape but i could see two lights on the craft.It was traveling at a very high rate of speed.\r\nthen i noticed that behind it at a short distance was another craft.This one had the typical aircraft lights on and also a strobe avoidance light.It was chasing the front craft. as they passed directly to the east of me,i could distinctly hear the jet engine at full throttle on the rear craft and knew it was a military jet. it didn't seem to be making any progress in catching up to the other craft. as they progressed southward the front craft veered back toward the west and the ocean. this would have been in the vicinity of nas point mugu maybe a little east/southeast over the santa monica mountain range.The chase plane matched the course.\r\nby this time, i am standing in the middle of my street to keep them in sight. i watched as they headed out over the ocean in the direction of the channel islands heading roughly toward catalina island. i then watched the rear  plane break off the pursuit and turn sharply northward flying off the coast in the direction of santa barbara.The other craft continued southwest over the ocean until i lost sight of the lights of the craft.\r\ni have no idea what i witnessed. i have seen this before when i lived on the gulf coast when dea or the coast guard would chase smugglers but this was different. what ever that military fighter was chasing it could not catch it.Not many planes that i know can out run a f-16. but this one did easily.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13148,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.2068348,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10212008-0020","longitude":-119.1717016,"occurred":1224557100000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1224557100000,"summary":"Military
