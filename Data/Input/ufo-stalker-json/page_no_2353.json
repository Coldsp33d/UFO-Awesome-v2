faces north/northwest to have a cigarette.  gazing east/northeast i observed a string of dark red lights in a boomerang formation travelling southeast to northwest.  the lights never changed formation leading me to speculate they were not individual objects but that they belonged to a singular object.  the light appeared to blink in a tip-to-tip sequence, alternating starting points.\r\n \r\n the object was occluded from my view after about 30 seconds due to a very large tree in my building courtyard, so i moved to the other side of the porch hoping that the object's path would allow it to be visible on the other side of the tree.  it unfortunately was not.\r\n\r\ni did however continue to gaze into the sky hoping maybe it would appear.  about 5 or 10 minutes after the initial sighting, i happened to look back in the direction i originally saw the object only to see it again or an identical object traveling in the same exact  path as the first object.  i would estimate this sighting was the same duration, my view being once again occluded by the large tree. this second object as it passed seemed to me to be followed by one or two aircraft.  whether these were jet or helicopter i am not certain.  \r\n  \r\ni am no aviation expert but having lived in this area for over two years i am quite accustomed to hearing and seeing commercial jets and private headed for lax or burbank pass over my building.  had this object been one of these judging from its size, it would have been extremely low and emitting very loud engine noise.  there was no discernible noise coming from these

noise i associated as a car with a flat tire. my daughters also heard the noise and others in my neighborhood but they all went back to sleep.\r\nthen i heard military jets flying very low. sounded something like the blue angels flying over my house. i got up and looked out the back door. it was cloudy but i thought i saw an oval shaped thing far up in the sky blinking around in a circle. multicolored, looked like a 1970's christmas tree topper. i went to get my glasses and looked back in the same place and it was gone. then over the tree tops i saw what looked like a flock of canadian geese flying over the tree tops. they had a blue glow around them and it seemed as if they had mirrored wings flapping. as they got closer i could see it was not birds. the thing was flying very low, and slowly, silent, just above the tree tops. i stared for a few seconds when i realized it was not birds it scared me so i shut the door. \r\na few seconds later i opened the door again and it was hovering over my garage.\r\nabout 20 feet away and about 100 (maybe 200) or so feet in the air above my garage. i am not good with estimating measurments but it was very close.\r\ni saw a lot of detail on this thing. it was about half an acre in size based on the lots in my neighborhhod. a hovering v-shaped warehouse. amazing. as it hovered, i felt as if it were showing off, like \"hey i see you, look at me\". it was incredible. beautiful.\r\ni stared for a good 5 minutes. awe struck with fear. i can describe this thing in good detail if anyone is interested. if this is some kind of aurora secret plane, our military thing, thy should be proud and tell the world. if our government made this thing, you should be proud.  it was incredible. words can not describe what i saw. it was a v formation of lights flickering like mirrored birds. they was a triangle shaped platform above the orbs but they were not connected to it. it was completely silent as i remember but maybe a low hum or whirl noise. it was beautiful. heavenly. so bright i could barely look at it. i will never forget october 10, 2008 4:50 am as long as i am on this earth. i live about 2 city blocks from llyod expressway and about a half mile from i 164 on the eastside of evansville. this thing was flying to the southwest very slow and low. it looked like it would have came from chandler/newburgh area, flew over the east side, then maybe crossed old newburgh road after it left my house and went over the river in the direction of henderson.\r\nif anyone else saw something that looked liked blue glowing canada geese flying in formation or a v-shape object or a blue/gray triangle flying over i 164 or the lloyd expressway on friday oct. 10 4:30-4:50 am, please tell mufon. if anyone else in plaza meadows subdivision saw it, please tell mufon so i know. strange to think i am the only person who saw this. the neighbors i spoke to heard the loud bangs and the military jets but they did not look outside. please contact jerry sievers from vincennes mufon if you saw anything on friday october 10, 2008 about 4:30 am . thanks.\r\n","distance":"21-100

(sorry, i don't know astronomy so i don't know which stars. according to a constellation map i looked at, they could have been the two lower stars in the great square of pegasus.) it lasted only a second or two. \r\n\r\nas far as distance, the only way i can explain it is this:  if i hold my hands above my head at the same spot where i saw this flash, the distance between my hands would be about two feet.\r\n\r\nthe light was very bright, much like that given off by a sparkler. it did not resemble a meteor at all, especially because it maintained a horizontal course and did not arc or bobble. \r\n\r\ni associated its sudden appearance and disappearance with acceleration. it reminded me of all the sci-fi movies i've seen where the captain orders warp speed, leaving only a flash of the ship behind before its sudden disappearance.\r\n\r\ni immediately telephoned my neighbor, who is a member of the local mufon chapter. she interviewed me, asking very specific questions, about what i had seen. she believed it was a ufo.\r\n\r\nmy first reaction to the sighting was bewilderment.

astronomy. i was showing my buddy the constellations in the sky. as we were looking at the constellations we began to identify moving lights. we saw satellites traveling across the sky as they appeared as \"non-twinkling\" star sized lights. we also identified airplanes which always seemed to have some type of blinking red beacon light. we knew they were planes because we could hear the sound of the engines finally reaching us. as we continued looking at constellations in the sky, we then noticed a light far away moving toward us. thinking nothing of it, we were trying to think of what kind of plane it might be. as the light got closer, we noticed it didn't appear to make any sound like we heard with previous planes. we began to anticipate the sound to reach us at any moment. as the light moved closer and closer the light started to get bigger. i then realized this object didn't have any blinking lights on it like the planes we identified previously. it was a surreal moment. as it flew over us, we were struck with awe. the best way i can describe it was that it was shaped like a boomerang and was probably about 50 yards wide. i would guess that it was probably flying at about 150 to 200 feet above us and moving at about 40 mph. it didn't make any unusual movements or aerobatics. it just flew in what appears to be a straight path. the object was emitting a white bright light from the entire surface of its body as if it was one whole light. the light was very similar to quality of light a full moon would produce, but strangely, it didn't light up anything as a full moon would do on a clear night. and i thought i was hearing a very low sound coming from it, almost bordering the lower limit of my hearing range, but wasn't sure. it continued to fly over us and off in the distance. we lost visual contact with it because of the near by houses. we both looked at each other in disbelief. we later went down to a small valley area called \"ogle tree gap\" which was near my house where we could continued to view constellations. on our way to ogle tree gap, we kept wondering if it was some type of experimental craft from ft. hood, which was a near by military base. but as we got there about 15 min later after the event, we noticed about a dozen helicopters flying around in formation with search lights on. we then immediately left and went home and called it a night. the next day i was hoping to find something in the local paper or on the news about what we both had experienced to kind of clarify out thoughts. i found nothing. i haven't spoke about this in over 10 years until recently. i have searched for the object since then on the internet. even stories but i have found nothing at this point that is identical to what i experienced.
