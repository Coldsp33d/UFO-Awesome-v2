my 1981 camaro and i was driving. we got to u.S. 37 after driving through the amish country side on doty road. it was still daylight at this time and the sun was just starting to set and was casting an orange overcast on the clouds. we went under the first underpass and traffic was moving slow, about 35 mph. just shortly after we passed the overpass i noticed a glimmer out the corner of my eye. this would be out the driver side window, about 2,000 ft away or so. at this time the wal-mart and everything on that side of the road was not there. i turned my head to look and see what it was and after a couple glances over, from driving the car and looking at this glimmering, my eyes focused and to my surprise there was a spacecraft. it was obvious, the orange of the sun on the bottom and the reflection of the clouds and blue sky on the top. i immediately, turned back to my friend and screamed, \"it's a real ufo!, it's a real ufo!, oh my god!, look! look!\". she then replied, \"oh god, your right! i thought i would never see another one again!*\". i continued to glance over to the object and back at the road and between glaces it disappeared. i looked to my friend and said, \"where did it go? it's gone!\". she then said, \"no, it's above us!\". i then moved forward, then to the side, looking out the windshield and driver side window, then i said, \"i can't see it!\". right at that moment it pulled slightly ahead of us. i could then see the nose of this thing and the sides of it stuck out about a foot and a half on either side of the camaro. the nose was shaped to what reminded me of a dolphins nose. i did not feel threatened in any way and was amazingly calm. i tried slightly swerving to the left and then to the right and it stayed perfectly positioned above us with a 1 sec delay. i sped up and slowed down and it did the same with a slight delay. i looked up out the window and could see my reflection on the bottom of it. it was perfect, like chrome, but better. it had no wings, seams, visible propulsion, windows, lights, or antennas. it didn't even have a place for a door. it was about 4 to 4 1/2ft from the top of the car. it made no sounds, not even air rumbling or any other kind. it did not interfere with the radio or the engine. we had no missing time, it flew above us for about 15 minutes. when we got to the curve going left in the road, it broke away from us and kept flying straight the went up and over the trees. when it did this, it was so incredibly graceful. it was almost as if it was on an invisible track, like when a roller coaster goes over a hill. when i seen this i knew immediately that it was not from earth, honestly, it was too nice looking. this vessel was about 15-20ft long about 10-12ft at it's widest point it was shaped sort of like a nerf football. it looked strikingly like the alien spacecraft on disney's, \"flight of the navigator\", only it didn't have the humps, it was smooth all the way around, the nose was different, and it was perfectly reflective.

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"At the time of the incident, i was a sophomore in high school. i have visited the specific site of the occurrence and looked for some clue that does not exist. over the years, i did reconfirm this incident with my mother and father and with a neighbor (described below). \r\n\r\nwe were visiting my grandparents home 3-4 miles outside the village of gnadenhutten, ohio (tuscarawas county). it was a late summer (1961) evening, i went outside into the driveway to start my father���s car, (15 years old and looking for any excuse to start the car) in preparation to leave on our 25 minute trip back into town.\r\n\r\ni noticed what appeared to be a large (10���-20���) fire in his woods across the road from the house (400-500 yard distance) slightly uphill and beyond a creek. i knew the area well, as, i hunted this entire 250 acre farm. \r\n\r\ni immediately reported the fire to my grandfather when returning to the farmhouse, he was concerned about the spread of a potential forest fire, so, several of us proceeded to the side porch to verify the position. the fire did not appear to be spreading, and, he assumed some dear hunters were camping in his woods, however, he called a couple neighbors, to verify the location and get their opinions.\r\n\r\nwithin 5-10 minutes we noticed what initially appeared to be a spread of the fire along the woods floor moving from our left to right and following the contour below the ridge of the hill. this was strange, as, the previous location of the fire was not burning. the fire was moving at an angle closer to our position when one of us noticed this was caused by a pulsating light (red some yellow mixed with white) coming down from above, not a fire.\r\n\r\nthe reality that something was emitting a light strong enough to make the floor of the woods appear to be on fire took a few minutes to sink in. we all noticed an additional hazy light source in a band encircling the craft that was suspended or flying over the treetops. this thing was moving about 50-100 feet per minute. \r\n\r\nthe one very unusual thing was the lack of any sound, in fact, the only sounds were the normal night creatures from this wooded farm area. this is significant in that this entire occurrence took place in a narrow (maybe 600 yards wide) valley surrounded by 250-300 foot hills. \r\n\r\nwe all watched in total shock as we could more clearly see the shape of the unit as it approached us to within 250-300 yards. it was silhouetted against the hill and the trees were dark, so, the only light source was from within the craft, in a band around the center section and the light from the bottom. my best guess is that the craft was wider than my grandfather���s two-story farmhouse, and, ��� as high. \r\n\r\nat its closest point we could more clearly see the light shinning down through the treetops as a wavy but concentrated shaft of light all the way to the floor of the woods. the tree branches and leaves were visible under this somewhat blinding (high intensity) light. \r\n\r\nwhen the unit moved beyond the woods it was suspended approximately 150- 200 feet over a hay field and the shaft of light was not so apparent, however, it began to angle (about 45 degrees) itself skyward and with ever increasing speed soon (less than 10 seconds) became a distant white spot, before vanishing in the night sky. the bottom of the unit, when changing attitude was multi colored but mostly reds to orange mixed with some white.\r\n\r\ntwo families of neighbors witnessed this occurrence as my grandfather called both to question what they saw. everyone agreed this was unexplainable, and, we should not tell this story, to avoid redicule from others.\r\n\r\neveryone in my family is gone, however, my sister (she was 11 at the time) does remember that some thing happened but not any details. last year, i asked one of the neighbor boys if he recalled the incident and he was stunned that i would mention that evening. he confirmed, he saw this unexplainable occurrence but he was at an angle to witness the event more from an end position, whereby, the craft was moving toward their family before leaving the woods. his family porch would be ��� mile to the right of my grandfathers as we viewed this craft moving from left to right and the point of departure was a little right of center from our porch position.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

Canyon","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" a friend and i were driving eastbound on us60 between kings ranch rd and peralta trail. off to the south east we observed a mid-air smoke circle and line of smoke through the circle. very high, maybe 10,000'- 15'000', could have been a meteorite breaking up over the desert. but a later event in the day made me reconsider this. the entire sky was cloud free and a very gentle breeze allowed the plume to be visible for sometime, which made me believe it was rather large. as i was driving i could not focus on it very long but my friend was very aware of it as he was in the passenger seat on the side of the smoke. he was the one whom noticed it. we both do not wear glasses for corrected vision. i have noticed this type of object before on two other ocassions.\r\n then later in the afternoon at approximatly 2:45pm i was again traveling eastbound on us60 between idaho rd and tomahawk rd when i noticed a very fast moving cigar shaped very bright object moving from superstition mountain towards the south, about 1.5 - 2 miles from where i was situated. i would state that it was approx 150'- 200' feet in length/diameter at it's largest. it appeared to change shape from cigar shape to a disc to a very condensed point twice, then it disappeared. it was slowly steadily climbing in altitude and at about 1,500' - 6,000' and cruising steadily at about 300+ mph. i did note the bright sunlight and thought that it might have been the sun glinting off of the object that made it appear to change shape, but as i watched it i discounted that and definitly saw it change shape before i lost it. it was again changing shape to a point when i lost it. i did not see any wings nor stabilizer and observed it for about 15 seconds total. it maintained a steady brightness unlike sunlight shining off it. i am aware of williams gateway airport in this area and this did not appear to be a typical military or civilian aircraft. after i came home i called my friend that was with me ealier in the day and he reflected on the earlier smokeplume when i explained to him what i had seen. that made us think maybe they were connected possibly.

to stargaze and last night was no excetion, it was me my father in law and a long time friend, we went out specically to look for ufo's as we've seen them before and beleive there is a upswing in sightings, when we all looked up we immediatly saw two stars that seemed to move then one became much brighter than all the stars in the sky then it decended almost to the ground, mind you we were far away from what we saw but it was a very dramatic drop then it gained altitude at near split second speed passed where we first saw it then it went to a little bunch of stars and kind of hid among them but we continued to watch it for about 20 minutes as that one  seemed to be watching us the other one was cruising around the sky darting about in random patterns moving like something other than conventioal aircraft, after a few seconds maybe 20 to 30 seconda then dissappeared after that we focused on the first, then we saw 5 more racing across the sky going south towards the patch of stars that the first one was camoflaged in then the first star or whatever they were joined the rest of the lights that was passing by and they all flew off towards the south together, now what we saw was pretty incredible but not surprising as we here in merced see this type of action almost every night and feel that any true investigator will have no problem filming them as i have a digital camera, these things are to high for my camera to pick up but whatever it is it sure seems to be taking a closer look at us or are getting very comfortable","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

friends staying with me.It was late.It was dark.I dont remrmber a whole lot about it,but i remember me and one freind looking up and seeing the object in the sky.I dont remember hearing any noise from it,it seemed to hover,it was hard to tell how far away it was,but i dont think it was more than a couple of hundred yards away.I dont remember it flying off.Ijust remember looking at it in the sky.Idont think me and my freind talked a whole lot about it,but when we were in high school i mentioned it to him at a party and he confirmed that he remembred seeing it to .After high school i didnt see much of the freind.He went to college upstate and eventually became a doctor and now resides in san antonio.Its been a long time since i talked to him but iknow what i saw and im sure he remembers seeing it also.Im not saying what we seen was a ship with alien beings flying in it.Im just saying i know what i saw was not conventional or from the military. even with the technological advances man has made since then,what we saw was not conventional then or now or even in the near future.I really just want,whoever takes these kind of things serious to know what was or still is out there,because i think everyone on this planet needs to know the
