that passed by us on the boardwalk in ocean city, md last night... i don't know who to contact about this, so, i just googled the word \"sightings\" and found your website and figured it was a good place to start... i never had anything like this happen to me in my entire life, and i can't make this stuff up. my husband and i drove down to ocean city, md on the morning of oct. 14, 2008 for a little day trip to make up for lousy weather we had there a couple of weeks ago during our anniversary vacation... anyway, at around 6pm we went into phillip's seafood house(near 12th and boardwalk)  we finished our supper around 7pm and were walking slowly on the boardwalk back to our car on 10th street to return to pennsylvania.  i was looking out to the ocean and noticed how beautiful the clear sky was and that the full moon was so bright and really lit up the night sky since there were no clouds to be seen.... when off in the distance just over the ocean's horizon, i saw what looked to be a plane burst into orange fire, but in slow motion. it only illuminated for a few seconds and faded back into the night sky... then, a few minutes later in another area i saw it happen again, only further away... i kept pointing to the sky and saying to my husband, \"did you just see that?\" and he did... and a couple that passed by came up to us and said. \"i saw you pointing to the sky, tell me you just saw that and we aren't crazy. i thought it was a plane on fire\"  and we both told them that we had seen it... the strange orange glowy light popped up about a half-dozen more times within about 10 minutes... now we were all watching this weird event closer... the lady that was with the man that who asked us if we had seen it called the ocean city police right away, but they shoved it off and said it was probably navy maneuvers...  then, out of no where off in the distance that faint orange burny-glowy light shined again, but this time it was accompanied by 4 additional lights in a row... it really kind of looked like the phoenix lights, like the 5 lights were part of the outside ring of a disk... only orange and it didn't last long... and it didn't really move to much, it just appeared, rotated and then faded away... we got really creeped out and left right away...The entire four hours driving home we didn't say a word to eachother...  i couldn't sleep all night long because of this little episode... i'm scared...Was it the navy? i did see two navy helicopters fly over the beach at around 2pm that afternoon... but there were no clouds in the sky, wouldn't we be able to track headlights from a plane or helicopter?  these just faded away... it was really creepy...","distance":"Over One

tent to sleep for the night at our family farm-site near the middle of north dakota. my dad had glanced up and behind him while lying down and said \"oh, look, the north star!\". i was tired and so did not sit up to see for myself for a couple of seconds. when i did, i immediately realized that what he thought was the north star was actually much larger, brighter and coming quickly towards us, so i said \"dad, it's coming at us!\" and was very alarmed. dad then grabbed his glasses and sat up to look. when he said \"oh, wow!\", my niece was intrigued and looked too. she was not as interested, so layed back down. dad and i sat quietly watching the object for a few seconds while contemplating what the object coming at us could possibly be. i ruled out any aircraft that i had ever seen, whether in person or photographs (i grew up watching the activity at air force bases in fargo, then grand forks, now duluth, mn - in addition to attending many airshows, perusing many aviation periodicals, and generally just being interested in aircraft). initially, due to the fast speed, large size, and intensely bright white light of the object in spite of the dusk condition of the sky, i decided it must be a meteor - probably a large one. i then became very afraid and sad because it seemed to me that based on the trajectory it would hit land within 20 miles of us - killing us and many for miles around. i was thinking to myself, \"great - i'm gonna die in a tent in the middle of nd...\". then i realized it was actually slowing down. when it kept slowing, i knew it wasn't a meteor, and started contemplating whether to retrieve my camera from the vehicle or not. this is the point  when dad asked if i had my camera handy, to which i lamented was in the truck. as a few more seconds passed and it was still slowing, i decided to get the camera and said \"well, if it's gonna do that, i'm going to get my camera!\", to which my dad said would be a good idea. i got up, unzipped the tent, jogged the 50' or so to the vehicle, opened the driver-side door, grabbed the camera, unzipped the case, and jogged 1/2-way back to the tent in order to get a good view of the ufo. i kept sight of the ufo minus standing and exiting the tent, and reaching into my vehicle. as i was nearing the vehicle, i could see the object was an enormous (size of a football stadium), round, bright white glowing \"ball\" with a silver/grey metallic-looking ring around. i would guess that when it was nearest to us, it was between 10-15,000' altitude, and between 5-20 miles to the northeast. what was most intriguing was that it emitted absolutely no sound, even though it had nearly stopped, and then started going straight east (and away from us). because it was quickly heading away from us, i needed to jog back toward the tent in order to get a clear view of the skies it was headed toward for any possibility of photographing it. it sped up, making it difficult to find in the viewfinder of my camera, but i was able to take two photos a second or two before it completely vanished. i immediately got back into the tent to show my dad the photos, which is when i noticed that my niece had fallen asleep in what must have been such a short amount of time. what also struck me then was that the entire sky was dark-black, though there was a hint of dusk when we first noticed the object. these two things, in addition to the ufo itself, seemed odd possibilities for an event that must have taken a minute or less. dad and i were so bewildered that we were awake for many hours afterward -

star. it twinkled a rainbow of hues very brightly. it was not the first time i have observed it in pretty much the same position, which was about forty degrees elevation, to the east south east, just above the neighbourhood treeline. last night though, through both binoculars and naked eye, the star was especially transfixing. i felt an enthrallment and felt unwilling to remove my gaze for several minutes. really a very soothing feeling, almost hypnotic, obviously very hard to describe; i was feeling quite a connection to this star! in my marvel i thought i saw the star wander to and fro, and even change altitude, but i couldnt be sure because these movements were slow, and i have no tripod setup of any sort. so still 'connected', i 'asked' for slightly more conclusive behaviour; i dont know what i was expecting, maybe a figure eight! there was no variation in activity for half a minute or so, but then the star brightened slightly before fading out to black over three seconds. i stayed out only for another five minutes or so, but i came out again about a half hour later to find the same light had returned, and now it was definitely wandering, with noticeable displacement. observed it off and on until about four am, when the the clouds rolled in. i am quite impressed, since until last night i had only suspected this object to be.. unidentifiably compelling. im certain i will see it again. mufon, ill let you know how my date goes tonight but i hope it wont be awkward if i bring my girlfriend :)","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

chair. a bank of fluffy scattered clouds began moving across the sky comming from the east and moving at a fairly good pace. i wathed them directly overhead and then noticed what i thought was an optical illusion. it seemed the stars that were visible in the breaks between the clouds were moving in the opposite direction of the cloud movement.  i thought \"what a cool illusion\" but then i realized that the \"stars\" were moving and in utter disbelief i checked this over and over again using fixed point references to my line of sight. i watched them pass the edge of the chair's headrest, pass the gutter edge of the roof. when i realized what i was seeing i jumped up from my chair and really wasn't sure what to do. i thought of waking my mother to witness this but decided to grab my video camera. i did try to tape some but it didn't look to me in the viewfinder that i was really getting anything too clear. finally i just pointed the thing towards the sky while keeping it steadied against the back of the chair and hoped for the best. there were dozens of them as far as i could tell, not blinking, not changing color, just looking very much like stars moving at a slow to moderate pace towards the east. i did observe one veer slightly more to the north at one point and this convinced me even further that it was not a trick of the eye. after about 8 to 10 minutes of this ( i must guess because i was feeling a bit freaked out and it's hard to judge time exactly) they dwindled out and stopped comming. i've been trying to convince myself for hours now that i didn't really see what i thought i saw, but it's not working. there was definately dozens of white objects on the move high in the sky. i hope i can find something on that

as if she was writing it. she also asked me to include my phone contact information.\r\n\r\nmy name is sherrie nichols. i am a registered nurse of over 35 years, and a former captain and flight nurse in the united states air force. i own my own business, srn inc., where i investigate medical fraud. it is imperative in my profession to have keen insight for even the smallest of details. whenever i experience something strange, i always inform my husband who conducts paranormal research, and we explore and discuss all of the details together. \r\n\r\nit was sunday night, 10-12-08, the last night of a family vacation to denver, co. the time was 10:05 and my husband and i were smoking a cigarette outside the front entrance of the hotel where we were staying on the west side of denver. the air temp. was rather cold with a thick overcast. i was looking northwest at the overcast when three, stop light bright yellow and round lights suddenly appeared. the lights were in a straight line spaced about 1 degree and evenly apart from each other. about 2 seconds later all three lights suddenly disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared. my husband in the past has shown me how to make a good determination of the size of an object from a relative postion. each light was about the size of an american quarter at arms length. i immediately informed my husband of what i had seen, and showed him in relationship to where we were standing where i had seen the lights. my husband informed me that there was hill in the direction of the lights with a long, flat plateau on the top with communication towers located on the hill and wonder if that was what i had seen through the overcast. he said that we would look into this the next morning when the sky and the visibility was supposed to be better.\r\n\r\nthe next morning after breakfast i joined my husband outside of the hotel's front entrance. the morning was gorgeous which allowed us to investigate my sighting further. there were communication towers on top of the plateau, but they were at least 7 to 8 degrees to the northeast of where i had seen the lights and at the end of a sharp decline of the hill into a valley. the top of the tallest tower from where i was standing was about 2 degrees above the plateau floor, whereas the lights were about 15 degrees above the plateau floor. this calculation is based on forming a fist with ones hand, turning the hand on its end with fingers facing left, then holding ones arm at arms length on a level plain with ones eye, while placing the bottom part of the hand on the horizon of the plateau to estimate the elevation......And then to calculate distance left to right, turn ones hand fingers down and measured from the first yellow light right to the first and tallest tower that was to the right.\r\n\r\nreport submitted and written for sherrie nichols by sandy nichols\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"Over One

father, and i happened to be looking up at the sky when i was doing it and saw a bright star light object moving slowly from north west to the south east. i had a recent experience with a similar object less than three months before, so i watched it, but did not bring it up to my father, who is skeptical of the phenomena. it was moving slowly, and had a steady yellowish glow to it. there were no strobes or navigation lights that i could see, although i could see several other strobes of aircraft in the same area (a few miles in the distance). the sky was perfectly clear and i could see lots of stars(my house is in a small town). after about 3-5 minutes, the object vanished. prior to it vanishing it was in my clear sight, about 40 degrees above horizon. it appeared to be the same type of light i had seen before in my previous report (08/05/2008 - benson, nc), and in the same area as the object i saw before (about 7-10 miles from where my house is).","distance":"Over One

on a dirt road in the middle of no where,  for about the last month.  i have to take the dirt road slow and careful because my bmw has a very low clearance.  it's not easy to get there in my vehicle so i have to be very determined to do so.  i have always been a sky watcher, and up until this sighting, all other sightings could have been possibly explained away as stars, planes, etc, but not this one.  i have never reported the other sightings to mufon neither.  however, this sighting was undeniably something else.  after taking my recyclables to the recyclable bin at apx 7:30 pm on october 9th 2008, i felt the need or a precognition to drive to this spot. i live about 20 mins from this spot in a small dell webb community, which is about 30 mins west of the valley of phoenix or what we like to refer as \"civilization\", there is nothing in between.  this spot is even further west from the valley, nestled behind some huge mountains, the white tank mountains.  i did notice on my way there, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and a got a strange feeling, i brushed it off as a draft of cool air.  night time was upon us and the back ground sky was pitch black.  while driving there, i actually missed the dirt road turn off, so i turned around and started driving back to the road.  that's when i seen the first reddish-orange \"orb\" appear, just like the ones i have been seeing over the last month.  but then to my amazement, a second one appeared, then a third, then a fourth.  the \"orbs\" were  equally separated & distanced apart in an arc formation.  i knew then it was something that could not be explained away, it was definitely something else.   after all four came into view they materialized or vanished.  the lights were apx. 1000-2000 ft away in the the northwest sky, noting, i am not too good at judging distances.  the \"orbs\" appeared probably a second or two after each other in this arc formation. after realizing what i was seeing i was in awe, slightly shocked and due to my human nature, somewhat frighted, so i kept driving all the way back home.  i noted the time was 7:49 pm and immediately called my one friend via cell phone to explain what i just witnessed.  \"baby steps\" is the feeling or impression i got from this experience.  just to back my credibility, i am highly educated with a ba in business, economics & environmental science, along with an executive mba.  i have owned a web development & marketing firm, a publishing company, and now, part owners in a pre-paid gift card company, cardvark, inc. www.Cardvarkgiftcards.Com\r\n\r\ni hope my story enlightens and intrigues you.  i am attaching a photoshop rendering i what i seen, all i had with me was my iphone, which does not take good night-time photos. \r\nthad j.","distance":"501 Feet - 1
