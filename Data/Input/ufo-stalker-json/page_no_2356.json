have decided to repost this report with all 3 photos: \r\nthe first photo was taken directly after seeing it approach from the east end (heading westward), the second photo was taken when object was more centrally aligned with my balcony, the third photo was taken as it sped off in the west direction, fading out of sight. feel free to publicly scrutinize, validate, and/or analyse these photos. \r\nnote:  i have mass emailed several copies of the 3 \"originals\" to various friends, family members, and acquaintances, should anything (mysterious) suddenly happen to me.\r\n\r\nhere is my original post: \r\n***i went out to my balcony to have a cigarette (i only smoke outside), then all of a sudden i saw this enormous object with flashing red and amber (?) coloured lights coming in the direction of my apartment building at a speed that must have been 6-8 times faster than i have ever seen any plane move. i quickly grabbed my hp digital camera (which i keep on a shelf right in front of my balcony door) and i captured the first photo of it (the best visual one), then i was waiting for it to pass this tree outside of my balcony to take another photo, but it seemed to slow down its speed and was taking a long time, so i captured the second photo of it through the tree (2nd best visual), then i went to take the 3rd photo and my camera's l.E.D. display read \"waiting for flash to recharge\", so during this time the object seemed to really speed up again (i yelled out loudly \"does anyone else see that?\", in attempt to get any neighbors outside at the time to look up) and was almost out of sight, but i aimed the camera in its direction and captured the 3rd photo (the least visual one) anyways.\r\n\r\ni felt so \"in awe\" of its presence during the flyover, my heart was racing... this object looked like something straight out of a high-budget sci-fi movie, but it was real, and above my head in the open sky! it looked sort of like a \"spiked orb\", but i am not sure if the \"spikes\" were just a projection from the bright lights, or were actual \"spikes\" protruding from the \"orb shaped\" object. i was so excited, i had to light up another cigarette immediately after finishing the one i had smoked during the ufo sighting.\r\n\r\ni \"uploaded the pictures\" to my computer as soon as i awoke the next morning (today, sunday oct. 12th/2008), as i was too shaken and excited to do it before sleeping, and i didn't want to accidentally \"delete\" or \"lose\" them in my excited state. surprisingly, the \"lights i had seen, didn't appear in either 3 of the photos, but the \"orb shape\" itself sure did!\r\n\r\ni am only going to upload the 2nd photo, the one with it partially obscured by the tree; but if anyone could steer me in the proper and secure method of submitting them for analysis (possibly at [u.W.O.] the university of western ontario?). this is a major event in my life, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. i often take pictures of the sky during the day, cloud formations, chem-trails, and planes (ok, the squirrels & chipmunks playing in the tree beside my balcony too... cuz they are cute!), but that is why i keep my hp photosmart e327 5.0 megapixel camera beside my balcony door. it's not that great of a camera, but it was on sale and i am only a \"beginner\" (amateur) photographer.\r\n\r\nthanks to any (and all) that can lend any type of support.***\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":13025,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.982668,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10132008-0001","longitude":-81.238318,"occurred":1223708400000,"potentialRelations":[13019],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

plane flying.  it's common to see jets flying south to land at newark airport.\r\n\r\nbut this \"jet\" wasn't flying south.  it was moving towards me (east).  as it got closer i saw it was not a jet.  i then believed for a second that it was a military aircraft.  it was shaped like a boomerang.\r\n\r\nthen it started to change shape, somewhat.  whatever this was became malleable.  at this time i knew it couldn't possibly be a jet.  no jet i know of bends and contorts.\r\n\r\nabout at this time-or maybe a few moments before--i noticed black circular objects trailing the larger boomerang.  these circular objects were also black, maybe numbering 3 or 4.\r\n\r\nthe boomerang object hovered for a few seconds over my building, before it--and the circular objects trailing it--continued in a northeastern direction, over my building.  \r\n\r\nthis would put the object right over the hudson river and new york city.  i'm certain that many others had to have witnessed this.\r\n\r\nas the objects left my view, additional circular objects rose from the south west.  there was no boomerang, just four circular objects.  they, too, moved in a northeastern fashion.\r\n\r\ni telephoned the west new york, nj police at 6:36 p.M. and told them that i was not crazy, but there were some very strange objects flying overhead.  the desk person said he'd take my name and if anyone else reported it he could reference it.\r\n\r\njust as we were speaking, additional circle objects rose again from the southwest.  i told him what i was seeing and he said to get a camera.  i yelled for my roommate to get my camera.  i took a picture but the black circles were too far in the distance.  and they did not follow the same flight plan.  they moved north, not north east.  so i did not, unfortunately, get them on camera.\r\n\r\ni waited for additional objects, but then the sun light was gone.  \r\n\r\nwho knows what i witnessed?  of course, the logical brain says to myself that it \"must have\" been some type of balloons being released.  but balloons don't move or look like that.\r\n\r\none thing is for sure.  i will never take a ufo report lightly or dismiss anybody's report.  what i witnessed definitely was creepy.\r\n\r\nthe photo i took just shows you the area from where the objects originated, in the south west sky from my position at the hudson river, new york city/new jersey

1963-66.  it's been awhile.  anyway, my cousin mike and me had walked to the indoor swimming pole to go swimming for awhile.  we were supposed to be back home before it got dark but we stayed there longer than we should have.  when we did decide to start for home, we took a shortcut through the school yards.  it was already dark when we started for home.  we were on a path that ran beside the baseball field when we both noticed a strange feeling and the fact that it seemed way to quiet.  don't know why, but we both looked up at the same time and totally freaked out(that's an old term for being really scarred). all we could see was this very big round shaped thing with different colored lights all around it.  it was not making any noise and it seemed like it was almost close enough to touch.  it was so big that we couldn't even see the sky, only this thing!  it was just floating directly above us.  we were crying and screaming and running as fast as we could, neither of us looked up again.  we don't know how far we ran, although it seemed like not very far, when we ran into my older brother and my older cousin.  they had been sent to find us and bring us home. we were in big trouble.  they wanted to know why we were crying and screaming, so we told them.  my brother did not beleve us but my older cousin david did.  at least he said that it could be true.  we couldn't even remember going swimming or anything that night except what i just told you about.  all i remember prior to that is that i know that we were there to go swimming, and i assume that we did.\r\nmany years later, i was not certain if this had really happened, or if it was all just a dream.  as a young adult, i asked my cousin mike if he remembered anything weird that had happened to us when we were kids.  that's all that i said.  his reply was\"you mean that night that we went swimming and saw that thing above us?\"  that confirmed that it was real and that it was not a dream.  all of my

that?!?), and we thought it might have been a small plane that crashed ��� we were approaching west warwick ri, which is where tf greene airport is located. (as far as the airport goes ��� i travel this route often, mostly at night, and i am comfortably familiar with the planes that come and go from the airport. i have never witnessed anything that

went out to my balcony to have a cigarette (i only smoke outside), then all of a sudden i saw this enormous object with flashing red and amber (?) coloured lights coming in the direction of my apartment building at a speed that must have been 6-8 times faster than i have ever seen any plane move. i quickly grabbed my hp digital camera (which i keep on a shelf right in front of my balcony door) and i captured the first photo of it (the best visual one), then i was waiting for it to pass this tree outside of my balcony to take another photo, but it seemed to slow down its speed and was taking a long time, so i captured the second photo of it through the tree (2nd best visual), then i went to take the 3rd photo and my camera's l.E.D. display read \"waiting for flash to recharge\", so during this time the object seemed to really speed up again (i yelled out loudly \"does anyone else see that?\", in attempt to get any neighbors outside at the time to look up) and was almost out of sight, but i aimed the camera in its direction and captured the 3rd photo (the least visual one) anyways. \r\n\r\ni felt so \"in awe\" of its presence during the flyover, my heart was racing... this object looked like something straight out of a high-budget sci-fi movie, but it was real, and above my head in the open sky! it looked sort of like a \"spiked orb\", but i am not sure if the \"spikes\" were just a projection from the bright lights, or were actual \"spikes\" protruding from the \"orb shaped\" object. i was so excited, i had to light up another cigarette immediately after finishing the one i had smoked during the ufo sighting. \r\n\r\ni \"uploaded the pictures\" to my computer as soon as i awoke the next morning (today, sunday oct. 12th/2008), as i was too shaken and excited to do it before sleeping, and i didn't want to accidentally \"delete\" or \"lose\" them in my excited state. surprisingly, the \"lights i had seen, didn't appear in either 3 of the photos, but the \"orb shape\" itself sure did!\r\n\r\ni am only going to upload the 2nd photo, the one with it partially obscured by the tree; but if anyone could steer me in the proper and secure method of submitting them for analysis (possibly at [u.W.O.] the university of western ontario?). this is a major event in my life, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. i often take pictures of the sky during the day, cloud formations, chem-trails, and planes (ok, the squirrels & chipmunks playing in the tree beside my balcony too... cuz they are cute!), but that is why i keep my hp photosmart e327 5.0 megapixel camera beside my balcony door. it's not that great of a camera, but it was on sale and i am only a \"beginner\" (amateur) photographer.\r\n\r\nthanks to any (and all) that can lend any

hundreds over fort smith arkansas\r\n\r\nit was just after dusk on an august evening in 1967. the a.M. station that my sister and i listened to began to report lights in the skies over fort smith. of course i immediately ran out into the yard to see for myself. huge oak trees largely blocked the view and after a few minutes of surveying the patches of sky overhead i gave up. the reports continued to pour in and the disc jockey was at a fever pitch. i summoned my dad who listened for while, then i remember him laughing and saying that the station was playing a joke. at some point he began to take the reports somewhat seriously and we climbed into his ���46 plymouth and drove to a remote area known as wild cat mountain lake. it was wide open and afforded as much of a horizon-to-horizon view as anywhere in the fort smith area. we sat on the hood for a long time until i bored and climbed back in the car. almost immediately i heard my dad shout something and scampering back out found him pointing at two white lights moving slowly across the sky from east to west. they weren���t very bright and if they had not have been moving, would have easily blended in with the stars. they were traveling side by side, about two fingers apart at arm���s length. when they were almost directly overhead they suddenly made opposite 90-degree turns and quickly accelerated out of sight. shortly after, a solitary light, much brighter, tracked across the sky at a tremendous rate of speed. it took probably less than 15 seconds to traverse the sky from the east to the west horizon. we sped back home to find several of our neighbors in lawn chairs ��� in the street! the next three to four hours we watched an amazing display. as time went on the lights came in at lower altitudes and glowed the spectrum from white to orange, with the intensity (brightness) increasing as they became more orange. as i recall, they would glow brightest when hovering. at their closest and brightest, they were perhaps one-third the size of a full moon. i can���t estimate the altitud e, but at one point i did contemplate fetching my bb gun and taking a pot shot. so, bad idea aside they did come in very low. they would fly in formations of two or three, stop suddenly, hover, make impossible turns, and accelerate out of sight in seconds. it was almost as though it were choreographed for the benefit of the crowd below. at one point when a single object hovered directly overhead, i was able to observe it at length through a powerful pair of binoculars offered by a neighbor. it was more or less triangular shaped, not sharply, but more like a guitar pick. i���ve heard descriptions of spheres and chevrons being seen that night, but that was not what i was looking at. if those other accounts are accurate then there was either more than one type of object or the shape was not static. this thing appeared to glow from within, like an old christmas tree light bulb and there was some sort of structure resembling a grid or a checkerboard on the underside. at least one television station and a radio station were broadcasting live from the parking lot of the coca-cola bottling plant, less than a mile west of the fort smith airport which shares a common runway with the 188th fighter wing, known at the time as the 188th tactical reconnaissance group. both the airport and the air guard are in virtual line of sight of the parking lot and it was thought curious that no jets were scrambled during that evening, more so as antidotal evidence surfaced in the following days that the objects had been painted on radar. someone had a transistor radio out on the street that night and we could hear the crowd reacting on the live broadcast as the objects ���performed��� so we could be certain that we were seeing the same objects as those at the bottling plant parking lot, which was approximately 2 miles from our location. the next morning the southwest times record ran a front-page story on the sightings, complete with a low-resolution jerky black and white time exposure that to this day still ranks as the worst! ufo pho to i���ve ever seen. needless to say, the town and the media were abuzz. a couple of days later the air force out of little rock released a statement, to the amusement of those who had not seen the objects, explaining away the entire incident as swamp gas. there are two things i can say with certainty about the objects i witnessed: 1) they were solid objects, not gaseous and 2) they were controlled (flying in formation, etc). the speed and maneuverability that these objects soundlessly displayed, is still exponentially greater than any technology even today, almost 40 years later. i would love to hear from others that were witness to the phenomenon that night in 1967. my dad, the neighbor with the binoculars and i���m sure many others are no longer with us. let���s not let this story die as well. i'm guessing at the date based upon other reports, so if you are certain of the exact date please post.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned

extremely slowly upwards. we both dashed out onto the terrace to see them a bit better. there was no noise from them. \r\nwe are used to seeing helicopters, military aircraft and commercial aircraft around here and therfore know generally what we are looking at. this night there was a slight haze, but could see the stars and moon easily.\r\neach object had 3 amber lights forming a triangle. my daughter thinks that one of them has a red flashing light. they were not exactly very large, but they were the brightest and biggest lights i have eveer seen in the sky.\r\none was slightly ahead of the other two, but they formed a vague line going from the horizon towards the atmosphere. the first one disappeared suddenly after about a minute and the second one swerved a couple of times ie. it did not go straight like the first one. gradually the remaining two went up into the atmosphere (not across the sky) and suddenly dissaperared. this was the confusing bit, as, if they had gone across the sky i might have thought they were a weird military aircraft, but as they went straight up like rockets, this was not a usual sighting.\r\nbeing a ufo sceptic, i was not frightened thinking that there must be a logical explanation the the sighting. i have been on the internet all morning trying to find out if there was a reason for this, but up to now i cannot find anything. i would take any
