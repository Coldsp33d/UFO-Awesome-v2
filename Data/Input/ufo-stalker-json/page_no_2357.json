(note: the line appeared\r\nall at once.. not from one end growing to the other).. when the lite flashed.. a star\r\ncame out of the east end of the line and continued east... very interesting..\r\n\r\nrecap:\r\n10-8-08 (nitetime)\r\nonce again...I saw atleast 10 more... but tonight was significant..\r\ntonight i feel that whatever it is im seeing has acknowledged that\r\nim watching them.. while facing east..I was watching another star\r\nin the north/east moving south over houston.. as it passed a few\r\nmiles south of 1-10 south/east of my position.. it stoped and made\r\na left hand u-turn.. then gained altitude as it started to head north\r\neast then stopped completley...Hovered around unsteadily.. i stuck\r\nmy head in the back door and called for my wife to come out and see\r\nthis one...She came out.. and as we were watching it for a minute ..\r\nout of the east an orange-ish sparkling lite headed west about\r\n300 - 400 ft off the ground came directly over our house at about 50 mph...\r\nit made no sound at all.. it was just cruisin west... almost all the others\r\nthat i have been watching (approx 70 in the last 4 weeks) appear to be\r\nwell above 30,000 ft.. but this one was very low and came right at us..\r\nright over my house.. to me it seemed to be an acknowledgment..\r\nwhy all of the sudden so low and right over my house.. while im watching\r\none of them in another part of the sky..?\r\n\r\ndue to this low flybye over my house..\r\ni think they somehow know i see them..\r\ni think they wanted me to know that they know..\r\n\r\nlately i have wondered if i was special because of what i see that others dont..\r\ni am not... i think its simply because i looked to see.. look up and see the truth..!!\r\n\r\nhow i find them in the sky:\r\nits really very easy.. all i do is look up in the sky.. in sections systematicly..\r\n(imagine a grid of rectangles or squares).. i focus on groups of stars at once..\r\npaying attention to their fixed postions relative to each other and look for moving\r\nobjects against a fixed background of stars in each grid/section.. i focus on the fainter\r\nstars in each grid to adjust my eyes to see more lite.. ussually \"they\" are easy to see..\r\nbut some are very faint.. i dont want to miss those.. i have noticed i have gotten\r\nbetter at finding them in the sky as time goes on and look at bigger sections of sky\r\nat one time now.. i know what im looking for now..\r\n\r\nhopefully this will help others see what i see....\r\ni havent reported this to anyone officially.. they will think im crazy..\r\nmaybe if others can also see.. we can come together as a group..\r\nand discuss what to do next... how or if we should disclose this

and had coffee at starbucks.  it was around 9:30 p.M. on friday october 10th.  i was on hershel avenue in hyde park when i looked ahead and noticed three orange and red balls of fire in the sky.  then i saw another one trailing the first three.  i told my girlfriend what is that up in the sky?  she said that is odd.  the another one came over the car followed by another moving from the east to the west at a good clip and a say about 15 thousand feet in the sky.  \r\n\r\ni stopped the car in the road as nobody was behind us.  there were a few cars coming the other way but they just past on the other side of my car.  we got out of the car and looked up and saw more of these balls of fire pass over my car.  there was no noise so they couldn't be an airplane or a hilicopter.  we got back into the car and drove to her apartment which is less than a mile from where we saw the lights.  as we drove west we could still see the lights in the sky going due west but as we got to her apartment the light disapeared in sky or they were out of sight. the lights followed each other.  there may have been a cluster of three or four but then there were several in session.  they headed off to the west but then curved off to the north west before going out of sight.\r\n\r\nafter getting back to her apartment i parked the car and we both go out of the car and went towards the street.  i looked into the east sky and saw one more coming right at us.  there look there is another one i said but not as bright in color.  sure enough it was the same thing we saw on hershel avenue.  we both watched it but the red glow started to fade as it got closer to us.  almost right in front of us in the south east sky it disapeared from sight. again there was no sound\r\n\r\ntwo people were walking down the street and i asked them if they saw anything in the clear skys.  they listen to our story but said they never seen anything but they would look in the sky on their way home.  my girlfriend adn i went in her apartment and made some phone calls to local tv news stations but again nobody called anything of that nature into the stations.  then we called the local newspaper and no luck then we call lunken airport but we didn't call the tower just a local airline that said they hadn't had any reports of unusual sightings in the sky.\r\n\r\nsaturday october 11th i check the local news and newspapers and there was nothing about the sightings.  then i checked the internet and nothing.  when i got home on friday night i thought many it may have been a meteor or a comet burining off in the earths atmosphere.  not sure but you would think somebody would have saw something.\r\n\r\nwhen i got to work today one of my employees said they were driving home last night on i 71 going north when he saw the object i was talking about in my experience the night before.  he said the object was red or orange looked like a ball in the sky and when straight down and disappeared.  he had his son in the car and his son saw the same thing and was shocked.\r\n\r\nso it looks like one person saw whatever it was.

difficulty since it was extremely cloudy.  although earlier in the night i had noticed the moon and knew it wasn't that close to the horizon.  luckily, the clouds became patchy and i was able to see that it was clearly not the moon.  the object continued to move about, shining down this blue beam.  when it was closer to the horizon, what i believe to be the craft was round and circular.  after watching it for a couple of minutes it disappeared.  strange, i thought.  then i looked in my rear view mirror and it was behind me.  not directly overhead, but behind me a ways.  at this point, the craft was more of an oval shape.  it darted around in sweeping motions, always emitting the blue beam.  it stayed behind me for a couple of minutes and then disappeared.  at first i was astonished to have seen it, then as it changed direction and was overhead, my instinctual reaction was fear.  i started shaking and my knees went weak, though i generally do not fear the possibility of

out of nowhere a saucer shaped craft materialized in front of us about 100ft above and about300yards away from us and flew very slowly allowing both of us to see it very clearly it flew towards the west and approached a low flying helicopter and the lighting was clear allowing us the best view possible if i had a camera it would have been the clearest photo ever printed it was that close then we wondered if the helicopter saw it and as the saucer was about 500 or so yards from the copter it just accelerated up over the copter and sort of just dissappeared before it reached the horizon, i didn't report it before as i didn't no where to report such a thing the is there are alot of sightings hereand we have a non-active air force base here named castle and as a kid i lived near the base and always saw unexplainable objects near or above the base airspace, now this happened about 5 yrs ago but the last two nights me my son and a friend all witnessed these strange star like objects that moved at unbelieveable speed there were two on the 9th 2 days ago and then last night we saw two more but this time they actully crossed paths like on a grid and one of them was much brighter than the other and after a couple of seconds the bright one dimmed to the brightness of the other and shot striaght up towards the moon and then we lost sight of them, this is my fist time reporting but be sure now that i've found mufon i will certainly report all promply. the suacer was incredible though , silver shiny big bright lights on bottom of craft turning counter clockwise with no sound or exaust that was visible. i am a artist and can clearly draw the thing we saw but do not know how to post on computer, a little computer illiterate, so sorry","distance":"501 Feet - 1

right hand side, i noticed three lights, out my front window, above the 2 story shopping center. i had just past beltline road, which runs perpendicular to coit road. thinking it might have been headlights, or a reflection of light on my front windshield glass, i looked away to watch the road, to deter any accidents. then, looking up again, i saw the 3 lights again, and noticed that they disappeared behind the 11, or so story compass bank building, thereby resulting in my deduction, that these were not a reflection in my window. i also heard no helicopter sounds, nor plane engines (propeller and jet).\r\n\r\nthe lights were in a straight line, traveling in unison, equidistant apart. as coit road runs north, the 3 lights seemed to be moving north-west. the line they were in seemed to be a slight verticle angle, with the north end higher than the rear.\r\n\r\nthe lights were not blinking. they did not vary in color, nor have any color, such as red, or blue, or green or yellow. i would describe their source as incandescent. not led, or white...But somewhat warm. they did not vary in size, but were consistent with each other. their size seemed to be that of what a plane would have. however, lacking the ability to determine the distance of the object due to no physical structure of the object, i can not give a size of the object themselves.\r\n\r\nas the lights traveled north-west, a forth light appeared, as if behind the middle light, resulting in a box formation, as if to suggest the lights were the underside of a plane or something. they continued to stay in formation, and moved in their direction, with the angle of the lights askewing more and more, once again reaffirming my observation of the lights were affixed to the bottom of the craft. \r\n\r\ni did not feel scared, nor did i notice any radio interference, or light interference. i felt a little excited, as any individual would when seeing something that they could not put the words 'airplane' or 'helicopter' to. i kept thinking to myself \"what the hell is that.\" i did not notice any other drivers trying to the observe the object, because i happened to be too busy watching it myself. as i kept driving, the object kept heading north-west, and out of view. coming home, i told my girlfriend of my observation, and saw nothing on the news, internet, or local newspapers. the day after, i continued to search, but found nothing to my avail.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

about 5 miles of the naval air station base (formerly carswell afb and before that,the famous fort worth air field to which the debris from the roswell crash was flown to and the famous pics of jesse marcel and the \"weather balloon\" were foisted on the public).\r\n\r\nto that i have to add that i am also real close to highway 377 south which leads to first granbury, then on to stephenville.\r\n\r\nliving as close to the base as i have for a coupla decades, i am very familiar with the planes that are almost always in the sky around here. from my back yard at night there is hardly a moment when yoy cant see a plane in the sky.\r\n\r\nwednesday night i was preparing the hot tub and fireplace for a little family r&r. promptly at 8pm after getting all things in place i sat down in a handy lawn chair and put my feet up on the the brick ledge of the tub and leaned back to take in the sky a little.\r\n\r\nas soon as i looked up, a point of light emerged from behind the leaves of a large tree in our yard. it was very high in altitude much like a commercial jet at about 35,000 feet or so. it was bout 35 degrees from the horizon, and i was looking due east which would put it travelling northward.\r\nbut make no mistake about it, this was no jet. for one thing, even as far away as it was it was easy to see that the object was spherical in shape and very luminescent, as though lit internally rather than reflecting any available sunlight. it seemed to glow a rich golden color. there were no flashing or different color lights. it did not appear to be traveling on an arc similar to the earth as a plane would, but was doing the opposite......Slowly arcing upwards and fading and growing smaller at an amazing rate. i knocked on my daughters window and told her to come out. by the time she got outside, the object had disappeared outward.....It just went into space. the entire sighting lasted about7 to 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nthis is the third such object i have seen just like this in the last several years. the first time i saw one of these was on the 377 hiway heading into fort worth from granbury late at night. at first i saw strange red, blue, yellow and greenish lights illumintating the sides of the small rolling hills to one side of the hiway......Very strange as they were moving all around very quickly......Then as i passed the area where the lights were, i saw what i thought at first was a meteor that seemed to shoot high over my vehicle, travelling in the same direction as i was.\r\nas i said, at first i thought it was a meteor, but then i noticed it was too well defined for a meteor and besides that it suddenly slowed down somewhat, did an unbelievable perfect 90 turn to the east and again, shot upwards and off into space at an amazing rate. definitely not a meteor!","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

directly behind me aproximatly 5 feet away. he said hey look @ that. when he said that everyone who was with us looked striaght above our heads @ the same time which was really erie because its like

everything up like daytime. i would say about a good 4-5 seconds passed of staring @ this thing which @ the time was staionary but seemed like as soon as we all locked onto it it began to move slowly northeast in the direction of chicago in the next 4 seconds we watched whatever that thing was fly horizontally without sound moving so fast it had to of covered miles before the light completly dissapeared. this thing was only between 1000-3000 ft above. no more than that because i just cant see anyting being that big in mass and farther away than that. it was absolutly mind boggeling as to what we seen. it was so disturbing that i had watery eyes and i dont know why? i want an answer because its just eating me up inside wondering what the hell we all seen. everyone of us texted each other today to see if we were all thinking about it and im guessing if it were you, you would do the same. because we were all thinking about it. the whole thing lasted a miere 8-10 seconds but i will

record this.  the event lasted for 1 hr and i recored it for 5 minutes.  ive sent my video to robert marsh who gave me the link to this site.  from what he said it seems like he likes the video.  the video clearly shows an object in very thick cloud cover performing moves that an airplane, nor helicopter can make.","distance":"Over One

desk in my home office and go outside ang simply look up. i did so and there the craft was.  as i viewed the craft, i could see and feel the energy being exhausted from the craft, like waves through my body. a tremendose wind preceeded the event.\r\n the craft was completely silent. a large triangle with all smooth, rounded edges. it was non-descript in color, grey/black. the craft travelled slow and steady with no woble at maybe 15-20mph heading sw. it travelled forward as one of the points of the triangle was clearly the lead or front of the craft. near the center of each of the 3 points of the triangle was a large dome with an amber glow that when viewed at close distance affected vision much like heat affecting air in a desert or on a highway. the domes were approximatly 30' in diameter and constant in color and light intensity. the overall size of the craft was around 150' along any one of the three sides. the hight or thickness of the craft is hard to say, yet i would approximate it to be 30-40'. at the very center of the craft was another dome the emmited no light, but rather anchored a complex array of ariels and antennas with apparaticies on the ends of some. the largest antenna was in the very center and came down maybe 20' or more from the bottom and was host to a slow pulsing red strobe, the only other light or color visable to me.\r\n for the first 30 seconds i didnt blink or move,... i knew what i was allowed to see. then reason struck, take a photo!!! not wanting to miss a single second of the event i franticly ran in my office to get the cammra the is allways by the photoprinter, it was not there. my wife had used it in the kitchen that day. in a frenzy i grabbed binoculars from the bookshelf and ran outside. it was winter, and with no leaves on the trees, i watched at 17x magnification the remaining minute or so of the event. the craft sailed sw toward downtown.\r\n  i live in the flight-path of two very active airports, dallas luv, dfw airport and a smaller field in addison. this was no airplane. as a matter of fact, there were no airplanes in the sky, not one. this leads me to believe that the faa grounded, halted or rerouted airtraffic. \r\n needless to say, i'm a beleiver now. this event has profoundly changed the way i view the world and its place in the cosmos, not negatively though.It sounds fantastic if now crazy, but i believe that i was allowed to view the alien spacecraft.\r\n  ","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

beautiful giant stormclouds that rose right up high into the atmosphere, moving so fast you almost felt like that they were moving away at the same pace you were walking. \r\n\r\nit was while i was

2005 spring. the funny thing is not one person was there to witness it with me when usually there are at least a dozen people who are either jogging or walking their dogs. i was walking east when i looked straight ahead about 100 feet up in the air and one block away from where i was standing- a silver saucer sort of fat with red, blue, yellow lights all around the rim. i have always had an interest in ufo's and it happened on a day when i was not looking for one. it was still day light. a weird sense of calmness came over me. as i turned to look for other witnesses, i didn't find not one person. it was very strange. just me and my dog. i stopped and stared at it for at least two minutes which is a long time then suddenly (by the way no noise, it was just hoovering so still) the brightest, whitest light came out from the bottom of it, strectching straight down perfectly. i've never seen light like that. it slowly went straight down and obviously landed on someones yard as it was a typical neighborhood. i then began to continue on with my walk as if it was no big deal. i was very calm, which is strange because i should have ran to someones door to have them see it too! i never spoke about what i saw until a few weeks later.  i told everyone i knew and course no one beleived me but my mother who has also witnessed a \"ufo\" back in the late 60's with my german father who is pretty closed minded and even he will admit it was not of this world. i also witnessed a strange metallic almost fluid like large ball of whatever it was outside of the 737 airplane while landing in the ontario airport. the lady sitting in front of me screamed out. we both saw the same thing but the strangest thing again, is we didn't talk about it after that. we saw it clear as day flying side by side with the plane but got off the plane and didn't think twice about it. i do belive what i have witnessed on both occasions were our extended family from other worlds. i have a sense of why they are here and they don't frighten me. i am looking for witnesses to what i saw in the spring of 2005.\r\nthank

his house about 12-15 feet above the driveway. the flowers hanging over the pot looked pretty against the bright blue cloudless sky, so i shot four pictures in a row of them, from about 20 feet away,
