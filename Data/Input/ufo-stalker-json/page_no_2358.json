silver object hovering in the southwest. the entire object was silver. i was amazed in wonderment as to how beautiful it was. it was approx 100 ft above the ground in the plank rd area. it was rectangular in length- about as long as the goodyear blimp and had square segments similar to a plastic pill box. there was no traffic, and i kept driving off onto the shoulder because i kept looking back at it. this happened 2 times, and when i got back on the road, i looked back again and it was gone. the segment lines were clearly defined, and the silver object glistened in the sunshine. absolutely stunning. i have never seen anything like this. although i was moving, it appeared to be hovering. the outline of the object was clear against the blue sky. what was even more strange is that i immediately forgot the sighting until a friend of mine mentioned a ufo sighting up north. this was that evening. there was no \"missing time\". i went about my business the rest of the day. i drove the same route the next day and there was nothing in the sky. i was wondering if those segments would separate and take off!","distance":"101-500

(longitude: 98���14'13.94\"w, latitude  26���13'36.17\"n), i was talking on my cell phone and happened to glance up at the sky. it was a bright, sunny, mostly clear day with hardly a cloud in the sky. i observed two bright, shiny \"dots\" flying in very close formation almost directly overhead but slightly west of my position. i can only describe them as \"dots,\" seemingly circular in shape and very small in the sky from my vantage point. i could not tell if their bright appearance was due to reflection from the bright sun or an internal illumination.\r\n\r\nthe objects were moving due west and, as they flew, they came very close together and then separated from each other several times (2 or 3 times). at one point, they seemed to almost touch, but then they separated, as they continued their track across the sky.\r\n\r\nsuddenly, both objects came to a complete stop in the sky and remained \"frozen\" for several moments before reversing their direction and heading back to the east. as they headed east, they began to appear smaller and more faint, which to me indicated that their altitude was increasing.\r\n\r\ni ran inside mcallen high school to get a friend of mine to come out and witness the objects, but he was not in his office. when i went back outside, the objects were so faint that they were barely visible. moments later, when i finally contacted my friend, they were no longer visible.\r\n\r\ni have never had a \"ufo sighting\" in my life and was extremely shocked to observe what i observed. the fact that the two objects came to a complete stop in the sky for

moved to the left and then downward. it disappeared shortly then hovered back what seemed to be upward with the white lights off...Yet still very colorful blinks of light. question 6.. says how did i lose sight of the object. i lose sight when the sun oves out. but they get closer everyday. it's 3:26 and they're out there now. i showed my co-worker and before he thought i was just being as he would say \"retarded\". he seen it and all the rest and he sure can't come up with an explination. my mom as well researched this. she believes that this is not the star sirius as i've read in other blogs and debunking forums.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:05:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

time we saw coming over the trees the most awsome site i have ever seen. a flying saucer ? it was round, it was metallic colored and it did have light panels however i could not see inside or did not see any markings on the vessel. i did not see any exhaust and am not sure if the sound i heard had anything to do with the ufo or if it was the pump kicking in which just caught our attention. i did not notice a sound as it came over us and it was so low it was scary. it did not spin and i did not see legs hanging down or anything like that. my only saving grace is that my best friend had a sister working at the radio station here in town and when i told him the story her laughed then said that he guess it isn't that funny afterall, that alot of calls came in that night about a ufo siting. anyway, i don't know if it was some nasa test craft or what, but i have yet to see anything else like it. i've never reported this since i didn't know how to go about it and also i really

i-25 heading north through denver/lakewood, co.  i have frequently noticed the interesting contrails being made by aircraft that are significantly different from the normal aircraft contrails. the contrails tend to stick around for up to 10 min and can be turned on/off in the cockpit of the aircraft. the second contrail was being made (see picture) and as the aircraft was finishing its run a bright sphere appeared.  it was at the same altitude as the aircraft contrail (~ fl 36, heading slightly north of west), and stayed in a position between the two contrails.  it went to bright white to a lesser bright white for 20 sec.  then appeared 5 degrees south of its original position and performed the same sequence of events. after observing the ufo for 2 min it disappeared. interestingly enough a very similar event occurred again into the same area at 1109 on 8 oct 2008. the contrails were being made again in the same area of the sky. i observed the ufo appear between the two contrails again. however the object was significantly bigger and cigar shaped. it appeared at 1109 and followed the contrailing aircraft for 3 min until 1112. it first stayed in about the same position then proceeded to follow the aircraft in a south westerly direction. it disappeared suddenly after this event.  this has been interesting as the ufo���s have been around the same alt (~fl360) and always seemed to be in the same spot.  the later observation ufo seemed to be ~twice the length of the aircraft, while the first ufo was ��� the length of the aircraft. i have many hours of flight experience and i know when it is not a normal aircraft, balloon, or biologic species. thanks for letting me share!","distance":"Over One

view of the night sky out here. you dont see stars like this in the city. i smoke outside and at night spend the break-time looking up at the sky. \r\n\r\nsince day one, there has been a brilliant star-like light thats always brighter than all the other stars that caught my eye. its always in a different location, but remains in the same general vacinity- to the right of the house or to the left of the house.. sometimes its a twinkling white light and sometimes its mixed with a shade of red ( but still always brighter than all the other stars ).  \r\n\r\na few weeks ago i noticed the light moving in a zig-zag pattern until it disappeared behind the tree-line. i rationalized that it was a weather-balloon.. a plane ( though no noise ). \r\n\r\ntwo weeks ago the light has become ( for lack of a better way of describing it ) vividly active.. moving rapidly across the sky ( sometimes in a zig-zag pattern ) then come to a sudden and complete stop. it always seems to be lower than all the other stars, but just high enough that it only looks like a light. im still rationalizing its some kind of weather-balloon.. a helicopter even though no sound. \r\n\r\nto be funny, one night last week i grabbed a flashlight and blinked the light in the direction of the object off and on for about 3 or 4 minutes. it seemed to have made no difference and it just sat there so i went into the house. about 30 minutes later i came out and it had moved directly across the door of the house where i was standing earlier. scared me to death.. i went in shut the door and decided i didnt want to know what it was or who it was anymore. \r\n\r\nover this past weekend, my husband has a police scanner he listens to and overheard a local lady calling in observing \"my ufo\". the dispatch has plugged her call in with the local police department and you could hear her reporting seeing the object in the same vacinity. she was crying.. her kids were crying in the background. finally.. someone else besides me has seen that light! the police dept. reported they called the local airports and said there is a blimp company starting up tours of the area and that is the object.\r\n\r\ni had a hard time believing a blimp company was giving tours at 9:00 at night.. what can you see in the dark, but thought ok.. thats all it was. my ufo is a blimp. \r\n\r\nmy usual routine of having a smoke-break out on the porch led me out off the porch .. a few feet out in the yard to look in the direction of the blimp and there it was.. moving towards me in a direct and deliberate way. for some reason, i was scared so i moved a couple of feet in towards the stairs of our deck to see if it would change its direction. i peeked back and it was still moving in my direction. i climbed about 5 steps and kept my view behind our roof-line to see if it would continue.. it stopped. i went back down the stairs to see what it would do next and it just appeared to be going up until it got smaller and smaller until it disappeared. \r\n\r\nthat was no blimp!\r\n\r\ni dont know what im seeing and ive debated about reporting it on here, but curiosity won on maybe others would report seeing it too thats in my area once someone else did. theres definately something other than rational explanations!","distance":"Over One

warrington which is located in bucks county, pa. i was sitting on my recliner watching tv when i started hearing this loud rumbling noise. i figured it was a plane and didn't think much of it. after i heard the noise for several minutes i started to get a little concerned and got up to see what it was. at that same moment my wife came dowstairs and asked me if i heard the noise. after we both agreed on hearing it, we went outside on the front porch to see what it could be. we looked up in the sky and both were immediately surprised to see lots of white tiny blinking star like objects in a very confined area of the sky. my first immediate thought was that maybe we were getting attacked since it was 9/11. i knew it was definitely something that i had never seen before. the blinking lights were traveling at a high rate of speed almost like falling stars which made me think these were no airplanes. there was definitely too many lights in the same area to be airplanes. if i had to put a number on the objects that i saw, i would have to say around 10-20. we both stood there puzzeled for 5 minutes watching these lights, when to make things worse my wife looked over on the porch and pointed out a black cat about 5 feet away just sitting there staring at us. freaked out by this point, we both ran back in the house. after being inside the house and trying to figure out what it could be, i decided to call the willow grove navy base which is located not far from our home. a woman answered the phone and told us that they were testing planes in the area. i hung up the phone unconvinced and wondered several things.\r\n\r\n1. why would the air base conduct such a test on sept.11 when they know that people's anxieties are already high to begin with? \r\n\r\n2. i have lived at this location for almost 10 years and have never experienced anything like this, so was this the first time they were ever conducting this test?\r\n\r\n3. i am no pilot by any means, but how could atleast 10-20 airplanes be confined in such a small area of the sky at the same time, especially at night, and traveling at such fast speed and be able to avoid crashing?\r\n\r\na few minutes after hanging up the phone we went back outside. the loud rumbling noise was gone and the sky was completely empty. i can not say for sure what it was that i saw, but i can say it was definitely something that i had never witnessed before in my life.

radius-25; threshold-15. in the enlarged enhanced view, the object appeared to be solid, and not the result of a camera malfunction. i checked and rechecked the other three photos of the same scene and found no trace of the object in any of them.\r\n\r\ni mentally retraced my activities to determine the time when i shot the photo and then did test shots with the same camera to determine the amount of time which elapsed between the first and last photos in the scene (five seconds). \r\n   \r\ni emailed copies of both the original photo and the enhanced enlargement of the object in the photo to folks i know in the ufo community asking for opinions. one person emailed back recommending i report to mufon to learn if someone else saw the same object.\r\n\r\ncamera: fuji s100, 12 megapixels. setting for all four photos: automatic. i have saved all four original photos.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12957,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":36.3930879,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10082008-0011","longitude":-105.2850091,"occurred":1223406000000,"potentialRelations":[12984],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New Mexico","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1223406000000,"summary":"Don't know;
