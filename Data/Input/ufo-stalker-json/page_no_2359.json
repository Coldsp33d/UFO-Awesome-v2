was changing colors from a pinkish color to green to white, blue and yellow.  we both thought the color changing was strange, but he told me to keep watching.  \r\n\r\na moment later, the color changing light moved very erratically up and to the right.  the movement was similar to what a sheet of paper would do if you dropped it, only moving upwards instead of down.  we both watched it for a

aircraft that i know of.  sometimes the movement was kind of slow, others it moved a great distance very quickly.\r\n\r\nwe watched it for a while, and after a while we both had to get some sleep, and

i even think the insects and animals in the distance stopped making noises. it was too quiet.\r\n\r\n2. q. what made you first notice the object?\r\n   a. i had just entered my observations into the site log. ending comments in the log noted something to the effect that the night sky was extremely clear and calm. i exited my vehicle and looked to the south, the direction the vehicle was facing to observe the site below. i was parked on a dark hilltop away from the city lights and within sight of the rotating beacon at our local airport (french valley airport - faa designation f70) located approximately 2 miles to the southeast. from the hilltop, i look down (and south) onto a lighted parking lot on the site i patrol. the lower surface of the craft became visible as it approached the parking lot from the south. the parking lot lights were being reflected off of the lower surface of the craft which means the craft was low enough to be able to reflect the light off it's lower surface. the craft was not shinny or metallic in nature. \r\n\r\nmy first thought (as a hang glider pilot) was why is there a hang glider flying in the darkness (no moonlight)?  a hang glider would not be able to maintain altitude in the current weather conditions.\r\n\r\n3. q. what did you think the object was when you first noticed it?\r\n   a. i am a hang glider pilot, ex-military pilot and faa licensed private pilot for over 27 years. i am familiar with all declassified types of military and civilian aircraft. at first, i thought it was a hang glider. but, i thought to myself, what would a hang glider be doing out here flying on a 'moonless' night? the craft was maintaining it's altitude. a hang glider would be descending. it was not a hang glider. i was amazed at how it silently passed overhead without the aid of wings as we know them.\r\ni thought the craft appeared to be too large for a so called drone.\r\n\r\n4. q. describe the object and its actions and motions.\r\n   a. i observed the craft as it traveled through a viewing arc of approximately 60 degrees. the time to pass through this arc was approximately 10 seconds. i estimated the speed at about 80 to 100 miles per hour. there were no exterior anti collision lights or strobes. there were no markings on the lower surface of the craft except for the unique camouflage pattern.\r\nthe object was a triangle shape as viewed from the bottom side only. \r\nit had an aspect ratio of approximately 3:4. wing span 3 : fuselage 4. i did not see a side view profile. as the craft flew directly overhead, i reached through the open window into my vehicle for my fully charged 'mag light' flashlight, laying on the drivers seat, which was previously adjusted to deliver a tight beam of light and illuminate an object to approximately 300 feet.  i did not take my eyes off of the craft as i reached for the light. i aimed the mag light at the passing craft hoping to see anymore detail, with no effect. therefore the craft was slightly higher than 300 feet. i would estimate 400 or 500 ft agl. i measured the width (wing span) of the craft by spacing my right thumb and forefinger apart accordingly. then, i turned south to the parking lot below and held my fingers at the same 'arms length' against a section of fence lining the parking lot. i proceeded to that section of fence and paced it off. i calculated 42 to 45 feet.\r\n\r\nat a ratio of 3:4. a 45 foot width translates into a 60 foot length.\r\nmy flashlight can typically illuminate an object at approximately 300 feet under those same atmospheric conditions. however, the craft was just out of range of my beam of light as it passed overhead. and below the standard traffic pattern (approximately 700 ft (agl) for the nearby french valley airport.\r\n\r\nthe craft was silently (no humming, electrical or pulsing noise) traveling from south to north (on the grid ). again, it was dead quiet outside.Not magnetic north. as it passed by, i located polaris, the north star and the craft was heading directly toward it. my flashlight beam did not affect the craft and there was no reaction from it. i recently learned that a birds flight path can be affected or altered if you shine a high beam light at or in front of the bird in flight. i know this from first hand experience.\r\n\r\nthere was an odd camouflage pattern on the lower surface of the craft as it passed overhead. i asked myself why the bottom of the craft would need to be pattered in such a way? \r\n  \r\n5. q. describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object.\r\n   a. i couldn't believe what i was seeing. i removed my prescription  glasses and rapidly rubbed each eye while keeping one eye on the object at all times. i only wish a had a witness to verify what i was seeing. i was 'wowed' but not overwhelmed. however, i am a scientific realist and cannot believe that this object originated on another planet. this technology could be the result of a \"black government project\" the crafts clean, simple and concise lines were easily seen. there was nothing left to the imagination. i felt afterword that if this was extraterrestrial in nature, i would have expected a more aerodynamic looking craft designed with more compound curves. again, i felt this was military and not extraterrestrial. however,i felt the technology would be extraterrestrial in nature.\r\n\r\n6. q. how did you lose sight of the object?\r\n   a. the craft and faded out of sight into the darkness when the lower surface was no longer illuminated from the ambient light provided by the parking lot lights below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":12940,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":33.575891,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10072008-0003","longitude":-117.1308832,"occurred":1223285280000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1223285280000,"summary":"A triangle shaped craft passed silently almost directly overhead at an altitude of 300-500 ft  agl.

glisan/cherry park rd. to the north-northwest i spotted a dark object just above the houses and trees. i don't recall how it caught my attention at first. usually my eyes are rather focused on the road while on deliveries.\r\nmy first thought was that it was a large bird hovering over prey, so i continued to watch. it then tilted slightly, glimmering and reflecting light as though made of chrome or silver. this isn't far from an airport, so i thought perhaps this was an airplane or helicopter, however i'd never seen one this shape nor one reflect light the way this appeared to. and they're usually moving at a brisk pace. this didn't appear to be moving so much as quivering and slowly rising, and was not growing larger as a plane would if approaching. my next thought was that someone lost a large, reflective helium balloon or was flying a remote-controlled toy aircraft. but the shape was odd, like a sideways fedora. at this point, i felt as though i was reaching for explanations for what i was seeing, and had a difficult time believing this could be an alien craft as it was mid-afternoon over a very public area. i continued to watch as best i could without risking an auto accident. by the time it occurred to me to grab my cell phone and attempt to snap a shot or video of it, it had begun moving (much more quickly than the aircraft i typically see in the air around here) to the southwest and was out of sight by the time i had approached the down slope north of cherry park rd and could no longer track it. even had i thought sooner to take a shot, i doubt it would've shown up on my low-quality cell cam. the entire event couldn't have lasted more than 20-30

new building which is at the 5th floor level, to set up work for tomorrow i was checking the location of a surveyors axis line, actually sighting along the line, i was looking due east towards long island, when i noticed what appeared to be a kite floating in the sky, what interested me was there was  no wind this morning... nothing.. still, la guardia airport is roughly north east of the site, a twin engined passenger flew diagionly by at about that time, that the first clue i had as to the scale of the object i was observing, now i am curious, the object was approx 2/3 the wing span of the jet. the was some beetween a 1/2 mile to a mile distant, the object appeared to be well past the jet, due to the greyness of the whole sky it was very diffuclt to make any kind of estimate of distances, but i have watched aircraft on that flight path recently  and judjed by that. some thing else about object was that it opaque, and faded completly, from time to time into the backround, my first thoughts wre this might be some kind of military secret aircraft on a test run or something, being between two international airports it would be \"discovered\" thereby proving or disproving the object capability of stealth or something, this whole thing went on for 15 to 20 minutes, also it changed shape from parashute shape to plaice (the flat fish) to disk depending on the objects movement,\r\ni drew some sketches shortly afterwards, send a fax # i will forward the page. to say the least i was stunned and also the object moved east/west and up and with real smooth movement. one other thing a helocopter flew from south of the objects location, it looked (heilo) minute in relation to the object at first, the was helocopter flew in my direction it too 2 to 2 1/2 minutes for it to pass me, i dont know how fast helocopters fly' again cant estimate distant, and the object was behind the helo.\r\ni have no clue what i observed, this is not a figment of my imagination.\r\ni dont

barnes and noble, which took us about three hours.  we left barnes and noble at about 9:15pm with loads new books and cds.  my girlfriend unwrapped her new libera boy's choir cd and we started listening to that.  we headed towards sedona on i-17 and then made our exit onto 89a south as we usually do.  we passed jackson's grill on our right and continued for maybe 1-2 miles before first seeing the ufo.  we saw a steady yellow orange light in the distance, south of us.  my girlfriend pointed the light out. weweresurprisedtoseethislargelightunlike anything we had ever seen in the night sky.  we could see the light getting closer and closer.  the craft moved to the left, east and disappeared for a second behind the dense pine forest.  a moment later it reemerged and at that point it was about 3,000 feet away from us, it was floating right above the pine trees to the left of the highway ahead.                                                                          we didn't stop the car at any time, we kept moving.  we moved closer to the craft until we were about 700 feet away from it.  we could see that it was peanut shaped with a large, yellow, rectangular window in the center.  either the window was tinted yellow or the interior was yellow in color.  we didn't see any beings inside.  there were lights all over the craft but there was no order to their placement, very random.  there was a large red light and a large green light and lots of little cream-yellow and blue lights all over the craft.  the craft was about the size of a one story large house.  there was no noise, no dirt was stirred, the tree tops didn't sway at all.  alexandra was holding my hand tight and somehow seeminly calm.  i was quite scared because there was absolutely no doubt or question as to what i was seeing a short distance from the car.  that realization gave me an instant cold sweat and an instant desire to leave a quickly as possible.  with shouts of curses i urged alexandra to accelerate.  i was even too frightened to look over my shoulder towards the rear of the car, but i did just in time to see a flash of light through the trees followed by a flood light of some kind.  the light was shining directly at us, that urged my fear on even more.  i looked foward and did not look back.  seconds later we passed a car heading north, our instinct was to stop them but honestly too afraid to do so.  this car would have seen the light. there was no other car on the road that would have seen the craft but the two of us.  there were two ufos in the sky that night, one we saw up close, the other stayed in the sky the whole time fixed in one spot.  at a distance this second craft looked just like the first one we saw, an orange-yellow large light.  we didn't experience any missing time that we know of.  we sketched the craft as soon as we got home.

witness to the event i am about to share. i am however the father and father-in-law of two of the witnesses, as well as knowing the other witnesses. it is also important at this time for me to state that i have the utmost respect and admiration for all of the witnesses involved, and believe every word that they shared with me of their experience.\r\nhalf of the guests arriving that summer night in 2005 (year date correction 2006)with their wives and girlfriends for a cookout only wanted to enjoy the evening with good friends and relax. they were war weary, veteran soldiers of the 101st airborne out of ft. campbell, ky, having returned stateside a few weeks earlier from a tour of duty in iraqi and soon to be redeployed again in 2006. their hosts for the evening were my daughter, theresa, and her fianc��� and soon to be husband bryan, also a veteran of the iraqi war and still in active reserve. nobody had a clue when the cookout began that a few hours later they would have a strange experience that would create an air of apprehension and leave them scratching their heads in wonder and amazement. \r\nthe cookout itself was no different than any other cookout that these guests have attended throughout the years. hotdogs and hamburgers were being grilled and devoured; fruit bowls salads and desserts being prepared and served, and an occasional well deserved beer being consumed. the only difference between this cookout and others were the stories being shared. these were stories of brave men, all who volunteered after 9/11, willing to risk their lives in the defense of their country, of gallantry in battle and fighting an enemy whose bravery consisted only of murdering innocent men, women and children with car bombs and by other means. in the past i have asked these men to share some of these stories with me and at times have met resistance���resistance in the sense that they wish not to be thought of as heroes, but only doing a job that they believed in. as i shared earlier, one of these men was my son-in-law. as a sometimes overly protective father of his only daughter, i could not be any more proud of her choice in a husband with whom to create a lifetime of precious memories.\r\nas the evening progressed, most of the group decided to sit cross legged in a circle on the driveway at the back of the house. the conversation was flowing freely and unabated until it was interrupted by a scream that seemed to emanate from the air itself and every place at once. chill bumps suddenly and unexpectedly took the place of the warm night air caressing their skin. at this exact same time someone yelled that there was a glowing, white orb the size of a basketball emerging from a seven foot tall line of bushes that ran down the left side of the driveway not more than 20 feet away. one young lady then sprang to her feet and declared with some conviction that the scream was that of a ���witch,��� and then ran into the house to tell those few who were not outside sitting on the driveway. by this time everyone in the circle was standing. bryan and two other men ran into the basement a few feet away and returned a few seconds later with weapons���a blow torch and two large automotive wrenches. by this time the orb had slowly floated through the air about 5 feet off the deck into the back yard some 40 feet from where it had first been seen. not knowing if the glowing orb was a friendly, bryan and the two men began to converge on the orb using military tactics���one left, one right, and one in the middle. the orb seemed to sense the presence of the three and began to veer left into the neighbor���s yard. whether using intelligence or instincts, it slowly maneuvered through an array of trees and seemed to be using the trees as a buffer to separate itself from the three. a few moments later the orb stopped. the three continued their advance on the glowing orb until they were about ten feet away from it when it suddenly vanished right before their eyes. the ���witches scream��� ceased at this time as well; its blood curdling cry no more.\r\nneedless to say everyone became a bit apprehensive during and after the experience. the emotional impact on one soldier was more telling than with the others. he vanquished himself to the house and upon leaving stated loudly, ���i didn���t sign up for this!��� on the surface this might seem a little strange for soldiers to feel any kind of fear after having fought a vicious enemy in a war and having to soon face him again in the future, but not really. in my extensive, hands on research of the paranormal, i have periodically been involved in cases where the bravest and strongest of people fall prey to the fear of a ghost, a bigfoot, ufos, aliens (et���s), etc. i believe that this fear is based on the belief system of each individual. the majority of the population���s belief system is based on what supposedly learned men of science and religion tell us as what is real and not real. not many people dispute religious leaders when they tell us that we must fear god and the devil, and that aliens are demons, and that by messing around with any aspects of the paranormal it will surely carry us to the gates of hell. on the other hand, scientist���s state emphatically that anything in the paranormal realm is not real; that those who claim  to see or have contact with such things are either lying, delusional or they are just plain mistaken about what they experienced���as in misidentifying a star, the moon, a plane as a ufo.\r\nthe brave soldiers at the cookout had been trained to fight a physical and tangible enemy who cannot suddenly materialize and disappear into thin air as if on a whim. what the group experienced that night falls into the category of the paranormal���something unknown was real and tangible and did materialize and disappeared on a whim.\r\nfrom my own personal paranormal experiences, i strongly believe that most people who share paranormal type experiences are not lying or delusional; that they actually have paranormal experiences that are real; that though what they experienced cannot be seen, touched and studied in our three dimensional world, it is still real nevertheless.\r\na good example of my belief is fortified in a survey poll conducted for an article that life magazine ran as their cover story in the march 2000 issue, an article about ufo, aliens and abductions. i was interviewed and my personal abduction experiences were one of the main features of the article. though the writer did a hatchet job on the whole subject matter, including me, the poll tells a different story as compared to the writer���s beliefs and so called unbiased writing style. \r\none of the questions was this: ���have you or anyone else you know ever seen a ufo, or haven���t you?��� though 79% answered ���no��� to this question, 2% answered ���not sure,��� while 6% answered ���yes, personally��� and 13% answered ���yes, someone i know.��� now if you take the 19% who answered ���yes��� and divide this with the estimated population of just the united states in 2000, you get the rounded off figure of 53 million individuals. \r\nnow according to what scientist���s state and believe, this would mean that almost 20% of the unites states population is either liars, mentally ill or can���t tell the difference between a stationary star, or a big, white moon, or a fast moving plane and an unknown object that looks like none of the above...\r\ni don���t think so!\r\n\r\nsandy

one very quick flickering light hovering over, i think, the fairless hills golf course, quite high up in the sky. then i saw another quick flickering object hovering around trenton rd & woodbourne rd. after this one quickly disappeared another one flickered on down around oxford valley rd & new falls rd. they all hovered & flickered on again for about five mins or so. i know it to be about that amount of time because i had to run into the house to get my car keys so i could get the camera.  i apologize that i did not get any pictures as i couldn't figure out how to get the digital to work at night.  i'll get someone to show me so i'll be ready for the next time.\r\n \r\ni came outside after getting the kids down to bed & saw a number of helicopters circling the area.  i noticed another hovering, quick flickering object over the oxford valley mall area, & then another one flickered on & off further south, but in the same vicinity. my daughter came outside to check on me (she's 4, so she's not a good witness), but that's when i saw the helicopters flying in formation & circling the mall area.\r\n\r\nresponsibilities took over & i had to go into the house, but the helicopters &

was approximately two hundred yards away. it was stationary above large power lines (transmission lines). it was almost touching them. \r\nnow i will try to describe it. it was rectangular in shape. using objects near the craft such as cars and buildings i was able to get an approximate size. it was 40 to 50 feet in length and 10 feet in width. the color is really difficult to describe. it was bronze, bright shiny bronze. \r\nthis is the best way i can describe what happended next, it appeared that the bronze color was folding in on itself towards the middle. as it was doing this either the object moved directly away from us or collapsed in on itself. it disappeared very quickly. the whole sighting took place in about 10 seconds. \r\nwhen it was gone the customer said \"did you see
