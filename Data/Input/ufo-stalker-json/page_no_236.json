both pointed to a very fast moving object in the sky, not directly overhead but at about 80-85 degrees from the horizon. object looked like a satellite or star in its brightness but speed and direction made it stand out. very fast moving and moved from east to west across the southern sky. as it was nearly overhead it came to a full stop and to our amazement it backed up for a short distance, then turned and continued west at a speed about double the original speed. the path it followed was a sharp arc toward the horizon. it vanished from sight in the western sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\none of the two observers is a pilot and he noticed that it was moving the wrong direction (e to w) to be a satellite and that is what caught his attention. i noticed it due to the speed being far to fast for it to be an airplane. also, the light was constant - not flashing as airplane lights often are.\r\n\r\nsky had a light haze tonight but all stars and planets in the southern sky were quite clear. sky in that area was clearer than to the east and north east.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Path with directional change,Path then

tracking something moving much smoother and faster across the sky. the military jet made it accross the sky in about 1-2 mins. this object made it from directly above me to out of sight in approx 20sec. the only reason i spotted it was becausd i was watching the 1st plane. it was like a weak dot on a page. i almost lost site of it the entire time it was scaling the nighg sky. had it bbeen a

and between lamb blvd and range road (north las vegas, nv)there are no street lights. at 11:48 pm driving with my driver side window down, a very large solid bright white light appeared straight down above me and illuminated the stretch of land between both sides of the highway, to include the west bound side of north 215 highway. i first thought this could be a police helicopter with a spotlight, but i was the only vehicle traveling and the light covered a huge area, and the sound of the aircraft was not a helicopter, there was no sound from above!!The light remained solid for 5 to 7 seconds as i was traveling, difficult to say if the light was traveling with me or i was traveling through the light. when the light was gone , i then heard a soft smooth swoosh sound as it accelerated to the east. when i was on top of the bridge before range road, i could see four lights 2 solid (on bottom) white and 2 flashing red (on top)(difficult to say if this was one or two ufo's). the ufo(s)

and our neighbor invited us up to the cinders in flagstaff to camp/ride.  we got there late on friday, just before sunset.  we drove around trying to find our friend among all the people camped, but couldn't find him and the sun started to go down so we chose a spot outside the last of the other campers.  while i was pitching the tent and setting up, i noticed a bright (star) between two tall pine trees.  a little later i glanced up again and it had moved maybe a foot, but then later when i glanced up again at it, i noticed it had moved a foot upward and in a non-linear direction from the first two views so i knew that was not right and went to the truck and got my binoculars out for a closer view.  to begin with, it caught my eye due to it being so bright and seemingly close, but had initially just dismissed it as being the north star.  so when i looked through the binoculars, i couldn't focus well so i went to a nearby tree with a branch and steadied the binoculars.  it was not quite dark yet.  when i focused, i couldn't believe it.  i called my wife over and told her to pinch me and tell me i'm not seeing what i saw.  she looked through and saw the same.  what we saw was points of light connected by beams of light.  it was irregular in shape and was slowly rotating around.  the best way i can describe it, is if you remember the old wooden erector set toys and connected wooden balls with the sticks and made an irregular object all connected and began rotating it around.  it was transparent as you could see through it to the points of light and beams of light on the other side as they rotated around to the front.  after looking for just a few minutes, i suggested we jump on the quad (atv) and get a closer look.  so we doubled up and drove towards it through the forest of the cinders.  while driving the sun had gone down so i flipped the lights on and kept driving towards it.  we must have gone just about two miles and then all of a sudden it took off in the opposite direction in a instant and appeared to just stop way out on the horizon.  at this point, it seemed futile to drive any further so we stopped and i picked up the binoculars and tried to view it again, but could only make out the glow of it that i had seen from my naked eye to begin with.  at this point, we decided to return back to camp.  (i just saw the show 'ancient aliens' on the history channel and they mentioned mufon - so looked it up and decided it was time to share our story with the wider audience in case someone else saw the same thing at that time).","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"01:30:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then

search lights crossing the sky....And i thought that odd.....Maybe they're searching for something way out thyere....This was on the horizon. \r\nthe light wasn't swinging up or down though and so i watched it. the beam of light broke off of the horizon and was flying by itself towards land....Directly west.....Well, directly perpendicular to land anyway...Since i don't know the exact north/south orientation of that beach.\r\nas the beam drew closer to land it resolved from a glowing beam into individual disks, flying in some sort of formation. there were abour six or eight large disks and about forth small ones. at first the formation seemed like a bunch,....Kind of a thick formation that all of a sudden changed to this shape as they approached land. the large disks were flying at the points with about five smaller ships within the formation.They switched quickly into this formation as they did a 90° turn south. i saw a smaller one moving through the formation and seemingly enter a larger one. their shape was a disk, they were nearly completely round when overhead but more ovoid before that. as they passed over i could see stars through their formation. their two sizes were both larger than the stars but smaller than an aspirin. the smaller ones were about three times the size of the stars and the larger maybe....20 stars or larger...\r\nas i watched them, with my stomach heaving and my heart pumping awfully fast, i heard mr x return to the room....The door was open the the room and i was only about 20 feet from the door. i shouted and he came as fast as he could but when he arrived the disks had just traveled far enough south that they turned back into a beam of light.\r\ni realized that what i was seeing, light-wise was the reflection of the sun, on the bottoms of the disks (saucers). i suppose one could do the math and estimate their minimum height for them to be able to reflect the suns light onto singer island at 1 am in february of '83. to me they seemed to be in space.....Absolutely not in our atmosphere. there was no noise, their was no vapor trail or otherwise.\r\nin closing, i was as clear headed that night, for the interview in the am.....As any time in my life...Can you imagine? exec chef for the king of saudi arabia? after the first year on the job, it was on to all the best cities in the world for hotel starts...What a job! and we were all hired...\r\nbut never went. the king had a change of political heart and decided the jobs were better done by countrymen.\r\nhere's the thing. i've lived with this eating my heart out since then. please answer my input!\r\nsince then, i've seen on the science/history channels....Your shows...The one about president reagan having his fleet of 8 large oblong space crafts and 43 smaller crafts. this is tearing me up....Because what i saw were not oblong. but hearing nothing about it since 1983 has me so anxious to know more.It drew many tears just writing this to you so please don't let me down.\r\nbrian donovan\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

morning star get hotter. as i was doing my watering i ask my wife what time it was in order to get something to eat. she said 7 am, i look up to the sky to think where should i go for breakfast and notice this slow moving cylinder shape object coming from the direction of the airport (miami int. airport). i called my wife for the phone but she was busy with the kids and all for school. i could not move for not to lose track of this object. so, i kept a close eye on it and somehow it saw what i was doing it flew straight up in the air like 500 to 600 hundred feet in the air. with out a sound and without any traces of smoke or engines on this craft it was so clear and clean and a bright color of clear silver(not see through).This craft and i where just there and it felt like forever. as it was over my head it started to spin so fast that these colors of chrome; hot red; clear bright white and yellow came off of this craft. i then could not move even if i wanted to. these colors where almost touching me. i some how ran in side the house to call the police and as i was pressing the numbers 91- it some how knew what i was doing and flew away. i looked at the phone and it was 7:30 am. \r\n(i did call, because it could be another country doing what country do to each other and that is spying on each other).\r\nthe next day i woke up even earlier to prove to myself something. as i was just for and hour looking up in the sky. i felt something looking at me. as my body turn me to the direction of this small sphere that flew like motionless and without sound and had a color of its surrounding not so much of hiding but reflecting the outdoor. it had me pulling out my pocket knife because i did not feel safe. and it just hovered there and after a while it flew away like a balloon. (not floppy and not all over the air but like how a balloon floating away up in the air slow motion. (both time the objects flew up into the air without a sound).

inwards of the four points. it was diamond shaped. i could see it because the night sky around it was brighter than the bottom of it. i couldn't guess at the altitude. we got back in the truck and started traveling again. the craft seemed to be keeping pace with us. after  awhile it just seemed to dissappear. i had no idea what the craft could be except a u.F.O. i didn't become upset because i

those in a hospital morgue) and one of them opened. the drawer came out with a man in a silver suit (with no insignia or patches) lying down on it. he had what looked like dark glasses on his face. he sat up and looked around slowly. after a few seconds...The snowy tv screen cleared up and went back to the tv program that we were watching. \r\n\r\nduring the entire incident, i was pointing at the
