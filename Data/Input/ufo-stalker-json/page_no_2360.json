my only debate is if ra sungod was the main god in egypt then ra was god the father of jesus therefore god was nicknamed the \"master of deception\" meaning the mayan 2012 theory is probably false. also becausee the bible warned about false prophets and fortune telling and jesus was called \"a theif in the night\".\r\n\r\nmy apparitions are in my head , mary and jesus pay more attention to me with telepathy  like i can see and hear them think about me every 30 minutes im beggening to believe im family or perhaps the reincarnation of an extra terrestrail meaning rebirth includes memory erasion because im uncertain.\r\n\r\nthe proof i have is these unmarked planes sometimes at times every day 5 minutes apart from one another flying directly over our house very lowly. ive used binaculors and they dont bear ups logos or even passenger lights but are constantly circling st charles, il. usually there is 5 or more unmarked planes circling st charles all day everyday. it is becoming obvious the governments research department is protecting the area from unidentified objects that are as what you can see constantly in st charles , probably because of me.\r\n\r\ni am growing fatigued or making no plans for the future because this in constant,  such as going back to college and am gambling my life and health on skeptical issues of the unknown. they must have theyre own problems if they are letting us suffer and die on a dirty planet. everyday must not be christmas or why is the beloved jesus letting the best texas christians lives be destroyed by hurricanes? why are they obsessing on church and god and the bible in a world of chaos and anarchy? i am enraged at jesus for letting the people and the world come to this! is he tired after 2033 years or just lazy or frustrated? i dont pray or go to church but i sure get the ufos above the house on a 24-7 percentage. \r\n\r\ngo ahead if youre wealthy st charles has a small airport nearby. rent a room at the marriot hotel near our house for a week and watch the constant unmarked planes circling as if they are obsessing on something here seeming not to be getting any answears on the lights.\r\n\r\nif you should dare come stay at the marriot or super 8 near our hosue and watch the skies , if you find any answears you would bless my disturbed mind and email me at reharkthte@yahoo.Com\r\n\r\njolly roger\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"12:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12920,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.9148911,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10052008-0002","longitude":-88.3051233,"occurred":1223200800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1223200800000,"summary":"I am growing fatigued","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12920_submitter_file2__untitled.bmp"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"St Charles, Illinois","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:321346"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Loleta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"   i decided to take a break during work. i stepped outside at around 2245 hrs(10:45 pm) the sky was clear, the stars where out. i was setting down looking up, enjoying the fresh air. i sat facing due east. i was out for about 8 minutes. then i saw an orange light begin to enter the high north west sky above me. at that point i thought \"cool,a meteor.\" no sooner did this thought enter my mind, then its intensity grew and i could see it had a solid but plasma appearing form. it had a distinct fusalage and two forward swept wing like appendages. these where located well aft. this form remained constant as it travled to the south east across the sky almost directly over me. its relative size was about a half to three quarters of an inch at arms length, almost directly over me.  this decresed as it neared the se horizon. though its attitude remained true to its vector. the relative velocity was great, equivalent to a meteor or a shooting star. it retained the orange color and hue of the discharge from a standard neon glow light as it travled. it finaly disappeared out of veiw about 20 degrees above the south east horizon. it did not make a sound. i felt as though a profound truth was unveiled before me. regret was also felt in the fact no one else saw the same. but then again, it was huge, maybe some else did?

called me to the kitchen for some reason i don't know. my front kitchen window oversees west. i quickly turned my head to the upper right side of my window and i saw what i now know it to be an object shaped like a cigar zig zagging from left to right. at first i thought it was a kite because i didn't have my glasses on. but i continued watching the object.Because it started becoming bigger as it moved closer to the center of the window. i saw it was a cigar shaped grey blacksih color as it zoomed by my house. i ran to my backyard and looked at the sky, it was kind of cloudy but i could clearly see the object next to some cloud. i stood there with amazement and shouted for my husband to come, he couldn't make it b/c he was upstairs and couldn't hear me. after 2 minutes of the observation i saw the onbject punch a hole in the cloud and went upward into the atmosphere. i walked to my kitchen and shouted for my husband to come downstairs. i told him everything but he was skeptical and continued to tell me it was something like a bird b/c i didnt have my glasses. i put my glasses and showed my husband the hole in the cloud, he was skeptical and kept telling me it was probably a helicopter or plane. i went back to the phone and told my grandson everything. so far 20 minutes had expired since the first sighting on my kitchen window. i hung up my phone went to the sofa in the living room and watched the price is right for about 10 minutes. i got up and grabbed a cup of water when i saw a shadow coming up my driveway. i went to the garage with my camera. i saw the object go through my side backyard fence, i ran through my kitchen and into the backyard, i saw what appeared to be a man in black ran back again through the side fence and into my driveway, and quickly followed and took this photo as he was looking back at me. it was so scary that i ran back and told my husband, he called his friend and they were with us for about 2 hours. we didn't call the police department because he didn't think it was neccessary eventhough i kept telling him it was trespassing. next thing i knew i was on the computer learning more about mufon. around 40 minutes had expired. i don't know why a man in black would suddenly appear on my house right after this ufo sightings? quite mysterious looking man. i reported this

moved almost all the way across the horizon in maybe 30-45 seconds to the south-west of me the weird thing was once it was in that general location it seemed to stop completely. as i looked more at the object it was shining a bright orangeish-blue color with no distinct flashing lights, a few seconds later it was joined by another object identical to the first one and about 30 seconds later the

1981, while stationed at fliegerhorst kaserne (us army post), near hanau, germany, my husband, children and i lived in the small town of langenselbold.  it was a crisp, cold evening (no clouds). the time was approximately 9:00 p.M. and my son (age 8) and i were on the patio, viewing the full moon through a small telescope.  my son was viewing the moon, when he asked me, \"what is that thing going across the moon?\"  i took a look and there was a large, very obvious shadow (elongated, cigar shaped), trailing slowly across the moon from left to right, in a smooth, constant motion. it had to have been a very large ufo, to cast that big of a shadow.\r\n\r\nas soon as the shadow reached the right side edge of the moon, it disappeared and a very bright object appeared to the right of the moon.  i could not see the object when it was casting the shadow, until it moved out from the face of the moon. the unidentified object then passed around and behind the moon, momentarily out of sight.  suddenly, it again appeared on the right side and moved back across the moon, again leaving a shadow that moved right to left.  then, as it came to the left side edge of the moon, the shadow disappeared and the bright object again became visible and darted out into space at a tremendous rate of speed, disappearing from view in 1 second.  total time of observing object was approximately 2 minutes.  distance was approximately 238,855 miles from earth.\r\n\r\nat the time of the sighting, i had a feeling of excitement and awe. when my son and i rushed in to tell my husband, his exact words were, \"hmm.\"  he believed me but he wasn't excited at all.  i told a couple of friends and their reaction was about the same.\r\n\r\ni know this was not a satellite orbiting earth and i don't believe voyagers 1 & 2 were anywhere near that big, or that our probe (voyager 2) could fly to one side of the moon, then make a very sharp u-turn, fly back around the way it came and then accelerate to near light speed.  the ufo was huge, fast and had to have been controlled by some intelligence, probably not our own.\r\n\r\nearly this year, i took a photo of a ufo and have reported it to mufon.  as recently as sept. 22, 2008, my husband saw what he believes to be a ufo.  i will put that in a later report.\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

(all of which had thin trails behind them.) at this point, i sort of gave up, saying \"some people have the ability to summons them on command, and i'm just not one of those people...Sigh.\" just as i finished that thought, my 8 year old son came into the backyard, and proceeded to lay down next to me on the hammock. i said to him \"maybe you can help me...\" (he's as open minded as i am, my husband not-so-much!)i asked him to join me in asking to see something out of this world. he agreed. i started the count down. we got to three and he said \"i didn't concentrate. let's do it again.\" so he very matter of fact said in a whisper \"dear god, (a phrase i hadn't personally used in addressing the who-evers or what-evers that would make this happen, and we aren't big church go-ers) please show us a ufo (a word i hadn't used yet in asking either) 5-4-3-2-1...\" it was so endearing, the way he went about it. and lo' and behold, when i opened my eyes, directly in front of them, but many miles away above the tall tree line, there it was. a something!! just sitting there. i jumped off the hammock in an instant, and shouted to my son while pointing \"do you see it??\" he was silent for a moment, then said, \"nooo...\" it took me awhile to orient him to the tree line and the exact location (i don't know if you know how difficult that is to do with a child!) within 20 or 30 seconds, he saw it. i was shrieking and freaking out, and here is what it appeared to be: a star-like shine, completely stationary, as big as venus in the night sky and a bit brighter, no trails, no smoke. as i stared in amazement, delight, and wonder, i never had any negative feeling. only complete and utter appreciation. we asked. we received- something! i told my son to run in and grab the binoculars. he was quick! i did not want to take my eyes off of it. upon looking through the binoculars, i could see this highly reflective egg or diamond shape. it was so reflective (or shining) that all the colors of the rainbow were visible on and around it. the 'object' was motionless for at least 5 minutes. that is, until we called for my husband to come and have a look. reluctantly, he came out and looked through the binoculars, and couldn't readily give any explanation to what he was seeing. (he's usually full of explanations!)but as he viewed the 'object' it ever-so-slowly started to float away from and east of us. soooo slowly, though. until we could no longer see it through the trees. we didn't take a picture, because i know it would appear as a light blob, or just make a mockery of the beauty of it! it was amazing! and even if it wasn't something from somewhere else, it happened before our eyes after asking to see something special. i was reluctant to write, because of the circumstances in which it appeared, and that we have no evidence. but the 3 of us all saw it. plain as day. for atleast 10 minutes. giddily, i went in to make lunch. and i have told this story unashamedly, to many non-believers since.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":12898,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.3889953,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10032008-0002","longitude":-71.6908142,"occurred":1221936780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Massachusetts","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Diamond,  Egg,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1221936780000,"summary":"Son, husband and i saw stationary star-like, almost egg-shaped, object in sky. very metallic and reflective through binoculars. lasted about 10 minutes until it slowly  floated out of view.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Boylston, Massachusetts","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:321365"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"West Vancouver, B.C.","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I am sending to you in attachment my writen report and photograph of spoted object over cypress mountain near west vancouver, b.C., canada. that was my report to ufobc. in the attachment you have short opinion their specialist regarding ufo's.\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\n\r\nrifet bahtijaragic","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":12897,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":49.342994,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-10032008-0001","longitude":-123.153523,"occurred":1222633800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"British Columbia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1222633800000,"summary":"During hiking on the cypress mountain, nea dedr west vancouver, b.C. we spoted  ufo","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":"America/Vancouver","timeZoneName":"America/Vancouver","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12897_submitter_file1__Re_UFOoverCypressMountain.eml","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12897_submitter_file2__UFOoverCypressMountain-WestVancouver.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"West Vancouver, B.C., British Columbia","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:321366"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Kalispell","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"See email sent earlier","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12896,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":48.200531,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-10022008-0017","longitude":-114.315102,"occurred":1222992900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Montana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Saturn-like,  Sphere,  Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1222992900000,"summary":"Taking pictures at river and spheres and colors started showing up in alignments, as if a crop circle kind of thing in the air. i thought they pretty until i got home and found out one of the pictures was an alien head as the top sphere!

following report of this electrical event, was also here at my home in 2006, when we both experienced a close encounter of a lare triangular craft. \r\n(see cms reports...Michigan \"date of event\" 8-25-06)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaturday, september 20, 2008...\r\n\r\nmy husband left friday (9-19-08), early am for the upper peninsula of michigan for 10 days to go fishing. my neighbors directly to the south of me, had gone out-of-town for the weekend as their son was getting married. my neighbor directly to the north of me was home, (his wife was out of state visiting relatives).\r\n\r\nboth my daughters & i had spent most of the day saturday house-cleaning: mopping, vacuuming, doing laundry, etc. my daughters each invited a friend to spend the night that night as well and so at approx 5-5:10pm, we left our house to go pick up their friends and make a couple other stops. we arrived back home at approx 7:45pm, and at 8pm, i took my dogs out front (west) and hooked them to their tie-outs. it was warm & decent out...(dark, half moon, millions of stars, somewhat humid)...So i stood outside, when i got a funny uneasy feeling. after about 8-10 minutes, i unhooked the dogs from their tie-outs & brought them back in. \r\n\r\nwhile back inside now, approx 5 minutes later, i walked down the hallway into my bedroom putting stuff away, and proceeded to close all of my bedroom window blinds. i hit the light-switch off, & as i went to leave the bedroom, i thought i had forgotten something, so i quickly glanced back around the room. upon starting to turn back around to head out of my bedroom, there was this huge white flash, right by the north bedroom window, but outdoors (my blinds were shut)...Yet this white flash didn't show in my west window. i instantly think lightning?, yet i know it's nice out, as i had just come in...Then i think \"camera flash\". the girls and their friends are always taking photos. \r\n\r\ni stepped directly across the hallway into my daughter's bedroom, and i notice her blinds are still open & ask her if they had just taken a picture, when she says...\"no, my camera is over there\", pointing, then she says \"mom, i just saw a fla--\" , and right in the middle of her saying that, a white flash of white light happened again...And this was just outside her north window and yet nothing from her east window (backyard). \r\n\r\nthese flashes came from the north end of our home, where there are no electrical poles/wires/etc...Nothing outside at all. all electrical wires/boxes/etc, are located at the south end of my home, and power lines along the road (west). we have a 1-story ranch, with a walk-out basement in the north end of our home, which puts the north end of our home up like a 2-story.\r\n\r\nthis is where it gets weird...\r\n\r\nalmost instantly after the second flash, everything in the house that is electrical/electronic and has juice running to it, starts flashing, crackling, buzzing and humming. all you could hear was electricity running rampant through-out the entire house, as though someone took 10 live power lines from the street and laid them through-out our home...On walls, ceilings, floors, etc...Inside and out. it was this very loud static, crackling, humming, buzzing....And very unnerving.\r\n\r\ni instantly get my daughters and their friends to grab their sleep over stuff, the dogs,and get out of the house. i tell the kids to stay away from the house and sit out in the driveway.\r\n\r\ni step back in, as what i had instantly noticed that was very odd, all the gfi plug outlets were tripping, yet all the power to everything else in the entire house was still on, just going absolutely berserk...And it wasn't lessening. even lights that weren't turned on were coming on, etc...They had juice going to it (plugged in). i also thought it very odd that everything wasn't blowing/shorting out. there were absolutely no visible sparks/flames/smoke/fire anywhere...Nor the smell of any. \r\n\r\nit is now approx 8:30-8:35pm, i call my friend <name deleted> (also a mufon fi) who lives approx 4 miles n/w of me, i explain what's going on & i ask her to come over fast.\r\n\r\ni hang up and call 911, and alert them to what's going on, then i call consumers energy, but consumers energy doesn't answer their emergency line to which i tried a few more times (which in itself is very strange). i then call 911 back and 911 dispatch says they have a special tele#, and they will call consumers energy. 911 dispatch then calls me back, saying consumers energy will be here in awhile, they give me an order #, and tell me to call them back (911), if anything else happens in the meantime. \r\n\r\nin the meantime, i am thinking major electrical meltdown in my home...Shorting everything out. i go back outdoors, to see if anything is burning and to check the outdoor poles/power lines and transformers. as i look around, going over everything, that's when i observe that its only my house. none of the neighbors yard lights/porch lights/pole barn lights/nothing...Is doing anything abnormal...It is strictly only my home. i attempt to call my neighbor to the south of me, just in case someone is there (no-one home). i then call my neighbor to the north of me, but no answer. they usually go to bed around 8pm, as he gets up for work about 4am....So i leave a message on their answering machine. \r\n\r\nmy friend <name deleted> gets here approx 9pm. with all the kids/pets safe outdoors, her & i head back into the house, and proceed to the basement, to check the main/breaker box. the entire basement is doing the same thing as the upstairs, and as we turn the corner to enter the office room, the sound is even worse. the entire wall around and behind the main breaker box is loudly snapping, crackling, buzzing, etc. i hesitated opening the main breaker box door, as i didn't want it to flash, if it contained any fire/sparking/etc, thats when <name deleted> reaches over and opens it.......There's nothing visible to indicate anything wrong...Its just normal looking. none of the breakers had tripped.\r\n\r\nfinally, approx 10pm, the electrical starts slowing down its bizarre behavior, and isn't so intense now, so i come back in and do a walk-thru', checking everything out. i tell everyone to go ahead and come back in but sit right in the living room for a quick exit. no-one from consumers energy has shown up yet.  about 10:20pm, <name deleted> and i step back outdoors looking around checking the outside power poles & neighbors again...Approx 5 minutes later...All the electrical totally 100% stops acting up...5 minutes after that, consumers energy shows up...It is now 10:30pm.\r\n\r\nthe guy is here for a good 1 & 1/2 hrs, until approx 12 midnight, checking everything he possibly can, inside and out with a fine toothed comb. he checks all the poles/lines on my property. he even puts monitoring equipment on my main electrical breaker box. he is shocked that nothing shows anything ever happened. he had me reset all the gfi's, and turn on everything major, such as the oven, garbage disposal, microwave, etc...Everything worked just fine. \r\n\r\nhe checked in & out over & over...He can't find anything wrong anywhere. he is very puzzled by all this. he's been doing this for 24 years and there was nothing to show anything had ever happened....No scorch, burn marks, no wires burnt, nothing short-circuited...And everything tested that everything was normal. none of the breakers were ever tripped..He said that nothing should still be working...It should all be fried. he found the whole thing very odd, and he kept bringing up the flashes of white light i told him we had witnessed immediately before it all started. \r\n\r\nhe finally leaves and he drives back & forth down my road, and back by my house, to see if any line/transformer is messed up...Nothing. <name deleted> leaves and sends me a text message upon arriving at her home to say she made it home ok...It is now 1:22am. \r\n\r\nat 2:04 am...All the nightlight's, and emergency lights in my entire house start flickering and flashing again, however, there is no noise at all this time...No electrical buzzing-humming, no crackling, no sparking sound. i went thru' a couple of rooms & tested by turning on lights and they too were doing the erratic flashing/flickering, but no sound. i checked on all the girls, and to make sure nothing is burning/etc, anywhere. the last time i looked at the clock it was 3am....I awoke at 6am.\r\n\r\n\r\nsunday september 21, 2008...\r\n\r\nlater in the day, i call my neighbor to the north of me, and just as i thought, he said that he was already asleep when i had called saturday evening....And though he always hears the phone ring when he's asleep, he just lets the answering machine get it. he did get my message and indicated that he checked around his home, including all clocks (for flashing if power was interrupted), and he experienced absolutely no electrical interference, that he was aware of. \r\n\r\nwhen i went to leave to take my daughter's friend home, i noticed the electrical event also affected my tahoe's instrument panel. i leased my truck august 2007---brand new---its a 2007 chevy tahoe. i have an appt to take it in to the dealership this coming week...Thankfully its under warranty.\r\n\r\nnotes:\r\n\r\nconsumers energy (power company) could not find anything wrong, nor any evidence of anything ever even happening, so in the days that followed, i had an electrician, as well as a heating/cooling/plumbing technician come out. not a one of them could find any burnt, scorched, fried shorted wires nor anything else to show that anything happened....Except...They did confirm, that whatever happened, did destroy my a/c. i have an appt to have my truck checked out as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"20 Feet or

p.M. my wife and i were standing on our deck enjoying the crisp fall air when, almost simultaneously, we both notice a large metallic cigar-shaped craft in the northern sky.  quickly i realized it wasn't anything either of us had seen before, as it left no exhaust trail and was moving way too slow to be any conventional aircraft other than maybe a blimp which is highly unlikely for our area.  as we stood there almost mezmerized by this \"craft\" our kids had come to the door and were curious as to what we were looking at. when we turned to acknowledge them and try to point it out to them (which was a matter of seconds), it was nowhere to be seen. strangely enough there were at least 4-5 jets in the same area at the same time, which was actually what had brought our attention to that particular area in the first place.  after that, we went inside and discussed possibilities of what it could have been, ruling out every earthly possibility (noting that it either \"disappeared\" or took off at an ungodly speed).  \r\nlater that night after we put the kids to bed we decided to throw on our jackets and do some star gazing. throughout the evening from roughly 9 p.M. to 10:30 p.M. we also witnessed bright lights that were moving suspiciously slow with no flashing lights whatsoever, most of which were very distant. they had seemed to appear, move a short distance and eventually fade out. the last strange \"light\" we had witnessed was very unnerving as it seemed very low to the ground and alot closer than the rest. it had what appeared to be three stationary lights and again moved slowly from east to west never seeming to be moving farther away, and like the ones before it had just faded out.  considering the event earlier in the evening, my wife and i were excited yet perplexed at the mysterious lights we had seen.  myself, being an avid ufo buff, am convinced that what i witnessed was nothing that i've seen on this planet except in other ufo documentation. my wife, (being somewhat of a \"skeptic\") is not sure what she saw, but stressed to me that it was nothing she's ever experienced before.","distance":"20 Feet or
