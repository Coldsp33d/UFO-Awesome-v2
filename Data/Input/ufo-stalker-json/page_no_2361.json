view, i kept it in view calling to my parents, still awake in the adjoining bedroom, to come and see what i was looking at.  my father came first, looked out of the window, and grabbed the telescope.  \"what the hell is that ?\" he said.  i answered \" it���s a flying saucer, we���ve just been discussing them in school\".  my mother then came in to my bedroom and only had time to see it, still flying a fairly slow course due south, nearly at the horizon. when it had gone we all discussed what we had seen, viz. a green oval, slightly narrower at the front, flying very steadily directly south for about 30 or 40 seconds. dad and i, who had seen it through the ���scope, thought it might have had a slightly brighter rim with a slightly yellow tinge to it.\r\nwe looked in the papers the next day to see if anyone else had seen it, and found one report of an extremely similar object seen in brighton, sussex, directly south of london, seen the evening before, about 2 hours after we had seen \"our\" ufo.\r\nsince then, in the words of the song, \"i���m a believer\" !!!\r\nyour points 1. i, 14 years old, was interested in astronomy and regularly before sleeping had a look out of my bedroom window, and if it was a clear night, i���d get my telescope out and look up at the stars.\r\n2. it \"flew\" into the bottom of my view throught the telescope\r\n3. i was excited, not sure but hoping it was a ufo as we had just talked about this in my class at school.\r\n4. above  5. still excited, and glad my parents had seen it too.\r\n6. it flew over the southern horizon, never deviating from its steady courle sout.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

those earlier,in the spring.Still have alot of activity around here, my 1st report was put in mufon's \"filers files\" newsletter.\r\n  we have these things that look like stars w/red,blue, & white flickering colors...Finally  saw one close enough that through the binoculars , it looked like a simon game.You could see 4 quadrants on bottom,each w/it's own series of white lights in it , & simultaneously red, green,blue,would light up one full 1/4.It would change horizontally,vertically,then 1,2,3,4 clockwise..It was awesome to see,& for me to see it w/naked eyes & through binocs.,i figure it couldn't have been too far away.(3 knuckles from horizon.)didn't move,make noise,etc.,just disappeared after 3am sometime.No clouds,clear sky,just gone. \r\n  \r\n also,while on a camping trip to tippasaw lake, this summer,took a picture of my son on the beach,slightly overcast day, no planes around...But when we got home & put pics. on comp.,saw something behind him.Will try to attach pic.You decide,it wasn't there to my naked eye,though,i'm always taking pics. & watching the sky,it wasn't there!)\r\n and tonight there's more than usual ,we counted 8 just in the northern horizon areas.No planes either,which is weird for this time of night,usually see 1 every 15min. or so over there.The ones(2 ea.) in the n.Nw. & n.Ne.,are at 4 knuckles from the horizon.The one due north is up higher @ 7 knuckles(kindof forming a gigantic triangle that covers the entire northern sky view). and 3 more above the center one about 1-2 more knuckles . \r\n  wish someone could fill us all in on what the heck is going on 'round here,seems like a mass wave of sightings world wide,in my opinion.Still waiting on the investigators to show up & get'em.;)or at least ,explain them.\r\ni'll keep

midway airport. then a strange plane caught my eye- at first i thought it was a plane then realized it was not. it was headed toward midway airport.It was sort of shaped like a bus- but maybe 2-3 buses in length.I'm not sure if it was a rectangle or cigar shaped ufo.There were about 6-10 extremely bright white lights they were large & round all on the bottom in a straight line. maybe one or 2 lights was square. i saw one light flash once it was red or green and very tiny in the middle��� . it was rather low in the sky only about 1 tree height higher than the 3 story condo i live in and rather close. i saw it between 8-10pm aug 25 or 26 2008. it moved very slow the pace of a blimp. it was a very clear sky at night and very dark -you could see the stars in the sky.��� i called my husband to the balcony to look at it -we are on the top floor -and he said \" oh that's a plane\". i said well that plane has no wings on it so how it it flying?? he was proccupied with paperwork inside and did not realize what he saw and went back inside. it also made no engine noise or any noise at first for that matter. about a minute later i heard a low motor noise the kind you hear from a dishwasher motor without the water swishing sound. it moved too slow in the sky to be a plane - no plane moves that slow. the lights were so bright and it was such a dark night that i could not see the exact shape of the craft. but the lights were all in one straight line with no wings - i know for sure. and it was close enough for me to see it was not a blimp because i saw no such shape of a blimp on top. i went back inside to find my cell phone to take a picture when i returned it was gone.I was not scared because this is the 2nd time in my life i have seen a ufo. the 1st time i saw one i saw it land on the ground- back in the 1970's in ohio it was the round kind dark metallic slate/gray with 3 round lights one top one red one white and one green. it landed right next to a weeping willow tree and did not move one branch on the tree - at night. it was completely silent. i was studying how airplanes flew back then because i wanted to be a pilot someday. so i knew that was no technology we had anywhere on earth. i felt like it was using magnetic forces of some kind to move - this was just my initial thought when i saw it - i studied a lot of science and that was the first idea that popped into my head as i was wondering how it could be flying. i could be totally wrong - but i��� am just sharing my initial thought at the time. it was there for about 1 minute then flew away. i was scared and very curious - after telling my brother and he said \"yea right\",i never told anyone else because i did not want people to think i was crazy.","distance":"101-500

down into the kitchen to eat some string cheese and i let them out in the back yard.\r\n\r\ni let them in and finished my cigarette and saw them both watching me from the kitchen screen door/glass door. i opened the door and the west highland terrior ran under the kitchen table to escape the door opening.\r\n\r\nhe completely dissappeared and i thought he ran back outside because he is wild and i looked everywhere. so in last attempts i open my parents completely shut door ( he doesnt try to push open closed doors and the knob was in locked position) and he was there laying on his doggie bed. he dissappeared and re-appeared.\r\n\r\nso after having a nightmare later at 3 am i went back outside to smoke and saw a neon blue thing 5 times the brightness of the north star hovering in the eastern skies towards chicago and appeared to blink. several mysterious planes were also in the area and the big dipper appeared to be decorated by other star like lights , destroying its pot like shape.\r\n\r\ni dont care about the second coming or eternity. at this point i need a new start and  a new body. i dont know why they keep messing with me and i dont think they will ever make me happy

neither of us made a big deal out of it, and to be honest i've never really grasped what i may have seen until now. to this day, my friend and i still agree about what we saw. i've never taken the

habit to look up at the sky as i passed.  i stopped for a moment at the railing and thought to myself, i've looked up at the night sky probably many thousands of times in the last fifteen years, and never seen so much as an unexplainable light.  at the very moment i finished that thought a huge thing flew silently over my head coming from behind me, moving from the east to the west.  as it moved off it appeared to be traveling a bit to the south so that it would have been going south-west toward the ocean.  i knew immediately that it was a ufo.  it was a little overcast with wisps of fog.  only some stars were visible.  the ufo was under the overcast cloud cover, with just a few wisps of fog under it, so its lights were very clear.  it had four small red lights in a perfect square, and between those lights it was pitch black with no stars visible.  it felt big, and solid, and maybe 20'-30' across, but i'm not very good at estimating the size, distance, or speed of anything.  i couldn't make out the shape of the craft because it blended in with the night sky, and it disappeared, or had moved out of view after only about four-seconds.  as it passed over, a circle of larger white lights inside the square created by the red lights came on softly.  they slowly pulsed as if they were on a dimmer, and someone had slowly turned them on and then off.  it moved dead steady, and fairly rapidly.  i tried my hardest to keep sight of it as it moved away, but after only about four-seconds it was just gone.          \r\n\r\ni was frozen to the spot, and just kept repeating omg.  i was a little afraid, and i think i stood there for maybe five-minutes.  i went into my room, looked at my clock, and it said 3:50am.  this was the first sighting i've had that i couldn't dismiss as possibly some other thing.  this was a month ago now, and my reactions to this experience in the days that followed were not what i would have thought they would be before this experience.  firstly, although i was a believer intellectually, knowing that something is true on a cellular level is very different.  at least for me.  i was shaken.  i only shared the experience with two people, one of whom has also seen a ufo relatively close by.  i thought i might not report it at all.  i was afraid if others learned about it they would think i was crazy.  i was afraid of being visited by mib.  i had a slight feeling of being \"invaded.\"  i had to sleep with the lights on, etcetera.  i'm feeling better, but i'm realizing that this experience really changes everything that comes after it on some level.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:00:04","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

being outside by myself. i dont recall actually returning inside the residence, but my roommate's fiance remembers me walking back inside but i did not speak to or look at anyone when i came back in.  about an hour later my roommate's fiance found me asleep in the guest room on the couch. she thought that i was crying so she went outside to get my roommate to comeinside and talk to me.  when she went outside she found him wandering towards the edge of the trees.  she had to call his name multiple times to get his attention.  finally he responded and came inside where he found me lying on the couch with my arms extended like i was chained up.  he woke me up and asked me what was wrong.  i explained to him that i had no idea what had happened but that i vividly recalled being on a craft.  i was lying naked on a table, and there was a group of slender, gray-colored figures standing over me.  i remember watching them slice my chest open then a bright light came on over me and two of the entities began speak loudly, almost like shouting, at one another and motioning towards me.  the next thing i remembered was my roommate waking me up.  i explained to him that i was extremely paranoid and uneasy about being alone outside, so he came out to smoke with me.  while we sat outside smoking i looked up and saw a figure crouched on top of the carport.  i pointed the figure out to my roommate and then we began to become very uneasy.  we began to look around the yard and saw more figures around the edge of the trees.  we decided that it was way too risky to be outside, so we went back inside.  right before we entered the house we saw a figure at the end of the fence so we stopped and looked at it, right as we opened the door the figure moved back behind the fence.  while we were outside we called to the figures several times thinking that they may be some neighborhood kids messing around.  not a single one of the figures moved away from us, except for the figure at the fence.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"01:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12859,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.4297194,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09302008-0013","longitude":-77.4065162,"occurred":1221984000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Virginia","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1221984000000,"summary":"There
