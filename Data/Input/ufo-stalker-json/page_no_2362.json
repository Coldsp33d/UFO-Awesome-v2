States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I walked down to my garage at around 10 and 11:00 pm on september the 25; it was a thursday night. i was putting my cat in the garage, but before i did that, i walked out to my gate and was gazing at the western sky. it was a dry, warm night, and there were stars out, and a few airplanes in the sky. there is nothing but a field where i was looking; i live in the country. as i was looking out into the field, i saw an object in the sky, a little bit above tree-height, flashing colors. it was an object that seemed to flash colors as it looked to be turning. or it looked like it might be spinning. the lights emanating from the object were different colors - pink, blue, green... pastel colors. the object was completely silent, and hovered for 10 mintues or so. i couldn't really make out the shape of this ufo. i went up to the house to get my film camera and video camera. when i came back it was gone ...I was disappointed because i had asked the ufo to stay (there) so that i could get a picture.\r\n\r\ni took my cat into the garage, and when i came out of the garage i walked over to the shop, which is a couple of feet away; and for some reason, i looked down at the ground, looking at the bushes. all of a sudden i looked up and there it was! staring right at me. in another spot close to me and my gate. it was at tree-top height directly across from me, in front of a house, across the road. the field i was looking at, before, is right alongside the house across the road. the ufo appeared totally different now. it was circular, and of a starlike color, only a little warmer (color). it was white, though. it hovered for a minute or so while i picked up my cameras and took pictures. when i aimed my film camera, i couldn't see anything in the lens, but took the picture anyway. i got my video camera up and shot that too. after i took my photos, the object, completely silent, then started to drop down from the sky toward the ground. it was completely descending to the ground, i thought. i walked over to the gate trying to get a look at it going down to the ground, but when i got around the gate, it was gone. it must have gone behind the house as i couldn't see it anymore. i was wondering why it had disappeared on me, but in the morning i viewed the spot again, where it had descended, and it obviously had to have gone behind the house. it had been further away than i had thought. it must have dropped behind the house and landed somewhere in a field. this is all farmland here. that is, if it landed, of course.\r\n\r\ni took my video film inside and put it on the tv to view. to my astonishment, i did get the ufo on video! it looked like a five pointed object or something. it looked like it was spinning. then i got a white circular object and, a green circular object. funny thing, the ufo that i saw on the video looked totally different than the one i saw with the naked eye (which was a circular white object). and, the circular green object, i didn't even see! it was like there were three objects out there, and my video camera picked up three ufo's. the flashing, turning ufo, and the circular white ufo. plus, a green ufo. i thought that the flashing ufo probably traveled closer (across the field) and changed into a white circular ufo. ...But i don't know. the ufo's were one right after the other on film, so i didn't see three all at once. it could have been only one ufo changing form. who knows?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbarbara richey cronin

time i have experienced a siting i've been quietly enjoying a cigarette while seated in my backyard. i had not ingested or smoked any kind of mind altering substance. the most recent siting (approx. sept 23 2008) was a dark night, and the sky was clear of clouds and some of the brighter stars were visible as they usually are from our back-yard. three of us suddenly saw a white round ball of light (much, much larger than a star) that was totally silent moving across the north eastern sky at a steady but fast pace for about 5 seconds; then it simply disappeared about 30 degrees up from the horizon - in mid-air. it seemed to be moving from the north to the east. it was hard to determine how high it was, but it seemed to be flying at the level of jets. there were no flashing lights, no colours and no sound following behind as a jet rumble usually does. we were at a loss to find an explanation for what it was, but it was not the first time we had seen this type of object in the night sky from our back-yard.\r\nearlier this summer (approximately mid-july) another witness and myself were sitting in my backyard and we saw basically the same large, silent white ball of light moving from the north more in a south easterly direction before it disappeared. it seemed to be moving more slowly but as steadily with no variation in direction or speed...And no accompanying sound.\r\nduring the summer of 2007 i saw the same type of white ball of light 7-8 times from the back-yard. each time they were moving in the same fashion, sometimes faster, and from west to east or south to north (sometimes straight, and sometimes in arching trajectory) disappearing in mid-air. only once did i see one continue to beyond the horizon. i was alone for about 4 of the sitings from our yard, and there had been 4 others witness the other sitings.\r\nlast summer,i also saw one following a tree-line while i was outside a cottage on the north shore of prince edward island. the silent, white ball of light was steadily moving from west to east following the tops of the trees. it seemed to be only about several hundred feet above the trees, but it did not look gigantic as one might expect if it was that close to the ground, so i was confused about where it actually was. it did not disappear, but continued until it was beyond the tree-line at the horizon.\r\nthe most memorable siting occurred last summer, approximately mid-august 2007, from my backyard. this siting occurred at around 10:00 pm. my back-yard is lined on the north and south by tall elm trees leaving a clear vantage of the s.E., east and n.E. sky. i noticed through the trees a white, silent white ball of light moving in the southern sky. i continued to watch it until it was clearly visible and beyond the trees, and a heartbeat after it cleared the trees it's size and brightness expanded with a huge flash...It took my breath away...And then it went back to it's normal size - continued steadily for 4 seconds and then disappeared in mid-air. it seemed to be moving from the south to the north in an arching fashion before it disappeared. i felt extremely excited and yelled for anyone in the house to come out. one friend came out after i ran to the door and called upstairs. he sat outside with me for about 3 minutes and the same type of white, silent ball of light became visible in the north-east sky and moved steadily toward the south for about 5 seconds and then disappeared. this was the first time he had seen anything like this and he was dumbfounded. i was extremely excited by this experience...It felt like the expansive white flash of this ball of light was exclusively directed at me. of course, my skeptical side dismissed it all as perhaps a satellite hitting the sun's rays at that moment. on the other hand, it was too big to be a satellite. i have no answers, only experiences and questions.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

middle garden canyon trail on ft huachuca. on one of these excursions i was sitting on a post and just happened to look up and noticed this silver and white object lingering above the mountains. i initially thought it was a weather balloon as it was during the monsoon season. i watched this thing float in the air for probably 45 minutes to an hour. during the time i was watching this the object seemed to ascend and descend in altitude. now the whole time i'm veiwing this object it seemed to either reflect the sunlight or flash a light almost as if it were spinning and only one side was silver or really shiny. in my best estimate it was probably somewhere around 15,000 to 25,000 feet in the air. to cover this object at an arms length you would probably have to use the cap of a bic pen. it moved off towards mexico as it ascended and descend in altitude. a co-worker radioed this into one of the military instructors at our base camp and he reported it to the border patrol but they informed him it was one of thier balloons. i am not an expert or even heard of baloons being controlled. now i usually bring my camera but unfortunately this trip i had left the camera at home. now also during this time there weren't very many clouds in the sky, and the ones that were weren't in the same area as this object. i wish i would have known about this website and your organization at

in the southwest, one in the south, one in the north, and one in the northeast. according to him, all of these objects are brighter than the normal \"stars\" he views in the night (he has been

18, 2008 8:48 p.M. at home in my backyard as usual i was taking time lapse pictures of planes, jets, stars and jupiter with a clear night sky. \r\n\r\ni use a remote cord attached to my nikon d80 digital camera, mounted on a tripod. set on manual focus, iso 400 fine, on bulb at f4.5. (usually)\r\nmy lens is a dx af-s nikkor 18-135 mm.\r\n\r\nto preset my camera focus i use jupiter because it is small and bright. \r\ni can see jupiter with its moons when i zoom in on my image. \r\n\r\nof course with time lapse every visible star draws a line due to the rotation of the earth. planes and jets with their flashing lights will track lines and flash points. some very interesting array of patterns can be pictured this way.\r\n\r\nwhenever i spot a dull or bright star like object moving slowly across the night sky i immediately turn my preset focused camera, frame and shoot using time lapse photography. these star like objects always move slowly in a straight line and fade out or sometimes i have seen them also appear into view and fade out again or just sit still and disappear. most sightings last 5 to 6 seconds but no more than 30 perhaps.  \r\n\r\nattached picture for sept 18, 2008 8:48 p.M. at home in my backyard.\r\n\r\ni saw a large white star like object moving slowly in a straight line. \r\nimmediately i turned my preset focused camera, framed and opened my shutter  using my time lapse while i watched the light progressively getting fainter until it vanished to the naked eye, which lasted about 10 seconds from the time i had noticed it. i am not sure but i think i left the aperture open for 12 to 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nunfortunately i framed this star like object a little too low moving out of my picture area before it faded away.\r\n\r\nafter i took the picture i zoomed in on that portion of the black sky littered with stars, to see what looks like the very faint object spiraling, creating a weird corkscrew path that diminished in diameter. i think it's a bit out of focus too. i have no idea how high or how large this spinning object was moving.\r\n\r\ni have on other nights photographed such star like objects as well but this one is  probably the most dramatic picture i have taken so far.\r\n\r\nmy feelings are mixed.\r\n \r\nthe cosmos has endless possibilities for any form of life, consciousness, technology and science that can only provoke more questions than concrete answers. \r\n\r\nto witness moments like mine are awesome. i wish is to spread the word to other star gazers with better camera lenses and video cameras so that we can capture better images than mine. perhaps this method may shed some light about their propulsion systems.\r\n\r\ni think the corkscrew turning indicates a certain flying method in entry or exit from earths sky's. who knows what stealth or wonders man made or alien may exist. maybe it is just a common unnoticed phenomenon in nature. \r\n\r\ndavid sereda, \r\ni believe has talked about the \"galaxy clock\" \r\n\"electromagnetic wave patterns vibrating so fast within a space that they give the illusion that mass is solid. \r\nbecause of this dichotmoy, mass is believed to be both made of particles and waves. \r\nparticle and wave theory are fusing together as they are both revealing the same thing. all mass has waves that vibrate at different frequencies.\"\r\n\r\ni hope to receive an experts opinion as to what i've photographed. i will accept any answer other than a hoax.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:06","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12836,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.3352396,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-09292008-0007","longitude":-79.7949419,"occurred":1221721200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1221721200000,"summary":"Time

was moving to the right and the higher was moving down and to the left, towards the lower one. they had no blinking lights like a plane would, which is what caught our eyes... that and their bright orange color, as opposed to the stars we saw that were light yellow/white. they were both about the size of a large star and were shimmering a little. as the upper one came closer to the lower, they both began to accelerate (the upper one more so) and as they crossed each other's paths, the lower one \"dropped\" quickly toward the ground, as if it were \"falling\", dimmed on and off a little, then vanished. the upper one remained for about another three to five minutes, began to \"drip\" small orange lights, that were very faint and vanished like sparks cooling as they fall from being belched up from a campfire, then the large dot began to dim a little on and off like the other large one had, then it vanished. we had no idea what they could have been, and weren't very talkative

brother.We were riding bikes around and decided to take a random picture.Since the screen on the camera was broken we couldn't really see what was on the picture until we got home.When we got home we uploaded the picture to the computer with our sanyo 6.0 megapixel camera.At first when we looked at this picture we thought it was a moon and some other tower or something.But at a closer look it looked like a moon and a ufo.The shape on the left had nothing connecting it to anything so therefore it wasnt a tower that we know of.Me and my dad drove around looking for a moon too but found nothing,so possibly 2 ufos.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12828,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.7585309,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09282008-0014","longitude":-86.6366476,"occurred":1222654800000,"potentialRelations":[12827,12826],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

a silhouette they were seeing. the lights were the most interesting part of the object. knew it wasn't a plane has a single light non flashing the lights on this object were all over and covered the entire craft instead of flashing at a constant rate therre were many rates all different colors erradically and quickly looked sparkling. dj friend got a video on phone poor quality.   the lights changed orange green red blue yellow.\r\n\r\nin lakewood hanging out at friends house. early morn walk. hadln't planned on going to lake. past park while walking down the road right on lake side. park

ointing. it changed directions had erradic movement. then it blasted off fast towardsnorth. another came up from behind. same type.And flew off in same direction. saw a bouy or bigship in the distance. hovering around ship.. it landed on water and 30 seconds later 2 lights popped out from where it came from. 2 separate things flying in formation. flew into the direction of north star and disappeared. from the time seen to disappear it was like 10 minutes aor more.\r\n\r\nmeteor-not sure what it was. friend suggested that's what it might be. she's pretty sure. she put it back where she

sure that i became a believer. it was was the night of september 26th 2008 at some where around the time of 11:15pm.I remember that the sky was the equivalent of being a beach with no lights around you, while the sky was crystal clear(not a cloud in the sky. i thought it was kind of weird because we hardly ever get nights like that here in my city. i was letting my dog outside to use the bathroom, when i just so happen to look up at the sky like i do every night to look at the stars. flying right over head at the exact time i looked up was what i thought looked like birds flying in v-formation at first glance. but quickly realized that there was something wrong with how fast they were flying and how it looked. the duration of what i was was pretty brief and lasted with direct flight for about 6-10 seconds max in my field of view. if i had to guess how far up above me it was i would have to say around 15,000 feet or close to it. there were 5 lights that had one in front leading with two on each opposing side forming off to make a \"v\" in the sky, and never once broke formation(which makes me think that they were part of something way bigger than just these lights i saw). now this part is really going to sound really strange and i have a hard time believing it myself but... the lights were not bright at all....As a matter of fact...It had the same effect to them as when you see on movies and a spaceship has a cloaking device activated. it was that effect that made me at first think that it was birds flying until a kept observing it. if was flying from north-west to east, and i followed it with eyes from first sight til i lost sight of it continuing east over a tree line. what i saw, was not accompanied with any sound what so ever(for the height flew over), no flashing lights, and no distinguishable shape except for the \"v\" formation that it was in. i still can't get what i saw out of my head, nor can i wrap my brain around it. and the fact the it looked somewhat cloaked was just something i could not believe right out of a movies. and it moved pretty rapidly and very steady across the sky. i don't know what i saw, but i can guarantee that it wasn't a flock of birds, and definitely not and airplane.! i attempted to use photoshop to try and recreate what i saw, although its to give a rough idea as to how wild it was, i wanted to trt and show you what the cloak effect kinda looked like.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
