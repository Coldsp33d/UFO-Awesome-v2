and to see proposed art on thames river exhibition.\r\ni was on north bank of river opposite to mayor's building. i was just taking photos of nice night scene of tower bridge and pier lit in green.\r\n\r\ni took below attached photo of tower bridge and mayors building with pier in view on above mentioned time. i used my sony ericsson k800i phone with 3.2 cybershot camera. i have submitted two photos in previous report and this is just after that lets say in 15min after when i was on tower bridge i took one photo looking south side of the bridge from middle. i saw some weird object in my mobile screen after taking photo so i again quickly take another snap in almost same position. and again after that i take few more photos but in these two photos this oval shaped object is visible. this obejct wasn't visible with naked eye. it was only on photo. \r\nit was bit strange cause in none of other photos anything like that appear. it also dosne't look like some kind of light refection or..Light scattering .\r\ni suspected that it might be some dust particles on my mobile phone lenses and due to lighting it glows like that. but it wasn't present in all other images which i took on that day. quite strange. i don't know what it is.\r\nthey are prominent in these two images.\r\ncould it be ufo? i don't think it's stars or planes. \r\n\r\nit would be fascinating to see if anyone else reported it or found same things in their photos. cause that day it was very nice day clear sky and many tourists around.\r\n\r\nthanks for investigating and providing this facility to report.\r\ni hope some of your scientists would help me out in this regard.\r\n\r\ni have attached 3 photos here.

ages 13, 11, 8) to see if they would see anything and few minutes later another star like object appeared moving in the same direction at same speed and then slowed down. my kids were screaming. then in the blink of an eye i don't what was but a streak of light sparked across the sky north the same direction where the object had slowed down. it then picked up speed and another one appears going south toward catalina island. about 5 minutes past and then another one appeared going east to west we watched it did not take ekes off of it and it disappeared right before our eyes. these were not planes, we live under the flight path of lomita airport, and sometime depending on conditions long beach airport changes there flight patern. these were not military planes doing there normal patrols of the los angeles harbor. these objects were star like in apperence moving faster then military jets able to slow down and flying at such a high altitude that i think its impossible. please contact

bedroom/sunroom to the east. the lights were moving slowly and without any sound and appeared to be not more than 30-40 feet off the ground, although i could not tell how far away they were and i live on a hill, so they could have been up higher off the ground below the hill. i got up and ran into the sunroom where i stared at the lights, first telling myself that it must be a car going up the hill, but then realizing that the hill was not that high, so that it must be something else. i then thought maybe it was the medivac flight for life helicopter making a landing at the hospital nearby at the bottom of the hill, but there was no sound. there is no ambient light in my neigborhood either...No street lights of any kind and no house light were on at that time, so it was very dark . the lights drifted up the hill towards the mountain behind this area (shadow mountain) and then made a sharp u turn and came straight back at a higher altitude. at that point i recall saying out loud, \"holy [pd]\"!! and thinking to myself that i must be seeing a ufo.... oddly enough, i do not recall anything after that, and the next morning i did not remember that the event had occurred at all. i woke up feeling as if i had a hangover; my eyes were red, i had bags under my eyes and i felt very fuzzy and tired even though i assumed that i must have gone back to bed and slept for several more hours. even the following day i still felt strangely exhausted and had bags under my eyes, but at the same time i felt energized and excited mentally. i did not think about or remember the event at all until the afternoon of friday the 26th when a friend called me and read me an article in the newspaper about a ufo sighting in the valley at the very same time that i had had this experience. i went out and got the newspaper, read the article myself, and then called the sheriff's department, because one of the deputies had also seen this object, as well as a local woman who lives near me, whom they then had call me. the memory of the event started to come back to me as i discussed it with both of them. we all saw \"something\", but the deputy is still convinced that it was just a small plane flying low and disappearing over a hill (the same hill where the other woman had her sighting, which is also just to the west of where i live) even though no planes can land here at 3-4am because the airport is closed then. the sightings had some similarities, although it seemed that the object was changing shape, color and speed. i have put in a call to air traffic control today to check on the presence of any aircraft in the area at that time, but they do not open until monday, so i have not been able to talk to them. an aircraft could not have made that sharp u turn that i observed, however; not even a helicopter. i also called [l. s.], and i even gave his number to the newspaper, who also called me, since they said that they did not know where to report this, but [l.S] has not returned my call yet. i then remembered that mufon takes reports, so here it is.....The other woman just called me and we had a very interesting chat about \"it all\" including several other similar strange experiences that we have both had. she may file a report with you as well.......","distance":"21-100

daughter sensed something was out of place when i asked her \"what is that?\" she buried her head into my shoulders as i followed it, with a sense of wonder and a little fear/excitement. i am not sure what shape it was as it did not have defined edges, possible oval, diamond, or square. as i followed it for what was a little over 1/2 a minute it finally went out of site/focus. i initially thought it was maybe a flock of birds, but the formation was very tight and stable, like one single object, and when i initially saw it it was not moving, or moving slowly directly overhead, which is how i

movement tv crew hit the road from orlando for tampa and st pete. we were headed out there to cover a car show that was being hosted by young dro in st pete. we were supposed to cover, birdman and cash money records in tampa at club 112. i was with award winning female rap artist [pid], and acoustic folk singer [pid]. we were excited about covering these events and getting some good interviews. we got on the road and headed out to st pete. it was late in the afternoon just before night fell when we were on the bridge (i 275 headed south bound) that connects tampa and st pete, its a pretty long bridge and we missed out turn when we reached the st pete side. we had to turn around. we went back across the bridge and ill be honest we were lost. we went across that bridge twice and we were headed back for the third time. we got a call from the promoter in st pete saying that the car show was canceled. we decided to just head back to tampa grab a drink and head home. we said screw it we weren't even interested in covering the cash money concert in tampa that night. we were about to get on that bridge again when we were on the on ramp [pid] and [pid] both were talking about the sky. they wanted me to tape the sky.. it was a brilliant color, a very nice night. i wasn't really interested in shooting the sky line but it was a really pretty sight i took the camera out and taped the sky. it was at that point that [pid] and [pid] started yelling about lights in the sky. ill be honest at first i couldn't even see the lights. i was turning the camera on and making sure everything was in focus when i first made eye contact with what looked like a bright light and it disappeared and reappeared. i couldn't believe at one point i couldn't even find the lights. i remember [pid] yelling the lights are spitting red stuff. a chill went down my spine when i found the lights. i thought to myself ufo. i was saying to myself don't mess this up. i actually missed maybe the first ten to twenty seconds messing with the camera and trying to find the lights in the sky. it was like the light was calling us. its at this point the story gets crazy. the lights seemed to be putting on some sort of fireworks show. i told them to put the passenger side window down. the lights seemed to literally jump from one location in the sky to another. it seemed like it just went on forever the lights flying around in circles ... it wasn't a fireworks display. fireworks have to fly up from somewhere and they fall down. it wasn't a plane i didn't know what it was ... i got a cold chill at one pint and i blurted out \"babylon\" i felt fear for a second. then the lights seemed to merge and it looked like they turned to into a fireball or a comet. only it didn't fly straight down. it made a turn that i thought was impossible a sharp 180 degree turn! it picked up speed and shot to the ground. at that point i said to [pid], \"that [pd] is crashing son\" ... then it shot up in the sky and i remember saying \"we wont see no more\" i was disappointed. while we were on that bridge we could see people in other cars pointing at it and when we came off the bridge cars were pulling over looking. we kept on going. it was a good thing we kept going. when we thought the ufo was gone we were sitting down in shock. i remember hearing someone light up a cigarette that is how quiet the car was. i was in shock i was just holding the camera out the window. i wasn't shooting anything in particular i was just in shock i couldn't move. after a while i remember someone saying that is some crazy [pd]. and it was. i can still remember [pid] asking if it was a full moon that night and it was. i called our editor and told him that i just shot the greatest ufo footage ever. he hung up on me i cant blame him though. we got back to orlando. i left the tape with the editor and he called me later and told me that i did shoot the greatest ufo footage ever. he was so excited he told me that there were a few more thing that we missed. after we thought the ufo crashed it was following us. i watched the tape and i was so surprised. he slowed it down frame by frame and showed me the ufo flying ahead of us. he showed me where the ufo really left. it flew behind a building and it looked like a shooting star. he also showed me something else some sort of light appeared on the skyline during the light show. it appears to fly behind a building. i have no way of telling if it flew behind the building or not. it could have been an illusion. regardless it was there on the tape none of us noticed it on the bridge. we came up with a plan. we posted a short video of the incident on our blip.Tv page, myspace and youtube. the response was overwhelming. long story story short the video got picked up on wftv.Com (orlando's abc affiliate) we got the footage copy written and we prepared for a media storm. \"not on our radar at all,\" lt. rebecca heyse, public affairs officer for macdill air force base, told wftv.Com, adding that they have no reports of similar sightings on january 20. wow the air force had no idea that something was flying around a major city. a few days later wftv reported on its site that a t-6 plane used in the bill leff starfire night skyshow, was flying that day. wow this flame in the sky that wasn't on the air force,s rader was now a plane. i was like wow this is a cover up. i googled bill leff and watched his air show on youtube.Com its a great air show but it looks like nothing that i taped on the 20th of jan 20008. they were trying to debunk us. i knew what was up then it had to be a grass roots movement to get this out to the people. it became a passion of mine because i want to know whats going on. if the government knows they need to disclose this to us because we have a right to know. i have been in touch with bill birnes form ufo magazine and history channels ufo hunters show. i cant tell if they want to show the truth or just show poorly shot footage of suspected ufox and having people talk about their experiences with no evidence. we are putting this out for the world to see. check out bill leff's airshow and compare it to what we saw. air shows are loud this thing i in the sky that we saw made no noise. air shows are held at night this happened before night fell over the sky. this incident has changed all of us that were in the car that day. [pid] already a respected artist in the orlando scene and an award winning mc has shifted her music to more spiritual rhymes. she is on a mission to share her truth with the wold through her music. she is one of the few rappers that has actually brought up ufos in her music. she is constantly on a mission to find and share the truth . [pid] life has been affected as well as his music. as for me i'm trying to bring the truth out i don't care about what it is if its police brutality that i see and shoot with my camera ill bring that to the world if its a ufo ill bring that to the wold to. i ask everyone to look at this video make an informed decision and remember that if we don't demand the truth the government will continue to lie. i have no idea what that was but it was no plane and ill keep saying that to my grave. you can view the video for yourself ..Menttelelvision.Blip.Tv and you can reach me at myspace.Com/supreme407

they were flying faster than the plane but not in any formation at first. then more started to appear up until about a total of 15 spheres started to slow and follow in the slip stream of the plane. i

the ability to be so close together as a bundle until they fell into a formation of following the plane. unfortunately, i could not  take a photograph with my mobile phone as it was a sunny morning

very minimal, showing the milky way and even satallites to the naked eye.\r\n i brought a high powered telescope to spend a few nights looking at the sky with hopes of getting good images of whatever i could see. \r\n there is scant to no high altitude air traffic in that area at night, such as jets and, when there is, they always are travelling east/west. \r\n my place is on the southwest area of moosehead lake. i set my scope almost straight up and at an angle slightly to the northwest, aiming to the right of the milky way's band - at it's edge.\r\n  i was setting the sight on the thing by trying to find a satallite, which i did, and ranging out from there. as i was doing this a light travelled through the scopes line of sight at a very, very high altitude.\r\n  it was simply white and looked the same as any given star in the sky. in comparision to stars, it appeared as a \"middle sized\" star, not the brightest, not the dimmest, but right in the middle of those \"classes\". \r\n  it was easy to track it with the telescope as, at first, it was travelling in a straight line at an unknown speed and height. it looked and moved, for all purposes, as an airplane flying at 50,000 ft or better. that kind of speed and movement, although it was just one white, clear, sharp, unblinking light.\r\n  it was heading, at first, straight west, away from my position. it travelled that way for about 10 seconds and i, although a little curious about it, was about to dismiss it when it took a sudden and sharp turn to straight north. it travelled the same way as i described above due north for about 15 seconds and then turned again, another 90 degree turn, to straight east for another period of about 15 seconds. it's speed remained constant at all times, slightly slower by just a little as to how a jet airplane looks as it tracks across the sky. that kind of speed.\r\n  it then took another turn at about 45 degrees, heading southeast directly back over my position for another 15 seconds, then took a very sharp 135 degree turn back towards the west.\r\n  it began repeating this pattern over and over for about 10 minutes. what was very interesting was that the pattern, 2 90 degree turns, a 45, and then a sharp 135 back to the original position changed each time the light went around it's course. the 45 degree turn would be made one turn sooner with each pass, directly followed by the 135, then 2 more 90 degree turns.\r\n  the turns appeared to be made as if you were drawing an angle and kept your pen moving through the angle, kind of slightly rounded, but still quite acute. it kind of reminded me of how a billiard ball glances and bounces off a pool table rail - kind of soft yet changes direction suddenly. it would be completely impossible for a common airplane, or even a warplane, to make such turns as that light did. \r\n  although it was very hard to guage the exact altitude and speed, i would say - if i had to guess with only the skygazing experience i have - that the light was at least 70-80,000 ft high and travelling at about 10 miles a minute. but this is only a guess made with only slightly more than amatuer experience.\r\n  seeing nothing more than a moving light through the telescope, (it was very dark), i stopped looking through the scope and was able to watch with my naked eyes. \r\n  after about 10 minutes of the same pattern being repeated as i described above the light stopped moving altogether and almost seemed to blend right in with the surrounding stars. it was as if i took my eye off it, i wouldn't be able to pick it back out of the night sky. so i kept my eyes directly on the light for about a minute or so. \r\n  i was starting to think that maybe i was just seeing things when the light started moving again to the southwest. it travelled the same way as above for about 5 seconds, turned sharply to the northwest, and just shot away, building up to amazing speed, (using my \"math\" to try and figure it's original speed, and using 10 miles a minute as my baseline, i would say it built up to at least 3500 mph within a 15 mile span), and was gone with no return. \r\n at no time did i hear any noise or any sonic boom, anything like that. \r\n  i have spent countless hundreds of hours watching the night sky, it is one of my favorite things to do - especially up there where there are no city lights and such to interfere with skywatching. i have seen some truly strange things over the years, but all could be explained somewhat regularly. in 20 years, this light was something of the sort i have never seen before, or even supposed could exist as it did. and, no, it was most definately not a searchlight of any kind.\r\n making the turns as it did and accelerating so quickly like that just doesn't seem possible to me. although i do believe that life exists throughout our universe, i also have believed that - even if an advanced something or another that could travel through space from points unknown exists/existed - the nature of time throughout the universe would make our visiting each other, (2 different, intelligent species), an impossibility. such as if one society rises and falls somewhere in the universe, can travel the stars, all that - but time has seen them come and go millenia ago.\r\n i have always thought that time was the great divider between us ever realizing with full proof that intelligent life exists as ours does.\r\n\r\n  now i'm not so sure.\r\n  that light carried a lot of meaning in it for me, in it's impossibility, improbability, and definate existance.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then
