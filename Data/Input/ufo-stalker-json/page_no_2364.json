to watch it started to make a large arc around the north-eastern portion of the sky and started heading south. it was making large arcs, at an impressive speed, so we had no idea how to classify it. \r\nwe lost sight of the object when it became so faint in the southern sky we could no longer track it. \r\nit was definitely too high to be a plane, especially at the speed it was moving. it also

(see above about room mates. lol ) i gave up and sat down outside in the cold again, on the driveway. in the cold.\r\n\r\nit was while i was sitting on the driveway that i just happened to look up and there it was. at first i thought 'plane?' because it was dark and i saw the lights straight off. but instantly i knew it wasn't. i suddenly saw a ...For lack fo a better term... saucer shaped thing. no, more like two bowls glued together sort of shape. it had lights all around it and was coming out of the heavy clouds. it was also competely quiet.  it was not high up either.\r\n\r\ni wasn't afraid when i first saw it. i knew it was looking for me. but i was emotionally strung up about the arguement with room mates and felt homesick, plus this ufo on top of things... so as soon as i realized it was looking for me, i panicked, i rang the house phone and made the room mate let me in, even if she was putting baby to bed. (i would have waited otherwise in the cold.)\r\n\r\nwe live under frequent air traffic. planes come and go all the time above us, quantus, virign mostly... and we can hear them, even when they're on the horizon, they are coming down to land at brisbane airport. this wasn't one of them. it was low, i could see the shape, it had no sound even so close.\r\nit was not that hte wind blew the sound away- i'd watched several big airplanes just ten or twenty minutes ago. and this ufo was upwind, sound would have traveled to me,\r\n\r\nanyway, as i got indoors, it passed over some houses about twenty metres away, heading for the park that i had been sitting at. like it was unsure where i was.\r\n\r\ni would normally take pictures but i really wasn't in an emotional state to think about  that! \r\n\r\nbut even with my panic, even though you' assume i'd sit with people... so i felt safer... i went to my room. on my own. shut the door, lay down, and fell asleep. i woke up at about 9:50pm... maybe... and felt so groggy, so out of it. i didn't feel fluish anymore, just really stunned and numb, like a lesser extent of what i felt like after general anesthetic. someone had been knocking on the door and i hadn't even heard them, i'd just gotten up for water and for panadol. and i couldn't bring myself to tell anyone about it till today. there was too much stuff going on last night to tell them. \r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, 101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

clouds, like maybe 60,000 feet, 2) had a brilliant glow when the sun would shine on it, and 3) appeared to be a little round ball with no wings. also as i watched it, it didnt seem to be moving along like a jet plane, but seemed to meander along as if it where being pulled or towed.  it had not wings, no contrail, and no noise. stayed on a n.E. to s.W heading and if i had to guess, i would say air speed to be around 1000 miles and hour, as it crossed my  field of vision in about four minutes, at an altitude of at least 60,000 ft. i have a feeling that i may have been looking at a satellite, but dont know if satellites can be seen in broad daylite, even with the sun reflecting of them, but this object did have a really high level of brightness when it would come from behind the clouds into the sunlite.  i guess if i go to the park at 11:00 am tommorrow and look up in the same spot ill see it again if in fact it was a satellite. anyway it dissapeared of to the southwest out of my field of vision, and just after that, i observed to jets moving in the same general direction behind

other kids so i could not have been the only one that saw this thing. something caught my eye and i look up and tried to make sense of what i was looking at i first thought it was a helicopter but i did not hear the blades then i thought it was a plan but there was no sound and it stayed in one spot i could not take my attention away from this thing when i came back to my senses i had not realized that some time had passed it was like every thing around me continued and i was there but i wasn't and that the basketball court was full of kids and when i came out of looking at this thing

the cotton trailer picking up cotton off of the ground and tossing it back in the trailer.  we all saw a red glowing or shimmering ball in the sky about 15 to 20 feet off of the ground floating in the air above the cotton field.  it scared me and i climbed up into the trailer with my father and grandfather as quickly as i could and then turned and looked at the ball again. it floated up about a foot and then floated down about a foot and then just popped out like turning off a light.  the ball was about 3 to 4 feet in diameter.  it was perfectly round in shape.  i later was told that another man about  a mile away also saw it and it scared him so bad that he stopped the cotton picker that he was driving and ran to the house.  please let me know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this .  my grandfather died about 10 years later but every once in a while he would jokingly ask me if i had seen the u f o again and smile or chuckle.    thanks,  gary

mount charleston, i see white and green lights appear flash, hover and disappear from time to tiime. i can tell it is above for sure because i can see the silhouette of the mt top at times, not only that but sometimes they are so bright that if there are clouds present, they illuminate the entire cloud with its glow! every time i see them i get goose bumps and chills even though i ve seen them a thousand times. note: i recently saw  a show on crafts in the sky and they are very similar to the lights that were seen over the mountains in phoenix.","distance":"Over One
