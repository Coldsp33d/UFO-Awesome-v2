States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Shortly after sunset in early january, 2008, as stars began to appear on the eastern horizon, i took my dogs into my backyard for their evening jaunt.  living approximately 3 miles from a county airport, i expect to see aircraft of all types flying overhead in a regularly known landing pattern.  and, as a retired usg official who held a top secret clearance i have seen a multitude of different aircraft.  i have aways been a reluctant believer of life elsewhere in the universe but unable to believe the earth was being routinely visited by life elsewhere.  however, the events of that evening were clear and convincing proof to me of both.  i have attempted to analyze and absorb the event over the past 9 months and put it into some rational context.  frankly, i can't and, i now understand why ufo witnesses are so reluctant to come forward.  it began innocently enough.  as i stood in my backyard watching my dogs, i was startled by an intense flashing red light from the corner of my eye that seemed to come from an aircraft only vaguely outlined. the craft was so low that it seemed to be on a crash course in my own neighborhood, actually next door, which is why i was startled.  as i turned east to get a better look, i clearly saw a black matted triangular craft against a darkening skyline silently hovering about 100 feet over my neighbors house with a pulsing red light beneath the craft.  it was not moving at all, and there was absolute silence.  i was completely transfixed by this sight.  my thoughts were that this couldn't be happening, but it was.  so, i rapidly tried to put the craft into some context which i understood.  i began to compare what i was witnessing with a list of the kinds of aircraft with which i was familiar - none fit.  it seemed to be relatively flat on top and bottom with equidistant but rounded sides with no visible windows or visible projections on its surfaces.  i also began comparing the size and shape of the craft with my toyota suv which was immediately below the craft, with my neighbor's house also below the craft, and with the 50 foot tall trees in my backyard which were bare since it was winter.  in relative measure to these known objects, the craft was as large as my neighbors house and most of his backyard combined.  so, it seemed to be about 100 to 125 feet on each of 3 sides and about 20 feet in thickness with a dense black matte covering.  by comparing the height of the trees in our yards with the craft, the craft was silently hovering approximately 100 feet above my neighbor's house. the red light at the front of the craft was unlike any i have seen on existing aircraft - it was incredibly intense and clear, almost like a super led.  it was located under the craft at one end of the triangle that appeared to be the front of the craft.  the craft also seemed to have an equally intense white light eminating from the rear end but its source was not clearly apparent at the angle the craft was to me at that time. that white light was not the same as the flashing lights on wingtips of known aircraft.  this white light was not flashing or pulsing but was steady and appeared to be of a soft but equally intense quality of light.   after approximately 5 minutes, the craft made a 90 degree turn to the east and began drifting slowly and silently away. as it turned, i was able to see two large circles each approximately 8-10 feet in diameter at either side at the end surface of the craft which were the sources of the white light i had only seen before from an angle.  the white light was steady and intense but of a softer nature than the flashing red light.  after another 5 or so minutes, the craft had slowly moved out of sight.  in closing, let me note that i was absolutely stunned by this event and speechless or otherwise i would have attempted to make some effort to contact the craft.  i have never seen anything like this in my life.  it was not a us aircraft.  i don't believe that any other nation has this kind of technology at the present time.  the only conclusion i am able to draw from this event is that the craft was clearly and purposely surveiling the area.  it was also clear that the craft saw me watching it but made no attempt to contact me or to evade the area.  on reflection, i'm sure those piloting the craft could not perceive any threat to its presence from anyone.  one final note, for some unknown reason, my dogs did not respond to its presence, they were quiet and not frantic - it seems that reaction is reserved for the postman.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:10:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

employment. my story or experience has been held quiet in my heart for a long time. i wasn't able to tell it to anyone exept my grandmother, and she looked at me in doubt & suspicion rather than believing when i told her about the event.\r\nit was a windy night starry night in a very small town of patin-ay, & i was escorting my little cousin home to their little hut on a hill more than a mile from my grandmother's. it was a newly constructed village & the road going there was rough gravel with grasses on the side with a  height almost 9 ft long. when i reached my destination my uncle told me about some crazy dog on the loose so he lend me his samurai for my protection. on my way back, while being aware of the danger, i was getting more excited about the samurai so i aimed & hitting those tall grasses along the side of the road when suddenly, a very bright liquid-bluish light coming fast towards my direction flying very low (a height of 3 coconut trees) at fast speed that my eyes can fairly describe it. i can remember that i was mentioning bad words (more like holy [pd]! expresion in my language caused by exitement)when i saw the object and turned sharply to other direction until i could no longer saw it on the tall grasses. i was stunned of what i saw, the hair in my arms were standing & gave me continuos shivers. the closest thing to describe it is like from a movie called \"the abyss\" when an unknown small object passed through the nuclear sub, end up losing power & heading for a crash, that was it! but it was bluish, liquidish more like organic. since then after i told my grandma & saw her reaction, i never told it to anyone, until now. later, i saw your website feature on yahoo so i decided to contribute the story to you rather than the story dies with me & remain untold. my mind expanded since then, & have great understanding that the universe is a very big place that only we human beings alone can inherit.\r\n\r\np.S. the object was more like

things but i realized that the star was actually moving and descending at a what appeared to be a slow pace. i continued to observe it's path and realized that it was picking up speed as it continued it's descent. i knew it was getting closer because it continued to grow as it came down. it's color was intermittent, from white to royal blue to white to royal purple but touching in between colors like teal and lilac as it changed. it seemed egg shaped as it moved but when it finally halted it was spheric. it's hard to judge to give an accurate measurement of how high it stopped because i could barely see the mountains in the dark due to a lack of moonlight, but i'd estimate it hovered at maybe 5ooo feet and was about 2 miles away from my position. it just stood there changing colors for about 2 minutes and began to move away in a sort of cartoonish manner with minimal pauses as it traveled, almost hesitantly. suddenly, it ascended vertically into the air and in relation to the face of a clock shot like a tracer 6-12-7-3-10-3-8-12-6-12 and was gone. like it had never been there. i got freaked and excited like getting off of the rollercoaster for the first time. i tried to tell

have a clue what it takes to propel aircraft. was on the telephoe with my mom and my door was open so i assume it was a cooler time of year. next door to me was a large parking lot of an oriental buffet. i looked out the door and thought what the hell. so i go out on my porch and in broad daylight there was a round craft hovering 20 feet above my roof top but over the parking lot next door so i could see it clearly.. if i had a camera i'd be very famous today.. it was pretty much the typical looking saucer pictures you see and it had pie cut shaped pattern lights under it and the lights curved as they turned. i looked for any means of propulsion to include fans propelers or jet exausts and believe me there were none. after a few minutes it slowly started moving over my roof so i went to my front door to see it pass over, as it was going very slowly, and when i opened my door and went out it was no where to be seen. i have told very few people about this but it told me there is something out here and i have no doubt there is.. i almost called the local radio station to report it, so people in cars could see, but i figured they would think i was nuts. i watched the news that night and the next day and no one reported it.. i know what i saw and i know it wasn't from this earth.. i am 49 now and the usa hasn't came up with anything close to this craft yet so that just reinforces it in my mind.. since then i have decided that light was the source of its propulsion..\r\n\r\ni just saw your news report on yahoo and heard phoenix so i had to tell my story.. the guys

more like a planet and yet it was no planet cause it was way too big (bout 1/5 size of moon) and it was motion less! it was dead south and my dad was not far away probably 1/8 of a mile so i quikly returned hoping to get him and return in time so he could see this unreal sight as well. but when we got back (which was really quick)... the object i saw just above the treeline behind that

the time to look up at our sky.\r\n\r\nmy account to you is accurate as well as truthfull... you can be assured of this....    thank-you... i see that i can attatch a sketch.. i

with. all of a sudden i saw something in the sky. i was sort of freaked out so i ran inside to get my digital camera. when i came out it was still there and i took 3 pictures but only 1 turned out. we were amazed by this so we kept watching it for about 5 more minutes. it was going in a straight line left and it didnt make a noise. it also changed shapes. first it was like a disc the it turned flat. finally we kept watching it and we looked at it until it disappeared into the air right in front of our eyes. when we first saw it i thought it was a bunch of balloons but they would of been floating
