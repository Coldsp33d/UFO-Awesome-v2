tucson, arizona at the time. i was in my late twenties, he was in his mid to late 60's and still played a mean game of tennis.  he became somewhat a mentor and father-figure to me as i lost my father at an early age.  in the course of getting to know each other after matches we would sit court-side or in his apartment and chat about life, current events and our lives past.  the topic of ufo's came up frequently, as i have always been interested and had several experiences when i was around ten that involved my family.  some background on dr. fallat - he told me he spoke fluent german so while serving during wwii he was given top secret clearance and dropped behind enemy lines many times on spy missions.  this factors in because he said the government never revoked that clearance. when he got out and went to college he became a biochemist.  he told me he taught biochemistry, mainly at pittsburg university.  some of this is out of sequence.  as i said, the topic of ufo's came up, particularly the roswell incident one afternoon and i rambled on about what i have read and dr. fallat listened, as he always did, with a pipe in his mouth.  i finally paused, he looked at me and asked, \"i was wondering son. how you know so much about this topic.\" (meaning roswell) i told him i had read a great deal. he stated he had never spoken to his own family about what he was about to tell me... he said he was one of a handful of scientists that got to examine the bodies that crashed at roswell.  because of his top secret clearance and his new status as a biochemist he was well trusted by them.  he told me they were about 3 and 1/2 feel tall, pale greyish skin; a breast bone that ran from the chest all the way down to where genitals should be; some similar internal organs and some they could only guess at what they were and did; they deemed their eyesight so accute that they could actually see \"through\" objects. there were some other details given that i didn't give here.  it seems a small piece of a huge puzzle but i wanted someone to know about this in case anything happened to me.  if i can answer any questions or be of any further assistance please feel free to contact me.  thank you for your efforts and time in this very important matter to our lives on planet earth.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12714,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0528081,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09222008-0010","longitude":-111.0874711,"occurred":-710265600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-710265600000,"summary":"Biochemist

80 objects. the sky was completely clear, no clouds. they were scattered over the sky but generally in a loose formation, some higher, some lower, the lowest ones would have been a few thousand feet, i saw a few airliners that were flying higher than them, some objects were very high, maybe 20,000 feet +. i watched them for 15 minutes till they dissapeared out of sight. there was no sound at any time from the objects. one object was a pulsating light, not like an aircraft strobe light, but very slowly pulsating. another object was behind the main group and moving faster, apparrently to 'catch up'. another object looked like something was dangling underneath it, it sounds silly, but the best way i can describe it was that it looked like a ' flying jellyfish'. that doesn't make logical sense to me, but i can only report it as i saw it. \r\n\r\nthe next day i called the control tower at luton airport (the closest airport to the sighting), i spoke to the senior controller on duty and asked if they had seen anything on radar, he replied that they hadn't. i received a letter from the ministry of defence a week later saying that how 'most ufo sightings can be explained as ordinary natural things.) basically treating me like an idiot, as if i could have mistaken 'planes' or 'stars' for a fleet of luminous ufos (in broad daylight and in clear weather no less) a clear and obvious effort to downplay the situation, no matter how ridiculous the official 'explanation' was to anyone with half a brain. i never felt afraid during the sighting, and had a strong feeling that these objects were intellingently controlled, and that they were trying to make themselves known to people, to show that they were peaceful. the conditions for the sighting could not have been better. at that time it was too early to see stars, even if it wasn't, i know what i saw, it was blatantly obvious. \r\na few days later i contacted the editor of ufo magazine at the time, graham birdsall, and told him of my sighting. he said that other people had reported similar sightings in other parts of england in the weeks before mine, and that also someone else in london had seen what i had, had videotaped it, and that it would be available to buy though ufo magazine.\r\ncould i say in certaincy what these objects were? no. i can say with certaincy what they were'nt. they were'nt planes, helicopters, 'balloons' or anything 'normal'.

about 2 weeks ago.  ever since then, we started going outside at night, usually after 9pm, and sit on the front porch to look at it.  at first we thought it was the satellite station because it was brighter than the other stars, but we then realized we were wrong, since we spotted the station directly opposite of this object.  how did we know it was the station?  i looked up the schedule online and it stated that the satellite station would be in my area between sept 8 - 20.  it is now the 21st and this object is still outside, only this time it's situated in another area.  i did some research online about stars.  yes, stars emit color but usually it is only one color.  this object emits several colors: blue, red and green.  not only that, it shifts.  i remember the other night, we went outside around 10:15pm to check this \"star\" out.  it was situated just above the roof of the house in front of us.  literally about 40 minutes later, it shifted to the right of the house in front of us.  yes, i understand that stars shift due to the earth's rotation.  as a matter of fact, i read that stars \"shift by about 1/365th of 360 degrees per day, which is something like one degree\".  the key words here are \"per day\".  not \"per 40 minutes\".  \r\n\r\nmy initial feeling were goosebumps and then a thought came to me, a ridiculous thought: don't stare at it or its light will paralyze you and lure you in...Yes, ridiculous.  i'm still here, thank god.  i'm wondering if this object is here on a mission.  gathering information.  or perhaps reading our minds...In any case, i am not afraid.  i don't believe in the whole \"war of the worlds\" idea, rather, i feel they're like scientists, definitely more advanced than we are, here to do research.

large object flying east se over my house for less than a minute on 13 sep. 2004 after the object disappeared over clouds a small aircraft on near the same rout flew over at that time i realized how large the object must have been and how fast it must have been traveling and at what altitude.\r\n\r\n this event happened 4years ago this month and i would like to post it here for more to see,i did report this to the national ufo reporting center, the above description is the exact copy of the report. i would like to add some details to the report. i was waiting to be contacted by someone and give them this information at that time, however no one ever did try and contact me, so here is the rest of the story.\r\n the object i witnessed was indeed very large it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up when i realized just how massive it was, and the speed at which it had to be moving, to this day i hardly can believe it myself, i still try and calculate the time and distance it traveled during the time i watched it and to come up with a approximate speed.\r\n  it was late afternoon the sun was still up but low just going behind the mountains and setting fast here in colorado springs. the sky was clear except for a couple of billowing (cumulonimbus)clouds south east from my house.\r\ni was sitting in a chair on my back deck when i happen to look up and seen this large chevron shaped object above the peak of my house moving in a se direction. i did not take my eyes off from it and tried to get the best imaged to remember by scanning from one end to the other and looking for the smallest detail i could possibly get. the under side of it had what appeared to be round lights or blisters of some type. if they were lights they were only a dim yellowish glow. in fact the whole craft was some what subdued i remember thinking if i had not been looking up at the time it was above me it would have been very difficult to spot, meaning the reflection of the sun was not evident on this object. the total time i was able to observe this was about 5 to 7 seconds. during my observation i notice that a cloud would be in its flight path and i figured it would pass under it due to the distance the cloud was to the se. when this object passed well above the cloud is when i had some what of a reference to it size and speed. this is when hairs on the back of my neck stood up as well as goose bumps covered my arms as it continued out of sight.\r\n my back ground is retired usaf with 21yrs 6mo. most of which i held a (sbi) top secret clearance. i was on flying status in the air force and have over 3000 hrs in the kc135 flying command post aircraft  part of flight crew. i also have been a private pilot for the past 12yrs and own a airplane that i fly out of meadow lake airport east of colorado springs.\r\ni have been in and around aircraft most of adult life. i do know this craft that i seen is larger and faster than anything man has built. this is why for the past 1460 + days sense i witnessed this i can't help but look up when i go outside and wounder where it came from and if it went back yet.\r\n sorry i waited so long to give you the rest of the facts to the sighting i encountered. \r\n  ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,  Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

not look like what i have seen on pictures or tv.) the small one moved up at incredible spped and dissapeared.  the one closer just dissapeared, almost at the same time, it was like it had turn the lights off ... like they knew i had seen them.\r\ni told my family but of course noone believes me! i kept looking for a reappearance until midnight, but the sky was just dark.  i want to know if someone else saw something unusual like me

the skies were dark, with the mountains outlined with light from the recent setting sun. at this time of night, stars were beginning to appear, expecially the bright ones on the horizon. while cooking up dinner i noticed two bright stars appearing in the sw sky. this was nothing to take note of. but, 10 minutes later one of the stars began move east, ne. it simply looked like a star, but moving toward me, in silence and grace. it got bigger the closer it got to me. there were planes in the sky and this certainly wasn't one of them. the guy in the campsite next to me saw it and we tried hard to figure out what it was. for about 45 seconds we watched it as it moved closer to us. there was a band of low clouds in the sky east of the object. the object moved in a straight path into (or behind) the clouds. it was a thin, narrow cloud and we expected the object appear on the other side of the cloud within just a few seconds of entering it. it did not. we sat there trying to figure out where it went. the cloud thinned a little bit and we saw the object again, but it was much smaller and seemed alot further away. my guess is that when the object moved behind the cloud, it changed trajectory and moved at a 90 degree angle toward the south, sw. the cloud moved on toward the east, leaving us with nothing to observe. the object was gone at that point. i was astonsished at what we just saw. it object itself was a bright star looking sphere. it got larger as it move closer to us. i couldn't tell the size of it. it moved slow and remained the same shape and luminescense. it was sureal. i did my best to write it off as a plane, helecopter, blimp, satelite, etc. it was none of the above. it was graceful, peaceful, and moved in such a away that i couldn't take my eyes off of it. whats more amazing is that it was in the sky for at least 10 minutes, hovering above the mountain skyline, before i noticed it was moving toward us. and it apparently changed direction, and before we knew it, it looked to be 1000 miles away from us. as an optimistic, \"want to beleive\" person, i firmly beleive that this was the most legitimate \"ufo\" i've seen to date. i've seen other oddities in the sky before, but this one was the most convincing.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

sky that was blue rectangle doorway.\r\n\r\ni was in bed at the time in an upstairs bedroom, went to bed about 11:00 pm that night june 4 th, 2002, slept for a few hours, then i awoke in my bedroom about 3:38 am, june 5th, 2002, i saw the gray type u-fo creatures four of them inmy room, with a hole in the ceiling roof looking out at the night sky, and i thought to myself, they're here again, i short to sit up, and i check the clock it read 3:38 am, i felt a neele and then a pain in the back of my chest. and i feel my close moving by themselves. any i think to myself, why is this happening? looked at the time its 3:52 am, a doorway in the roof of the bedroom opened up and the roof had footsteps on it. i felt a needle in my left arm at 4:10 am. i started to quote a bible verse at them which was deuteronomy 7:20-26, and they started to stay to them selves and i heard has it were like a girls voice said, \"he got that myth book and he's reading some myths from that book.\" before they started dropping to the ground. 4:17 am i was picked up. i can see all the roof top's of the houses and their's a holes in them, and they were taking others out too, then i looked where they were taking me a hole in the heavens like a square doorway. the dark cloudy sky i'm flying up above. and theres a doorway in the starry night lit sky. and then i'm through this doorway and in some sort of room  on a table, needle in my eye. hurts. i see a metal table needles in arm's, back, and penis ((hurt), warmth, relaxing and then can't feel hand is numb, hard to think, feel left index finger of left hand chest right side lungs. why are they doing this to me? why? tell me why?... then i'm taken back to the house through the roof,  i remember, listening to the thundering backwards, sounds. that about 7:30 am... \r\n\r\nafter this i couldn't write it kept coming out backwards, from that night. thou i had i parasite or something moving around inside of me. i went to the doctor and they just brushed it off as just a fatty tissue.\r\nso later a 6 months goes by the thing moving around in side of me, i showed it to my family and friends, and they told me to go have it removed, because they felt it moving when they touched it, i went back to the doctor and said touch this i grabbed this hand and pushed it over the spot were it was, he jumped back, i then said i want it cut out now.\r\n\r\nhe, give me the name of a surgen, of which i went to, had it removed, a the pathology said that it was the ussaul fatty tissue with an abnormal parasite that was nothing they had seen before.\r\n\r\nnow, if this happens again, i'm going to cut it out myself. \r\n\r\ni don't know if this has happen to other as will, but i sure would like to know, about other thing's like this...\r\n\r\ndon't have much to say. about it, tried to get a hypnotist to find out more about this. but they don't bother with me...\r\n\r\nplease don't disregard this. i know their's something to this. thundering's sound in reverse... iit has a lot to do with them. and the grey's are violent race of being's, as are the brown ones and the green reptilian type, i want to fight to stop them... i'll do anything to learn to fight back...    ii couldn't sleep at night after that, for a little over 2 yrs., sometimes i still have trouble with

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving se on roseville parkway, with the galleria mall on my left; i had just passed reserve drive and was approaching harding blvd when i saw a big bright, slowly pulsating red light that was slowly hovering forward about 80 - 100 feet above the mall. i was 90% sure that what i was looking at was not a helicopter, as i've seen a flying triangle twice before in my life (2 separate instances 10 years ago that i haven't reported here- will do so soon).\r\n\r\ni quickly passed over into the left lane and stopped at the red light at roseville pkwy and harding blvd. i rolled down my window to get a clearer look at the craft (car needs a wash, hehe) and i saw that it was most definitely a flying triangle, flying in reverse! what i mean by this is it was flying with a flat end forward; the two circular lights underneath the front-facing end were white, the rear light was the pulsating red light, and there was no central light/it wasn't \"turned on.\" the previous two times i saw these, the configuration was three white corner lights and a central red pulsating light. and that's how they're usually described in other reports. so that's pretty interesting. anyway, i know it wasn't a helicopter because i saw the triangular outline of the craft as well, and could see that the body was black, even against the night sky, which was illuminated due to the mall parking lot lights. i estimate the craft was about the size of a fighter jet. also, the craft was totally silent. i could hear the heavy traffic of the cars around me, but could not hear an engine from the craft above me.\r\n\r\ni reached for my cell phone and tried taking a picture of the craft, but it flew behind the marquee of the mall, directly to my left (>_< !!!). (this was probably when the craft was at its closest to me when i had visual contact, and with the help of google maps i'm estimating this was ~200 feet away from me, and perhaps ~80 feet off the ground). i waited for it to emerge and tried getting a picture but it then was obstructed by a streetlamp, and as i glanced at my light i noticed it had turned green, so i made a u-turn on roseville pkwy so i could follow the craft.\r\n\r\nit seemed to be making a slow circle over this corner parking lot, so i pulled into the mall at reserve drive, turned right at galleria circle, then made the first possible turn into the parking lot there. (by this time, as it fully set in that i was witnessing another flying triangle after a loooong 10 year wait, and was in active pursuit of the thing, i had a massive rush of adrenaline, or fear, or both, because my left leg started shaking involuntarily, my heart was fluttering, and my whole body was slightly trembling). at this point i had lost sight of the craft, until i was at the edge of the parking lot facing roseville pkwy. i saw that it was flying sw.\r\n\r\ni turned around back to roseville pkwy, and went forward onto reserve dr when the light turned green. as i did so, i called my mom on my cell and said \"guess what i'm following right now?\" she said \"no!\" she immediately knew what i was talking about, because each of the times i saw a triangle 10 years ago, she had been driving me home (from a friend's birthday party each time, oddly). i told her i was going to try to follow it and hung up.\r\n\r\nbut as it turns out, i had made a boneheaded error by going down reserve drive. being uneducated about my hometown, the one i've lived in for my whole life, i didn't know that reserve drive was not a through road connecting to another major thoroughfare. but it probably didn't matter anyway, because after i had pulled out of the mall, the craft had picked up considerable speed. by the time i got to the dead end of reserve drive, the triangle had flown several miles away toward the red warning lights on a tower i took to be the one at around baseline rd and walerga rd, which is about a 6 mile drive according to google maps, so perhaps 5 miles as the crow (or grey :p) flies. from my perspective it seemed that the craft had basically reached those warning lights by the time i reached the end of reserve drive, which was probably 40 seconds or so (i was going about 50, it's a 20mph zone... sorry. there wasn't any traffic on this road though!) for something to fly away that fast, it would have to make a noise, if it were a conventional aircraft. but there was no engine noise - total silence, as when i had seen it circling over the mall parking lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nanyway, there's actually more to this story. i made a u-turn and went west on roseville pkwy to try to follow the craft, but lost sight of it pretty quickly thereafter (about this time, my leg stopped shaking, and my body stopped trembling). \r\n\r\ni drove around for awhile after that. went all the way down baseline rd, toward the airport, thinking the craft might be headed that way, then after not seeing anything anywhere (which would be easy because this area is flat farmland, not really illuminated, you can see more stars, etc.) i made a u-turn just before pleasant grove rd (not to be confused with pleasant grove blvd). headed back to the mall, then drove to wendy's. got a #9 with a sprite. dee-lish. waited in the parking lot, looking up through the moonroof as i chowed down, didn't see anything. drove home, then went for a very long walk.\r\n\r\nat around 11:30 pm, as i was walking westward on blue oaks blvd, i saw directly to my right (the north) a craft flying low, also to the west, maybe 5 miles away. i'm pretty sure it was the triangle, turned on its side: i saw one strobing white light, perhaps 5 quick pulses, followed by three red lights in a triangle pattern, this time with a central red light. this pattern kept repeating: five-ish white light strobes (seemed like just one white light), lasting about a second, then darkness for maybe half a second, then all of a sudden the triangular red lights would come on really bright and solid, lasting maybe two seconds, then a half second of darkness. rinse and repeat. i quickened my pace to keep up with the triangle, then eventually had to start jogging, then running flat out, until i ran out of breath at about crocker ranch rd (god i'm out of shape). shortly thereafter i lost sight of the craft.\r\n\r\n\r\nall in all, a pretty awesome night! hope i don't have to wait another 10 years to see one of these mysterious triangles.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change","formattedAddress":null,"id":12689,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.7549335,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09212008-0006","longitude":-121.2807059,"occurred":1221969780000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1221969780000,"summary":"Triangle hovering over mall, then taking off rapidly","tags":["triangle","hovering"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12689_submitter_file1__Map1_SacramentoAreaRoads.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12689_submitter_file2__Map2_SummaryOfTwoSightings.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12689_submitter_file3__Map3_RosevilleGallerial_AreaSatPhoto.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12689_submitter_file4__Map4_RosevilleGalleria_AreaStreetMap.jpg","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12689_submitter_file5__Map5_RosevilleGalleria_GroundTrack.jpg"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Roseville, California","triangle":true,"type":"Black Triangle Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:327381"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2366}
