had at that time a regular habit of going to the hottub every night at seven. i was engaged in conversation with two other people there talking about the troubles small business have, or somesuch. i sat on the edge of the hottub with my feet in the water and lay back. it's an outside hot tub with a great view of the sky and mountains. i'm looking up at the sky chit-chatting with these other two

about to ask you the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nwhat the three of us saw were two brightly lit, completely silent, oval shaped objects moving in perfect unison. one slightly ahead and to the left of the other, moving as if they were attached. directly overhead. they were not a single object because we could see stars between them. they had come over the mountain and were moving across the valley towards the airbase. they seemed to be the size of largish airplanes. they were not blimps. we lost sight of them in a strange way, they appeared to become transparent the further they got from us. as we watched them, they got dimmer and dimmer until they were over the brightness of the strip and disappeared completely. the sighting lasted about ten minutes.\r\n\r\ni checked my watch, which i used to make sure i wasn't at the hottub for too long, and thus know the exact time of the encounter.","distance":"101-500

clouds.  this occured in the northeast sky from where i was walking through cheeseman park in the capitol hill area of denver.  initially, i thought it could be a low flying helicopter or plane catching the sun's reflection.  i was waiting for it to turn so i could identify it.  instead, it kept rising in a straight trajectory for maybe two minutes before it entered the clouds.  given the distance and altitude of the clouds, the object was probably much further away than i had originally thought.  it also means the object must have been quite large.  \r\n\r\nduring the time of the sighting, 2 fighter jets flew overhead at subsonic speeds. they were flying in a straight line probably within 10 miles of the object. within 5 minutes of the sighting, several high altitude planes flew over following the same general flight path taken by the fighter jets.\r\n\r\ni do not know if this was some kind of test launch.  however, i saw no exhaust or any indication of how the object

brother and sister in the back seat. we were driving in my mom's 1967 oldsmobile convertible, a very fine car. we had a summer house on the jersey shore in beach heaven which was a few hours drive from our trenton home. during this time the jersey pine lands were undeveloped and the drive was dark, remote and long, unlike what it is today. in a barren stretch of road we all see it in the sky. it was enormous, so large i could not see the ends, i saw just the belly of the craft. it was before us and mom pulled over to watch it. we all saw it, it was unbelievable. it was dead silent and floated barely above tree level and it did not make a sound. we huddled together. the crickets stopped whistling. one of it's lights focused on us and it stopped directly above us. i remember how it lit my moms skin, an unusual light not like florescent or incandescent or neon but more like todays led's except a thousand times more intense.\r\n\r\nas fast as it came it was gone, with smaller crafts zipping around it, as we continued to the shore an excessive amount of military trucks passed us. we were right outside of fort dicks military base. what struck me was instead of the soldiers looking at us or at ground level they all looked up. we knew it was about what we saw.\r\n\r\nthis was before everyone had cellular phones and when we got to the shore house mom called dad who was still in trenton. she told him what we had seen and then came our realization of the time gap. over six hours had passed and we can account for only ninety minutes, that's the normal drive time.\r\n\r\nmy dad instructed us not to say anything to anybody and the secrete was kept until 2000. i was living in california and my brother called me home to new jersey to help care for our dieing mother. i brought it up asking her if she remembered and she did, every little detail exactly as i did, so did my brother and sister. my mother seemed relived to retell the story, but she asked me something strange, \"did they hurt you?\".\r\n\r\nwe all noticed that we all have the same scoop mark on our legs, and a patch where no hair grows on the other. i had medical problems and the doctor noticed scars in my organs from previous surgeries. not odd except for the fact that i never had any surgery.\r\n\r\nthe blue light appeared in my life several times over the years, once on the nj turnpike with fireballs, once in my hollywood home with a flickering man and witnessed by my partner and again camping in remote woods. i figured it to be saint elmo's fire until i realized it occurred too many times for me to witness that rare light so often.\r\n\r\ntoday i am frail and sick with complications that can not be diagnosed. i believe my conditions to be related to that event.

night sky and the mountains in the horizon to my north (toward interstate 10 highway), i noticed, to my right, away from the airport and seemingly a much farther distance away, a very small dot of light, moving from the northwest to the southeast at a very high rate of speed, far too fast to be any kind of airplane.\r\n\r\ni tracked its fast move across the horizon for a couple of seconds, but it was small to begin with, and began to fade from my view as it moved farther away. and it moved into an area bathed with light from a very bright moon.\r\n\r\nit absolutely, positively was not an airplane. it was a very small dot of yellowish-whitish light. no airplane i've ever seen, even flying at the highest altitude, looks that small in the sky. and again, it was travelling much too fast

through the sky, this shot across it. it was also much lower in the night sky, just above the mountain range north of the i-10.\r\n\r\nit occurs to me that it could be a meteorite, but it was not

children.  i was in my bed and saw 3 greys gliding in at the foot of my bed.  i sat up and shut my eyes thinking when i opened them, the aliens would be gone because i must have been seeing things.  i opened my eyes and they were still there and they looked like a sick light grey-green color, like they were made of powdered donuts that went bad, a cross between a lion and a praying mantis. at some time i went into the bathroom and saw lights shining in the hall.  i have trouble remembering or even making sense of things.  i didn't care.  i ran out of the house yelling something like \"spacemen, martians, aliens...Ufo's did anybody see them?! i think some neighbors came out and i only heard one slightly negative comment like \"quit drinking\"  and i went out in the street (i lived on the corner) to see if there was anything in the sky.  it was dusky-dark.  a car drove up and a young lady told me they were the greys, that she and her husband had seen them and what did they look like to me.  \"e.T.'s parents.\"  i used to think my children were okay, that they had slept through it, but one of my daughter's had nose bleeds growing up and one developed asthma and my son had an interesting reaction. i have developmental dryspaxia and he was slow in learning to talk.  he kept saying \"a man!\"  wondering if he had seen them, i went into the toy room, and picked up a rambo doll \"a man like this?\"  he shook his head no.  then reluctantly i picked up the little e.T. figure \"a man like this?\"  he shook his head yes and i felt flushed. it would take me some time to remember the young lady who came by my house.  she was the same girl that was on the other baking pan.  i had nightmares about it for years.  one memory i have is of seeing someone hold up what looked like a small strip of bacon fat that must have been taken from me because i was laying on a table. i have marks on the sides of my knees and ankles that are faint except when i am in the bathtub. the following year i we would be threatened over the phone by a \"man in black\" and when i called the police, i was put in a mental hospital and diagnosed with severe schizophrenia.  the medicine further confused me.  my husband and i divorced and my oldest daughter and i ended up on a bus from california to nc. my other daughter and son were taken to the island my ex was from and i haven't seen them since i went back out on the bus to try to get them.  i am on ssi for post traumatic stress disorder and my learning disorder was finally diagnosed, but i have never seen anything that one would associate with schizophrenia.  i figured it must have been a mild case or something associated with the illness.  i have never been committed since. the only medication i have to take is for anxiety

cycle in about 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nthe object continues to move upward in the sky and right now it is 12:18 and it is still visable.  it has move to about 45 degrees in the sky.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

noticed a black slow low flying triangle almost directly above my head (i have a sun-roof).  the object had six white lights and all of them dimmed or grew bright at different times and speeds and not in any order.  at the time my car was not turned on and i had no music playing also my windows were open.  the object seemed to hover and not move for approx. 3-4 minutes.  it made absolutely no sound and i did not hear any engine or whirring noise as those from airplanes or helicopters etc.  i watched it and was tempted to leave but felt like it would see me and for some reason felt very scared and alone at that moment.  it suddenly made a sharp right turn without moving forward and flew off in front of me until i couldn't see it anymore.  it moved very fast almost like it was trying to get away from something.  i waited in the parking lot approx 2 mins. to try and gather my thoughts when i saw a police or ambulance helicopter flying in the same direction as which the object had gone.  perhaps they may have also seen it?  note:  i did not use my cell phne it didn't seem to be working it was turned on but seemed to be powered off.  i messed with my phone afterwards and hit a button and it lit right up.","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

i was outside looking up at the stars (or lack of from being downtown san antonio and having a heavy haze tonight in addition to light pollution) and i noticed a star object that was traversing the sky. i was standing looking northeast which is the direction the object was heading. i did notsee any other objects in the sky at this time and presumed i was looking at a satelite or space station (i don't know if the space station is over texas tonight). being that most of the stars are not visible tonight from the haze, i was surprised that i could see a satelite. as i watched the object dissapear behind neighbors tree i then saw approximately 15-30 seconds later a similiar object, star like in appearance, high in the sky, etc., coming from the north heading south-southeast. there was also a jet in the sky which at first i thought was following the object but the paths diverged and the jet stayed on a course heading south-southwest. the jet did give me a perspective of height and brightness, and so i am safe to speculate that both objects where much higher than commercial jets. again i watched this object dissapear behind trees and wasunable to watch it any further. each object was in view for about a minute, traversing the night sky in this time. the speed was steady and the brightness did not seem to vary beyond what you would expect from atmosperhic distortion.\r\n\r\nsince each object was similiar in size and brightness, but at completely intersecting flight paths it is hard to image that satelites are that close to knocking into eachother as well as being on such different courses. \r\n\r\ni was not paniced nor excited, mostly curious and observant of what i was seeing.
