beach to gulf breeze, fl. i glance out the window and see some strange craft sitting up in the air over the marina.  we pulled over to the side of the road as soon as we crossed the bridge. i have never seen anything like it before or since. it was about two to three hundred feet up in the sky and sitting there not making a sound. it was a 6 sided figure with the lines that were parallel with the horizon about 3 or 4 times longer than the other 4. it was approximately 50' wide and 15' feet high. if you can imagine that. it was divided through the middle with a line parallel with the other two longer sides. it had rows of panels along the top and bottom halves. these alternated in color from red to green to blue to yellow in such a way as to give it the appearance of the panels moving around the craft. we watched for a few minutes and then the next thing i know is that we were heading down the road and i was looking up in the sky and it was still there. we rode home without speaking and i don't remember talking about it for years. not even the next morning, it was like we had put it out of our heads. and when i would try to bring it up my buddy would say \"i don't wanna talk about it\". this has gone on now for 40 years and i still wonder about that night. \r\n   i  lived next to airbases as a child and i have never seen anything like this. pensacola naval air

else around. we were right on the boardwalk near the river palms hote. it came over us very slowly with out any any any sound at all. it was huge. the were in a v shape almost like a flock of geese but much much bigger. the entire area was so huge if you can imagine how big 16 vw bugs in the sky in a v formation  but and yet independent. we froze and stared as if we take our eyes off we may miss something. then they gradually disappeared into the coulds. no one else was around, someone is almost always around however it was midweek but still that was somewhat rare. i called the air traffic control and they did not see anything, no reports. just recently i hear that the air traffic control at laughlin closes at 6pm that was something that has bothered me for 7 and a half years that there is no way they could not see that thing. but it was about 6:30 so there was no one there to see it. they were all together however they seemed to be very independent i say that because one side seemed to move a little different almost like a push off of a wing kind of like. each one was not lite but seem to illuminate the lights shinning into the sky from the bug hotel. they almost looked opal not a light not a color but like it was reflecting light. we have gone back to the exact same spot and same time of year same time of day it just to this day boggles my mind. all i can say is what ever it was was really big and i have no ideal what it was. i would like to think they were deaf geese of extreme in size unable to honk and each a white opal in color what in the world was it i don't know i am just glad my husband saw it too! he tells no one in fear they will believe him crazy i did at first tell others but not really any more because it is unbeleivable. i have notified many on the internet however i have tried and tried to locate someone who has seen something like it the closest i have come up with is those balloons in mexico except the ones we saw were in a formation all together. that's it wish i had had a cell phone with a camera back then only a cell phone and no camera.It had us spellbound.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Actually, this one event turned into many events that still happen to this day. it started out as a quiet drive back to our house on a country road miles from our house. me and my wife were coming back from an outing and decided to take the back way to our home, which is in an area that is still mostly rural and dotted with corn and wheat fields, although development was only about ten miles behind us. at this point we were due east of celina. \r\n\r\nneedless to say, it is pitch black out there, and the only lights visible is from farm and ranch homes. the roads are long and winding. anyway we were driving along talking, and we were about to reach a curve in the road where an old cemetary and church is, when we both saw this object in the night sky that was turning all different colors. we pulled down by the cemetary on a whiterock road to get a better look at it to see what it was. i wanted to see if the object was stationary as we had observed it from the road while we were driving. as i stopped the car, lights still on, me and my wife observed that the object was truly stationary, and hovering about two or three hundred feet off the ground. now there were many trees in front of us, no bare ground, but i made an educated guess at its elevation from the ground.\r\n\r\ni decide to get out of the car to get a better look at this thing to determine if it was a helcopter, plane moving slow, a passenger jet heading for dfw airport. it was none of these things as far as i could tell. i ask my wife what she saw, and she said that she saw a stationary object turning different colors and it looked to her as if it were spinning around as it was changing colors. i told her that i agreed and we continued to watch this object until i got an idea. now, you must understand that i am not a scary person, just the opposite, and i wanted to see if i could get a reaction out of this thing to see if it would come our way, or at least acknowledge that it saw us, so despite my wife's protests, i stood in front of our car lights and waved my hands and jumped up and down to get its attention.\r\n\r\nin that kind of darkness, anyone could have seen me doing what i was doing in a plane flying much higher. i was counting on that.  well, at first nothing, but then this object went completely dark, like nothing was there, then its lights gradually came back on. i told my wife, i think i got a reaction. well, i started jumping up and down again waving my hands, and this time the object began coming our way. my wife wanted to leave, but i said let's see what this thing really is.\r\n\r\nwe did not have long to wait, because it was almost over us in a mater of about 30 seconds, but veered to our right as it got near. it had dropped altitude to about 100feet, and was slowly moving by us at about 150 yards away. the first thing we noticed was that there was no sound coming from this thing, we were listening real hard, nothing but dead quite. \r\n\r\ni told my wife that i saw an object that was triangular with three white lights at its rear, she said she saw the same thing, and that it looked like a triangular wedge shape. the different colored lights that it had been displaying were no longer being displayed. it was black in color all over. i began to follow it on foot down the whiterock road to the right of where we were parked. it began to move off from us as i motioned to it to come back our way. i wanted it to land.\r\n\r\nit continued away from us at a steady speed going southwest, finally disappearing into the night.\r\n\r\nnow i want to say that this object has been a regular visitor about a quarter of a mile away, about 200 feet up, and west of our house for two years now. it appears with its spinning multi-color lights on many nights. i have flashed my flashlight directly at it to get a response from it, and most times it will begin to spin faster and flash more colors. sometimes though it will almost stop emitting light altogether, and begin moving off to the north and west. it does not show up all the time, there are periods when i do not see it at all.\r\n\r\nbut i want to say that i have watched it trying to maintain its hovering position making movements to the left or right to keep its center of gravity. much like a person trying to keep their balance on a round ball, little corections that keeps it stable.\r\n\r\ni have even turned my back patio light on so that it can see me, and i make gestures that tell it that i can see it.\r\n\r\ni do not know what this is, i have speculated that it could be a military platform that our government is trying out over populated areas. however, i do not think that we are even capable of this type of technology, and my instincts tell me these could be some type of probes from another craft monitoring this area. you see, me and my wife have speculated that the reason that this thing or things are around here is because of all the air traffic that comes and goes north and south. it is a perfect place to observe without being noticed to much.\r\n\r\none more thing, one night a month ago, i was outside at about midnight and observed a dimly lit round object flying from west to east at about 1000 feet at a high rate of speed, no sound.\r\n\r\nall i can say about these things is that, why has someone else not seen this, and how could they not. with no pictures, video, or anything, it is just my word, and personal account.\r\n\r\nend of event.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering

and he wanted to show us some things. we went a few hours later and he went on to explain many ufo sightings and showed us many new forms of music that we had never heard before.He even later that eveningclaimed to show us a light in the sky that he said was a spaceship. we went back to out cabin and were a littleunnerved by the whole storybut not unbelieving. a few years later we ended up moving there.And there was what we called a spaceship school there. it was ran by two women hope and grace and they claimed to have communications with the brothers of light that inhabited these spaceships.There were a good number of students who attended that were our age and we visited a couple of their sunday services. the story went that the main angel was gabriel and jesus himself had been at one time taken away in one of these spacecrafts. all of this would have been hard to take except for the fact that sightings of crafts were happening continually at this time and both of us with other witnesses had seen craft on more that one occasion.Still i felt uneasy about this and went to the bible and god for some help. i found three scriptures that seemed to disagree with the philosphy being taught and went to the school to ask a few questions. hope told me she loved questions from her students and we sat down for a chat i asked her the first scripture and she answered ,\"well what jesus meant by that was,..\" with a little chuckle in her voice and i said well if that's true what about this scripture and  she answered alittle more intensely \"well what jesus really meant was!!!\" andi said well if that is true then what about this scripture? hope was in her late 60-70's at the time and jumped straight in the air twirled and flew out of the room!! i was left sitting at the table with mouth opened and a litle man grabed me by the arm and said hope has a headache and i was put out the door of the trailor and left looking at the beautiful high sierras wondering if that really just happened!!The next morning i was up early and on the way to mammoth and sunsshining and the sky was blue and as clear as can be and a spacecraft came up over the pine trees in full sight and i looked at it and pointed my finger at it and said these words \"satan you're a liar! and in the name of jesus be gone\" the craft shook in the air and disappeared and i've never seen one since that day. i believe that this entire ufo lore is just the demons trying as hard as they can to do the job they do so well,deceive. it says that satan is the prince of the air and would do many miracles in the last days to fool many even the elect if that was possible.Not many have had the experience that i had or have been lead to the complete conclusion because with so many seeing is believing but the magician knows if he can distract the veiwer the trickand illusion will be a great success.I'm telling this story knowing that manywill think i'm lying or fabricating this for a personal religious view but i promise you that nothing could be further from the truth. at the time i was not a christian but these events plus others have helped me to find that way of living.I witnessed these things and tell you that i stand by this statement. michael corry sept 17th 2008

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"When i was 12 years old in 1976 my family had just moved to a new house in chesterfield sc. i was moving boxes from a van parked 150' away from our new house back and forth on a straight path and noticed a small 4'-5' diameter solid metallic disc shaped object hovering overhead at about 200ft. it was silver polished aluminum in color with a dark band about 6\" wide around the perimeter. i would guesstimate its thickness to be about 1 foot in the middle and tapering to about 6 inches at the perimeter. there were 6 pie segment lines thru the diameter of the craft. there were no other markings, insignia, id numerals, exhaust ports, antennae, landing gear, access hatches, camera ports or any visible means of propulsion. no sound was emitted. there were no flashing lights or exhaust of any kind. this was not a tethered mylar balloon or a drone of any kind(that was military or civilian in nature). i was 12 years old at the time and could identify almost any aircraft,missile or drone/rpv(very few were in service at that time). i've been an aerospace enthusiast all my life and i know pretty much any aircraft or flight vehicle that takes to the skies and i could not identify it. it was about 10oclock in the morning est and a clear blue sky with about 2-5mph cross wind to my position. the craft maintained a back and forth track perpindicular to the wind so i ruled a ballon out. and yes i'm familiar with what weather balloons of all sizes and shapes look like and this was not following the wind patterns or acting like a tethered balloon!  everytime i would move it would move to maintain position directly overhead. if i moved faster it would keep up and if i moved slower it would slow down or stop when i did. it was always directly overhead. this continued for 30 minutes. when i remembered where my camera finally was and retreived it the craft had disappeared from my line of sight. my position was atop a small hill. i had about a 2 mile line of sight in all directions and could not see it. i was only out of sight with it for about 30 seconds. as a kid no one would have believed me and thought i was crazy so i never told anyone until my adult years. i don't think i've ever questioned our belief that we're the only sentient beings in the galaxy more than after that day. i've heard reports of smaller ufo's but this lead me to believe that humans are not the only ones who might send a small recon vehicle instead of a larger craft. this was way too small to have carried any substantial sized beings in it so i assumed it was a remote or autonomous vehicle. i was unnerved at first, but i felt i was in no immediate danger. after it seemed to mimic my every move it was kind of a game for a while. i seriously thought someone might be trying to play a joke on me and looked to a nearby treeline for a tether but saw nothing. i have made homemade hot air balloons and flown helium filled balloons before and this craft did not behave as a balloon would. i really had to convince myself that this was some type of craft i had no knowledge of, given the flight profile. i'm still baffled to this day as to what that object was. thanks for running this site. i realize that there's a lot of misidentification of aircraft and natural phenomina and it's easy to mistake a man-made or natural objects for a ufo. sorry, this was a perfectly clear day and my eyesight was better than perfect at that age. i've lived around military bases for a number of years and seen all types of military and civilian aircraft plus a few bomarc missile launches and there was no mistaking that this object was extremely out of place! \r\n     i also worked for an ex-captain in the u.S. navy and after i told him what i saw he told me his story too. long story short=2 destroyer patrol sweep in the caribean during the cuban missile crisis. he was called up on deck around midnight to witness an extremely large, bright object traveling underneath the water directly in between the 2 destroyers(2 miles apart) at a high rate of speed. as it passed between them it erupted from the water at a shallow angle. there were about 100 men on deck on both ships who witnessed the huge, bright object angle from the water and flick out of sight in about 3 seconds into space. when his men asked if it was russian he replied \"it's not russian and it's not ours\". he dutifully filed a report and was asked not to pursue it by his commanders-understandibly. and he's an ivy league graduate with 2 degrees and served in the pentagon. he told me \"you're not crazy, i'm not crazy and i don't believe in church anymore!\" \r\nagain, thanks for having the conviction to run an orginization that is investigating the possibility that there are more intelligent beings than ourselves. because the alternative is downright scary(and pathetic!) if we're the most advanced species in the universe...Now that's laughable.

(1978 or, 1979). i had the summers off for a few weeks every early july (model change from gm) and that is the only reason i can associate the time with july. sorry. i was with a freind in the pool by ourselves and i was reaching up from under the dive board hanging on as we just floated enjoying the warm night air. i noticed a helocopter comming down the beach (daytona)at a slow rate of speed with a huge spotlight pointing down at the beach. it was the bright kind like you would see at an event where they shine spot lights into the air to attract people from many miles away. the light was not quite that large though, only as bright. i remember thinking that they were probably looking for people parked on the beach but that was not illegle. i also thought that maybe they were looking for couples laying on the beach making love or something. it was not like the police to make a big deal of that though would it? i wondered to myself. as the craft came closer i could only guess the distance with a certain amont of accuracy untill it got so close that the angle in relation to the ocean edge made it easy to judge. once it got approximately 80 to 90 yards it stopped for 5 -10 seconds. i cant remember what had been discussed between my freind and i to this point in time in the incident. at that point (about 5 to 10 seconds) the craft made a flare of light similar to a fireworks explosion except that eventhough the light went in all directions, it didnt go as far as a big fireworks display. maybe similar to seeing a firewoorks go off from a mile or two away. small but we know it was right in front of us. close. (80 to 90 yards) as i mentioned before , the angle was greater to the beach edge and as it got closer you cold tell that it was almost between us and the beach edge (tide). the pool we were in was about 100 or 125 yards from the water so as it got closer, you could judge easily. (especially with the spot light right there) at any rate, now as it made this fireworks -like lightfor maybe one second it vanished and stoped out over the sea about 4 or 5 miles out and hovered. (no sound) now it was just a big light but you could tell that it was now out over the sea about 4  or 5 or 6 miles but it took less than 1 second to get there from the beach with no sound ! i couldnt tell you if my freind and i looked at each other at this point and said wow ! or what! but it had hoverd about 3 or 4 seconds and did that little fireworks type light thing again and disapeared. i can distinctly remember that as i looked at my freind  the first thing i thought was that 'who would beleive this' and before i could finish asking what do we do? who do we talk to , my freind said  \"who would believe us anyway\" and this i remember because it is the same thing that i was thinking as she said it to me! it is that reason and that reason only that i can so distinctly remember this conversation. i could probably draw an example of the sighting but it is hard to explain in text. i had not spoken to anyone about this for many years and the freind and i had not discussed this matter to anyone that i know of between then and the time we had gone our seperate ways as freinds. at one point i had asked my father (passed on) about his feeling because he was a very logical and technical type person who had an answer for everything. i thought he would be the one to ask. he explained in our breif discussion that they now have experimental helocopters with jet engines on them that make them fast and agile. that was as good as his explanation got. this is a good one i thought as he never gets stumped. i was apprehensive in the first place to talk about this stuff and didnt want to argue that i couldnt hear this thing make any noise from less than 100 yards. he may have considered my remark a provocation for an argument. he was an ornery old coot. the subject was dropped at that point partly to avoid further embarassment on my part. john p.S> see attachments /  drawings.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12584,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":29.2167447,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09182008-0005","longitude":-81.0177331,"occurred":299660400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":299660400000,"summary":"No good look at the craft itself but only of the light from it.","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12584_submitter_file1__pool.BMP"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Daytona Beach, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:330036"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Mancos","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I live in outside of mancos co.,population of ~ 800 people.  i enjoy resting in my hot tub and viewing the night sky.  viewing the sky, i noticed -- what appeared to be a star, but moved slowly, in spurts, and somewhat in a pulsating manner westwardly.  movement was slow and irratic.  depending upon the angle that i saw the object; it appeared to have lights moving horizontally across in a sweeping fashion.  it also appeared as if there was a \"main\" light, but also smaller sweeping lights moving in either direction, and what appears to have no order.  difficult to determine if the object at times moved closer to the ground or was moving laterally, or combinations thereof.  seamed harmless, and difficult to determine size and distance.  two planes (i think normal flights) flew somewhat near the object ... and the object then stayed stationary and looked like an ordinary star.  shortly after each plan passed then the object would move slightly and the horizonatal lights would appear.  the horizonatal lights were predominately white in color, but on occasion ( i think i saw some green and red hues).  \r\n\r\nmy neighbor, harry kinder has mentioned he has seen several unidentified objects in the sky previously.  i too, have seen these star-like objects previously, but to be honest, i thought my imagination or eye sight may have been playing tricks upon me.  \r\n\r\ngetting back to this object, i was in the hot tub for at least an hour .. just gazing at this object, and to try to figure out if a pattern was in involved with the lighting. \r\n\r\nno photos, difficult to determine how high or size of object. appears to have moved around in the sky, then stopped, as if to look as if it were a star. \r\n\r\nmy feelings were at best neutral.  it was just there, no excitement thrill or anything.  i was more curious than anything.  it presented no harm or sudden movement.

his back yard watching stars.  we noticed two lights traveling side by side at high altitude east to west and assumed they were jets from andrews afb. suddenly the \"lights\" began to circle each other in a complex pattern that no aircraft could perform; it was as if they were orbiting each other at high speed while having stopped their forward motion.\r\nthe suddenly both objects broke contact and one went north and the other south at an incredible speed, too fast to follow. we were both so astounded by what we had seen that we ran into the house where my friend called the telephone operator. she told us that we were probably just imagining things and to tell our parents. (they were out for the evening)\r\n\r\ni have thought about this for years. looking back it seems like a thing search lights could do, however; the lights were very high and bright like planes or stars and search lights would have shown beams.  lasers might have done it, but i don't believe they had them at that time or at least not to play with.  no, these lights were flying like airplanes until they stopped and did the weird orbit thing and then vanished at high speed. certainly this could be replicated today with special effects, but we are speaking of the 1950s.\r\n\r\nof course the washington area was a hot bed of ufo activity in the late 40s and early 50s. i was born in 47 as was my friend, but we had been told stories by some older kids about jets flying low level down the potomac river\r\non many nights during that time. (i suppose to get beneath the radar) at any rate the ufo situation was something everyone seemed to take as a fact of life in the dc and northern va area back then.  all i can say is what i am

startled me. when i looked out of the window from the moving train, i saw a saucer like object that was pure grey flying really low just a little far away from the train. im totally sure it wasnt an aircraft coz there is noooo frickin way an aircraft would fly that low and there were absolutely no airports around that area as well coz we were like really far away from chennai so the idea of an aircraft flying low to land would be out of the question. this object was no jet since jets werent round and they too dont fly that low. i dont think any of this would be of any use to u guys anymore

ufo never even crossed my mind, i haden't heard about ufo's much back then. it hovered right there for about 2 minutes. i didn't hear any engine noise just a humming sound. after about a minute the lights stopped flashing and came on solid. i was starting to wonder if i should run away. then the 3 flashing lights turned off and a spotlight came out of the left side bottom. all right i've had enough, the spotlight pointed at me and i ran like hell. there was a trailer park about 100 yards back so i ran in there and hid in the restroom. i waited about 20 minutes then snuck out to take a peek and it was gone. i ran and didn't stop until i was home.  thinking back now i still have not a clue what it was, helicopter? no there was no noise. planes don't hover. as far as i know it didn't chase me. i never said anything to anyone then, they would called me crazy. i  told my wife and some relatives about it a couple years ago. they said belive me but i know they didn't so here i am wondering what the hell it was and did i almost get abducted??\r\n\r\n\r\nthe main reason i am writing this is because i would like to know if anyone else has seen anything like it?

weekend.  it was 1:30 am and i was lying in bed, which was directly in front of the only open window in the room, it had no screen.  i saw what appeared to be a shooting star go from east to west.  it started slowing down, but never lost its brightness.  it came to a stop for just a second then proceeded southward.  at this point i knew it was not a shooting star.  as soon as it started moving south it curved back to the east and sped up to what appeared to be and infinite acceleration until it seemed to blur into a streek of light. \r\ni ran outside to see if there was any other activity, but saw nothing else.  her cousin awoke to me runnung outside.  i described to him what i saw and he told me he thought he was the only one who had seen it.  he said he had seen the same thing at least 5 times before.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional change,Path then
