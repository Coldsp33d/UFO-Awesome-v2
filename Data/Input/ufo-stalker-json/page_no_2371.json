here but i remember the craft and hope to see it again.\r\n\r\nmy sister and i were heading to the house for lunch after playing in our woods.  a shadow on the ground startled us and above us about 3-400 feet was this giant boomerang shaped craft.  \r\n\r\nit was completely silent and as it very slowly moved i stood watching it trying to see everything i could.  we were always seeing strange craft over our house with various shapes and sizes.  when i saw the shadow i thought there was an airplane going over because we were located almost on the flight path for the air national guard.  however when i saw craft it was like 2 wings joined together in a v shape without a tail.  i knew it couldn't be an airplane because there were no engines, no tail and no control surfaces of any kind in sight.  after my little sister ran to the house i stood and watched the craft for about ten minutes or more until it finally disappeared over the trees of the other farm across the road.\r\n\r\ni told a teacher about the experience a day or so later and discovered several others in the area had seen the very same thing including adults.  towards the end of that week someone from the military was at our school with pictures of an aircraft he called the flying wing.  quite a few of the other kids that had seen it decided that was what they had seen but i was not taken in by it and began asking questions.  \r\n\r\nhe became quite irritated with me when i asked him where the engines were and he held up the picture again.  i told him, \"not the engines on your picture, the engines on the one i saw.\"  after a few more minutes of attempting to dissuade me that what i saw was his flying wing, he told me i had a vivid imagination and turned to leave.\r\n\r\ni joined the air force after i grew up and began then to try to find out what i had seen and made a trip to where they had a decommissioned \"flying wing\" to take a good look at it.  i noticed the resemblance was quite a lot like what i saw but it had 4 very big, very visible engines as well as a lot of windows.  it was also about 6 to 8 times smaller than what i saw.\r\n\r\ni have been going over this for many, many years trying to find anything it could have been and still have not seen anything quite like that craft and i still search for an explanation.  i also search to see anything like some of the others that used to come over our house.  some were shaped like a cigar with an egg stuck on each end.  some were round, oval and some were even square.  someday i will find the answer and when i do i know it will be something from another place.  \r\n\r\ni watch the night sky and wait; i search the internet for any shape that might fit the specs of what i saw; i just hope they hurry because with my health the way it is i would like to see one again before i die, just to see it again and relive that summer day so very long ago.\r\n\r\ni don't have any photos as i didn���t have a camera back then and i do not draw very well at all.  however, now i carry a camera all of the time and take a lot of pictures of clouds searching for anything standing out that does not belong.  if some of the pictures i have taken in the last few months turn out not to be digital glitches, i may be able to report a current sighting.\r\n","distance":"101-500

completely lounged back in a beach chair gazing at the stars, when all of a sudden i saw a triangular formation of 3 lights in the sky.  they were moving very slowly at about 2 mph.  i could see what appeared like a very light yellowish white laser lines connecting all three lights which made it appear as one large object.  i'm almost convinced it was one large object the size of a football field about 3-4 miles in the sky, because you couldn't see any stars through this triangular formation.  ----all of a sudden as i spotted it, i said to my boyfriend:  \"oh my god!  what the hell is that, as i pointed up at the sky at this object.....My boyfriend also said:  \"oh my god!----as he saw the object too.....The object proceeded to move forward at about 2 mph and then it slowly turned at an angle towards the left.  as it turned slowly to change direction, the 3 lights faded out or turned off completely, and the object could not be seen anymore by us that night..........I want to state that i'm convinced this was not some \"stealth bomber\" from the nearby army base, because they are wide triangular aircraft........This object that we saw was a very long triangular object the size or length of a football field, and made no noise whatsoever as it propelled itself somehow. to me, it was definitely not any kind of aircraft that i've ever seen, because i love jets and aircraft.  as far as i'm concerned, it was not any type of aircraft from this world!-----i don't care what anybody says!----completely and truthfully told......A beachbum from corpus christi, tx!---ps...And don't

we came upon 2 horses laying by the side of the dirt road.  the horses were dead.  i stopped the car, got out and walked up to the horses.  i noticed 3 more horses in the field nearby that also appeared to be dead.  the two horses by the road side had no legs.  their legs were gone from the knees down.  the two horses by the road side had no lower jaws.  the cheek flesh and muscle was also missing.  both ears on both horses by the road were gone.  one of the horses in the field appeared to be in the same condition.  because of the way the other two horses were laying, i could not see their legs or head due to heavy sage brush.\r\n\r\ni returned to my car and told my wife there were horses in the field that also looked dead.\r\n\r\ni told my wife they may have been hit by trucks driving down the road.  i told her that perhaps a herd had been crossing the road and were struck by a large truck, thereby severing the legs of some of the animals and destroying their faces. the remaining three horses then staggered into the field and died.  \r\n\r\nwe then continued down the road towards our dinner date.\r\n\r\nafter eating dinner, we returned to dulce, nm using the same dirt road short cut.  \r\n\r\nmy wife asked me to slow down because we were nearing the place where the horses had been.  she did not want me to hit them.  as we approached the site, we immediately noticed that the two horses by the road were gone.  i could not see into the field to determine if the other 3 horses were there or not because it was dark by then.\r\n\r\ni slowed to around 5 miles per hour to scan the road side and field as best we could under the dark conditions.\r\n\r\nmy wife then said \"look at that in the sky.\"  i leaned down towards her lap to look out her window.  i could see a dim white light to the north towards archuleta mesa.  the light then began to move south.  then the light moved east and then north and passed in front of the nearly full moon.  as it passed in front of the moon i could clearly see the shape of the craft.  it looked like a long cylindrical...Butane tank (but i checked that it looked like a cigar..In the check box there), but really it looked like a long butane tank/cylinder.  it was followed by what i thought were two smaller black objects, almost flying in formation.\r\n\r\nby now, i was looking out my driver window and over my left shoulder.\r\n\r\nmy wife said \"let's just get out of here.\"  so i started to drive again, looking over my shoulder at the object, again just a light because it was not silhouetted against the moon.  the object then descended and circled directly behind and above our car.  i looked up through our sun roof and saw that the object/light was right above us and slightly behind us.  \r\n\r\nthe last thing i remember is looking through my sunroof at the light.\r\n\r\nthen we were just driving along like nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nwe arrived home shortly after 10:00 pm. and that's significant because our dinner dates only last about 3 hours.  we are almost always home by 8:00 or 8:30.  but this time we did not arrive home until 10:10 pm.  \r\n\r\nit just does not add up.\r\n\r\n1. dirt road driving\r\n2. wife saw it and pointed it out\r\n3. i thought the object was a star\r\n4. cylinder/cigar/elongated butane tank, moving and circling our car\r\n5. i felt no emotion.  i drove away.  confusion while at home after.\r\n6. i don't know how i lost sight of the

having the hydroplane races on the lake.  i live about a 1/2 mile from the lake and was at home.  i heard a loud low flying jet pass over my house and i knew the show was on.  i quickly grabbed my camera and ran outside to get some photos of the jets as they did the show. \r\n\r\n when i got outside you could not see or hear the jets at all.  i took the time to set all the functions on my camera which were manual settings, asa or iso 400 ( film speed ) and shutter speed at 1/250th of a second so the planes would be sharp ( stop action ) and the 300mm lens set to infinity as i did not expect the planes to be any closer focus than this.  while i waited i did a few test photos of clouds that would be in the direction of the jets as they did the show over the lake and island.\r\n\r\nwithin five minutes of me setting the camera up the show began and i took some great photos of the blue angels in formation etc.\r\n\r\n  when i uploaded the images after the show had ended i noticed a speck near one of the clouds i had photographed during my first few test shots.  i blew the image up in photoshop and saw it was a disk or oval shaped object quite a ways out near the bottom right corner of a large puffy cloud.  \r\n\r\ni don't know what the object is as the camera resolution is only 8 megapixels\r\nand when enlarged the image falls apart pretty badly.  it is oval shaped though, has a highlight on it making it look reflective metallic silver colored, and can be seen in a different area on one other photograph but only very faintly. i did not see the craft or object when i took the photographs at all.  too far away to see with the naked eye at that distance i suspect, as i did not notice it when looking through the 300mm lens.\r\n\r\none other note is they restrict the air space near the fly zone when they do the air show for safety purposes.\r\n\r\ni will attach the photos that are relevant to this incident.  i have a photo of the cloud and circled the spot where the speck (oval object)is.  i did nothing to this image from photoshop at all.  then i blew the image of the disk up as large as i could and still hold detail.  then i blew the oval shaped object up a second time, using unsharp mask, contrast and hues to try and define it a bit clearer.  the photograph of the blue angel plane is to show the distance proportionally and in the same direction as the cloud was when i photographed the speck earlier in the show with the same camera settings.  maybe you have seen this object somewhere else in your files? hope it

house and the san diego naval base is about 60mi south as well so aircraft were not uncommon.  \r\n\r\nwe just sat smoking for about five minutes and were slowly walking and talking towards the garage to play some more cards.  he asked me if i heard something and i did.  it was kinda like a very loud phane with a slight metallic whine (almost like a tuned down jet engine of sorts).  we both watched this \"thing\" get closer from the north heading south almost directly over pch (about .5 miles to the west of us,  pch runs along the shore all the way to oceanside).  it was circular in shape and was moving very slowly.  we thought it was just another military test run (these were not uncommon) but when this thing got closer,  it was about the size of a very small helicopter and made virtually no noise.  i ran and grabbed my neighbor mark who was still awake watching tv and he came out and was amazed as well.  \r\n\r\nthis thing was only about 300ft overhead, was moving very very slowly (my guess is about 25-30mph?  we watched it get larger and larger and could not believe how close it was and how little noise it made for being such a large object.  not large by airplane or helicopter means, but about the size of a large suv or a very small helicopter.  \r\n\r\nwe watched it pass over head for about 3 minutes until it was out of sight.  we all kinda stood for a minute and blamed it on the military base testings that go on quite often.  we did however, assume it was a military spy drone being tested or some kinda freak new stealth helicopter type craft being tested.  \r\n\r\nwe kept discussing how quiet it was and how the lights on the bottom were in circular formation and not blinking, yet the underbelly of the craft was not able to be seen.  mark is a hobbyist in flying remote airplanes so he was especially tweaked about this.  his little b52 made more noise than thia thing.  it was kind of like a blanketed howl of a jet enjine.\r\n\r\nthe only way we could see the shape of this thing was when it passed overhead.  we then were only able to see the outline of a circular shaped object with lights in one circle around the base of it.  non-flahing lights  at that!  they were yellow and soft white only as well.  \r\n\r\nit could have been a military test thing......But i figure if it was a ufo you guys would want to know.  either way it was a neat thing to see.  there were three of us (including me) who witnessed this.  it happened quite a while ago but i just stumbled across your site and figured you might want to know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

7:08pm est and began to drive east twords state highway 41 which is only about .8 miles down the road. usually i take a country road to town about .5 miles down the road in the same direction but i decided to take 41 just because. after i passed the country road that heads to kentland a plane and its lights caught my attention in the se sky or outside my passanger side of the windshield. as i turned my head around to look back at the road thats when i sall it. 6 evenly spaced out white lights lined across the eastern sky that appeared to have the same circumfrance as the next. i definiatly did a double take thinking what i was seeing was just a few aircraft flying in the sky since i knew that there are a few air bases south of home. but as i kept looking i notice they were not moving at all. they lights were hovering in unisin in the sky. then they faded out becoming dimmer then like a knob on a latern they became very bright again not moving at all.They stay lit for about 7 more seconds and that was it they faded  away not to be seen again that night.By that time i had stopped in the middle of the road to see if i could get another glimps but there was nothing. i had called my sister during the experiance to see if she could see it from the house but it was already gone by that time. i think i have ever been so exsided,scared and in aww at the same time ever like that. i finished the drive to my girlfriends and told her what happened she really didnt believe me but she said to me that she has not ever seen me that frantic before. so whatever it was it was definatly a

nightfall. we were making our way back out to the hayfield from the woods when my friend spotted a light in the sky but i didn't see it right away. i am not a very firm believer to ufos, though i kept an open mind to remain optimistic. so when she said this i wasn't really listening to her that well. especially after she said the light moved. i still couldn't find it.\r\nwhere we were is directly below where alot of planes fly, both military and civilian, so there are alot of odd lights at night that turn out to be planes. \r\nas we hadn't planned to be out past dark, we didn't have a flashlight with us, so the stars were very visible from time to time. as we reached the edge of the woods i spotted a moving light as well, almost over us but north a little. i can't say how far, as judging distance of things in the sky is difficult. still, i was surprised enough at seeing it that i actually fell right off a cliff spraining my ankle. that held us up for a while till i felt able to walk again. we completely forgot about the light after that.\r\nhowever, i only managed to make it to the field again before i had to sit down. actually, i rather laid down as i realized i was bleeding. unable to do anything about it i decided to lay back and wait a bit for the pain to pass. where again i noticed the same light as we saw before in the woods. this time it was definitely almost overhead, though still a little north. the only reason i picked it up was because it was sitting in a cluster of stars that formed a triangle with the point south. this particular light i hadn't seen among them before to my recollection, though i remember that group of stars enough times from summers past. \r\ni was just beginning to say, \"hey, take a look at that star\", grabbing her shoulder to pull her around so she could see it too when it moved about an inch in the sky. then it was like this halo wrapped around it from west to east, taking up, i'd say three inches of my total field of vision, and it was gone. it didn't go up or down move anywhere else. it was simply there, then not. \r\ni've never seen anything like this before, but i'm willing to say that wasn't normal, nor some comet or confusion from pain. i was on the fence about this kind of stuff before this but well, you have my confidence and support.\r\n\r\nif you are looking for this location on a map, email me, it is easy to reach, but i wish to remain anonymous at this time. thank you and good luck!

lighted moon went fast by my side at tree top level.  this flat disc that looked larger that a basketball disappeared out of sight.  we came to the end of the street and started for our home.  suddenly at the corner came a flying saucer headed diagonally to the spot where we had been when this disc crossed our path.  the saucer was about 100 to 150 feet away and had lights spaced all around the entire rim with a lighted hump on top. it stopped abruptly when it saw us and sent spurts of air from its bottom to the ground, stopped and then did it again  i ran to my neighbors house and got the two of them outside also.  the lighted hump on this was delicate and lovely and had balsa like slats making a curved form.  in the quiet i could barely hear a very soft hum.  i happened to look up at the clouds and there in a small space between two clouds were two very small stick planes standing motionless along side each other and standing on their ends.  across and down from the top were long cross sticks the size of 1 to 1/2 inch from my far away view point.  as i pointed upward the saucer got mad and sent spurts out its bottom again.  as we watched the saucer started rolling over its top toward us and under again into the long shape of a cigar and pointed the front end toward the spot where we had seen the stick planes now covered with clouds.  at medium speed it disappeared into the clouds.  thinking about it later, perhaps we had seen the protecting shell that would fit on each side of this cigar to enclose it for a trip far away.\r\n\r\nwhy didn't we report this to anyone?  because we were spooked by what happened next.  we went home and went to bed but we felt weird so we went out into our screened in porch and looked up toward the street light.  we felt like we were being watched so we dashed in, locked the doors and went to bed.  none of us told our family about this but the next day around 10am i went on outlook express to see if we had any e-mail.  instead up pops google with a message---\"have you ever seen a flying saucer?  tell us about your experience\".  i froze and called my husband.  we were concerned and didn't know what to do. we decided only our government could write and send us this message.  we must have seen something that we should keep quiet about.  we x'd off google and didn't touch the computer until around 2:30 pm when we found this message there again.  we clicked it off and the next day it was gone.  never before or since have we received such a message.  they must have seen my husband go home for the camera

let's say - 100 feet overhead, i would expect a sound.  but even at 100 feet, it could not pass from one horizon to the other in the time witnessed.\r\n\r\nthe reddish-orange lights were clearly separated by something that could not be discerned in the dark.  i am also a professional artist, who understands perspective.  the two-light separation appeared as one as it approached from the north horizon; separated as it neared overhead passing; and appeared as one as it disappeared at the southern horizon.  the apparent path was straight, from due north to south.\r\n\r\nsimultaneously, my friend and i looked at each other in disbelief and wondered if the other actually saw the same thing.  we both described - identically - what we had witnessed.\r\n\r\nthere is absolutely no question in mind mind - or my friends - that we saw what i have described.\r\n\r\ni was more excited than fearful of the event.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":12536,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.336557,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09172008-0031","longitude":-83.0363838,"occurred":1172649600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1172649600000,"summary":"Reddish-orange lights, each end,  separated by oject that could not be seen in dark.","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Detroit, Michigan","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:330113"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Treetop","city":"Bossier City","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"About 8:00 pm i stepped outside into my front yard.  when i turned to return to the house i saw a ufo hovering about 50 feet over the house. it was very close.  it appeared to be black and triangular in shape with lights along the sides.  it made no sound whatsoever and did't move at all.  we lived near barksdale afb so i went in to phone the base to see if anyone else had reported this.  no one had and the base said they didn't have any aircraft in the area.  i returned to the yard and it was still there.  the wife and i watched it for about 30 minutes until it slowly moved westward until it was out of sight.  it was much too close to be mistaken for anything else.  the strange thing was that there was not a sound or a breeze or a movement at all.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary,Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":12535,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":32.5233852,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09172008-0029","longitude":-93.7274428,"occurred":558687600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Triangle","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":558687600000,"summary":"Went outside -

other about it. my friend was an army reservist at the time and i went on to be an anti submarine air controler in the navy in 1980. we both watched the bright light hover there and wasn't sure if it was a helicopter or not.The light was like a magnesium candle and we didn't think it looked like a commercial aircraft. after watching the object for over an hour we decided that we would walk to the store and if we came back and it was gone that it had to be a helicopter hovering. we returned a half hour later and the object was still there. i thought that was funny because at some point aircraft have to refuel and can't remain on site for hours on end. as we watched the object it started to move across the sky at a great rate of speed. i can't be sure how fast but it was really flying. it then made a zig zag patern in the sky and as it did it was moving so fast that it left streaks of light behind it as it moved. the radical turns would have had such g forces that any human inside the craft in my estimation would have been crushed. it then made a final zig and them took off up straight into the ski and disappeared. i have seen many aircraft during my time spent in the us military and i have seen jets break the speed of sound as i watched them. as impressive as that is to witness i have never seen an aircraft that could zig and zag at such sharp angles like that. i can only assume that this was a ufo sighting and i can not account for the rapid motion or abrupt turns.","distance":"Over One
