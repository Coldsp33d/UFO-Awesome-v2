States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":" at this time i was eight years old and no grown up would believe my story so i just quit telling it until i was a grown man. \r\n\r\n  i was playing with my best friend on walnut street real close to the intersection with church street in danville, pa. in the summer of 1965. i can't be sure of the exact month it occured, just that it occured during the summer months when there was no school. i can still take you to the exact spot on the sidewalk where we were playing because nothing else in my life is burned into my mind like that. i can still see it and hear what noise was involved just like it just happened and i am almost 52 years old now.\r\n\r\n   me and my best friend were kneeling on the sidewalk playing with gi joe figuremen. it was early afternoon in broad daylight. we both looked up when we heard an unusual noise overhead. it took about 10 seconds or so for the ufo to descend and hover about 40 feet or so above us. it was a saucer shaped ufo and had colored lights all around it. it had quite a few windows around it or it appeared like windows. the noise that the ufo made on descent was not of any engine known to me and i have worked around jet engines before so i know what they sound like. it wasn't a real loud noise but you could hear it.\r\n\r\n   i only seen it for a real short time because me and my friend were so scared that we ran in separate directions to our houses. i went into my house and ran up and hid underneath the bed and shook like a dog does when it hears lightning. i was never so afraid of anything in my entire life. i can't remember how long i stayed under the bed until i came back out.\r\n\r\n   when my parents came home i told them and they was nice about it but it was evident they didn't believe me at all. my friend's parent't didn't believe him either and when you are 8 years old it is pretty hard to convice a grown up of seeing such a thing.  i ran it over and over in my mind since then and i can't come up with an explanation. i was only eight years old and it couldn't be attributed to alcohol or drugs or an overactive imagination. the reason i say this is my friend seen exactly the same thing i did. we both have an above average iq and seen the very exact thing and heard the very exact thing.\r\n\r\n    that's pretty much my story but i wanted to tell you the reason that we were so afraid is because we thought somebody was looking at us through the windows. it was like the burning energy at a rock concert or a sporting event with a lot of people there and the energy from so many people. it was like there was a bunch of beaty little eyes looking at us to the point it made the hair on the back of your neck stand up. and besides, we were only eight years old.\r\n\r\n  i am going to make sure all of your following points section is answered. \r\n\r\n1. we were on the sidewalk playing with gi joe figuremen on walnut street in danville, pa. in the summer of 1965.\r\n\r\n2. we first noticed the object because of the noise of it descending to hover above us.\r\n\r\n3. i thought it was a flying saucer and it was broad daylight so i wasn't seeing something in the night sky. it was very clear and very big.\r\n\r\n4. it was a saucer shaped object that descended quickly and stopped suddenly to hover around 40 foot in the air. things look bigger to you when you are younger but it looked like it was about 60 or 70 yards if you measured it all around it. it had multi-colored lights on it but the only colors i can remember for sure is green, red , and white. i can't describe its motions any better than that because i was so afraid.\r\n\r\n5. i never was so afraid in my life and i ran home and hid under the bed and shook like a scared dog. i still get chills up and down my spine when i think about it. i will never forget it.\r\n\r\n6.  i lost sight of the object when i turned and ran home at a dead sprint.\r\n\r\n  thank you for allowing me to report this to you. i only ever mentioned it to a handful of people in my life because nobody would believe me when i was a child but no one will ever convince me i didn't see what i seen. i am not saying it wasn't something the government had but if the government did have such a thing i can't imagine them keeping that technolgy to themselves for all these years because it was definitely powered by something i have never seen or heard of yet.  have a nice day","distance":"21-100

(who knows, maybe i am . . .). to illustrate exactly what i saw in june 2008, i went back to the scene and photographed it from the exact position that i was in when i witnessed the craft. i then superimposed a ufo (the closest to what i actually saw) onto the pic. now this is 99.99% of what i actually witnessed. the craft (refer to the superimposed photo) was about one-half mile from my position and about 300 to 500 feet high. after i first saw the craft, it hovered in place for about 3 minutes. i did not have a camera (i now keep one in my car) so i could not photograph it. the craft was behind the two story apartments in the foreground. notice how much larger the craft is than the apartments (the apartment buildings are pretty good size). after hovering for about three minutes, it departed in a northerly direction toward arizona and utah (note the location is about one quarter mile from the nevada/arizona border and twenty miles from utah). it took less than two minutes for it to completely disappear. while hovering, it made no noise and did not wobble. if i had to guess abouts the craft's objective, i would say that it was interested in the mesquite airport of which is located behind the trees on the far left of the photo. this experience was the most incredible observation that i have ever had. one funny element of this story is that mesquite, nevada is a city of 20,000 people. i have not met a single person that witnessed this craft (or will admit to it). i could not have mistaken it for anything else (look at it . . .What else could it have been?) i will probably never get the opportunity to see another one but if i do i will be prepared with a camera. i pass the area several times a week and my attention is glued to the craft's location in

the cool air. something caught my eye and i looked up to see a very, large, black, v shaped object floating over my apartment building and parking lot. it was moving in a south - westerly direction and it moved very slow, no sound at all, it blocked out the stars as it moved. it was about 100 feet off the ground. on the bottom of the object was 4 white lights on each side ( 8 total ). i knew it wasn't a helicopter as i have seen medivac and the presidents helicopter flying over at times, besides, they made a chopping noise and this didn't make a sound at all, none.\r\ni was shocked and startled for just a moment and i felt sick to my stomach but it didn't last long. i wanted to go inside and get my digital camera but decided not to, i didn't want to miss anything that might happen, i wanted to see where it went. i knew it wasn't one of ours or of this planet, we could not make something this large and have it fly in this manner. i was seeing something that should not be there, but it was. i just stood there and watched it float away.\r\nthe object floated away and was about 1/4 mile away, when it just vanished. i could see the stars again. after it was gone, i stood outside

sister sleeping in the other, both beeds in the same small room.  while watching my mother fix the covers on the bed my siblings were in, a alien appeared in front of me.  this was about 43 years ago, i was about 9 yrs old.  i can tell you now the alien looks just like a lot of pictures you see now, slightly transparent, slight glow, big tear drop type balck eyes.  at the time this happened i had not seen anything like it.  it was not tell my 30's when i saw my first pictur of exacly what i had seen.  it said nothing, i said nothing, i remenber nothing else afterwards.  all i remember was looking at it and seeing my mother working with my siblings in the background.  a year or so later, at the same house, i was playing with my cousins and nephews.  most of the time there were a lot of kids and people around, my mother had 12 keids in her family.  something made me look towards the hosue, at the cornor was another alien some distance, not sure if the same, but looked the same from my memory.  again, nothing said, and nothing remembered other then the first sight.  that was my only sighting on a alien and the only memory i have about it.  the other thing that happened to me one time was at my uncle house.  his house is about 5 miles from my grandparents house, both houses about 70 miles from my home.  i was abruply awaken at night while sleeping in the same bed as my brother.  i woke to something pulling both my feet, i jump up and out of bed and ran to where my mom and dad were sleeping, jummping over the area i knew the person was pulling my feet from.  i ended up sleeping with my folks as i was scared to death, my dad, by far not a senitive person, could tell something was really upseting me.  the next day he even asked my brother or sister if they had pulled my feet trying to scare me.  he must of known something had relly scared me.  at 52 years old, and not scared of anything, i still rap the cover around my feet becasue of that night.  only my mom, dad (died) and wife know about these moments in my life.  i will forever remember and wonder what this was all about.  there are a few other strange thing about myself that happend when i was

4 miles west of the 144th/highway 50 exit. the sky was the clearest it had been all week not a star not a plane not a single cloud just a early crisp morning. i looked up as i was gazing at the early morning sun and saw 3 lights that where very bright. this object was approximatly to my south east(the right side of the road). i am watching this thing thinking well there is offut airforce base and epply airport so its probably a plane coming or going and its just the landing or take off lights. as i get closer i realize its getting easier to see but i still can not make a good enough glimpse to really judge. it is not very high off the ground probably about the height of a taking off or landing jet. now knowing that the base and the airport are further east i am starting to wonder why i am seeing the front landing lights that are in the middle of the two outer lights.Because if they were facing me it would not be landing. right about the time i am thinking is there something more to this is it in fact a ufo. bam one two three all lights shut off in succession. right as i am looking at it. now i am really curious cause if it was in fact a plane where are the red and green lights one the ends of the wings that are supposed to be flashing. i look intensly as i can while driving and i see absolutly nothing no lights no other planes, no jet engine smoke or condensate nothing. i am just stumped. i was in the military for 4 years and i have seen lots of planes, jets, and helicopters. so one part of me says it was just a plane and i just couldnt see it for whatever reason. but another part of me is still asking why did it shut its lights off like that right at the moment i really took a great intrest in it. almost like it knew i had spotted it then since i witnessed the lights shut off i should have seen the red and green navigation lights. again the object was 3 bright white lights, center light slightly above the 2 outer lights. if there is anyway of investigating any flights in that area at that exact time i would appreciate it i did take note of the exact time the lights went off.","distance":"Over One

aprroxmately 2am, i was on duty as a military policeman stationed at west point military academy. i was with  two other m.P.'s. it was a really slow night as usual as nothing much ever really happened. this particular night we were out of our vehicles just talking amongst ourselves. we were parked next to the main parade field. as i was talking i noticed one of the m.P.'s was distracted as he was looking over my shoulder and he asked,'\"hey what is that?\" i kept talking ignoring him. he repaeted,\"hey whats that?\" i turned around in the back drop was this mountain. it was a clear night and visibilty was excellent as it was a full moon. when i first saw the object it was the size that shocked me initially. it was stationary and absolutely silent it was black in color, the length of at was unbelieviable. it had three huge square lights on the first story the second story had three square lights on bottom as well. we observed it for about 3-4 min. we were trying to figure out amongst us what were looking it, whether or not we should report it, but not knowing what to report. i can tell you for certain what it was not. it was not a plane, blimp, helicopter so on and so forth. as all this is happening the object all of a sudden flashes a light like a camara flash in rapid sequence three times. however, this light lite up the entire side of mountain. at this time we were very alarmed. we jumped into our vehicles and started towarded the object. as we made our way the object the object started moving slowly to my left, then it stop for about 3 seconds and traversed against it's flight path and darted to the right at an incredible speeds it was gone. within a second it was gone. we decided not to report the incident as the military tends to frown on this type of thing. i was so shaking that at the end of my shift i had to call my father and reluctantly told him what happened, i had to tell someone. he calmed me down and then told me his story of

is a cull-de-sac with my home at the end on the left. the beginning of my street is a slightly higher elevation than at the end of the cull-de-sac, about 400 yards distance. my home is the only home on my street. yard sizes range from 2.1 acres and up. at the end of my street there are two white fence lines running south to north which is a horse riding trail, and right past the last fence is a tree line that borders a farm that also runs south to north. \r\n\r\nit was about two seconds before i actually turned left that i noticed an object in the south east flying south to north. i had a perfect line of sight view, because from my position the object was above the tree line and below the clouds. i estimated the object to be no more than 1,000 feet in elevation. the object's shape appeared to be a combination of cylinder and cigar shape. the object appeared to be two tone in color, pewter on the bottom half and silver on the upper half. neither halves were showing any reflection which i thought rather strange since the sun at that time was shinning through a break in the clouds from the west.\r\n\r\nas i turned onto my street i slowed down and continued to watch the object fly in the same south to north direction. i ruled out commercial airline (too small), military helicopters and planes (wrong color), small private or crop dusting planes (no wings, landing gears, rudder or tail fins). the object was flying at a rather quick pace, but then when the object was right in front of me as i looded straight down my street, the object slowed down quickly and came to an almost dead stop. it was at this location that i was able to see the craft fully from the side and with much better detail. i had all of my windows down in the car (4), and the only noises i heard were the natural sounds emanating from a country setting...No cows were mooing and no horses were neying. the object's length was about the size of a chap stick held between my thumb and first finger at arms length. i would estimate the distance between myself and the object at less than a mile.\r\n\r\nabout two to three seconds later the object just vanished. it did not turn left or right, go up or down, or fly backwards...It just vanished from my physical sight. i then drove to the end of the cull-de-sac, turned around and drove to various higher and lower elevations in the

posting this over a year later now; since i wasn't too eager to talk about it in the public. i've seen formations of big orange lights before, flying stars and recently 3 orbs flying in triangle formation; but this one last year was special to me. the drawing were made right after the sighting.\r\n\r\nsighting occurred on may 14 2007 between 01:00 am and 01:50 am local time\r\n\r\nme and a buddy saw a boomerang shaped flying object in the clear night sky; which was flying very low over my yard. my buddy saw it first. it first appeared to be a very fast moving cloud. it kinda uncloaked itself and first appeared to be transparent. then he was able to see the small lights on the bottom (which by that time were turned on) and then was able to see whole ship, it appeared to be of a silverish color with a strong reflecting effect...Like a mirror...Like it was heavily polished. for a blink of an eye it recloaked and turned into a \"cloud\" again, but then instantly reappeared. by that time my buddy informed me what was going on; since i was looking in a different direction. the ship then reappeared near the great dipper. there was not a single cloud that night; so this thing caught our attention. there was a church tower near by so we figured that the object flew quite low (approx. 82 feet/25 meters). the boomerang kinda uncloaked in front of our eyes, and as soon as it had passed the great dipper it cloaked again and disappeared. it had a orange glow at the front, some sort of dome at the rear and some sort of lights (which were turned off) and the bottom. we were able to see it in full detail. the ship's color was silverish and the dome as well as the big lights at the bottom were appeared to be tinted (the small lights described above, where not visible any longer [turned off] ). i'd estimate the craft's wingspan was the size of at least 3 or 4 airbus a380 airplanes put together. the sighting didn't last long, maybe 2 minutes and a few seconds.\r\n\r\ni'd like to stay completely anonym for now; but if there are any questions or the like, please let me know by sending me an e-mail.","distance":"20 Feet or
