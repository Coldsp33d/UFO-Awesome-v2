being very clear out as we were in his garage the whole time. we were also looking at a plane coming at us from the east that evening as we were discusing if it was a star or a plane in the distance. i remember watching it for quite awile before we realized it was a plane. anyway we left at around 9pm and were headed for home, we took a short detour to the local supermarket to get some ice cream. as we headed west toward the store, we saw some strange lights to the north, my first thought that it was some kind of a carnival going on, we saw the lights about at treetop level as we did loose sight as our vision was interrupted by the trees. i was trying to think of the area and what and were it could possibly be, but the area of the lights was rural. then we reached our destination about 10 -15 seconds later. we got out saw nothing and went to the store. while i was in the store my wife called, and said you wont believe what she and my 18 yr old daughter just saw, i said yes i would cause i just saw it myself. we went home talked about it and that was it, i guess were all loosing our minds together. i forgot about it pretty much till the other day talking to my nieghbor, they brought up, so you saw the ufo too? im like ya. turns out they saw something to but after confirming the dates this evening, they saw the ufo on  the 2nd of september also a tuesday night. im sorry

(24) conae had already participated with nasa in the development of the satellite de aplicaciones cienfifico (sac) microsatellites as a space-research project. (25) as argentina continues to seek closer military ties with the united states, mainly through peacekeeping operations, its space program now appears more cooperative with that of the united states. its plans to develop the satellites for observation and communications (saocom)-1a radar satellite include italy--another nato ally of the united states. (26) also, the united states views the launch of latinsat-a and -b by aprize satellite in 2002 as a commercial endeavor with no national-security implications. (27) one reason the argentine space program is now perceived as more pro-united states is that most funding for programs with us competitors has largely stopped as a result of the government's fiscal

try and snap some night shots with his new olympus e410 slr camera, being a new hobby of his it was to be a trial and error type of operation and we really weren't expecting any type of miracle results, we certainly didn't expect to to end up snapping what we did.\r\nat my friends request i had gone to find a camera tripod i knew i had somewhere and on returning found my fearless pal retreating back into the kitchen backwards with a very worried look on his face. on asking what the **** was up with him he just pointed and asked \"so what would that be then?\"\r\ni have to admit his worried look was justified for a second while \"comet\" went through my head and \"plane crash\"  because the whole cloud looked as if it were on fire, my friend later described it as \"a fire in the sky\". \r\nit is a shame we spent the next twenty seconds doing laurel and hardy impressions, running around tripping over ourselves, we couldn't believe what we were seeing. by the time we had camera and tripod set up the object in question had cleared the clouds and was giving off a beautifully sharp burnt orange/red (like fire i suppose but much ...Clearer?) this is where my friend managed to get a few shots off as it started to make it's way away from us to the east over the rooftops, this is when i moved to get a better look and noticed the second object, much brighter, lower and much nearer coming straight towards us. we hadn't noticed this one due to the chimney blocking our line of site. after a brief arguement about shaking people when they're trying to take a photo we managed to reposition the camera and get both objects in the view finder.\r\nby this time the first object was disappearing over to the east and within a matter of 10-15 seconds the second one had stopped approximately 1 mile away, hovered in place for a matter of seconds and joined it leaving us both pretty much dumbfounded.\r\nthe whole event must have taken no more than 4-5 mins. maybe even less. it certainly wasn't a helicopter or aeroplane, i can't say what it was but it was eerily strange and a little un-nerving, especially the cloud effect.\r\nthe objects moved slowly, independently of each other and were seen in the east in the approach to manchester airport which is approximately 20 miles away. all i know about the pics themselves is the fact that he was trying different (apeture/f-stop..?) settings to get more detail, some shots worked many didn't but we managed to get a few.\r\ni'm not sure what i expect any-one to do with this, i'm sure it's just one more of an increasing number of reports but the photo's are yours to do whatever it is you do with them and i hope they help.\r\nthank-you\r\n\r\njohn\r\n\r\np.S.\r\nphoto p9131979.Bmp not agreat photo but it

near panama city, florida. i do have video tape of the sighting on september 9, 2008. the following is an account of what my family and i saw on that date.\r\nit was approximately 8:00 p.M. on tuesday, september 9, 2008. i was walking from my barn to my house when the object caught my eye. it was a big ball of light and there was a small plane flying directly behind it as if it was chasing or following the object. the ball of light was incredibly bright and coming directly toward me. it started to make a big circle south toward panama city. when it was directly over head, i was able to see the shape of the object, which looked to me kind of like a cigar shape and it looked like there was light coming out of the sides kind of like there was windows on the side. i did not see any wings or any strobe lights at all. it continued south until i lost sight of it. ten to fifteen minutes later, i saw the same object coming back toward my house following the same flight path with the small plane still in trail. then when it started to circle back to the south, the plane continued on a straight path to the north and two fighter jets showed up and followed the object until i lost sight of it again. then ten to fifteen minutes went by and the object showed back up following the same path, but there were a total of six fighter jets following it at this time. one was extremely close to the left side of the object, one to the far right and four behind it flying in formation and it was obvious then that they were following this object. this continued for four more circles in the same flight path. the last time i saw the object it was approximately 9:30 to 10:00 p.M. during the time of this sighting, there were no other planes in this air space. usually there are planes coming over going to and from the airport in panama city. my daughter brought her video camera out and began filming the object on the second pass. \r\non thursday, september 11, we were outside in the yard at approximately 9:00 p.M., when we noticed four fighter jets overhead flying erratically. after about thirty or forty-five minutes, these fighter jets began dropping what looked like flares. in the twenty years i have lived on this property, i have never seen these fighter jets drop flares like that, which makes me think that they were trying to confuse us about what we saw two nights before because the flares looked like balls of light coming form the jets. the difference is that the flares disappeared in about ten seconds; the ball of light from september 9 circled around and did not disappear and was constant. we did not video tape the jets on september 11. am in the process of making a digital copy of the video footage we shot on september 9. i will get it to you as soon as possible.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

few planes flying really high. i went in, got my 20x binoculars and looked at them. the first one was a four-engine, solid white/lt. gray plane, which reminded me of a kc-135 to a degree. off of its tail only, there was a stream of white spray coming out. not out of the engines, but off the tip of the tail section. keep in mind, i'd been outside for about an hour and had watched, without binoculars, several passenger and transport planes fly over without any contrails. just as this first, larger plane was moving out of the zenith position, a 2-engine, white plane, like a boeing 737 maybe, was right behind it and it too had the white stream coming off of the tip of its tail. all of a sudden...A brilliant white globe/sphere shot right up out of the west right between the first and second plane. it came up to the right side of the first plane and then angled to the left side of the second plane and i mean it was very close to both of them. then it very slowly moved further away from them in the direction that they had just come. after watching it for about 5 minutes moving slowly around up there it just zipped off just as fast as it had gotten there. no, it didn't appear or disappear into thin air, it just showed up very fast and left very fast. you could not see the ufo without binoculars though because it was so small, maybe 20 feet in comparison to either of the two planes, even in the binoculars it was just an extremely brilliant spherical dot. this is the first ufo i've seen as an adult and with two white (government?) planes laying out a thin stream of who knows what behind them coming through at the same time first? the streams were not leaving contrail marks in the sky, it was only a thin stream coming off of the tail tip section into the air. about an hour later i went back outside and through the binoculars again watched a few commerical planes fly over and none of them had any \"streams\" coming off of them. there were no contrails either save for a very feathery, whispy one in the area where the two planes described above had been. the contrail was about 10 degrees in width and took up about a 30 degree section of the sky, west to east. i've been around airplanes most of my life, including 4 years in the usaf...This was not normal. the planes came out of the eastnortheast and flew in a straight line to the westsouthwest point. the ufo came out of the west and slowly followed where the \"chemical\" trail would have been spraying and then after it reached about 60 degrees up from the ene horizon, it flew off in a zip. i tell you this only as a matter of record. that's the quick of it, the time was between 17:00 and 17:15 approximately by the way, skies were mostly sunny with a few fluff clouds flying from west to east. winds were gentle, but you could feel a breeze here and there. i live between etowah, nc and hendersonville, nc with a 360 degree panoramic view of the sky. what do i think about this event? i think that it was some type of government \"spraying operation\" with some type of spherical drone of sorts coming through checking the content of the air afterwards. could it have been extraterrestrial? i guess, but it didn't seem to feel a need to stop the spraying, so... me? i'm 47, have a b.Sc. degree, a wonderful wife and three children. i've been in r & d for nearly 20 years and am a \"normal\" person

during daylight hours over a period of 12 days. three sightings were followed by the appearance of military aircraft. \r\n\r\n08/22/2008 (friday)\r\n\r\nwhile sky gazing at 7:15 pm , i noticed a very bright object in the sky due south of my residence in westlake, la at 45 degrees above the horizon. the object looked similar to a star, except it appeared to be about ten times larger and brighter than any star or planet that i have ever witnessed. it should be noted that sunset this evening was at 7:46 pm and normally stars would not start to appear until about 30 minutes after sunset. (this ���star��� was out about an hour early with the sun still shining brightly). i watched the object for several minutes and it appeared to be stationary. i then went into the house and got my binoculars to have a better look at it and still it appeared to look only like a extremely large and bright star.  i would say that the object appeared to be very high in the sky but not beyond the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nat 7:30 pm, i called my wife out of the house to witness the unusual day light ���star���.\r\n\r\ni continued to watch the ���star��� until 7:55 pm (a total of 40 minutes) and to the eye it appeared stationary, but apparently it was slowly moving to the west as it was now clearly located directly south west (a 45 degree change in direction), but still 45 degrees above the horizon. at this point, the very bright clearly seen ���star��� got fuzzy and appeared to be starting to pull apart and quickly faded away against the cloudless sky. \r\n\r\nabout a minute after the ���star��� faded away, an air force b-52 flew directly over my house at a low altitude flying south westerly and flew exactly past the last position of the large daylight ���star��� that had just faded away. i had called my wife back out of the house to witness that the ���star��� was now gone, as the b-52 aircraft passed overhead. it should be noted that this is first time that i have ever witnessed a b-52 in flight since leaving the military in 1982. i believe that the closest active military air base to my home in 200 miles to the north in shreveport, la and any military aircraft in our area is somewhat rare.\r\n\r\ni remained outside to document the time that readily recognized ���normal��� stars start to appear with the first dim star appearing at 8:00 pm and the second at 8:15 pm. the extremely large and bright daylight ���star��� that faded away against a clear sky never reappeared in the sky by the time i ended my watch at 10:00 pm last night.\r\n\r\n(8/23/08) saturday\r\n\r\nat 7:40 pm, i returned to my backyard in westlake, la and started a through watch to the south and south west direction. (the same direction that i had observed the ���daylight star��� a day earlier.\r\n\r\nat 7:50 pm, again a very large and bright starlike object appears suddenly to the south west against the still clear blue sky. (sunset was at 7:46 pm and the sky was still very well lit up at this time).\r\n\r\ni watched the object for a minute or so to make sure that it was indeed a stationary object. i then attempted to get the attention of someone inside my home by knocking on the windows while trying to watch the object at the same time. (i did not want to take my eyes off the object just in case it faded away into thin air as it did the day before after observing it for 40 minutes).\r\n\r\nafter knocking on windows for another minute or so to no avail, i momentarily took my eyes off the object three times and was easily able to re-sight the object each time until the third time and then the object was gone when i looked back up. i remained outside watching for another hour without ever seeing the very large and bright ���daylight star��� again. however, during this time frame all of the ���normal stars��� that i normally see each evening began to slowly and dimly appear starting around 8:15 pm. i did not notice any ���normal stars��� moving or disappearing.\r\n\r\ni do not know what this very large bright starlike object is, but i am almost positive that it is not a star or a planet.\r\n\r\n8/28/08 (thursday)\r\n\r\n19:35\tobserved reappearance of daytime star-like object against a clear blue sky 45 degrees above the horizon sw of my residence in westlake, louisiana. unlike the first two sightings of this object, this time the object was not extremely brilliant. i then observed the object through binoculars and it appeared to be metallic and chrome colored, shaped like a hamburger bum.\r\n\r\n19:37\tat this point, i phoned my son who was located 10-15 miles sw of my residence and presumably that much closer to the object and ask if he could sight the object. he easily located the object in the same relative position in the sky to him as it was located to myself. when asking my son if he saw the star, he stated that ���the object was not a star as it was defiantly metallic, but he was unable to identify what it was���.\r\n\r\n19:45\tshot six still photos of the object on a sony digital camera. (object appears in the photos as a round white object against a clear blue sky without showing the chrome color or a detailed shape due to the long distance of the object).\r\n\r\n19:47\twhile attempting to locate the object in the viewfinder of my video camera, my son called back and said that the object had disappeared. i looked back up to confirm that indeed the object was gone and no longer appeared against the clear blue sky. i continued to search the sky for 30 minutes without the object reappearing.\r\n\r\n09/03/08 (wednesday)\r\n\r\n19:45\treappearing star-like object appears high in the sky directly above my residence in westlake, la. object remained stationary in the sky.\r\n\r\n19:47\tcalled my son out of the house to watch the object while i laid flat on my back observing the object straight up in the sky with binoculars.\r\n\r\n19:50\tobserved a much smaller yet very bright star-like object moving towards the original larger star-like object and then it stopped. at this point, i ask my son if he saw the second smaller object without binoculars and he stated that he did not. after about ten seconds, the smaller object moved toward the larger object again. as the smaller object met the larger object, the larger object appeared to become eclipsed by the smaller object and a corona of light could be seen around the larger object with the light at the center of the larger object blocked out. at the point that the larger object became eclipsed, my son stated that he could no longer see the object without binoculars. i continued to watch the ���eclipse star��� for a minute with binoculars and then it faded and appeared as faint light in three separate spots and then faded out completely. \r\n\r\n20:05\tobserved a large twin engine turbo prop military type aircraft flying low directly over my residence located in a populated neighborhood.\r\n\r\n20:12\tobserved a large commercial airline flying low and banking a turn directly over my residence. (it should be noted that large aircraft are almost never observed flying low over my residence located in a populated neighborhood).\r\n\r\n09/04/2008 (thursday)\r\n\r\n19:40\tstar-like object appears in the south, 70 degrees above the horizon as clouds begin to break at my residence in westlake, la.. the object could best be described as a normal star in appearance against the still blue sky in the background. object appears in wrong part of sky to be a star and 20-30 minutes early for a normal star to appear. observed object for 16 minutes with binoculars. during the time observed, the object changed from a pale star appearance to a yellow flattened  shape.  \r\n\r\n19:56\tobject begins to fade against a still clear cloudless portion of the sky and then appears as faded scattered light in three separate locations in the sky before the object is completely undetectable. \r\n\r\n20:06\twhat appears to be a fighter jet passes directly over my residence flying very low.\r\n\t(it should be noted that military aircraft are seldom seen in this area over a residential neighborhood, nor are low flying aircraft of any type with the exception of an infrequent piper or crop duster during the daylight hours).\r\n\r\n20:16\twhat appears to be the same fighter jet makes another very low pass over my residence for a second time.\r\n\r\n20:30\tended sky surveillance without star-like object returning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12459,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":30.2421496,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09132008-0010","longitude":-93.2507099,"occurred":1219457700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Louisiana","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1219457700000,"summary":"Multiple daylight sightings of appearing/disappearing star-like object","tags":["light"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12459_submitter_file1__daystarufo"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Westlake, Louisiana","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:333502"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2373}
