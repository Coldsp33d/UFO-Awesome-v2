est.\r\nthe sky was clear, the moon was beginning to shine in the southern sky.\r\ni walked over to my mother's house next door for a chat and walk.\r\nwe live on a 14 acre country property just outside of london, ontario.\r\nwe talked for a few minutes on her outside deck.  i remember commenting\r\nto her how much sooner the moon was shining in the daylight sky with the\r\ndays getting shorter.  i proceeded to take a walk around our property\r\ntogether with my 14 year old daughter.  during our walk, my daughter\r\nnoticed a couple of \"birds\" flying just above the moon.  she commented\r\nhow the birds made a face with the moon.  i looked up and started to \r\nrealize the two objects were not birds but something else.\r\nas they got closer, they became larger, appearing like missiles.\r\ni started to scream to my mother to come out to see these two objects.\r\nthe objects dipped down and levelled off right above us in the field,\r\nno more than a mile up.  i continued to scream for my mother as the \r\ntwo ufo's began to slowly move over top of us in a north-east direction.\r\nit was truly incredible sight.  my mother had come out of her house onto the deck and witnessed these two objects moving over us, and at the same time, a third similar ufo appeared above my mother's house about \r\n100 feet from where we were standing.  all these ufo's were massive\r\nin size, flying closely together in a staggered formation.  the third\r\nufo was slightly higher and slightly ahead of the other two ufo's.\r\ni would estimate that each ufo was about 150 feet long.  they were shaped\r\nlike a bullet, bulging slightly in the middle with small fins protruding\r\noff the sides.  the objects were metallic, with smooth surfaces, dull\r\ngrey in color, no lights, no markings and no identifiable features except\r\nfor the small fins.  they simply moved slowly north-east, making no sounds\r\nwhatsoever.  there was never any exhaust, no trailing vapor/smoke.  i just\r\nremember how quiet it all was.  we all then witnessed the three ufo's\r\nbegin to ascend upward in a 50 degree angle in a north-east direction, straight out away from us, becoming smaller and smaller until they disappeared from our view.  the ufo's did not fly horizon to horizon, but came from due south,levelling off and then flying north-east, straight up\r\nand out beyond our sight.  everything happened in about 4 minutes.\r\nwe could not belive what we had just witnessed, it felt like we were in\r\na movie with special effects.  i drew a sketch of what the objects \r\nappeared like right after this happened.  i called the london airport\r\nthe next day to ask if any unusual sightings were reported.  they told\r\nme that there were no air shows going on and nothing unusual on their radar that evening.  unfortunately,  i did not have a camera with me.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

colleagues were stargazing.  the moon had been out earlier in the evening but was not visible later.  the sky was still quite dark but completly clear and the stars were visible.  i noticed what looked like a far off galaxy with a cluster of very faint tiny stars inside.  it was only when this 'galaxy' moved across the sky with its 'stars' still equidistant inside it - in what seemed like a transparent elongated but dumpy blimp shape which was fatter in the middle, going at what i perceived at the time was the wrong way across the sky, for any normal worldy phenomenon.  it moved across the sky silently and quite low down and was enormous in size. it floated towards us, curving across the sky away from its original direction and went directly above us all.  we were all astonished, with mouths gaped open and pointing fingers in the air shouting.  as it passed over us, either side of it seemed to bend in a curve over us and as i looked directly above me, i could still see its stars inside it, still equidistant; although unless of course the light was bent and i was seeing a reflection of other stars.  it had a haze or glimmer of what i can only explain as like a magnetic field or the shimmer you get on a very hot road/highway with like heatwaves transparently shimmering around it.  as it passed over and began to go past, i could only see it for a second or so because it was very hard to keep track of because it just blended into the early morning, but still dark sky. when i got back to my room my watch was not working.\r\n\r\ni got in touch with the bbc sky at night programme to see if anything was due over the area (star wise) to account for what we had seen and got a reply stating that they did not know of anything that it could be.  they said they would like to put it in their bbc sky at night magazine and i agreed that they could.  this i know sounds ridiculous, but this is exactly what happened and what i saw.  when we tried to tell people about what we all saw, we were laughed at and all kinds of ridiculous things were given as possible explanations.  \r\n\r\nsuffice it to say that as mature people doing research at the university of bath, (who where not drunk either) as has been also proposed, we all saw something which shocked us.  so much so that only two of us have discussed it once and the other two will not discuss it at all.  it has profoundly affected myself (and i am a professional person and ex. met. police, in as much as i am constantly looking up at the sky in case it appears again.  whilst this was an astonishing thing to see, it was also extremely frightening.  therefore i would like to remain anonymous.\r\n\r\nnb  whether this is of any relevance or not.  two days prior to the sighting my battery clock began ringing in the early hours of the morning on both days, instead of at the correct time of 7:30.  i was convinced that someone had been in my room and messed around with my clock at the time, for a joke.  this was mentioned to colleagues and family at the time as something very strange for anyone to be bothered to do. \r\n\r\nthere have been a couple of pictures on the web which look very much like this thing, under the heading of transparent ufo or semi-transparent ufo. because i was unable to photograph this thing myself, unfortunately this is the only way i have been able to explain

yesterday.  i was watching tv with my sister, who was home visiting from college, and i heard my dog going crazy outside. i got up and looked out of the big picture window in my family's den to see what was upsetting the dog.  \r\n\r\nabout 300ft away from our back yard was a field near a large wooded area where my friends and i often rode bikes and played.  this is where i spotted the craft.  it was approximately 15-20 ft in diameter, and was what appeared to be a mix between and oval and a disc-shape.  the actual base color of the object was what i would call a silvery-blue...Almost like a hue. the surface was solid...I could easily see that.  however, the surface of the object seemed to have a property that most would consider to be iridescent.  i say this because the surface was multi-colored, but the colors were not seperately defined...They appeared to be pulsating/swirling and mixing together...It was really beautiful.  the light source itself appeared to be coming from a central location within the object. (i couldn't actually see the source which was producing the light that was pulsating through the iridescent surface of the object, so i assume that it may have come from a centralized location within the object itself.)\r\n\r\nafter i first saw the object, i called my older sister over to see it.  i distinctly remember her saying, \"oh my god! what is that?!?\"  it was right after she joined me at the window that i noticed the tv in our den was horribly static-filled and was having some audio problems as well.  \r\n\r\nat this point, my sister and i ran outside into the back yard and kept watching the object, which at first had just been hovering, but was now moving very slowly, (estimate of 5-10 mph), to the right.  this movement resulted in the object occassionally being obtructed from view by patches of trees from the wooded area about 300ft away.  it would slowly go behind the trees, and then slowly re-emerge on the other side.  i remember wondering why it could be so close and so big, (esp to a 12y/o boy), but make no sound whatsoever! however, our dog was making so much sound, i'm surprised the whole neighborhood didnt come to find out what was going on.\r\n\r\ntowards the end of the sighting, which i believe to have been around 5 mins total, the object went behind a thick patch of trees and never re-emerged from the other side. i saw what appeared to be a flash higher in the sky and more to the right, which could have been an instantaneous take- off of the object, but that is merely speculation. it's almost as though it just disappeared.  it may have landed at that point, but i cannot say that for sure.  i do know that there were no other houses in that direction...Just the field and the woods.  i have wished many times since then that i had jumped on my bike and chased after it...But unfortunately i did not.  i do remember that i was so impacted by the event that i wanted to study whatever i could about ufos, but one of the only sources i had were my family's old world book encyclopedias.  i remember that i read about project blue book, and was thrilled that there was a government oraganization designated for ufo research, and was excited that i could report what i had seen.  so, i wrote a detailed letter about the event, and included my own drawings and diagrams of what i had seen.  little did i know, since it was 1988 at the time, project blue book had closed almost 20 yrs before.  i did, however, get a letter in return informing me that blue book was no longer in operation.  i'm surprised anyone responded at all.\r\n\r\none final comment about this sighting...I have, for years, wondered why it may have been that what i consider to have been an authentic ufo would have been \"snooping around\" near my home in such a small town in south carolina?  what i consider to be the answer to that question hit me just recently while doing a lot more reading on ufos.  located within about five miles of my home at the time, and from my whole city for that matter, is the lake robinson nuclear power plant.  i'm not surprised anymore that they were in our area!","distance":"101-500

staying in the same spot, but the blinking light was throwing colors that i've never seen on a close venus or mars experience, and it was too bright to be a satellite...And airplanes don't have pink lights on them.\r\n\r\ni kept my focus on the light, and i realized there was a random pattern emerging. the base color was white, but then i'd see the color change in sets of threes. it went right to left, and the colors it was giving off were pink, purple, green, blue, red, and orange. it was as bright as an airplane coming in for landing, but it was too far away. there weren't any other stars in

every other weekend our nearby aunts and uncles would gather for dinner at my grandmothers house and us grandkids would hang out outside. most of the time we would look up into the vast night sky which many stars were visible out there.(being out of any city light)on this night my cousin;17, my brother;13 and myself;15 years old (at that time),   were looking out into the southern sky and above us. below this sky is an endless range of large hills rolling through our area all the way to the coast. \r\n\r\n   from hill tops to right above us we scanned the sky and nothing but the stars were out. all of a sudden after about 20 minutes of gazing, i had been looking just above and ahead in more of a southeast direction. some kind of light radiated from a central point in that spot in the sky. i  immediately  shouted to my brother and cousin. ���look!'. it had already passed by the time they looked out to what i was pointing at. but not 3 seconds had passed when we all together sough it again but it seemed brighter this time and in 2 or three simultaneous ripples. i say ripples because that is how i saw it. they were two or three split second pulses of bluish -white light radiating and growing like ripples in a pond when throwing a pebble. this whole event took no longer than 3 to 5 seconds. the light that rippled seemed to almost follow the contour of our outer atmosphere's dome. though that was interesting and creepy at the same time; not 2 seconds later did we see a single pinpoint of red light in that same general area. this light was like a star but a constant red. in our excitement we kept our eyes glued to this point of light. the light then started to move and get slightly bigger and brighter. the light now was definitely moving, not blinking, but appeared to move at  great speed and in sharp angle downward and toward the west. with in seconds the object ended up about a mile away it seemed. all three of us owing and aching and briefly discussing how fast it must have traveling compared to a jet. the red light hovered  above a tree line on a hill just south of us. straight ahead of us. my brother pointed out light from the object hitting the tree tops. the red light was faint and it did appear that close to the trees. it seemed like we were watching it for quite a while, just sitting there hovering . there was no apparent movement; no flashing or blinking of the light. the object had a constant deep red light like a red led. we were sure as we spoke to each other right than and there that it was not moving. the light had not changed in size or direction. all of a sudden after about 10 minutes it rows and took a sharp south eastern direction and then just disappeared. \r\n\r\n                i have seen two more similar sightings in later years as has my girlfriend. never again have i seen the \"ripple in the sky\" though. my brother and cousin and i all still talk about it and refresh the story. it has stayed clear in our minds over the years and true to all three of us. if any others have similar stories, tell it. the world needs to know. thank you.

clear gas and it was hovering over the mountain. \r\n\r\ni looked through the binoculars, focused in and it was still just a big pearl, except i could see little red sparks of fire shooting off the surface which would zig zag in the air and then blink out. it just stayed there while cars zipped past us on the street. it was bizarre. it didn't seem like anyone else was seeing this. after about 45 minutes, it seemed to be moving with the curve of the earth because it was getting farther and farther away at the same rate of the sun and was slowly coming down. it got dark and finally it was out of sight behind the mountain. \r\n\r\nwe turned on the news to see if it was on there. nothing. i personally called luke air force base to see if anything had shown up on their radar. the lady i spoke

attention on them and noticed they would move left to right up and down, not major movements either but they were definetly moving then i noticed the third object and they had formed a triangle these objects were not close to each other. it was very dark since i was away from the city lights and you could see at times smaller star-like less bright objects in the sky moving in the middle of the triangle and towards the brighter star like objects this went on for hours.\r\ni was able to spot probably 30 or more objects in the entire night sky, at first glance these would be \"stars\" until you noticed the movements.\r\nat times they would become very bright like shine brighter than they already were, i was able to see smaller ones shoot off and then back, it was weird.\r\nafter hours of observation i finally went home since the sun was going to be coming up anyway, it was amazing there was just so much activity that when i decided to go home i wasnt even disappointed about not having

in the yard and he wasn't disturbed by it!  it continued to float down the street and hovered over the hangers at the roswell industrial center.  we lived about four blocks away from the hanger where the 1947 crash debri was taken.  it hvered there for about 15 seconds then shot straight up and was gone in a split second.  i tried to get my husband's attention but i just couldn't speak!  i did file a report of the incident with the roswell ufo museum the very next day.  i had told mr. glen dennis about it.  the strangest thing was that i wasn't scared during the incident.  it was after that

of it, the object was at the horizon, moving so fast that she saw tracers/trails behind the lights. it then looped around and flew over the darkened playground in which she was sitting. she  said it was low enough to light up the entire area and absolutely silent, moving extremely slowly. at this point, she took the photo of the object.  she got scared and started walking home.  i called her and while we were talking, it flew over her again very fast.\r\n\r\ni have included the one photo she managed to obtain.  i hope it helps.  she was not able to gauge altitude, distance, size, or speed,

sun 9/7/08.  looking north towards plymouth meeting.  i noticed a bright orange orb(it was hard to miss) flying accross the sky coming from the nw(316 degrees) heading east. i first thought it was a plane, but it was orange, no blinking lights and the light was big and bright. i followed it accross the sky until it disappeared at about 76 degrees.  another one then appeared around the some area ( 316 degrees).  it also flew towards the east, that is when i ran into get my binocs.  it was not a plane.  it was not a meteor - no tail.  it was orange there was also something coming out of the top.  my fiance also saw it through the binocs and described it as a disc with \"fire balls\" coming out of it. there were four orbs in total, i did manage to film the last two, the final one disappearing at about 8:15. they all travelled on a straight line, not moving up or down. all four disappeard in the same exact spot. no more followed. the video i have is shaky, i was trying to get the tripod hooked up and i was trying to zoom in to see if i could figure out what it was.  the best shot i have is around 1:30 in my video,  it shows the houses and you can see the orb travelling in the background. this was witnessed by about 6 people.\r\n\r\nlink to youtube video: http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=y3a4tdvksfm\r\n\r\ncan you please email and let me know what you guys think it

clear night at first i thought i was see a shooting star when it was first coming into sight . but as i stared to wait for it to \"burn out\" it only became more clear it was easily seen in a tripod shape and it was completely silent. on each end of the shape there was like a like but different than an airplane light because the lights were not blinking nor did they reflect off the night sky.It was flying across the sky at the same speed as a typical flying object but also rotating as it was moving foward i live directly in the landing path of the burlington international airport i am very familiar with what airplanes sounds and what they look like when they are landing and taking off . this is nothing like ive ever seen in my entire life. after we could not see it anymore we looked at each other like in disbelief or shock did we just see a ufo? my first reaction was to call anyone service like the airport who may be sky watching or wouldve know of any type of plane that would be this unusally shaped and quiet . the woman said she only passanger planes were arriving last night and there was no plane landing or taking off around the time we had witnessed this unkown aircraft. i dont know if ill ever see somthing like this again but this was truly amazing! i wish i knew if anyone else had witnessed this.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

am using the bathroom. i live out in the country where it is quite dark and nothing to obscure my view.  i happened to look out the window and saw something small in the sky that was too high in altitude to be a plane.  i then saw it changing colors ans thought again of the lights on the plane, but too high.  i could clearly see that it was changing colors.  i got my binoculars and looked out the window at it.  my first vision i feel that i can not trust as i was unable to reproduce what i first saw.  i thought i saw a triangular shape with lights around the perimeter with rotating colors.  i had my wife look through the glasses and she could clearly see the color changes but not the overall shape of it. i then looked again at it 10 minutes later and could still see it but could no longer make out the shape.  as such i am not sure if what i initially saw shape wise was correct or if it had moved.  my vision is 20/20.  i compared this object to other stars in the sky and while it looked very far away (somewhere over the atlantic i would say) it was larger and brighter, course changing colors too, than any other object in the sky.  i have never seen this before and will look again tonight and from here on out to see if i can see it again.\r\n\r\nthe early morning was dark but very clear, no wind, rain or anything else to note.\r\n\r\ni went to bed ad 4:00am and it was

outside of town off of m-33 to see the hydro-electric dam.  when we got there we noticed a few hawks gliding over the river and started to watch them.  after a few moments we both noticed an object in the sky near the sun that was moving towards us.  it seemed to be very high up based on its size, but it was moving incredibly fast.  i've seen airliners flying overhead at 30,000 feet and this was moving much faster.  i've also seen military jets flying overhead and this was also much faster than that.  we expected to hear some sort of noise from the engines, thinking that i was possibly a jet of some sort, but it was absolutely silent from the time we saw it to a few minutes after it had passed.  it was triangular in shape and few straight almost directly overhead.  it was near impossible to judge height based on the lack of noise or noticeable details and the whole experience lasted maybe a few minutes until it was blocked from view by the treeline.  i searched through google for any other people that may have seen something like this in the area or in neighboring states, but haven't seen anything yet.  my gf and i are very skeptical of what we saw today and really want some sort of verification of what it was, whether that's someone else seeing the same thing or some sort of logical explanation. please tell us we're not crazy.
