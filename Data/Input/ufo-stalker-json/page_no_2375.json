for several minutes, i wasn't watching the clock, but i had only smoked about half of a cig. and star gazing as the stars were well visible that night.  i first saw the lights of a large airplane pass over at a high altitude from west (over the mississippi river)  moving toward the east.  the plane wasn't audible until it had dissapeared from my sight over the facility's roof.  about a minute later i noticed another object following the same trajectory as the plane, i first believed this to be another plane as commercial flights often pass over this area.  as the object moved closer, i noticed that the lights were not typical of the commercial planes i am familiar with. the lights seemed to blink red, blue, and yellow in a distinct pattern.  at this point i was thinking that it was just an odd plane, but when the object was directly over my head it simply dissappeared.  given that it is very dark here at this hour, i thought that perhaps a small random cloud had passed between my view and the object, so i continued to watch for it to reappear as the stars in the area i had seen the object dissappear were still well visible.  after several minutes with still no sound associated with this second object and no further sighting of it i heard a helicopter to the west.  i looked in that direction and saw a helicopter (obviously identifiable by the lights and sound).  the helicopter made a loop around the area i had seen the object dissapear in and then returned to the west, dissapearing behind the tree line.  growing up in atoka, tn very near the naval base at millington, i am quite accustomed to seeing various aircraft in the sky at all hours of the day and night.  we used to watch the air show from my front yard every year, but this was unlike anything i have ever seen, military or commercial.  i heard no reports on the local news about anything occurring, or being witnessed in the sky that night.  i don't know what it was, but it was strange and gave me a gooseflesh sensation (which i have rarely experienced since childhood). by the time i had returned inside, 20 minutes had passed.  i am not 100% on the date, it was early on a sunday morning in late july or early august.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

was more random than a firework could ever be) that was rapidly moving in a ridged movement for about 40 seconds. i woke my husband who was able to see this for about 15 seconds until we could not see it through our window anymore. at that point we both got out of bed and looked out the window to see where it went, we did not see that rapidly blinking start light again but saw approximately 6-8 white blinking lights that formed a circle (looked as if it was the size of our development or bigger, huge craft). we considered the option of it being planes but there was no red light on another wing, they were all moving in formation, and it wouldn���t explain the blinking light. it did sound like 5 planes were going over our house (subtle but noticeable) but it made more of a hovering sound rather than plans and continued until we saw it slowly move to the east. that was the last we saw of it until we couldn���t see anymore because of the slight precipitation in the air. i can���t think of anything else that would explain this encounter and have never seen a ufo in my life. i have seen plenty of planes and it was not that, my husband works at an airport so he knows it wasn���t as

a hotline or on mufon, and decided to report it! it is always the same thing but in different spots above my house. it will sometimes go south to north and other times west to east or vice versa! the only way i can describe it is that it truly is a u.F.O. to me because i'm not saying it's an alien starship, but it is unidentified to me and there are no f.A.A. regulation lights on it! it seems to be just a moving star and my mom has seen it as well!! the object just seems to float in mid-air miles above our house. it will look like a shining, bright star in the nighttime sky, but then we will see it moving at a slow pace. it flashes real bright sometimes but only when i look at it, because i have told my mom and she hasn't seen it flash yet. after it flashes real bright, it will appear as a normal star but it is moving and it gets dimmer and dimmer untill you can't see it anymore!! i'm not sure what it is but i see it alot and my sister-in-law said it could be a satellite but i heard they only move south to north?? this one that i have seen moves in all directions and makes no noise at all!! it also seems to disappear right in front of your eyes?? so to whomever is reading this report, if you have any information about what this object is please contact me and relieve my curiousity!!! i know i didn't leave any contact info in this report, but i'm sure someone out there knows how to find me and get in touch?? well thanks for taking the time to read this!!! and one last note this isn't a hoax i am dead serious and i would like to know what this object is

facing west. from this window which is on the 7th floor and completely unobstructed i saw a large bright white object very low and sitting stationary in the sky. this object was not there earlier in the evening nor was it there yesterday. i thought maybe it was a planet because it was so large,low and bright. as i saw this object just sit in the sky,it also did not have any faa lights, windows, noise, markings, structure, it did not move, pulsate or blink. the skies were clear and the object from my point of view was that of a large beachball. it was close in my line of sight from my apartment maybe 1/2 mile out and it was near a brick tower as a point of reference.\r\n\r\nwhile this object sat in the sky for at least 20 minutes in the same spot there was alot of aircraft traffic heading towards ohare airport. coming from the south were planes one by one flying underneath and past this object. also in the farther distance you could see the aircraft in the waitng line with them stacked in the sky.\r\n\r\nthen after about 20 mintutes of watching this bright white stationary object it turned into a different color, it turned a deep cherry red, with orange and purple hues. when it started changing colors it started moving in the same spot it looked like a shelled peanut shape. it looked like it twisted in the spot into these colors without changing it original location in the sky. as it changed into these colors and shape it started moving ever so slowly to the right a couple feet and stopped for a minute or so. regular aircraft traffic was still heavy with the same patterns going on.\r\n\r\n after about a minute or so this red object slowly starting moving staight west still in the same low tragectory towards ohare airport. this red hued object was not blinking or flashing. it was just a red/orange/purple ball of light moving. it took about 10 mintues for what looked like it was right over the airport and then past the horizon. all the while, i could see all the regular air traffic going in and landing. this object from my point of view seemed to be in the middle of all this air traffic.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12416,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8841636,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09102008-0006","longitude":-87.6234582,"occurred":1221014700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1221014700000,"summary":"Large

(near smoke lake sighting on aug. 19, 2008) i had awakened at 4:30 am, (reason unknown), and had made coffee over the fire. while it was cooking, i walked down to the lake to look at the stars since the sun had not come up yet. as i looked to the south, (approximately 1/2 mile away), i noticed a large, bright, multiple colored, (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, with varying location), sphere shaped object flashing right on the treeline. this object spanned the width of at least 6 large pine trees directly below it. (i could see them silouetted below the object). i did not have a camera but my binoculars were in the canoe so i grabbed them to take a closer look. the object was definitely sphere shaped with alternating color patterns. as i watched, it arose and lowered in the sky, but never below the tree line. after about an hour it rose to a height of 100 to 150 feet above the trees but did not get smaller or travel along the trees in any direction. initially, i thought the object was an airplane or helicopter but soon realized there was no sound at all and the changes in the lights were not consistent with aircraft. after another 5 to 10 minutes i heard an airplane off to the west of the lake, at cruising altitude, moving much faster and much smaller than the object i was observing. the plane was gone from my sight within 5 minutes but the object remained for at least another 20 to 25 minutes without moving in any direction. i continued watching until faded from view with the lightening sky. during and after the sighting i felt i was watching some type of ufo and after speaking to a few people about it, i still feel i was being visited or observed for some reason. in addition, after relating this to my wife, she went on to the mufon site and we read about another similar sighting which took place north of smoke lake on aug. 19, 2008 at 10:14 pm. the reporters description seems to be very similar to my own in every way except duration. these two locations are relatively close to each other. within 10 miles. i would welcome contact from mufon as well as the other individual who had a sighting from this area to exchange information.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":12408,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":51.262735,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-09092008-0010","longitude":-85.3190939,"occurred":1220441400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1220441400000,"summary":"Varying multi colored, sphere shaped, hovering object above tree line.

the time, jay a friend of ours and me brenda the driver. i have made this many times.If you have ever driven hyw349s from lamesa to midland texas you would dicover a worn out 2 lane highway,for as the senery, well there is none unless you like mesquite,cacti,and of course lots and lots of horney toads. it is about a 60 mile stretch from lamesa to midland. around 11pm mountain time (car clock)we were going about 80 mi hr. when the car began to viberate and jerk, karen began to hollar \"pull over there is something wrong with the car!\" i quickley looked down at the gauges, the clock read 11pm andthe other gauges read normal. i looked up and everything was lit up by a brillant blue light. a colbat blue or the blue on a gas flame. i looked to the right (west) there it was, a circluar disk (like a plate turned upside down) red white and blue lights spun around in a uncounter clock way around the disc.The disc was silvery,no noise what so ever. all of a sudden it shot over the car to the east then in a split second it was behind us.The next thing i remember karen screaming (go go go!!!!!)she was terrified.Idon\"t remember ever pulling the car over but here we are in a ditch with the cacti.I really had to punch the gas pedal to get up the incline of the ditch.I looked at the gauges the clock still read 11 but the radio said it was 12:30 (that was texas time) my car clock should have read 11:30 but read 11. i guess i began to panic i kept repeating did you see it, did you see it, what do we do, what do we do!!!!!!!\r\ni wanted to call some one yea right who in the hell would believe us. we were 30 miles from midland when our incounter happened, 30 miles to go.\r\nwe got to midland told everyone in the household, their response (yea right.)karen,jay and i needed to get some rest for in 5 hrs we had to head back to colorado. oh i forgot about jay, he slept through it all! \r\nkaren and i did not get any sleep she was sick at her stomach and i was trying to warm myself with a small heating pad.I was so cold i could not quit shaking,it felt like my body was in shock. \r\ntwo odd things i can't explain!\r\n1. my wrist watch stopped at 11 too and never worked

sky. it had rained and i wanted to see if it was still overcast guessing at whether it might rain again or perhaps in the morning.I saw a streak of light in the western sky and had thought at first it was a bolt of lightning. however as i continued to view the growing darkness of night i realized that there were lines of light that simultaneously came out of each direction--north, south, east and west; met in the northern sky spun in a clockwise direction three or four times and then each went back from where they came to start the dance in the twilight over again.These \"lights\" were not saucer or cylinder shape they were \"globes\" of intensely bright white light. as they traveled from each direction bright white light trailed behind them. when they met and spun they appeared to look like four \"ying and yang\" shapes.I live about one to one and a half miles away from several car dealerships which are in the north and i thought to myself that perhaps it was a laser light show used as an advertising tool. waterbury, connecticut is known for its steep hills and valleys so to me it seemed impossible as each globe went to the north south east and west as far as the eye could see; if it was a laser show a hill or valley would get in the way stopping me from seeing its straight continuous path.These \"globes\" traveled faster than any plane, helicopter or jet that i have ever witnessed in my fifty plus years.I do not drink alcohol and i do not take any illegal substances i was not sleeping before i took my dog outside so i wasn't dreaming. i have never seen anything like this. my one regret is that i didn't have my camera phone with me as this sighting lasted more then ten minutes and i could have gotten some great shots.  as quickly as they appeared they disappeared silently again to the north south east and west.  since i witnessed this in june (2008) several other people have come forward to claim that they've seen similar \"lights\" have called the police and have even made it to the waterbury republican newspaper.If there is an explanation for this i would sure like to hear it....Since then....I go nowhere without my camera phone!\r\n","distance":"101-500

was driving i noticed two bright amber colored lights moving from west to east,i observed this or these objects from my car for approx 1 minute,what caught my attention was the lack of runner lights.I pulled over in front of our corner bank and got out of my car.The object move across the the sky at a good rate(hard to estimate,but not a ballon,at least several hundred miles an hour)and disappeared into the horizon.Im not sure,but the lights seemed to be one craft.This is my first time reporting any sighting,but i have witnessed several of these objects since febuary 08,and also,objects that seem to mimic stars,but then fade in and out,not due to cloud cover.I own my own company and i work outdoors in the middle of the night.I have noticed a dramatic increase lately,and i would like to hear from anyone in this area who has experienced the same.Thank you john s","distance":"Over One

near the moon. i pointed the moon out to my daughter and told her that it might be jupiter near the moon, but i didn't know how accurate that was. we were facing the south and i pointed out what i believed to be sirius, blazing brightly. i then turned around and faced north and saw an identical star blazing out of place. it was bright, unmoving, and steady. it was at roughly the same angle in the sky as \"sirius\", only directly opposite and in the northern sky. i thought that it might be a plane, but it was not following any standard approach, nor was it moving, but i figured that might be simply due to my angle and it could be moving roughly in my direction. then, it started to moved either downward or farther north. i could not be certain because it seemed to drift slowly, but the light was fading very quickly. within only a few seconds it had dimmed out completely, moving only a degree, maybe two, in my field of vision. when the light had dimmed, i noticed no blinking lights, red and blue lights, or in fact any other light that i would expect to see on an aircraft. it simply faded. there was no sound of a jet, prop engine, or helicopter, or any other sound for that matter. the light was white and faded out in the same color. the event lasted only 15 seconds at most, but was a little eerie as i didn't have time to analyze all the information before it was over.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then

noticed a bright object in the southern sky - brighter than a star.  it caught my eye because it was lower to the horizon and brighter than stars are in my area.  as i watched longer it seemed to change colors from green to white to red to white to orange, etc.  at this time i stopped walking and watched some more.  i thought maybe it was an aircraft approaching but it didn't get any closer or seem to change in position relative to the horizon like approaching aircraft do.  it seemed to be hovering - not moving left or right or toward me.  it also seemed be oscillating up and down slowly.  it wasn't making big movements, but rather small.  at this point i really thought my eyes were playing tricks on me in the darkness and that thing really couldn't be moving only up and down.  i had been watching for maybe a few minutes at this point.  i went inside to get my wife to look at it also, to make sure i wasn't just \"seeing things\". i took her out on the front porch and asked her to look in the direction of the light, without telling her what to look for.  she immediately noticed it and i prompted her to further describe to me what she was seeing.  she said that it was moving up and down and changing colors.  after about another 3-4 minutes it seemed to slowly move to the east and then it seemed to be moving north toward our house.  within 30 seconds or so we could start to see flashing lights on the object.  as it got closer, i could see a white flashing light on one side and a steady red light near the rear.  it started to look like an airplane (delta shape) but it was getting pretty close and i still didn't hear the engines.  eventually, it flew to the east of our house at an altitude of maybe 2000-3000 ft. and seemed to be traveling about the speed of commercial aircraft normally seen in our area.  i eventually heard the sound of a gas turbine engine but it was quieter than most commercial aircraft.  from the time it started to no longer hover until it passed by our house was probably about one minute.  i think this might have been an airplane but the hovering in one place for almost ten minutes and the oscillating movement lead me to believe otherwise.  i figured i'd report it anyway, though.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
