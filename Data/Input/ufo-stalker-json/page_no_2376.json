sunday, september 8, 2008, at 1000 hours, i began observing the mt.St.Helens volcanocam, real-time-image on my windows xp pc, taken from the johnston ridge observatory, which is at 4500 foot elevation and about 5-miles nnw of the volcano. the volcanocam image updates every 60-seconds.\r\n\r\ni intended to meditate for 30-minutes by focusing on some minute aspect of the dormant volcano. rising from within the volcano, a whispy steam cloud ascended and crowned the right inside slope of the crater. at the same altitude as the right rim of the volcano, and about one-sixth of the diameter of the caldera distance out from the right rim was a small blimp-like, white, cumulous cloud the right end of which was spherical. the potato-with-onion shaped cloud appeared directly alongside the volcano. \r\n\r\nthe movement of the misty cloud of steam suggested a left-to-right breeze, which also suggested that the small white cloud would drift steadily to the right.  curious, i scribed a vertical line on the window glass, with a felt-tipped pencil, at the left end of the small white cloud. since the image updated every 60-seconds, i knew the movement of the white cloud would be easily seen. the white cloud measured only one-half inch in length on the computer glass. and i chose to focus on the left end of the cloud while meditating. i began focusing/meditating at 1008. minutes passed. the image updated every 60-seconds. but the white cloud was absolutely static. \r\n\r\nthen i recalled reading in a ramtha book \"ufo's and the nature of reality\",  ed. j.P. koteen, page 177: ufo's...\"they appear as clouds. you will often see them when there is nothing else in the sky except one particular cloud.\" the small, unusually static, white cloud was the only cloud visible. at 1025 it vanished. a same diameter, white, also static, spherical cloud remained. (i printed a color copy of the volcano which just shows the left edge of the remaing cloud.)at 1039 it also vanished.\r\n\r\nat 1455 the same day,i returned to the volcanocam.  a similar-to-earlier,\r\nsmall, white cloud hovered above the earlier spot. i made a color copy of the computer image which shows the left end, only, of the new cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n don m. johnson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.S. \r\n\r\na year ago while driving in ventura, i stopped at a traffic light.\r\ni was facing the ocean a little over a mile away. a brisk on-shore breeze swiftly bore a low-level-blanket of small cumulous clouds inland. but i noticed a small, but dense white cloud that hovered statically over the beach, while the other clouds raced around it. the scenario did not change as i drove toward the beach for several blocks and turned away.\r\n\r\n\r\ndmj\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"00:20:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":12392,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.05574,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09082008-0008","longitude":-122.305199,"occurred":1220808300000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Blimp,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1220808300000,"summary":"A small, solitary, stationary, static cloud vanished after 20 minutes of being observed bu me.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Cougar, Washington","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:336929"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Benson","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was driving back from my cousin's house on thursday, august 4th, 2008 at around 11 o clock and i saw this light in the sky. the area i was driving in is a rural area, the nearest town is about 3 miles away, and that town only has 2000 people in it probably. at first i'm like, \"oh, that's probably a plane\"; but since i've always been intrigued with lights in the skies, i watched it as i drove home. as i'm looking at it, i realize the light doesn't look like a plane at all, because it's shimmering like a star would, and seems to be shifting colors between white, blue, purple and green. i could tell it wasn't a star however, because it was bigger and brighter than anything else in the sky, even the north star; and also it was moving side to side slowly. so i stopped my car and watched it, and the light kept getting bigger and the light looks even more strange the closer it gets, it was probably the weirdest light i've ever seen, i wish describing it could do it justice... so i'm like \"i wanna know what this is, i'm going to go follow this thing.\" so i turn my car around and follow it, which was a distance of about a mile, and maybe 2 minutes; and i get onto a side road and start to realize that the light is close, like real close; like maybe 100 feet in the air at most, probably lower. i get within probably 50 feet of it, and stop my car. it just hangs there in the sky, not moving. from my angle it seemed to be rather small (compared to other accounts of triangle-craft i've heard after i witnessed this), somewhere between the size of a military jet and a concorde jet. so i just looked at it, searching for a rational explanation, but couldn't think of any. it had three lights on it, one on the \"front\" that was the bright shifting light i saw before, and two dimmer lights that form a triangle (and from what i could tell, the craft looked like a triangle). the lights were all white (as opposed to an aircraft which has a green and red light on each wing so other planes can know what direction it's heading). then it starts moving real slow away from me, and just disappears as it got about half a mile away. from what i could tell it had no sound, which an aircraft or helicopter would being that low, and it also moved too slow to keep itself aloft like that if it were an aircraft. the entire time my heart was racing, as i knew this was not something that could be explained by any justification that i could think of at the time. (i was actively trying to \"debunk\" what i was seeing as it was happening) i also have seen a \"green fireball\" years before that zoomed over my house at roughly 50 to 100 feet. there is the possibility it was a meteor, but seeing as it was so close to the ground and yet still roughly the size of an rv, it seems there would've been an impact somewhere close that would be reported. since then, i have watched the skies for any other signs of things i couldn't explain, and on the night in question; it definitely paid off!\r\n(i have included this link to a video i found a few days later

the rain coming down. when i looked i saw a very bright light low in the sky. at first i thought it was a plane but it did not move or blink . then i thought it must be a planet. so i went about my business of making the bed and starting the coffee. as i was going into the bathroom to take my shower i heard someone yelling down below on the city street. so i quickly went to the window and looked down to find a tow truck down on the street. my attention then went back to the light in the sky which was still bright white and in the same location. i looked out the window some more and then to my amazement i saw this bright white object start turning orange and getting bigger in size. but it still did not move. i was then wondering what this could be. this object as it turned orange got 3 times bigger in size. this object then turned smaller and then got back to its original size and bright white. but it still did not move. as i watched this object it then turned off and just disappeared. i saw no objects flying away or lights blinking. then all of a sudden the object came back in the same spot it was in when i first saw it and now it was blue. it then disappeared again, only to come back to the bright white object still in the same stationary spot.\r\n i then was running late for work and took my shower. when i came out i quickly went back to the window and saw the bright white object still in the same location in the sky.\r\n this time this object disappeared and then came back to a blue color and then back to the white stationary object in the sky. then while this one object was there another same sized and same bright white object came out of the sky to the south of it and it then hovered to its right next to it very close. i was thinking what is this. i turned on the news searching for breaking news and bad accidents that may involve helicopters. i found none that morning. as i watched the second object join next to the first, this object remained white and stationary to the first object. then another same bright white object appeared out of nowhere and joined the 2 other objects and formed what looked like a triangle. the third object hovered below the 2 other objects.\r\nboth the second and third objects moved to the right of the object and just disappeared into thin air. i waited and watched as the first light i first saw just

dream and i can still remember parts of it very clearly. i woke at about 5 am with what seemed to be this dream. but it sure seemed like it just happened. i wrote it down right then and drew the sketches of what i saw. it started when i found myself outside and as i looked ahead of me i saw a small very bright light then all of a sudden a very bright flash. when i turned around there were 3 small grey beings standing there. i wasn't afraid (i don't know why). they then told me (telepathically i think) that they needed help (i don���t remember for what) and asked me to help them. i agreed. then i looked up and saw a huge craft hovering near us then i saw a second one about 400 ft away from the \"main\" one (it looked the same). the next think i remember is looking up at the night sky and it was like someone just pulled the sky apart and there was an opening maybe 200ft across. i could see blue sky and clouds in the opening and a humming sound (i didn't hear anything while under the craft earlier). i looked to the left of me and there were two other people stand near me looking up as well. i never saw these people before and none of us seemed to be able to talk or move much (it was like we were all just becoming ���un-paralyzed��� or something). there wasn���t a sound or a breath of air moving. there was some light at ground level that illuminated everything but i couldn't turn to see what or where it was. then all of a sudden the small gray beings were gone and then the first ship flew in to the opening in the blink of an eye and the second one followed right behind. the sky closed. that's all i remember until i woke up (or got back). \r\n\r\nnow the really weird part is my 8 year old daughter was sleeping on the floor because as i later found out she couldn't sleep in her room. later this morning when i was talking to my wife on the phone and before i told her anything about what i saw she said the our daughter had woken her up in the middle of the night (3:30) and saw a lot of very bright flashing lights outside of our upper (roof) dormer window. when i ask her about them before she went to school she said that she though there were about 11 of them. she closed her eyes and said when she opened them a little while later they had stopped. i guess that���s what got me thinking, did i really have a dream or did something really happen? \r\n\r\nupdated: since i wrote that at five in the morning on friday sept. 5th 2008 and now 3 days later it���s still all i can think about. i have been having headaches since this happened and seem to be very moody. when i was out mowing the mower stopped and as i got off i looked up and i had a ���flash back��� of that being the exact spot where we were all standing looking up at these two craft (we live out in the country and have a lot of area). again the longer it���s been the more i feel this really happened.\r\n","distance":"101-500

noon when i receive a phone call at my home from a gentleman which will remain unnamed at this time.  \r\n\r\nhe was speaking fast and seem very excited he told me that he had talked to a person in tx that gave him my name and told him about the mufon website. he said i have photos of hundreds of ufo's that he has taken over his house and barn since july of 2008, some of fleets and some of vehicles every large and wide. he said he has seen some with his eye and some only after taking a photo of the sky do they appear in the photo. he thinks there in the gamma or something. he has shown them to his neighbors and he told me they freak out. he called the state police which came to his house and they told him they had never seen anything like this before, and also mentioned to him about contacting mufon.  \r\n\r\nnow, he would like mufon to come investigate and see his photo evidence collection. before something happens to them. he wanted me to come right away, that night if possible. i told him i would come but not tonight. i wanted to bring others with me to investigate he's claims and that i would call him back with a date and time. he said that would be fine. so i called the ky mufon state director and left him a message. the state director called me back later that afternoon. while i was talking with the state director about this case, the guy calls me back, i put the state director on hold and talk to the guy. he says listen to me i have just taken a picture with about 50 ufo in it flying over my home. he was very excited and told me listen do you have a digital camera. i said yes, he said run out right now and take a photo of the sky looking north toward louisville. there coming your way, you won���t see anything with your eyes but take a photo anyway, i said ok, he said i mean it, i���m not crazy. do it so you can see i���m telling the truth. i hung up with him and went back to the state director who was still holding. i told the state director  what the guy had said to me. and we both thought i should go out and do what he asked. so,i put the state director on hold again went outside with the camera in tow to my back yard, looking northwest toward louisville the sky was totally grey and overcast. i didn���t see anything with my eyes but, i took a picture as instructed and went back inside to talk to the state director, i took out the sd card from the camera and put it into the my computer then said holly sh*t, still on the phone with the state director he asked me to email the photo to him. i waited on the phone till he received it. then the state director looked at and had the same comment i did, the state director counted 53 ufo a fleet as he called it. \r\nboy, now to say the least, this was not turning out to be your typical average day for a section director and a state director here in ky mufon.\r\ni live in bowling green, ky which is south of louisville. since i didn���t see these with my naked eye. i can���t tell you the direction they where moving, but since he told me they were heading my way which is south of him and he does live near louisville. so i would say they were moving southward toward me and the camera, please note as you look at each object all are exactly straight up and down that is odd to me. also odd to me is the fact he told me he saw about 50 in his picture and oddly we counted 53 in the one i took. as i said there was nothing in the sky when i took this picture and i heard no sounds and it wasn't raining. and if these were geese or birds i would have seen them with my naked eye and not taken the photo. i would have watch there flight path 1st to determine what they where. also there were no nat's flying around me at the time either. i took this photo with a kodak easyshare c643 - 6.1 megapixel with a kodak af 3x optical aspheric lens 36mm ��� 108mm (equivalent) it has an automatic lens cover and the lens was clean. and i was looking at the screen when i took the photo and didn't see anything but the overcast grey sky. the only thing i wish, was that there would have been an other object in the photo like a tree or something for size and depth, but i didn't do that just shot the open grey overcast sky.\r\nwe are currently playing phone tag with the gentleman that contacted me. so i have not seen the picture he took the same day before he called me as of yet. the ky mufon state director is also currently coordinating other ky mufon field investigators to investigate his other claims and accompany us to his home to interview him and see his other photographs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Wings","flightPath":"Straight-line

in the western sky at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon, less than 1000 ft. in altitude, and maybe (at most) 1 mile away.  the light was much brighter and a little larger than a star or planet.  it drifted very slowly in the same general position for about 5 minutes before i went outside and scanned the skies with and without binoculars.  i observed the same light for about 10 minutes outside and then went back in.\r\n\r\nat about 10:05 i went back outside to see if that or any other lights could be observed.  at this time i noticed at approximately 75 - 80 degrees above the northern horizon there were several objects with red, blue, and white-yellow lights at a high altitude (probably more than 1000 feet, but still close to this altitude).  i went inside and asked my sister who was visiting at the time to come out and look with me.  she observed the same things i have described.  at times there was no noise, and at other times we could hear the sounds of distant small planes.  these objects traversed the sky, always remaining in view and finally 2 of them assumed a stationary position in the north and northwestern sky.  we watched them remain stationary for about 15 minutes and then returned inside.\r\n\r\ni went to my bedroom to look out the 2 windows that face, one north and one west.  i observed an object in the northeastern sky, as viewed from my north-facing window, that was about 30 - 35 degrees above the horizon.  it had probably been obscured from view outside by a large maple tree in the neighborhood.  it had the usual blue, red, and white-yellow lights of the objects i have been viewing for a week now.  i called my sister and mom into the the room and they observed the same object.  it was just east of the dayton international airport, less than a 1/4 mile from it, and about 300 - 500 feet high.  we watched it for about 15 minutes and then my mom and sister went to bed at around 10:40.\r\n\r\ni continued to periodically observe this object until about 1:00 a.M.  for about the last 1 1/2 hours i noted that the object in the northeast was accompanied by 3 other objects with horizontally configured white-yellow lights (approximately 5 ).  sometimes each of these objects also looked like a ring of lights.  the lights on each object were evenly spaced.  these objects would appear to fade in and out of view as if being obscured by something.  even when they were observable they were curiously faint.  the original object, however, was clearly visible at all times.  it never appeared faint.  these other 3 objects were at approximately the same altitude as the original and maybe 50 yards south of it.\r\n\r\nafter 1:00 a.M. i lost sight of these objects through the north-facing window.  i looked out my west-facing window and now noticed there were at least 4 objects in the western sky maybe 1/4 mile south of the airport.  they only had white-yellow lights.  one of the objects appeared as a vertical line and through the binoculars i could see what appeared to be 5 windows vertically aligned with a barely visible and much smaller white-yellow light just feet from the \"windows\" and to the left of them.  this appeared to be a light attached to the top of the craft with windows.  the \"window\" in the middle of the line of windows (the 3rd) was considerably brighter than the others. this vertically aligned craft was clearly visible, but the other 3 objects were very faint, not hardly visible to the naked eye, but clearly discernable (though faint) through binoculars.  three of the craft were more or less horizontal to the ground.  these objects were about 300 - 500 feet up and 30 - 35 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nthere was a group of around 5 people sitting around a campfire at a neighboring house west of me and the objects were a little further west and north of them.  their party broke up at approximately 2:30 a.M. when 2 groups of people got in 2 cars and drove away.  within several minutes of this, the 4 objects slowly drifted away northward and out of view behind trees in the surrounding yards.  i saw no more objects from my windows after this for about 15 minutes when i stopped looking for the night.\r\n\r\nthe viewing conditions this evening were sometimes very clear and at other times there were 20 or 30 minutes of cloudiness that obscured viewing.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12382,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.8946122,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09072008-0009","longitude":-84.1930108,"occurred":1220684400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

evening my neighbor and i went to a meeting where a group was lecturing on ufos.  a man in the audience was very rude, cat-calling, whistling, etc.  i turned to glare at him, my thought was that he looked strange.  my friend also turned later and commented how strange he looked.  to our surprise he was called up onto the platform and was part of the group. one spoke of a mother ship and its location.  i told my friend that i see that every evening and it is just a big planet.  i would show her when we got home.  after the lecture everyone was taken out doors and was shown what they said were ufos. i saw nothing but stars and said so.  the strange looking young man decided to talk to my friend and me later inside.  he was a nice looking red head w/freckles.  he started telling us what they were doing here, but when he switched from saying \"they\" are doing such and such and said \"we are doing\" etc.  when he did that i believe my mouth dropped open and my brain shut off.  could not come up with the questions i now wished i had asked.  from what he told us it sounded like a minor scientific excursion.  as in gathering plant life, etc.\r\nwhen we got home i started to show my friend the \"planet\".  it was not there and i haven't seen it since.   thinking about the young man all these years trying to know what was different about him.  the only thing i can come up with is perhaps his skin texture may have been the difference.  \r\nthis happened 30 plus years ago.  i have never have been able to talk to anyone about it.  that is anyone that might have answer for

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"We were driving toward home after getting an early breakfast in greeneville.  ty was driving and i (jennifer) was in the passenger seat.  i look over in the sky toward sunrise (the sky had just lit up and turned to daylight) and saw what appeared to be a white streak of a light.  i didn't say anything, but ty turned and looked at it too.  he said, \"look, the space station...\" a long pause and then... \"or a ufo.\"  i said i had been watching it too.  \r\n\r\nwe pulled onto the main highway (highway 107) from greeneville and at this time of morning traffic is picking up a bit, so we had cars both behind us and coming in the opposite direction.  all of a sudden the object dropped altitude and flew in our direction (not following the highway, but crossing it) and it dropped so low i was able to see the outline of the ufo.  it was either black or gray in color, clearly a triangle shape, and had three large white or yellow lights underneath.  i remember seeing two or three smaller lights of the same color between those three lights that made up the triangle.  i was able to see it so clearly because it flew right over our car and it was broad daylight by this time.  i estimate it to have been as low as four or five power line poles high (my husband judged 1,000 feet high but he couldn't see it at the point when it passed over us because he was driving).  it was flying relatively slow by smoothly with no noise and went in the opposite direction of sunrise, toward the mountains.\r\n\r\nfriday night we saw something else.  my husband was alone getting gas nearby our home when he spotted a strange amber/orange colored light in the sky over a mountain toward greeneville.  even though he was driving back home he could see it in certain places over the course of about 10 minutes.  when he got home he asked me to come outside, and i did.  from our yard (we live in a very rural area) we have a good view of the greeneville city lights in the distance.  this light appeared to be hovering over the mountain.  we have plenty of cell tower blinking lights and flood lights, etc. but this was none of those.  i told ty to run in and get his telescope.  as soon as he went inside the light disappeared.  i yelled back in the house, \"nevermind, it's gone!\" and as soon as i said that it reappeared in the same spot.  ty brought his telescope out and started to try and get it in view.  the light was slowly moving behind the mountain by this time.  as soon as he got it in view with the telescope, the light disappeared.  it was no star because it had been moving in the opposite direction of the way moon comes up, and it had disappeared and reappeared.\r\n\r\nneither of us were scared during either sighting, just more amazed.  we felt it necessary to contact mufon because, while this was my first ufo sighting, it was not my husband's first.  for three mornings in a row back in june of this year (the month is estimated, we didn't write it down at the time) he was driving to work and saw these things around 4:30am.  the first time scared him to death.  the first morning a triangle was extremely close to the ground (so close it could have been touching, but he doesn't think it was touching the ground) right beside the road in a pre-season tomato field.  as he drove closer the object rose up slightly and tilted so he saw the lights underneath.  he said they were yellowish in color.  when he got even closer it disappeared.  that afternoon, on his way back home he noticed grass depressions in the (what is now) tomato field.  the next morning he saw another one further away in a different field, and yet again the next morning he saw an object in the sky.  after discovering the grass depressions in the tomato field we took a camera out to take pictures.  while driving by snapping shots we found other fields with similar grass depressions, all along about a three mile stretch of highway 107 (the opposite end of the 107 highway from greeneville).  we have those pictures on our computer.\r\n\r\nthis does appear to be a hot spot for ufo activity and mufon should be aware of this.  i am attaching the evidence from my husband's first encounter a few months ago.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Straight-line

almost overhead.  it appeared to be at least 8000 feet in the sky.  i retrieved my (10 by 50) binoculars and watched the object for a good 7 minutes from one position.  it was moving slowly from the southeast to the northwest.  it looked to be a kite sailing by, however, it had a cresent shape on one side and appeared to be changing shapes or changing its angle of orientation every second or two.  its size was about the size of a pencil erasier held out from an arms length.  i could not get a good look at the object due to its constant changing shape.  i quickly laid down on the lawn so i could steady my binoculars for a better look.  i am quite sure it did have a cresent shape on one side of its structure. i observed it move a good 45 degrees in the sky, coming straight overhead of my backyard orientation.  it had a very intense white hue to its shape also.  the only feature i could make out of its structure was its cresent side.  the cresent side was only visable as it appeared to be rolling over, changed its angle of orientation or changing shapes.  the cresent appeared to be in porportion with the rest of the object.  after about 7 minutes of viewing, the cresent side of the object began to change color from its bright white hue into red.  within 5 seconds of the cresent changing to red, the whole object appeared to have turned red and disappeared.  i scanned the sky for a good 5 minutes and could not see this object and observed nothing unusual.  the sky was clear with little wind and very few clouds.  the cresent moon was in the southeast but was not what i was observing.  this was my first ufo sighting.  i feel excited to report, i am now a believer.  my thanks to mufon and to all who report their events.","distance":"Over One

spot in the sky over the valley, and expected it presently to declare itself as a helicopter, but it remained unidentifiable and motionless long enough that i became curious and set my canon s5 digital camera on a rock to use as a telescope.  it has 48x magnification that can resolve the moons of jupiter.  \r\n    my immediate reaction was:  \"no way is that a helicopter!\"\r\n    then it began drifting westward, decreasing altitude.  i started snapping photos.  its motion was smooth like a balloon, no irregularities.  i finally concluded that it almost had to be some wacky balloon, but there seemed not enough volume to support any weight.  and it was bright reflective metallic not matte surface.  it looked heavy, compact, and structurally very complicated. \r\n    the object went between two superimposed ridges on the skyline, precisely where a forest fire had been receiving tanker drops 4 days earlier.  we at first thought it might be some govt recon vehicle doing a followup of that, but it was unnecessarily radical for such work, and we've never seen anything remotely like this in the past.\r\n    distance to object was about 2-3 miles.  no sound, and the environment here is nearly silent. \r\n\r\nwe realized later that the object, if it continued drifting westward following behind that ridge, would pass by the villages of rackerby amd bangor.  palermo

visakhapatnam with my brother-in-law, to take the kids on an outing.  just as  we were returning from the park, i wanted to point out venus to the children. it was 7:00 pm indian standard time.  venus or what i thought was venus was fairly high in the sky.  i could see it as i stood.  it was then that we saw the ufo.  it was somewhat high in the sky ��� judge it to be between 1-2 km altitude, moving in a steady south westerly direction somewhat parallel to the orientation of the park.  it should be noted that there is an airport about 5 km directly in this direction.  the skies were somewhat cloudy but since it was high in the sky, we could see it clearly. what was visible was a dome (it seemed to be glass) with pulsing green, red and yellow lights.  the lights seemed to be tied to the reactions inside the engine.  when i first saw it, the craft was slightly to the left of venus, then it lined up with it and continued on its southwesterly route.  the lights were clearly visible.  a commercial aircraft which was at a much lower altitude (about 300 m) allowed us to compare notes ��� colors were similar although the pulsing was more rapid in the ufo. it was also moving at least 4-5 times faster than the commercial aircraft. what struck us was the speed with which the craft was moving and the total noiseless-ness (we could not hear the commercial craft either). the speed was definitely above mach 1 yet it was completely noiseless.  was the noise being muffled by clouds? i have to say that i have observed commercial jets and they move very slowly and are much slower; i have also seen the space shuttle flying over minneapolis the craft was atleast as fast if not faster than the shuttle.  it was gone from the horizon in 2 seconds, the time it took my brother-in-law to move about 15 feet.  also the dome seemed larger and the lights were clearly visible.  so the craft is a ufo in the strictest sense of the word, do not suggest an alien origin, although there seems to be a 10%\r\npossibility that it was. sorry no multi-media available. have to say that i\r\nam a professor of information systems in a u.S. university.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over
