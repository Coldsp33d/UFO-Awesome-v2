she was at the trash can a bright flash of light filtered through the trees. she stepped out onto the road and watched as this light flashed two more times as it traveled south down the road. she ran to the house to get me and my daughter, grandson. the four of us scanned the sky to the south from the yard.  nothing was observed so we went to the road. we scanned the sky from north, west to south. nothing was observed for several minutes. my grandson first noticed a strobe flash to the ssw at about one fourth of a mile coming over top of a small woods. i picked it up then and we both watched it come on a direct line at us. it moved fast and was low to the ground. probably not more that 150 feet from the ground. it would strobe, then it wouldn't strobe again for about a second and had moved a distance of maybe 100 yards. as it approached  us the strobe turned east before it got the end of the yard. my grandson lost sight of it then. i moved back into the yard and watched this strobe continue east for about one fourth of a mile where it cleared the top of another woods and disappeared.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1

for the most part though one or two raced about the sky in movements that a plane could not do, ie. fast dips and sharp turns that would tear a plane apart.  they were at least a mile west of the park straight down interstate 20 toward alabama.  i would put the altitude at about 1000 to 1500 feet.  i pointed my canon gl2 and started shooting.  i did not have a tripod so some of the images are shaky, but you can clearly see three of the objects hovering in place in a triangular formation.  the ones that were moving were no longer visible.  i used the digital zoom to its maximum, and as the object wafted in and out of automatic focus you can see it pulsating.  one pulsed blue, the other red.  i did not shoot close-ups of the third.  an unusual aircraft (in terms of its large bright signal lights) can be seen flying in the airspace between the park and the object.  this same jet or another one identical to it came by several minutes later and did the exact same thing.  these were not stars or planets.  the north star was to the left as we faced the objects and was brightly lit.  there were few stars that could be seen over the corona of the amusement park, and none at that low orientation in the sky.  the objects all seemed to rotate vertically like a wheel.  i shot for several minutes, but since it was like shooting the points of pins in space, i couldn't get any better video so i stopped.  i work in the media and have hundreds of hours in choppers.  i am familiar with optical anomalies and tricks of light with cameras, and these images were not those.\r\nthis is actually the second ufo event i have witnessed, but it is the first where i actually had a camera.\r\ni plan to post the video on youtube soon.","distance":"Over One

viejo, ca, i was disturbed by the sounds of a helicopter outside in a \"search\" pattern.\r\n\r\nafter about five minutes of the helicopter noise, and also my wife becoming disturbed with the noise, i went outside to investigate.\r\n\r\nnote: normally a helicopter (police or otherwise) would seldom fly over the house, and would not remain in close pattern above my neighborhood.\r\n\r\nafter going outside, i identified at least two helicopters in an irregular \"orbit\" pattern at about 200-500ft agl at the south/east region of boundary oak and wood canyon, just north/east of soka university.\r\n\r\nimmediately adjacent, i observed a disc shaped ufo at the same location in a wobbling hover mode (pitching and rolling about 15-30deg) and with a slow (not more than 20-30 mph) north/west translation.\r\n\r\nthe object shape, flight pattern, lights, and sound, was clearly not consistent with conventional rotary wing aircraft or their flight patterns, and hence, i concluded it was an ���unidentified��� object.\r\n\r\nthe ufo disc shape was inferred by a clearly observed ring of discrete lights (between 8-15 lights, may have been circles or squares) that appeared to line the perimeter of the bottom of the object.  i was not able to see any other shape features.  i am uncertain on the color of the lights (may have been white/yellow/orange).\r\n\r\nthe helicopters (at least two were observed) were holding in a tight pattern to the south/east and to the north/west of the object, and appeared to be \"investigating\" the object.  the type and markings on the helicopters were not visible from my location. \r\nthe helicopters kept a distance of a few hundred feet from the object.\r\n\r\nthe size of the object was estimated somewhere between 30 to 40 ft in diameter, and was at least the size of the adjacent helicopters.\r\n\r\nthe object did not make any noise that i could discern over the sound of the adjacent helicopters.\r\n\r\nboth my wife and i observed the object in a slow hover for at least a few minutes.  then, it moved slowly to the north/west and below the horizon of the homes in the suburb. we did not see the object or helicopters reappear to our location.\r\n\r\ni then left the neighborhood in my car to try and find the object.  in the process, i came across a group of at least 4 neighbors together outside, at least one with a camera, that all observed the same object, and were visibly agitated.  i���m not sure if the person with the camera got a picture.\r\n\r\nfrom a hilltop near soka university, i could see the helicopters in the distance to the north/west, now in the laguna beach area.  from that distance, i could not discern the object.  a few minutes later, there appeared to be additional helicopters that joined the \"search\", probably 3-5 helicopters in total.\r\n\r\nby 10:30pm, and after looking from two other hill/mountain top locations, the number of aircraft lights decreased to at least 1 (probably a helicopter).  i then ended my searching at this point.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering

father who is now deceased witnessed the following sighting.\r\nwe lived on a farm between pickerington and baltimore near the community of harley on hwy 256. at approximately 8:00pm sometime during the summer months i and my father were standing on the front porch. at a distance of what i would guess was 5 to 7 miles south of us we saw a very large blimp like object. the object was at least 6 times the size of a regular blimp. i estimate the altitude to be 1000 to 1500 feet. the blimp like object was covered with hundreds of lights, white, red, green, blue and orange. the object was traveling east to west on a line that would take the object just south of columbus ohio. i asked my father what is it and he replied son it���s not a blimp, at that moment one of the lights on the bottom of the object grew brighter in color and then dropped strait down falling at a high rate of speed. it fell to approximately 200 feet then came strait toward our house at a high rate of speed steadily dropping in altitude until it was just above the corn field across the street then right before impacting our house it made a sharp left hand turn to the west. as it turned i felt the heat and saw the flame on the rear of the object. it looked as if it was a small disc or flat missile shape 10 feet long and 5 to 6 feet wide and about 3 to 4 feet thick. as it turned to the west it accelerated at an extremely fast rate and climbed out of site within seconds. as we turned back to the larger blimp like object it was now moving west and out of our sight. the sighting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. the next morning we went to the corn field just next to the house where the small object had turned just before impacting our house. we observed that the corn was burned on the top of the plants in a strait path heading off to the west for 100 to 200 feet. the burn pattern was about 4 feet wide.  my father called someone ���i don���t know who��� to report the incident. that afternoon 2 men dressed in suits and identified themselves as federal agents came to our house and talked to me and my father about what we had observed. after taking our statements they told us what we saw was a weather balloon, because the weather service had launched them from the airport in columbus that afternoon. funny thing is my father worked at the columbus airport and he did not believe the agents and stated so after they had left. he told me son what we saw was no weather balloon or blimp. \r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet, Over 1

were talking about ufos and then my sister says about how there just might be one in the sky, first i thought it was a joke, but then i looked and saw it. it was flying high in the sky at a fast speed. i originally thought that it was a plane, as i live near an airport, but then i realized that is wasn't making any sound. it was a long oval, like a cartoon version of a pill. it was white with a black line going down the middle. it was surrounded by a faint cloud. i wasn't frightened when i saw it, i was actually happy. the sighting was lost after it flew behind trees behind the house.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:01:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line
