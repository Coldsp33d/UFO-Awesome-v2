clear place and take the photo. i stopped where there was no trees. the sky was very clear so these balls were shinning bright. i took the photo watched them for about a minute and noticed that they were still and there was no noise. one or two of them appeared to move up and down slightly but mainly they were still. i got back into my car and started to drive. i kept looking back at them and after about minute and half they had disappeared, before the end of the road. when i got to my cousin house i took a look at my photo and i was expecting to see the orange balls that i saw, instead i saw what appeared to be metal disc like shapes all of them being the same shape with a little point on the top. when you zoom in and brighten the picture a little they look good. have no idea what they are, but i think they look like death gliders out of

wi\r\n\r\nmy boyfriend and i were heading back home to sun prairie, wi from labor day weekend in the north woods.  we had a couple of friends car pooling with us so we dropped them off in downtown madison first and then headed north/northeast towards home.\r\n\r\nwe usually take east washington out of the city, which turns into hwy 151, and takes us all the way home.  sun prairie is a fairly populated and growing suburb on the outskirts of madison.  although it also has several beautiful farm lands, lots of open country and wild animals, it���s only about a 20-25 minute drive from the city.  it���s far enough though to get out of the hustle and bustle of downtown life.  we���re just not city folk so we love the country feel that sun prairie gives us.\r\n\r\nso we were heading ne on hwy 151, traveling the speed limit of 65, and we were about ��� a mile from our exit 101 ��� main st. when i spotted something and pointed it out to my boyfriend.  i began slowing down, and almost completely stopped because there was no traffic behind us, and we were both watching in amazement while going down the list of possibilities���shooting star, no, comet, no, f-16, no.  it seemed at first to be heading east then slightly se then quickly changed to a ne direction.  it was only about 450-500 feet in front of us and about 500 feet up in the air and descending before it faced ne and completely disappeared.\r\n\r\ni first thought it was a comet because it had a tail of fire behind it and that idea quickly went out the window.  then i thought it was a f-16 because the tail looked like an after burner although the color was orange/red, yellow and white and there were no shock diamonds so it was totally inconsistent with a true after burner, besides the fact that it was descending and there was no roaring noise that would of surely shook my truck and our ear drums. \r\n\r\ni could see no ship, no lights, and not even an outline of a ship, even with the street lights and town lights on.  it seemed to be floating down slowly in front of us with fluid like motions as almost a jet ski would glide on glassy waters.  when it did turn ne, we were looking at the rear of the ship and i could almost make out a ring, similar to a single engine military craft, against a black background, before the burner went out and completely disappeared into the night.\r\n\r\nthe capabilities, maneuvers, and behavior of this craft are like none that the us military has made public or that i have ever seen before.  i contacted the local police department to find out if there were any reports of strange sightings in the area, but there were none.  i also phoned the local madison regional airport, where i know they do have f-16���s, and got a hold of operations where i was told the only landings and take offs were at 9:30 pm and 11:52 pm on sept.1st and 1:30 am on sept.2nd, none of which were f-16���s.  the only planes reported to leave the ground or land were a crj (jet) and a learjet.\r\n\r\nwe were so captivated by what we were witnessing that we didn���t even snap a photo.  i am working on simulating the event in an animated movie and will post it when i���m done.\r\n\r\nthis is not my first time experiencing mysterious lights and air craft in the skies and i do have some pictures of previous events in florida and colorado that i will also be posting on this site.  honestly i have always been a little weary about sharing my photos and findings, for obvious reasons, but now that i have found mufon and have observed the good work they���re doing, i feel relieved, comfortable, and excited, and want to share mufon with all my friends and family!\r\n\r\nps- i���ve attached a map of exactly where it happened and as i said above, i will be uploading an animated version of the event when i���m done.\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Path with

looking star moving southward.  i thought it could be a satellite, as i was watching this move, a flash came from the southeastern direction.  it was a quick white flash as if someone was trying to say, \"hey i'm over here\".  my sister happens to be looking up at the time as well, and makes a comment \"was that a falling star or what\"?  i said \"you saw that too\".  i was relieved to know this was not my imagination.  i said \"no\", i was watching that other star looking object, which was just north west of this flash, when this flash turned on and slowly turned off.  it was not like a falling star at all, it was if someone turned on a bright white light, then slowly it turned off.  \r\n\r\nabout three mins later, i happen to look up, and as i did, i noticed object fly just above me heading north; it appeared to have a wispy orange glow that seemed to have two bright lights at the front of it, almost shaped like a triangle with rounded edges.  i mentioned it to my sister who was sitting next to me.  i thought did i just imagine it, or was i just really tired.\r\n\r\ni was curious to know what this might have been, so i grabbed my binoculars nikon 10x50, i aimed towards the area where i saw the flash originally, as i was searching the skies, this object flew within my view, and it was huge.  it seemed to have two sets of lights in a row in what seemed to appear as a \"v\" shaped object.\r\n\r\nxx     xx\r\n xx   xx\r\n  xx xx\r\n   xx\r\n\r\nnot sure exactly how many lights were at on the object itself, however, i do know for sure it had two sets of lights in each row which outlined this object.  i watched it as it flew almost gliding throughout the sky heading northeast.  i was telling my sister to look up where i was pointing, i did not want to loose sight of this object within the binoculars view, and she said she saw nothing.  \r\n\r\ni am assuming this object must have been up pretty high for my sister not to see it, however, when i saw it looking through the binoculars it appeared to be large.  i would say it was twice the size of a jetliner.  \r\n\r\nthe best way i can describe this object is by comparison.  \r\nexample:  looking up approx. 1000ft at a 747 jetliner, through my 10x50 binoculars, the plane would appear to be the size of a nickel, and the bottom of the airliner would be difficult to see clearly as it is dark, and generally there are no lights at the bottom of the craft, perhaps a blue and red light at the wings and a white/yellowish light at the front of the plane.\r\nnow looking a this \"v\" shaped object it seemed like the lights were a whitish color, yet not blinding, and the object looked to be the size of a 50cent piece, quite large.  i could not tell you what altitude this object was at, as it could not been seen with the naked eye.  \r\n\r\nnote: during this 15 minutes duration, my sister and i noticed the dogs next door were barking like crazy.  we thought \"those dogs are sure non-stop tonight\".  it was getting annoying listening to those dogs.  \r\n\r\nwhile viewing this object through my binoculars, my sister made a comment about the dogs, she said \"did you notice the dogs stopped barking\".  i listened and realized yeah, they did stop.  while looking at this object i couldn't believe what i was seeing.  i just kept saying to myself \"what is it\".  perhaps, it was lingering around the area above the skies unnoticeable, and then decided to leave.  i must say, the dogs were quiet after this thing departed.  \r\n\r\ni wanted to know if anyone else had seen this object in the skies:\r\nlax area, beach cities (sobay), torrance, lawndale.\r\nseptember 1, 2008  approx: 9:51 - 10:15pm ish.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"Over One

feet. it was much higher than a jet would fly. on certain clear days one can almost see windows on a jet airliner and can sometimes identify what a jet type is 727. or737 or dc-10. this was one of those clear days... the sphere was large enough that at least ten airliners could have fit across the face of the side that i was observing. the sphere was hovering for about 1 minute and then, noiselessly, and very quicky accelerated over the horizon in about 1 to 2 seconds. one of the interesting facts was that the craft was some ten miles west of norad (north american air defense command)

around 7 pm (it could have been a little earlier or later, but quite a bit before sunset). i was observing clouds and contrails from the jets in the sky, looking toward the east.  i noticed a silver cylinder type object moving along under the level of the sparse clouds in the upper eastern sky.  it was moving at a reasonable speed that i would expect a jet to fly, going from approximately south to north-northeast. the length of the object would be about the width of the tip of my little finger when held at arms length to the sky (about a 1/2 inch or so), and it's heigth was about a little less than half of it's length - rectangular like - with i believe blunt, not tapered, ends.  i thought it should be an airplane or jet but i kept looking at it and could not notice any wings at all protruding from it.  it did not leave any contrail which isn't unusual.  but as i kept looking at it, i felt that it wasn't flying extremely high so i should have been able to see some shape of wings.  i recalled seeing jets that looked even smaller and higher in the sky and i was able to make out their form, but on this i could only see a cylinder shape.  it appeared to be a silver cylinder and was reflecting the light of the sun (which was behind me and low in the sky) with no apparant lights of its own.  i thought that if a jet were banking or something that maybe i wouldn't see the wings, but it was flying a straight line across the sky. it crossed my mind that maybe it could be a blimp type object but i don't have any comparison to make because i never saw a blimp flying that high in the sky and looking solid silver.  i didn't see any sign of windows, or lights but at that distance, i might not have been able to see them even if there were some.  i watched it until i could no longer see it because of my house and trees.  i look at the sky a lot in the day and night, observing clouds and stars.  i have never seen this type of object and if there is a good explanation for this, i'd like to hear it.  i mentioned it to my husband who wasn't really interested, and when i read the sunday paper article about ufo's being tracted from a local neighborhood (jeannette), i thought i'd report what i saw and maybe get an explanation. \r\ni was so fascinated with watching it, i didn't think to get a picture, which i truly regret.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

one night and told me about a light she saw on the way home from work.  \r\n\r\nwe live out on 70 between campbellsville and liberty, and the taylor county line is about halfway to campbellsville.  she works overnights there, and drives home in the early hours of the morning.  the following is what i entered in my journal at that time:\r\n\r\n\"a couple of nights ago, my wife saw a light following along side her as she drove home from the night shift at work. she described it as a white ball of light. i asked her if maybe it was the moon through the trees, and she said no, that the moon was on the other side. i asked her how large it was, and she said that it was hard to tell because she couldn't be sure of the distance, but it looked to be about as big as a beach ball.\"\r\n\r\ni remember her telling me that it seemed to stay alongside her.  also, i entered this into my journal about my neighbor's sighting a few days after hers:\r\n\r\n\"i told my buddy about it, who has seen far stranger things along with me, and he reacted by asking if she was hallucinating. i thought it was a little unnecessary. \r\n\r\nthen last night, he comes running over when i get off work, and tells me that he forget to tell me what happened thursday night on his way home from his in-laws. \r\n\r\nhe saw a white strobing type light in the sky, and at first thought it might be some sort of tower beacon, even though he'd never seen one there before. but the light kept moving as he'd get closer, and change position. then it eventually just left. i told him that it wouldn't surprise me, as the place he saw it is only a few miles from the famous ufo sighting near liberty, ky in the mid 70's. \r\n\r\ni restrained myself from asking if he'd hallucinated it.\"\r\n

light blinking in the sky. i thought it was a star, but it blinked too rapidly.I thought maybe it was satellite maybe.I got my binoculars and looked at it. that's when i saw the lights in a horizontal line. there were 5 of them: two elongated square shaped lights on each side of a brighter center light.Sometimes above the center light a green light flashed very rapidly, then it would change to orange.The white light always brilliant.At first i thought it must be a plane with its landing lights on, but it never changed direction or altitude. the lights remained stationary for most of the time. i could hear no noise associated with the lights. i saw the same lights on aug. 31 at about 2400 hours.They were in almost the same area of sky - north east of lakeport and about 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon.They only remained for about an hour. on sept.1st i saw them again at about 2245 hours, slightly more to the east than the previous two nights, but the same distance above the horizon.Again they stayed for about an hour.However, this time at one point there was another set of lights above the first set; they appeared to be slightly smaller, but had the same configuration and colors.They were very close to the larger set, almost as if they were sitting on the larger set.They only stayed about 2 minutes, then were gone. they were there then gone. i could not discern a shape; i could only see the lights. i reported this info to an friend of mine who is an astronomer and he plans to try and observe the lights tonight. he should get a better view because he has telescopes available to him. \r\nwhen the object left, it just seemed to disappear.One minute it was there and the next it was gone.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"02:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":12321,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.0521706,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09022008-0014","longitude":-122.9116093,"occurred":1220160600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1220160600000,"summary":"I

i am in the flight path of the rescue helicopters that land in our hospital and go to the airport to fuel.  i have lived in this area for 5 years at this location.  grew up within a few miles and lived out in the country during the late 80's and 90's, where i also have had a strange unexplained sighting. let me say that i have also hunted and been around all kinds of animals and machinery. \r\n                   the wind was blowing all day and into evening. a storm was in the area.  i had shut the windows except for my bedroom window on the west was open a couple inches. my window above my head on the south was open all the way.  i had gone to bed early and was sleeping soundly.\r\ni was awakened suddenly out of sleep by a loud strange worbling noise.\r\nthis noise was like nothing i had ever heard before.  i did not see anything to be quite honest i did not want to look out of the window. this noise went on for at least 15 minutes because i remember looking at the clock.  the impression that i got from the noise was that it was moving in a grid like pattern north to south then east to west.  as if looing for something. this was the impression that i had. the noise got louder and softer as it moved.  as i said i have heard a variety of things and this is like nothing i have ever heard.  i lay in bed thinking\r\nof any possible thing that it could be. this was a worbling whistling noise. i didn't have a tape recorder in the house.\r\n     this continued back and forth very close, seemed to be right over the back yard and a little to the south until it came from the west and moved east until it abruptly stopped when it got very close. i would estimate withing 50 yards or less.  i never heard it again.  i wanted to look out the window but really was very uneasy of what i might see. i felt very uneasy.  i layed awake for quite a while until i fell asleep and did not feel uneasy when i woke this morning.\r\n\r\n   we have a grove of trees behind our house and ever since we moved here i have not felt comfortable going in the north side of it.  my son who is grown feels the same way.\r\n    a few weeks ago i was sleeping and was awakened in much the same way by a noise that i have not heard before.  it was coming from the north edge of the trees this time.  it was a call that sounded like some other kind of animal but again nothing that we have in this state.  we have had foxes out there and they sound really strange but this was no fox.\r\n    both times the dogs didn't seem to notice which i find strange.\r\nthe call from the trees

first i thought they were geese flying in a v formation, and then realised that geese don't fly at 3000 feet and at 500 miles per hour (approx). they were about 5 to 8 miles away and heading south, about where shreiver air base is at.About that time , two of my co workers came out, and i pointed out what i was looking at. they also seen it. the objects were playing it looked like, because at first they were in the v formation, then the two in the rear would separate and fly up front while the two up front would separate and go back where the two had been. then the second to the rear ones would go up front, while the front ones would go to the rear. then they would all break formation and would fly in a group of a rough circle, flying erratically. all at once in a instant as one all together, they tilted at a 45 degree angle very fast as if they had dodged something, then immidiately straightened back out as a group. as they did this the sunlight glanced off of them, showing them to be metallic craft of some kind, and were in the shape of something between a diamond and a disk.The tall trees out side then got in the way, so i ran around the building to see if i could spot them as they went southward, but the trees were also in the way in the front of the building, so i lost them. i then went back to where my two friends were still at, and was discussing the strange event, when i looked up where the objects had been earlier, there was a plane flying in the very same spot and in the very same direction as the earlier objects had been. it was not a jet or a passenger plane,but looked like a military plane. now that led me to believe that someone knew about this event as well.Two years later my sister sent me a dvd that she had transfered from my dads old movie films onto disk of our childhood in montana, and 15 minuets into the footage, lo and behold their they were again! only this footage was taken in the late 1960's or early 70's. the same exact thing flying at about 2,000 or 3,000 feet.And doing the same thing as what i witnessed in 2004 , only this time in montana!I believe if the footage now on disk were enhanced with computer technology, it would show very clearly, and up close what i also witnessed in 2004.It was unusual enough, that my dad filmed them for approx 30 seconds or so. i'm not sure how to download the dvd clip for you, otherwise i would.(sorry) i'm only in colorado springs, which isn't far from you in ft, collins. maybe you can have someone call me or stop by and i will be happy to play it for themm and see what they think.  thank you. sincerely; matt ","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

reason, i was wide awake and could not fall back to sleep.  after tossing turning for some time, i realized i could not sleep and decided to go outside and maybe the night air would relax me, enabling me to return to sleep.  i dressed and went out to our backyard patio.  i noticed the time was 3:37 a.M.\r\n\r\nafter sitting on the patio for a few minutes, i noticed a light in the southern sky.  it appeared to be standing still so i thought it was a helicopter but i heard no sound.  then, the light moved eastward and stopped again.  still, there was no sound.  after a few seconds, the light started moving northward.  as i was observing this through trees, i walked out into the yard, where there were no trees, to see the light better.  the sky was very overcast.  as the light moved northward, toward me, i could see that it was several lights in a vee formation with the apex of the vee pointing north.\r\n\r\nwhen the object was almost directly overhead, it stopped.  it was huge.  a few seconds later, the lights dropped through the overcast and i could plainly see a large \"v\" structure.  it had 11 lights; five on each \"leg\" of the vee and one at the apex.  it continued to descend and soon, a huge structure, apparently connected to the vee, broke through the clouds.  the many lights from the city illuminated the structure and i could distinctly see very symetrcial seams of the structure.  it was somewhat oval shaped with a flat edge at the rear--somewhat like a clam shell shape.  there was a protrusion out each side, near the rear of the craft.  the craft stopped descending and stood still for a few seconds.  then, a small, orbital light came out of the protrusion on the east side, passed between the vee and the larger part of the structure and appeared to re-enter the craft on the west side.  a few seconds later, another light exited the west side protrusion, crossed between the vee and the main body, and hovered there.  i had a ver distinct feeling i was being observed.  then, the light recrossed the craft and re-entered the craft via the protrusion it had started from.  the lights appeared to have other lights within them that changed colors from red to blue to a purplish to red again.\r\n\r\nthe craft remained stationary for a few more seconds, then rose back through the overcast.  a few seconds later, the craft very quickly shot northward and disappeared.\r\n\r\ni remained standing in the yard, for i don't know how long, trying to comprehend what i had just seen.  i re-entered my house and immediatly made a sketch of the craft while everything was fresh in my mind.  i noted the time was 4:25 a.M.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Path

 i was so excited that i told my siblings/cousins who were outside with me, but they really didn't seem as interested as i was.  i ran frantically into the house to get my parents so they could see it and photograph it.  they were busy entertaining my relatives and really didn't believe me as i hysterically tried to convince them that there was a ufo outside.  unfortunately i clearly remember the helpless feeling and frustration that overcame me as i realized that they either did not believe me or just didn't want to be bothered.  when i returned outside the object was gone.  i have not seen a ufo since then.\r\n\r\ni have estimated the date and time of the sighting to be either 1983/1984 summer and it was about 9:30pm.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":12304,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.4501248,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-09012008-0008","longitude":-79.9910664,"occurred":458722800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":458722800000,"summary":"Orange/yellow/white fireball with tail was noticed in natrona heights, pa","tags":["fireball"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:337896"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Weston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":null,"distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Unknown","formattedAddress":null,"id":12303,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":26.1055654,"location":null,"logNumber":"-09012008-0007","longitude":-80.3934948,"occurred":1218438000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Florida","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Oval","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1218438000000,"summary":"Oval shaped airplane in a blink of an eye high up in the sky.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Weston, Florida","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:337897"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2378}
