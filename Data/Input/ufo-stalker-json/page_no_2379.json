seen a bright light through the gaps in the tree canopies that line the road, the road being approximately 60 feet from the front of my house, traveling towards me from a south easterly direction. having served in the u.S. air force for four years and have seen many aircraft flying at 500 feet during excercises, i feel comfortable at estimating the altitude to be approximately 1000-2000 feet. when i first noticed the light i had assumed it to a small propeller aircraft. i realized within 10 seconds or so, the craft was flying slightly faster than you would expect a small aircraft to fly. i was waiting to hear the engine as it came closer. after a brief moment listening and it came closer to be almost overhead, there was absolutely no noise at all. i immediately knew when it cleared the obstructed view of the tree canopies, it was definitely not any kind of \"normal\" aircraft. i quickly turned to open the front door and told my daughter to come outside and fast. in the way i said it and quickly running out to the front yard, she knew to run to see something. by the time we both looked up, the craft was directly overhead and had a defined outer ring of light with another inner and brighter ring of light. it was also considerably dimmer than it was when i first noticed it.  my best guess in the diameter would be at least twice the diameter of what i would expect for a helicopter's blades to be for the altitude it was at (approximately 100 to 200 feet in diameter). just before we lost sight because of the maple tree to our west, we saw one blip of a small red light that appeared to be on the top part of the craft. when the tree obstructed our view, we ran to the driveway on the opposite side of the tree and looked upward. surprisingly, the craft was very dim and just past a directly overhead direction. the next second, there was no light at all, only the dark silhouette of the perfectly circular craft against the clear night sky and background of stars. as the craft continued north west at it's constant speed and the distance from us increased, we were able to see it had a domed dimension above and below the centerline of the craft. we continued watching for about 10 to 15 seconds until we lost sight of it beyond the tree line that is approximately 150 to 200 yards away and the trees being approximately 60 to 80 feet tall. i turned to my daughter and told her she had just witnessed a once in a lifetime event. we were both in awe of what we had just witnessed.","distance":"20 Feet or

approximatly 11:40 pm when my wife and i first spotted a cluster of lights in the sky about a couple of miles ahead of us. we first thought that it could be a helicopter of some kind with many lights under it as it seemed to be stationnary in the sky. but as we were appoaching the sighting, the cluster of lights did not look like anything i've ever seen on a helicopter. it was heading slowly toward the south-west and could not make a good description of it. as we were trying to understand what we had just witnessed, i asked my wife to keep an eye over the trees in case she might spot it again. as i was asking her, i spotted another one near windsor ct. following the same path as the first, from the north-east heading south-west . this time we were getting much closer as we kept on driving. the more i drove, the more we knew we were going to drive right over the craft. as it got closer we knew that this was something we had never seen in our lives. as we were almost over it, we could finally make out the light pattern. it was in a v shape with 6 big round glowing white lights. these big lights did not lit the ground. there was a smaller white light at the front with 3 smaller white blinking lights and a small pulsating red light in the midlle of the craft. it made no noise, as our windows were pulled down because it was a hot and muggy night. it was not going very fast. it must have been about 300 to 500 feet over us. we could not make out the triangle dark craft itself as the 6 lights were overshadowing the structure but could tell it was a solid craft because of the difference between the sky and the flying object. ounce it had past over our car, we pulled over and looked at it until we lost sight of it. we were at approximatly at windsor, connecticut on

binoculars as i continued to observe the object.  after getting the binoculars i focused in and indeed it was flashing red blue and white and it wasn't actually stationary but moving about very fast in a tight area.  kind of looked like the squiggly lines a sparkler or light stick make if you jiggle them around.  the other celestial objects near this thing were not squiggly so it ruled out us making it do that with the binoculars and to be sure we steadied them on a railing and the object continued to move erratically. sometimes it appeared to stop and just change colors then it would start up again.  i called my wife out and my other son and they both confirmed what we were seeing.  we continued to watch it for about 20 mins and then it slowly moved beyond the horizon, sometimes stopping.  all the while it was moving away it was still pulsing and moving about in the zig zaggy jiggly motion.  also in the binoculars the lights sometimes appeared to be spinning around rather than flashing in succession or strobing. we have a small airport in our area and an army helicopter base not far so we frequently see helicopters and other conventional aircraft at night and know what they look like and how they behave.  this thing definitely did not look like anything any of us have ever seen before.  i tried to take a photo but the object was too far away.  truly

michigan. it was 16 august and i was at fullerton street about 30 feet from the water. i was watching a navy f/a 18 doing maneuvers. i was using binoculars to watch planes when they went higher or further away.\r\n\r\nthe f/a 18 did a maneuver that took it vertically straight up in the sky and then it did a stall holding it's position for a short while. as it was going up i used my binoculars to keep track of it. while i was watching it i noticed two objects in the sky above the plane.  they were hovering motionless and i was surprised to see them. the distance from these objects and the f/a 18 was hard to tell but they were not very close. but the pilot of the f/a 18 would have seen them since he was headed right for them but did the stall before getting to close. i would be very surprised if he did not see them.  upon first noticing them i tried to figure out what they were. my binoculars were not strong enough to give me the greatest detail but i could make out what they looked like.\r\n\r\nthey were probably a few hundred yards apart. the closet thing i can compare them to are the rovers that landed on mars. they resembled the bubble-like structure that shielded the rovers as they landed. there were bubbles, as i will call them, all over the object except the bottom. the bottom was triangular and black. the points on the bottom were rounded. the bubbles were cream colored.  there was no visible sign of a propulsion system that i could see. they stayed in that position for about five minutes maybe a little longer. i would watch them and then look at the f/a 18 as it continued it's maneuvers. i held my binoculars in place as so i wouldn't lose track of them. each time i looked back they were there and hadn't moved. i looked around the crowd to see if anyone else had noticed them but i didn't see anyone who did. as the f/a 18 was ending it's show i watched as it flew away. i still kept my binoculars in the same position but when i looked back this time they were gone. i scanned the sky but could not locate them. i still don't know if anyone else saw them, but there was a video crew there taping and i would not be surprised if they got something on tape. i myself had no camera and i wish i did.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":12288,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.8859736,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08312008-0008","longitude":-87.6259782,"occurred":1218870000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Illinois","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1218870000000,"summary":"Chicago

that what we were seeing was a ufo. it was very quiet but looked huge for how high it mustve been which ive estimated between 50 and 70,000 feet. at first thought i was amazed because i myself always had thought ufos were hoaxes but its one of those things that you need to see for yourself we started going crazy and were really just shocked. the object had fantastic moving capabitlities that allowed it to stop on a dime in midair and perform incredible turns. there were very few clouds yesterday so what happend was eventually it got to high to see but then 20 minutes later it was back

house.  my youngest son and i ran out of the house onto our deck in the back yard able to briefly see a jet on full afterburner.  i recognized this jet as an f-16 because of the silhouette of the empennage and the diamond pattern in the single jet exhaust and i also know that f-16���s routinely stopover at peterson afb as i have seen them both on the ground and arriving and departing. after the jet flew over the houses both my son and i ran through the house to the front yard where my other son was already there... jumping from excitement at the sight of the jet flying at such low altitude.\r\nthen to the east (the direction the jet was flying) i saw a bright light almost venus-like, traveling north about the speed of a private airplane. this light varied in intensity like the flash of an electrical arc��� a welder���s arc, which appeared pure white almost an ice blue color with brief flashes of red, blue and possibly green���almost as a diamond does when light is reflected from it.  it was flying at an altitude of about four fingers held at arms length above the nearby horizon at least a mile and a half away or possibly somwhere in the vicinity of shriever afb wich lies a few miles further.\r\nall of a sudden, it appeared that this ���light��� sensed that the jet was approaching and accelerated to a velocity that bordered on scary.  \r\nnever in my life have i ever seen anything accelerate like this object, in fact there was no transition from slow to fast��� one moment it was flying slow and the next moment it was almost too fast to follow with the eye with no acceleration in between. it was as though the fast-forward button had been pushed on a dvd player with the action moving from normal to fast-forward in an instant. the approaching jet banked to the left (north) in pursuit but had no chance whatsoever to catch this object and the object sped off to the north out of my line of vision in less than 5 seconds��� the jet however lingered in my sight for a seemingly longer period of time.\r\ni feared reporting this event when it took place to anyone because of any possible repercussions i.E., government agents; mib���s; military personnel and the like,threatening to make me disappear or whatever if i told my story to anyone. but that evening were there were at least three witnesses on the ground and i know the pilot of the f-16 saw that something was there and since norad in cheyenne mountain is nearby they would have had to have been aware of this object and that it posed somekind of a threat otherwise they would not have scrambled a jet out of pete field to investigate.\r\n","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

wednesday(16th-04-2008), right before 4:00.  the baxter delivery guy had just arrived to get me my pd dialysis supplies for the month.  i went out to talk to him and then he went into the depths of his truck to pull my supplies.\r\n\r\nso i was standing there in the driveway and i happened to look up at the tree in the front yard, to see if any greenery had budded yet.  beyond it, in the sky was a pinprick of light.  now, i'm looking almost due east, it's cloudless, pure blue sky, with the sun behind me (since it was almost 4) as i looked, i noticed more and more points of light.  they seemed to be clustered together in the same general vicinity.  and there were two sets.  some which were bright white and some fainter one which were reddish in color.\r\n\r\nso, it's like, this can't be what i think it is.  let's see, satilites? baloons or something?  nope.  they were all moving, slowly, but moving, but in different directions.  satilites follow orbits.  ballons follow wind trajectory.  these were going all over.  planes?  maybe.  but about that time, a commersial plane came into my view, traveling from the se to the nw.  i figured it was an ordinary flight going to sea-tac or vancouver, and it proved that whatever i was seeing was farther distant and considerable higher up.  it could still be planes of some type so i watched for a bit longer.  these two points of light drew side-by-side and then reversed themselves.  that's rather odd.  and then, ah! that one there did a right angel. and then another one did two consequtive right angles to reverse it's course.  nope.  not planes!\r\n\r\nas i was standing there watching this, my neck crained to the sky, the stories on coast-to-coast about people seeing leo (low earth orbit) spacebattles came to mind.  well, that's what it reminded me of.  if you think of the opening scene from star wars 3 or some of the battle scenes from battlestar galactica, were you have all those ships grouped together.  each one moving in relationship to the others, but everything confined in this relatively small space in the sky, well, that's what it looked like.  about the time i thought to count the lights, the fainter red ones were gone.  the brighter points of light were 16 in number.  they fadded from view after another minute or so.\r\n\r\ntotal time was under five minutes.  probably closer to 3.  the baxter guy then came out of his truck with the first load of my supplies, right about then, when it was over and they were gone.\r\n\r\ni didn't even think to call him.  hey, there's a ufo swarm going on out here.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12283,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":46.6048611,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08312008-0003","longitude":-120.4961587,"occurred":1208329200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Washington","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1208329200000,"summary":"Ufo

my girlfriend and i saw a huge, triangular object that appeared to be 200-300 yards across at the base. it seemed vaugely clear, with white lights at each tip. it was moving east at a very fast rate.

diaganolly, every way possible. they manuver too quickly to be aircraft. or at least manned aircraft that we currently have flying. they make abrubt right angle turns at times at speed, which would

plans for our music project when i noticed what looked like a very bright star. it was about -60 degrees to the bottom left of what i think is the little dipper. at first i ignored it. then it started to move towards the north west at a very slow rate. i told [s. h.] and we watched it for about 3 hours. we noticed that it seemed to have diffrent colors that were pulsating. we then walked to diffrent parts of the lake to try to get a better vantage point. after about 2 hours of watching it, the lights would extinguish and come back on for a few seconds randomly. we watched it do this for two more hours and then we left for our homes. \r\n\r\nthe next night and the night after, the object was back. same place, around the same time, and the same consistency. we watched it slowly move in a small figure 8 pattern like the first day but at one point on the 3rd day, we saw what appeared to be a smaller solid white point of light arrive to the bottom of the lights and go up inside it.\r\n\r\non the 4th night (last night) we were at [s. h.]'s house watching tv. i went in the back yard to smoke a cigarette and i saw it again. this time it was in a totally diffrent part of the sky and a little lower. i told [s. h.] and he got his binoculars. through the binoculars we noticed that there were at least 5 if not 6 lights lined up next to eachother horizontaly. one white, blue, red, green, yellow and what appeared to be orange. all of the lights were binking but the colors would change their stations randomly. the span of the row was about 30ft. the object still seemed to move in the figure 8 pattern as before. i called 911 and reported it because i thought that it might be an aircraft that was about to crash. 911 transferred me to the ashdown 911 (because that is where it appeared this time) and they had an officer investigate. im not sure if they saw anything because i did not follow up on it with them. after about 3 hours we decided to drive towards ashdown to see if

after dark around 830 pm or so and it was partly cloudy with a full moon. every friday evening my mom and i would go walk around my school i was going to for fun etc. my mom and i were only a few blocks from the home i lived in at the time.\r\n\r\nmy mom and i were returning from our walk and i was a little bit behinder looking down to the ground and out of nowhere a very bright dark blue light flashed on the ground is such a weird way ( its like the sun light type of light you would see at bottom of a pool with the water moving around kind like electricity with bubbles but a dark royal blue very pretty)the light was one inch or so from touching my shoes and was about three feet wide and six feet long and only shine in front of me nothing else and made no noise. this lasted 5 seconds then i looked up to the sky.\r\n\r\nwhen i looked up to the sky it was partly cloundy, calim, and the moon was out. there happen to be a very large cloud behind me and a clear opening to the sky where i was standing ( i want to note that the clouds were about 25,000 feet up or so and the opening was very large miles wide) so when i looked up i first saw nothing at all.. i looked back down and was trying to figure out what happened. i think at the time i was thinking lightining or something like that. at this point i looked up again and the moment i did this very very very large object came out of the cloud made no noise and took off very fast to the west to luke air force base area. \r\n\r\nthe object was massive it covered the whole opening in the sky, i want to say it was about 9-12 aircraft cairries long and about 5-7 wide. it was crazy big.The shape was rectagulr with no wings. the shape looked like it should not have been in the air at all no wings nothing. there were a very large number of lights on it and the back of the object was pure white lights and did not make one sound something of that size, speed, and the light coming off the back should have made a noise of moved the clouds or somthing  that was the second weridest part of this first would be the light on the ground in front of me.\r\n\r\ni lost the object behind more clouds, but was heading to luke air force base which was 8 miles from the area i was. after the object was gone i was scared ( i was ten years old at the time) and was very uneasy for the rest of the night plus my eye were burning for a unknown reason. this was what made me a full beleaver of ufos. the one question i want ansewered was why did that ufo shine that weird light in front of me for?, but will most likely never get a answer. the moment saw it i knew i was a ufo. there was no other answer for it....     \r\n\r\n\r\ni would also like to note in 1997 the phoenix lights were not flares i saw that (who didn't see that)\r\ni clearly saw the lights where connected to each other.. if you have any questions please feel free to contact me. thank

white lights turned into a row of white lights. then the lights changed color. red green white an yellow. the sky was clear visibility unlimited not a cloud in the sky. do to the fact the a cold front came through. the reflected off what look like fog or a cloud. then there was a flash of light bigger than the object. then it went up higher as a white light. where it bounced around. it came back down to the same location. i came in the house and woke up my wife to show her, i was looking for my binoculars and glasses. i showed my wife the object that now looked the same as an airplane with

circle of colored lights. it also had a flash of lightning. i t went back up and bounced around again. when it came down again i got my camera and tried to caught on film which i have not developed. watched it do the same thing about two more times then about 3 am it took off in an easterly direction. made a mark on the porch today i used a compass which made it about 28 degrees of mag north. the

\"disk-shaped, flying\r\nsaucers  in  an  oblique  formation  flew  directly  through  the \r\nlarge  open  hole.  i  was  in  a  large  crowd  of  people  and \r\ni  didn't  want  to  be  accused  of  yelling  \" fire in  a  theater\".\r\nthey  were  flying   a  pattern  where-as, \"they  all\" could   fly\r\nat  any   direction  in  a  moment  of danger.\r\n\r\nthe  ships  were   pewter  and

propulsion system.\r\nthey  were  traveling  at  approimately  350 miles per  hour.\r\n\r\nthe  \"lead  on\"  craft  had  a  lower  conning  tower.  all the  other \r\n3  were  identical---  smooth  bottoms. all   the  craft  were  \r\napproximatly  60  feet  in   diameter.\r\n\r\nthey  were  flying  due  east  directly  opposite  the  md 80's\r\ndeparture route  west  route, at  approximatly  10

the 2005 ufo conference with jaime mussan and became very intrigued by the information given about ufo capture in infared, and decided to purchase a camcorder.  after of summer of trying out various filters and lenses, the latest addition, a 1000nm infrared filter (which i was using for the first time), combined with uv filter 0.45x wide angle lens tele convertor 2.0x lens, i happened to make my

footage that i had captured, on my laptop. \r\n\r\nwhen watching the footage that i had recorded, i suddenly saw somthing that i had previously looked over in the garden. upon seeing the object on my

it on film set in.\r\n\r\nafter several veiwings of the said footage, i felt a feeling of unease and a little unsettled because i was unsure whether the i was watching the object, or, the object was watching me! \r\n\r\ni would estimate the object being no more than 50-80ft above the roof-tops of the neighbouring houses. the object appeared as a fairly round ball of light, with no hard edges, approximatly 6-10ft in diameter. as you can see from the footage, it hovered for several seconds before excelerating at a very high speed upwards into the sky, before disappearing out of sight.

dusky but about 15-20 min from being nighttime so it was a wierd dark purplish-red color.  i hadn't had any alcohol in over a week and no illegal substances in months if not years.  i look up at the sky and see what appears to be a plane moving in a north/northwesternly direction at a moderate speed. i gain some perspective by focusing more and realize that if this was a plane it would be ridiculously high in the air based on how i was unable to make out a shape and could only see the lights from the bottom (white-ish).  also the light kinda flickered a little but i wasnt sure if it was just clouds passing between the object and my field of sight or not.  i follow the plane as it moves across the sky thinking to myself i thought planes always had colored lights on the bottom but dismissed it.  i kept thinking, man this plane is really far up there i wonder why.  i had been watching the plane for maybe 5-10 min when i saw another passenger jumbo jet presumably coming from o'hare airport.  this plane looked normal and to be of a normal flying altitude.  as it got closer to the \"plane\" i had been watching i noticed that the altitude of the \"plane\" i was originally watching had to be at least 2.5x greater.  at this point i noticed that the \"plane\" also came to a complete halt.  i called it to the attention of my friend that i came with and she watched along too.  as the commercial plane flew under and past this \"plane\" began moving again in the same direction.  now i was concerned b/c i know that there are super high altitude planes but i dont think we have the technology yet to reach such high altitudes and also come to a complete stop and hover there.  anyway i started to focus all my attention on this one object.  from the time the \"plane/star\" started moving again, it took roughly 2-3 seconds for it to get back up to its original velocity.  second point of interest b/c i also dont think we have the technology to go from what appears to be standstill to say...Mach2 in that short a time.  so i'm still watching the \"plane/star\" thing when i saw it bust a 90 turn and head what would appear to be either south completely east or just down closer to earth.  now i'm super concerned b/c a plane moving at that speed should not have that type of agility.  from there i watched go through a series of complete stops to mad 5 second dashes with other 90turns mixed in.  at this point me and the other witness were completely convinced this was more of a ufo than some governmental experimental aircraft.  so at this point i had been watching the ufo for at least 35-40 minutes, and it was now completely dark in the sky so other stars were out.  i had only been focused on this one \"star/ufo\" thing the whole time so had not paid any attention to anything else in the sky save the one commercial plane that flew by.  so now for contrast i looked at some of the other stars and my friend commented that it looked like some of the other ones were moving too.  so now i chose a few stars closer to the original one i had been watching so as not to lose it, and noticed that indeed they were.  the other stars i focused on were considerably less dim and presumably further up in the sky.  however they were also coming to these start/stop/mad dash type of movements as well, however i didnt look at any of the others to see them do the 90 turns.  now i'm really worried because i'm starting to think this is an invasion or some super alien reconnaissance mission.  i figured if it were experimental aircraft there's no way in hell the gov't could siphon away that much money to secretly build that many super advanced aircraft as there were at least 10-15 erratically moving objects in the sky.  the original one i was watching remained the brightest and presumably the most close to me.  i was concerned about them initiating an attack or beaming me up or something but i wanted to verify if this was something that was out of our atmosphere or just appeared to be first.  so i called my friend in puerto rico and asked him to go outside and look at the stars to tell me if his were moving as well.  he did, i waited and sure enough he said no they werent.  he looked around for a bit and preceded to tell me about what happened to him the night before.  but i got off the phone because i was more interested in the stars moving around all crazy where i was.  the fact that he couldnt see them told me that they werent all the way out of the atmosphere or else they should be visible from pr as well, but they were indeed much closer to chicago.  so then i decided we should leave just in case something happened and we then left after about a 1.5 hrs of watching and the original brightest ufo was still sitting up in the sky, at that point it was at a standstill.  i have a witness so i know i'm not crazy.  \r\npoints i would like to make:\r\n1. high altitude planes must maintain a certain speed to remain at altitudes of that magnitude, that's a fact.  no helicopter could possibly be like 50,ooo ft off the ground.\r\n2. high altitude planes are quick and nimble to a degree, but not 90 degree turn nimble.  i think of a plane with super agility and i think of like an su-27 or something but even that can not make turns of that nature at super high altitudes like that, and especially hover at them.\r\n3. a jet engine plane can have amazing acceleration, but going from a standstill to some ridiculous speed in under 3 seconds is not possible, especially with whatever friction it would experience at a height of that magnitude.\r\n4. i watched the original \"plane/ufo\" for over an hour.  to reach super high altitude requires an ordinate amount of fuel, i imagine planes of that nature would have to make their trip and then hurriedly come back to be refueled.  to fit the amount of fuel it would take to be lolly-gagging around in subspace for over an hour on a plane aerodynamically equipped to make such agile turns would require a fuel tank probably bigger than the plane itself, unless there is some alternate energy source the gov't has that they are hiding from us.\r\n5. were this to be erratic movements of just stars or something else out of this atmosphere, then it should be visible to people in other places. granted i only called one person in pr but he probably would've seen something as many objects were moving around all crazy from where i was looking up.\r\n6. if these were a bunch of experimental gov't crafts then uncle sam is pilfering an absurd amount of money from taxpayers and somebody somewhere should be fired if they havent noticed the national budget misappropriating 500 bil or whatever it would take to come up with the r & d to make something that performs like this and also make a bunch of them\r\n7. i have an unnamed witness and i've told multiple people already so if this were some gov't conspiracy and i basically just told on myself throught this website then the government will have to \"quiet\" alot of people in the near future besides just me.","distance":"Over One
