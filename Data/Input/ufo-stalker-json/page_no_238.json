(my mom and dad had divorced, with my mom living in oak hill, west virginia; 85 miles to the north-east of huntington.)\r\n\r\nin september, 1966, i borrowed my dad’s sports car and went out to “see the sights”. i ended up in ashland, kentucky, which is just over the border from west virginia. being that i was only 17, i couldn’t drink, so i drove around the area. i-64 links ashland and huntington. at approximately 10:00 pm, i left ashland and headed back home. when into huntington, on i-64, i took the 5th street exit, which is where my dad lived. given that i had been driving around for a couple of hours, and had drank a number of colas, i felt the urge to relieve myself. as i drove up the 5th street exit, i pulled the car over to the shoulder, parked and stepped out to take care of business. i-64 runs east to west on the south side of the city, without the glare of city lights.\r\n\r\nwhile standing beside the car, i glanced up to see a perfectly clear night, devoid of clouds. the stars shown brightly. as i gazed upward, my eye caught movement directly over my head. there, to my amazement, was a dark/black triangle shaped craft moving west to east moving at a very slow speed. i also noted that it was not making any sound. on its bottom surface, there were 3 non-blinking red lights. \r\n\r\ni know the object was solid, as when it moved, it block my sight of stars above it. i could not determine the altitude as i didn’t know its size. however, if it were the size of a dc-9, it would have been no more than 100 feet over my head. i watched it for maybe 20 to 30 seconds, and sat back down in the car. my feet were still outside the car and i thought to myself, that thing didn’t have any flashing lights and it wasn’t making any sound; so i immediately pulled myself back out of the car and looked skyward. nothing. the craft was gone. the time it took me to sit down and immediately stand, took no more than 5 seconds. i guesstimate that i could see at least 3 to 4 miles in all directions, yet in that amount to time, the object shot out of sight.\r\n\r\n i then drove home and told my dad of my experience. his reply was, “you saw something interesting”. \r\n\r\nthe next weekend, i went to my mom’s house. my mother always fixed a sunday dinner, as she, my younger brother and i sat down to eat, she said “oh, i have a story to tell you.” last weekend, two of the ladies she worked with and my mom were driving from oak hill to charleston, with my mom driving. to get to charleston, my mom took rt.61 which passes over a series of mountains before it comes to the kanawha river where the road turns into an easy drive to charleston along the river. just as the road straighten out and the valley opened up, the lady in the passengers seat said, “look at that up in the sky.” it was on the north side of the valley, at which point, the valley, from ridge to ridge is 5 to 6 miles across. my mom glanced up to see a dark/black triangular shaped object that appeared to be stopped in the sky. after looking for only a few seconds, she looked back to the road to make sure her driving was safe, and then glanced back to the spot where she had seen the object; but it was gone. she asked the passenger where it had gone? the reply, was “...It’s on the other side of the valley.”. in the amount of time it took to look at the object, glance at the road, and back up to the object, no more than 5 seconds, the craft had moved (north to south) approximately 6 miles. the craft then sped up and in the blink of the eye, zoomed out of sight. i then told my mom of my experience, which occurred the same night. (please understand that to get from oak hill to huntington, one must go past charleston - in a west-southwest direction.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

in the sky was just out of place, its too big to be a balloon, and the shape was to unusual to be a blimp...I got to the red light, i was sitting with the other cars, i kept staring at the object, counting off everything that it wasn't,,,when the light turned green, the traffic stayed still,unusual because this is a very busy road,so i looked over to the driver next to me , he too was  staring up at this object. after some car horns the traffic started moving. i was getting closer to the hovering object, it was sort of waving in and out of the atmosphere, but it was definitely there. next i noticed a smaller black round orb traveling towards the orange object coming from the west. (this sounds funny, but something was telling me the orange object was waiting for the black orb to catch up) i pulled over, these two objects met, the black one went around/over the orange one and then the very slowly moved across the sky to the east. at the same time a plane was travelling to the west towards jfk. i was amazed no one else was out looking at this? i got back in my car it was 11:15 am, my phone battery was charging and not yet working.(worst time ever for that phone to be dead,i cursed it) i drove towards where the objects were going, which brought me to an industrial part of town, i parked behind a building and got out to watch the two objects move slowly it seemed but, they had traveled a great distance to the east. i was amazed, but had no phone for pictures and had to get to my hair appointment at 11:30, the only way i could catch another glimpse of the pair was if i had a chopper instead of a car. about  three minutes later i arrived at the salon, parked and just as my phone came to life, a black helicopter passedto my left side, so low i could see the pilot! the chopper was completely black, no markings whatsoever, and it was coming from the eastern direction where i last saw the objects. that was weird too. i know i saw something that was not man made, i believe they were traveling ufo's until i hear different.","distance":"101-500
