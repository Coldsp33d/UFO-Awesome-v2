last look out my north-facing bedroom window (as i had done periodically throughout the evening) to see if the object(s) i had seen 2 nights previously were in sight.  i noticed a star-like light in approximately the same position in the northeastern sky as i had 2 nights previously, so i got my bushnell binoculars to take a closer look.  what i saw was apparently the same object i had observed before (ref mufon report 26 aug 2008: \"ufos hovering over dayton international airport\").  the object had white-yellow, blue, and red lights in the same configuration as before.\r\n\r\ni went out to the front yard at about 1:05 a.M. and observed the same object. it was in approximately the same position as 2 nights previous, but noticably higher and a little further southeast of the airport. i would estimate it to be about 1/4 to 1/2 mile southeast of the dayton airport and approximately 1000 ft. in altitude.  i scanned the sky with and without binoculars to see if i could spot any other curious lights.  all i could see were planets and stars.  i could locate no other object as i had 2 nights previously.\r\n\r\ni went inside and woke my mom (approximately 1:10 a.M.) and she came to my bedroom window and observed the same phenomenon both with and without the binoculars.  we watched it from the window for about 10 minutes then went out to the front yard and observed it from there as well.  we stayed outside for about 10 minutes and then went back in.  we continued to observed the object from my bedroom window and another north-facing window in another bedroom for about another 10 minutes.  during this time my mom and i both saw what appeared to be a small cesna-sized plane slowly fly southeast from the direction of the airport toward the ufo but beneath and slightly south of it.  this \"plane\" was probably 200 to 300 ft. below the ufo. the plane continued on it's same path until it was out of sight.  i did not hear an engine sound from this second object and usually planes at that distance are easily audible. i see and hear these type planes every day at this airport and think it notable that i heard nothing on this night. it was now approximately 1:40 a.M.\r\n\r\nmy mom went back to her room and i continued to monitor the object from the window.  i lost the object behind some low clouds for about half an hour and didn't look for it again until about 2:30 a.M. i spotted it again in about the same position at about 2:45 a.M. and noticed through the binoculars that now there were no blue or red lights, but only white-yellow.  i noted there seemed to be 3 main lights evenly spaced in a horizontal line with some fainter lights of the same color in-between the main ones.  the ufo occasionally changed it's situation because sometimes it looked like an oval ring of white-yellow lights.  i could just make out a shadowy oval or disk shaped form that was barely illuminated by the lights on the object.\r\n\r\ni noticed my mom's bedroom light still on at about 3:05 a.M. and went in to tell her that the object was still there but without the blue and red lights.  she came to my room and watched it for about 10 minutes and then we both went to the front yard again and observed it with the binoculars.  my mom saw the object at this time as a ring of white-yellow lights also.\r\n\r\nwe went back inside and to our rooms to sleep (~ 3:20 a.M.)  i last looked for the object at 4:30 a.M. and it was gone. \r\n\r\nboth of us agreed we could not identify the object and had discussed the possibilities of what it might be throughout our night's observations.  we just didn't know but were very curious. \r\n\r\nthe viewing conditions i would describe as fair throughout the whole evening.  it was partly cloudy with a rather low cloud ceiling.  the object would dim and brighten throughout the whole viewing period due to clouds and haze passing over it.  when there was a clearing in the cover, the object and stars were clearly visible.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12258,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.8961922,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08292008-0005","longitude":-84.1927508,"occurred":1219996800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ohio","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,

dorking, surrey (uk) when, around 21.05hrs, one of our group happened to look upwards and noticed bright orange objects (which to the naked eye appeared orb shaped) travelling silently across the night sky.  it was very dark at the time, but relatively clear and there was no wind at all. \r\n\r\nwe had no idea what they were, so i grabbed my video camera and captured some very interesting

travelled (some in clusters, some separately) at a moderate pace and in a very controlled fashion across the night sky, only disappearing as they went past the high trees that surround our garden.  \r\n\r\nthe 13 adults present were awe-struck, none of us had ever seen anything like this spectacle before, but the three children with us were really scared, fearing we were about to be invaded by aliens. \r\n\r\nthe footage i took looks far more detailed than the videos i���ve seen so far, did anyone else see these things or does anyone know what they could have

opened the door to the backyard and looked in up in the sky and immediately noticed two red lights that were blinking back and forth and seemed to be connected somehow as if they were on a straight line. i said immediately after seeing the lights, \"what the hell is that?\" it was obviously not a satellite or satellites. what struck me and my friend was the distance between the two lights. the lights were too far apart to be like lights on the wing of an aircraft. this was at my friends house, he lives under a flight path so we've seen many planes in the night's sky. this was no plane. these lights made no sound and moved at a smooth seemingly constant pace until they faded into the distance. i don't know what these lights were, but i feel that they were significantly strange. i've never seen anything like this before, so i felt i should share this experience. i don't expect any explanation or closure on this sighting; i just felt that i should share the information that i saw

pretty much making a triangle. again, i'll remind that since it was flying from my right side to my left side across the sky, all i could clearly see were two lights.\r\n\r\n while staring at the 'plane', i started to think about how i've always wanted to witness a ufo and perhaps have it abduct me. i sort of laughed out loud and thought \"yeah, that would be silly. but perhaps i would be willing to be abducted by aliens, as long as i wasn't harmed...\". just at that very instant, i noticed the 'plane' change direction, but couldn't tell at first what it was doing. after two seconds, i saw the two bright amber lights and knew it was facing in my direction but still wasn't aware that it was coming right at me. i stood my ground just trying to make it out better then realized that it was indeed coming right at me. so it was then when i was starting to freak out that it started to head this way right when i wanted it to come this way... regardless, i still stood there, but ready to dart to the house. after another couple seconds of watching it come towards me, i decided to start walking towards the house while keeping my eye on it. it was amazing at how far away i thought it was and to see it start coming at me so quickly. the lights started getting really bright, large, and closer really fast. i then decided to start running as fast as i could when my dog started bolting to the door. i just continued running towards my porch and as i looked back, i could see that it was just so close and had the chill on my back as if it were right on me and was going to get right on top of me before i could get to my door. i was just praying to jesus and just kept running as fast as possible. i managed to reach my door just before it would have flown over me. i quickly got my dog inside but couldn't see the ufo at all as i had my head out the door for a couple seconds. that was when i started running down to my mom's room to explain to here what just happened.\r\n\r\n as i had gotten into her room, my mom was talking on the phone and i was breathing heavy. she noticed me and urgently asked me what's wrong. i then started to tell her that i was chased by a ufo in the field. while i explained to her my story, i realized that the ufo didn't make any sound at all during my experience.\r\n\r\n while i was running towards my house, three scenarios came into my head. all giving me enough reason to want to freak out and run for cover.\r\n\r\na) it was a plane that for some reason had made a 90 degree angle and started to make a crash landing towards me.\r\nb) it was an alien ufo that had decided to respond to my thoughts and come abduct me. (perhaps coincidence with it responding to my thoughts)\r\nor\r\nc) it was purely demonic.\r\n\r\neither way, any of these were good enough reason for me to want to run. if planes do make random right angle turns, speed up, and get lower to the ground, then sure i'll accept the fact it was just a plane. otherwise i know it was something else... demonic force or alien ufo, i know what i saw and it was the scariest experience of my life.. and i've had really scary experiences in my life...","distance":"101-500

it for a brief time. i suggested that we take a look upward from time to time to check out the big expanse of sky above us for any unusual activity that might occur and when i initially said this, i took a look upward in one direction, then turning my head to another part of the sky, i then exclaimed something on the idea of \"what the heck is that?\" \r\n\r\nboth witnesses with me looked skyward where i was looking and we all saw what appeared to be row after row of same sized circles of \"vapor\" spaced equally in a shape that was a perfect rectangle, traveling overhead diagonally.\r\n\r\ni was in disbelief & stood frozen for a short time as we all gazed upward. i remember one witness ask \"are you getting this?\" and i suddenly snapped out of what i think was a touch of shock & started taking pictures fumbling over my camera options trying to set it on automatic to get still shots before they got too far away. i managed to get a few digital camera shots in. i switched my kodak easy share 2710 digital camera to videoand fumbled for few minutes while i tried to focus on them.\r\n\r\nat this time they were further off in the distance and i tried to zoom in on them, but had some difficulty. with my eye & the video, i did notices that a second fleet seemed to come into view further off. i had trouble filming the target because the sun was shining on my back therefore my face was reflecting on the screne where you view what your filming before taking a picture or when taking a video. i had to use my eyes to line up the best i could with the ufo fleet passing by.\r\n\r\none witness didnt get anything, they were using there cell phone & the other witness did get some still shots in.\r\n\r\noverall what we all had seen that day was highly unidentified, definately not a plane, or planes. i am certain they were not clouds & certain it was no blimp, or balloons or even planes that make messages in the sky.\r\n\r\nthey were all the same size, vapor circles, traveling all toether in unison, after they went in a cloud (or above) they came out a little disorganized than their regular formation, but kept traveling and apparently there was another group that joined them. they appeared to be heading from \"----\" toward i believe \"-----\". \r\n\r\nthis sighting took place on sunday, august 17 at approximately 2:30pm.\r\n\r\ni believe what we saw as unidentified. \r\ni was shocked, excited, baffled, amazed at the time of sighting & after sighting.\r\nthe objects actions and motions were: traveling rather slow, uniform formation of rectangle (like an army) not uniform while further away and no trails were visible on each individual craft.\r\ni did not know wht the object was when i first saw it. i was baffled and in a bit of shock, dazed.\r\ni looked upward and noticed the formation after exclaiming that my witness and i should do so now and again while \"ghost hunt\" was in progress.\r\nwe didnt lose object, object kept traveling quietly into the

always hunted in the same area and parked the truck in the same area.  he would go over the hill to his favorite spot and i would do like wise which was about halfway up the next hill.  from my vantage point i could clearly see the truck parked on top of the hill.  we always hunted like this so that a hill would be between us allowing for a greater firing range without worrying about hitting each other.  the day progressed like usual and we met at the truck for lunch about 1pm.  after lunch, we again went to our respective spots.  i went back and sat against my usual tree.  suddenly i heard a noise in the leaves, i look over and see three does standing about 20 feet away.  i was surprised that they were there and never saw them coming.  the woods are fairly open and i just don't see how i didn't see them.  i fumbled with my rifle in surprise and as they ran off i noticed that things looked different.  i checked my watch and over two hours had passed!  i had never fallen asleep hunting before.  i turned to look at the truck to see if my father had returned.  sitting next to the truck was a sphere shaped (perfectly round) very shiny, chrome like something.  i had no

since childhood, i stepped outside just before going to bed for a casual look at the night sky. i did not have my telescope or binoculars with me, i now wish that i did. while i was looking to the west there was nothing unusual to observe only dim to moderately bright stars, nothing inusual. then all of a sudden a very bright object just appeared out of knower. it was as if someone had turned on a light switch. it did not fly into view it just appeared. this took me by total surprise. \r\n\r\nthe object was no bigger then a bright star and had a slight yellowish hue to it, similar to the planet jupiter when it is at its brightest. it was completely motionless just staying in one spot. its glow was steady and did not have the flickering effect noticed when you look at a star. i could not distinguish any shap to the object only its bright glow.\r\n\r\nat first i thought i had observed a nova burst an exploding star. i continued to observe the object for around ten minutes, it did not move but stayed in one spot. not knowing what to expect next i stayed outside and did not want to go inside for my binoculars and possibly miss something. i then noticed that the object was changing position, moving very slowly to the south. its movement was so slow that if it was not for the background stars as a reference you would not have noticed that it was moving. i continued to watch the object for around twenty minutes until it disappeared behind a tree line in the distance. the object did not change in brightness or speed. its movement was very smooth and made no sound nor give off any noticable exhaust or trial of any kind.\r\n\r\nas i mentioned above i have been into astronomy since childhood and have never experienced such an event. there is nothing celestial that could account for this incident. meteors, comets nor asteroids could not account for what i observed. celestial objects do not appear out of knower, hover in one place for several minutes then slowly move off and disappear.\r\n\r\nhaving been in the us air force from 1964-67 i had considerable experience observing aircraft in flight (single & formation flying) during the day and at night. no aircraft that i know of could account for what i observed. this was not a coventional aircrfat unless it was some form of black box stealth design which is possible but i highly unlikely it does not fit our current stealth designs. \r\n\r\nit was during a recent tv broadcast covering interstellar space flight possibilities that one of the scientists discussing ufos felt that if ufos are real it was possible that they could be using what he called a jump drive process. i did not really undewrstand what he was saying except that a space craft could be at one place in time, go thriugh a jump drive process and reappear at another place an time. some knd of worm hole or something. since the object i observed just appeared out of knower could it have been the result of a jump drive process.\r\n\r\nit also appears that ufos have ther ability to travel at phenominal speeds and can instantly stop on a dime so to speak. it also appears that they are not plauged by atmospheric friction problems as our shuttle craft and other re-entry vehicles experience. with that in mined, could the object i observed have been a space craft traveling on a direct path toward the earth at such a phenominal speed which after entering our atmosphere and air space had just suddenly stopped which accounted for the objects sudden appearnce.\r\n\r\ni don't know the answer. i only bring this sighting to you attention in hopes of providing something of value to the ufo investigations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

(please read below for more!). i saw this star-like ufo traveling down south. it was extremely high up. it seemed hundreds of feet above the atmosphere. it has no blinking lights as it looked like a planet. it was traveling straight and slow and then it slowly disappeared which appeared the object had cloaked. when i saw it i was excited and had my eyes on it for most of the time and i thought is that a plane and then with further observing i knew it wasn't any earth vehicle or satellite. \r\n\r\ni have had many experiences like this in the past since 2001. i have seen several like this one this year. i seen a ginormous ufo a few weeks prior which appeared to be as big as jupiter traveling north which behaved like the one i saw on the 11th. i have seen these behave different in many ways. i have seen them travel back and forth, and cloak and uncloak like a peek-a-boo or a now you see me, now you don't game. i have recently seen one that was going down east which the entire object was flashing but it was a very slow flashing characteristic. now, i have seen two that were not like these a couple years ago. these were on two separate days. they both were extremely high but had a very unusual red flashing characteristic and the one went into hyperspace or warp speed like you see in the star wars and star trek films. that was incredible to witness! i believe these red ones are man made but has alien technology. i have been wondering so long what these are and who/what might be piloting them. it is a wonderful but creepy feeling that i get when i see these objects because i wonder are they the grays, the insectoids or something that we know absolutely nothing about or all of these different species. by seeing these ufos i know that we are not alone! if anyone has any answers and/or has had these experiences please contact me at capri1981@aol.Com with your information!

the planets are moving toward the suns gravitational pull, not away from it. so if there were any signs of life ever existing on another planet, it would most likely be found on a planet that, at one time, held the same solar position as earth and that would be in front of us, not behind us. shouldn't they be looking at venus?","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line path,Path with directional change,Path then hovering","formattedAddress":null,"id":12244,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6920462,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08282008-0002","longitude":-121.3692645,"occurred":-128966400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"California","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Fireball","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-128966400000,"summary":"Green fireball followed vehicle, at upper right side.","tags":["fireball"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"North Highlands, California","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:341303"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover), Unknown","city":"Charleston","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Going outside to smoke. smoking in barracks  not allowed. a coworker steps outside to join me. everyone else (5 or so more friends) inside still watching a movie. i see an aircraft approaching perpendicular towards our airstrip. too high. coming in steep. no blinking lights to identify it. i point it out to my friend. we watch, expecting to see usaf aircraft pursue it. minutes go by. moving steeper in a downward decline, gradually faster. i observe that it may be a meteor, in which case we better leave the top floor and move to lower ground. aircraft very large and very bright by now (approx. 4:00\" into sighting). everyone steps out to watch. all of us are pretty scared now. as soon as we all gather to watch, a large light ring flares, radially away from the light, parallel to the earth. i now realize that it is indeed very high up. our fear freezes us all into pure silence. we all know that it's a comet or something, and coming directly towards were we stood. a few seconds after light ring, the object halts instantly. flashes brightly. breaks into 2 pieces. one much smaller. the other maintaining original size. resumes descent- in opposite directions. both objects, moving quite fast but easy to discern shape and dimension, appear to both be spherical and moving intelligently. descent turns into upward curves upward- both, still in opposite directions. curves turn to paths away from one another, parallel to the earth. smaller piece (on the left- now at 6-7\" into sighting) halts entirely. looms. larger piece, a few seconds later halts. looms. both flash very brightly and turn off. not disappear, but simply stop glowing. can't really recall how we knew that they were still there but everyone in the group commented on just that. what was a clear, cloudless night soon changed when enormous (cumilonimbus) clouds appeared where the two light spheres once were. exactly where they once were. the stars obscured by clouds that now grew and grew to cover them. over the clouds, however, it appeared that there was also black looking smoke coming from those two points. did they explode?Get shot down?

2 months ago (19th or 20th june) i shot some random pictures out of my window of the night sky.\r\nafter downloading it to the pc i noticed some strange/weird line at the upper left corner. i still cant figure out what it is (i'm a physics student), so here you are ;)\r\ni did not see the line with my own eyes, just with the camera. i cant remember if i did not look hard enough or if it just was not visible.\r\n\r\nits on three pictures: 59, 60 and 62. picture 61 doesnt show the area in which the line is or would have been located. but 58 and 57 does show the area, without the line.\r\nif you try to get the position of the line by comparing it to the position of two stars right to the line you will notice that its moving downwards with increasing picture number. sadfully picture 62 was the last one, so i dont know cleary how long it was 'visible'.\r\ni cant remember the time between the pictures, but it could be something between 7 and 40 seconds each. which means that it would have been at the sky 28 seconds upto 160 seconds. so its definitely no meteor or something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould you please tell me what this line is or by what it is caused?\r\n\r\nthank you!\r\nregards,
