fulton. going south on 481 from fulton to shopping plaza along 31, near great northern mall. there aren't any airports near by that i know of unless there are private ones. it's mostly cows and trees and houses.\r\n\r\ni think it was around the time on the radio 92.1 that they were playing a journey song, which i thought was great and funny because journey is well, journey. anyway.\r\n\r\nas passing phoenix exit (14) notice oncoming car with bright headlights up on bridge overhead, but not moving, to the left. as i get closer, i notice lights are far above bridge in the air, looks like one of those towers lit up at night. i think i don't remember a tower nearby, but dismiss it because i'm not the most observant guy. lights are a warm white light, bright and big, like old headlights, not the cold, bluish new headlights, lamps or something on the tower.\r\n\r\nit's dark out, but not completely, clear with stars, and a few distinct clouds. i keep driving, and lights are motionless like at the top of a tower, the same kind of height, so trees are blocking it as i drive.\r\n\r\neventually i see another tower on the left, one of those thin towers with little red lights running up it, near what i'm seeing so i have a bit of reference. i can barely make out the tower behind the lights in the darkness, but i can clearly see sky and clouds beneath these lights as i glimpse it through breaks in the trees.\r\n\r\nas i finally get about even with the lights, near the other tower, the \"headlights\" immediately and clearly began moving west, toward me and the highway. it was very low, like i said about the height of a tower, and fairly large. my side of the highway was relatively clear, more traffic in the northbound lane, so i could afford to slow right down to about 40 miles an hour. the thing came right across 481 and over the top of my car. i was not breathing or thinking, just looking at this weird thing. i hunched up over the wheel of the car and was craning my neck like a loony to get a glimpse of this thing but not wreck the car. i kind of wish i pulled over but i didn't want to. \r\n\r\nas it passed low and directly over the car, a few things hit me-how close and big it was-and how it looked like a plane coming in for a landing right over the car into the field on the other side of the road, but it didn't look like a plane at all. the size of the lights and the fact that none of them were blinking were disturbing to me. i've seen planes and helicopters at night my whole life, but this thing gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. most of all the lack of noise-at that closeness there should have been some plane or helicopter sounds i thought. also the fact that it appeared to go from completely motionless to movement right over my car. so i'm thinking i must have been driving for 7 or eight minutes directly into the path of this plane so it looked like it wasn't moving, but none of these things just didn't seem right, especially because the highway does bend a bit.\r\n\r\nas it passed over me, i'm looking for blinky lights and see none. three big bright whitish lights at the points (what looked like two headlights from the side) underneath, with a vague black triangle outline against the sky, and a mess of red, non-blinking lights underneath. what i didn't like about this was they were not aligned along a normal plane-like straight line, it was more suggesting it was along the bottom of this triangle shape. it was lighting up the belly very clearly, so i'm thinking \"okay, that's where the plane's landing gears and stuff are\" because i could see weird details, but they didn't register in my mind because i couldn't make sense out of what i was looking at. 481 is a 4 lane highway, two north and two south lanes. i'm going forty miles an hour, and it took about six seconds to pass over my car and head into the field behind trees on the other side. by this time i'm coming up on the exit onto 31 where great northern mall and wegman's and all those stores are.\r\n\r\ni keep glancing to the right and see little glimpses of the lights through the trees and the thing is banking toward the same direction i'm heading in, so i think i'll see it when i get to the intersection. i'm thankful for the red light because i can roll my windows down and try to listen, but all i hear is the car traffic and noise and the whole strip is lit up with all these stores and malls. the thing is still there though, and it's cruising low but across 31 and past. i turn right on 31 toward wegmans and keep peeking because it's hard to concentrate and i don't want to crash the car. i head through another intersection and that's where i see it last, it went from cruising around fast in an arc, now on my left, and i see it in the air through an opening in an intersections, maybe a quarter/half mile further south, where it had stopped moving again.\r\n\r\ni felt a little nuts at this point and didn't want to follow it, plus i knew i'd get lost if i went after it in that direction. so i went and got the groceries in a fog. that probably took twenty minutes. on the way home, i went back up north 481 and didn't see anything except i thought it was weird that there were 3 helicopters or planes or something in the area when i came back. they were higher up in the sky, normal blinky aircraft, but circling around in that area. that's all hope this helps, it was one of the weirdest things i've seen. i've only told my sister, wife, and dad, because i know no one will really believe me and i don't want people to make fun of me or think i'm a nutjob or people at work to find out and have a field day with me.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100

about an hour and was facing north-northwest stargazing with binoculars.  i've done this almost every night this month and have seen some remarkable star-like flashes and very bright meteoric-type activity on several occasions, so that's more or less what i expected to see, if anything.\r\n\r\ni was sitting down, binoculars in my lap, when i noticed a low-flying, well-lit craft flying north to south emerge from behind the small grove of winged elms on the north side of my property.  it had approximately six orange lights arranged in a loose horizontal cluster, a blue & white rotating beacon on top and an identical rotating beacon on the bottom.  the beacons were not vertically aligned, but i can't remember whether the top or the bottom beacon was on the leading edge, mostly because i quickly found myself rather excited due to the lack of noise, which is pretty much unprecedented considering its close proximity.  still, with that many lights on it - especially the rotating beacons (despite being blue & white instead of the usual flashing red) and because it was on a steady course & pace, i continued to assume it was a plane.\r\n\r\neven though i was facing the area from which the craft emerged, it took me by surprise for two reasons:  (1.) the trajectory of the craft was in no way - at least not to my knowledge - a typical flight path, and; (2.) despite its low altitude in relation to the tree line, i did not hear it.  at first, i thought it was a passenger airliner because of the lights & beacons, and i kept expecting to hear engine noise.  i have two ac units, but i do not believe either was cycled on during the sighting.  there is a fairly busy railroad nearby, but i do not believe there was a train running at that time.  after about five seconds of not hearing anything, i became fairly excited and looked through the binoculars, but i couldn't make out any structure or windows despite (or possibly because of) the bright lights.  i stood up and watched it continue on a straight trajectory for about 15 seconds longer - probably five of that fifteen seconds through the binoculars - changing my position to keep a clear view for as long as possible before it disappeared over the tall post oak forest directly behind my house.  i walked up to my back porch (my house is on an east/west slope) to see if i could see the craft emerge to the south, but i didn't see it again.  \r\n\r\ni was so mesmerized by the craft, and so preoccupied with trying to figure out what it was, it never entered my mind to use the small digital camera in my pocket.  obviously, i wish i'd have thought to do so.\r\n\r\nwhile i cannot explain why i wouldn't have heard it, i'm certainly willing to concede the craft may have been an airplane headed for denton municipal airport or dfw airport, but considering its low altitude and what i perceived to be its large size, the lack of noise and highly irregular flight path prompted me to report it.  it was not a helicopter.  ambient noise is pretty low out here, and i can't recall a time when i've ever seen any aircraft that low & near, yet been unable to easily associate it with the sound of an engine or engines.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

underneath that blinked in rapid succession and were blue, red, and white. the object was about 300 feet long and diamond shaped.

august 2008 when i noticed blue and red lights over the dayton international airport out my bedroom window. i assumed a plane and continued to make my bed and get undressed.  when i had done this, taking about 1 minute, i noticed the lights again in the same spot out my window.  a plane would have moved out of sight by this time so i was a little intrigued.  i grabbed my binoculars (bushnell 7-12x30 field at 7x 300ft./1000yds.) and took a look. i have painted a picture with microsoft��� paint��� of what i saw through the window with the binoculars.\r\n\r\ni saw a craft situated just east of the airport that had blue, red, and white-yellowish lights at a stationary spot in the sky.  not being a trained observer, i can roughly guess it was at an altitude of around 1000 ft.  i would estimate it's size as roughly 3/4 the length of a boeing 747.  i can only make this estimate based on decades of seeing planes come and go at this airfield.\r\n\r\ni watched a couple of minutes through the binoculars and then got right up to my window and looked around the sky with the binoculars to see if i could spot anything else.  i saw an apparently similar craft above the first one by maybe 100-200 ft. between the airport and the first craft.  after a couple of seconds this second craft rose what appeared to be straight up and out of sight.\r\n\r\nit was now about 12:10 a.M. i immediately went to my mother's bedroom and opened the door to see if she was still awake.  she was not, so i decided to go outside the house alone.  standing in my front yard i immediately spotted the first craft i had noticed in the same site.  i then scanned the sky with unaided eye and noticed a craft to the northwest of the airport. it had the same light configuration as the other two. i observed these two craft with and without binoculars for about 10 minutes and then went back to my bedroom.\r\n\r\ni positioned a chair in my bedroom so i could sit and observe the first craft i had noticed.   i sat and watched it for about 1/2 an hour. this object did make some small changes in altitude and position during the time i observed it.  the lights on it seemed to be steady except that occassionally the white-yellowish ones seemed to blink.\r\n\r\ni then decided to go back outside for another look.  the first craft was in approximately the same position but the second one seemed to be moving farther away in the northwestern sky.\r\n\r\ni went back in after about 10 minutes and layed down on my bed, getting up about every 10 to 15 minutes to check on the first craft out my window. the craft in the northwestern sky was obstructed from view out this window by trees.\r\n\r\nmy mom got up at about 2:30 a.M. to use the bathroom.  while i was waiting for her to come out of the bathroom, i looked out my bedroom window and noticed the first craft was now gone.  i scanned the sky with the binoculars and at approximately the same spot where the first craft had been but very much higher in altitude (i really cannot even guess) i saw what looked like a large rectangular object with it's long side faced toward me and tilted forward so i could see it's top.  it was covered in yellowish lights, somewhat like a skyscraper at night with the lights on inside.\r\n\r\ni caught my mom on her way back to her bedroom and told her about what i was seeing.  we both went out on the front lawn and neither one of us could locate any unusual lights in the sky.  they were gone.\r\n\r\nthe sky conditions on this night were what i would call moderately clear.  that is, i could see bright stars and the planets without any difficulty, but the sky was not \"filled\" with stars like it is on a very clear night.\r\n\r\nthe png graphic i have supplied shows the lights that were on a single craft.  i could just barely make out some shadowy solid mass the lights were attached to, but could not really discern it's shape.  from the configuration of the lights i guessed that it was probably disk or oval shaped.\r\n\r\ni would say the location of the first craft i saw east of the airport would be approximately above the village of ginghamsburg,ohio just next to the airport on the east and the craft in the northwestern sky would be approximately over west milton, ohio.  i would think \"night people\" (police,etc.) of the town i live in would had to have seen what i saw.  i noticed it while going to bed, but a police officer had to have noticed it on patrol.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

ever seen. i have been trying my best to get an explanation of them. i zoomed in on great detail to see energy waves being pulled back down into them by gravity. they are like layers of glass, on top of each other. circular, and immense in size. they have markings and what appears like energy fields around one of them. however, the other one looks darker, no energy firlds around it, and the center looks as though it had been quite damaged. almost like the 'energetic ship' is coming to help (you can make your own conclusion). there are either markings or levels. it is obvious the objects are not

were squirrels up there. there were not but while i stood on the sidewalk, i saw a plane flying fairly high up with a contrail streaming out behind it, roughly ne to sw. but what really attracted my attention was a super bright strobing light just below the plane. at first i thought it had come off the plane and was falling. it did move below the aircraft getting lower in the sky but it was not falling. i observed this for over a minute before the light went behind a tree. the plane passed behind the tree much higher up and as it came out the other side, there was another of these bright strobing lights below the plane. i had completely lost sight of the 1st one but was able to follow the second one. the plane continued on course but the 2nd strobing light moved in a westerly direction and appeared to be gaining altitude. at this point i was not sure of what i was seeing. around this time the mailman was delivering to my house. as he walked out to where i was standing, i asked him to tell me if he could see what i was looking out. he did and asked me if i knew what it was. i told him it was the second one light that had appeared below a plane, the first one i lost sight of behind the trees. i told him what i have written above. we stood there watching if for a good 10 minutes and observed it changing  direction now moving sw. while the mailman tracked the object i went into the house and got a pair of binoculars. i rejoined the mailman and observed the object through them. it was very high and very small triangular in shape but very narrow almost like a spear tip. silver to shiny white and strobing light that had no particular pattern. as i looked at it thru the binoculars a another plane passed thru my field of vision below the strobing light. the mailman reluctantly left to continue his rounds after a few more minutes and i remained watching this object for over 30 minutes. i went in to answer the phone after that and when i returned i could no longer locate it in the sky. \r\nwith the naked eye the object was never larger then the head of a pin at arms length but it was much brighter then the brightest star on a summer's night in the country. it did not move as fast as a passenger aircraft at altitude from my vantage point but changed direction at least twice during my observation. from time to time i tried to locate the first one of these that i had observed but had no luck. towards the end of my sighting, the light was not as bright as it was at the beginning while strobing erratically the entire time. i attribute this to the fact the object was climbing and moving further away from me\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:35:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Path with

trumbull beach right next to silver sands state park in milford ct. , and we saw what we believe to be a ufo.  the first sighting, all 5 of us can confirm what we had seen that night, we didn���������t manage to get any good photos, no one had a digital camera, but we did capture one blurry cell phone picture.  what we had witnessed was a series of orange lights right off the coast of milford ct forming perfectly symmetrical triangles as well as other patterns.  they definitely were not boats or planes or even helicopters with the way they just seemed to slowly drift around each other while pretty much staying in the same place in the sky no more than a few hundred feet up as well as fade away and re appear, even forming into one ball of light and splitting right back up again.  needless to say we were all mildly ���������freaked out���������  but we sat there on a rock pier for about 2 hours mesmerized by these orbs before they began to just fade out and disappear without seeming to travel any farther away. now this past saturday 8/23/08 at about the same time as before me and 2 friends were driving around by the beach in stratford ct right near the lordship airport and sure enough, my friend in the back seat of the car yells to stop the car!  and of course what could it be? the same orbs all over again, only this time we had a digital camera, it belongs to clint depalmer.  so we hurried the camera out of the bag, set it up and took as many pictures as we could before we gave up watching it seeing as how there really wasn���������t much we could do, news organizations im sure paid no attention to our claims.  we used different exposure times and zooms just to capture it from as many angles as possible, one of the pictures being so well zoomed you can see each individual orb seems to form a smaller triangular shape.  and strangely enough a co-worker of mine happened to have seen the same lights this past saturday at walnut beach, another small beach in milford ct. within walking distance of charles island.\r\nso to be honest im not sure what any of us saw but we know it wasn���������t normal.

that at times was very bright and at times very dim as if it was rotating, but staying stationary. then as we continued watching this object it would disappear but reappear in a diffrent location, performing the same actions over and over.  at this time i went to get my camera from the car and managed to snap a few pictures.  the object was very high in the sky and was visible for at least 10 minutes or so. after the object disappeared, we went inside knowing what we had seen was not from here, and not explainable.  we blew up the photos the best we could, changing color to make out a shape, finally we found a shape as well as a second object we did not noticed until we blew up the photo.  the main object's shape seemed to be mostly round with bubble like pertrusions on the sides and top, but the bottom had a very dark spot almost like a hole in the bottom of the craft.  below and to the right in the photo near the date in the corner was a second craft and again after blowing it up and changing the color of the background we noticed the shape of this craft was triangular in shape with a dark spot on the top, like a hole.  its almost like they were in sinc with each other.  i would like if anyone could professionally blow these up with better equipment to help see the objects more clearly.  i still have the photos on the memory stick in the camera i took them with.  after reflecting on what occured, i do beleive without a doubt that we had witnessed a ufo. i have always been a believer and would love to have these photos professionally examined and enlarged, to make others be able to see what we saw.\r\nthanks\r\nc.W.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12212,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":39.8009464,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08252008-0008","longitude":-75.3474118,"occurred":1219422120000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

running in the early to mid-evening when the sun was down and it would be cooler. i was running between 5 - 10 miles daily. as a serious athlete ( i won the presidents physical fitness award all 4 years of highschool ) i was always completely free of drugs and alcohol , and was lucid at all times. as i was running north on route 3 and nearly at the intersection where rt.3 and rt. 112 joined... directly across the street from what used to be the old mountaup motel and cabins. i looked over my right shoulder in the direction of the old \r\niga foodliner & the east branch of the pemigewasset river as i saw a cigar shaped craft that was glowing fiery red and was ascending nearly straight up , but not quite. but it was ascending very slowly , silently and at a very sharp angle. i stopped dead in my tracks and began staring at the object absolutely stunned & scared while also overcome by curiosity having never seen anything like this before. i stared at the object as it was silently ascending for about 20 - 30 seconds. the oddest part of the experience was that i was overwhelmed by the feeling that not only could i see the craft , but that it also could see me & knew i was watching ! it was quite eerie. i noticed that in the line the object was traveling that soon my view was going to be blocked by a big maple tree that was across the street from where i was standing. the tree was quite large & was in full bloom with all it leaves as fall was approaching. sure enough the craft disappreared from my view when it crossed behind the maple tree and indeed my view was completely obscured. i gauged where the craft would reappear and focuded my attention to that area of the sky & to my astonishment it never reappeared. it just vanished ! i just stood there in unbelief. i knew what i saw was real & not some figment of my imagination.  but i also knew that this craft could not possibly be of this earth. at least not to my knowledge. i want to repeat that the eeriest part of this experience was that i felt like not only could i see them , but they could also see me. i basically sprinted the last mile of the run to my home very , very scared. once home i deliberated on what i had seen but didn't tell anyone for fear of being ridiculed. in the last 30 some odd years i have only shared this story with only a handful of people. i'm convinced now that ufo's are real & that this is indeed what i saw. i'm prepared now to take my stand with others who've had similar expierences and share with others what i believe to be a real phenomenon.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12211,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.0578195,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08252008-0007","longitude":-71.6877307,"occurred":210322800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

was looking at it, a small star-like object was moving right under the visible part of the moon (which from my view was the top half). i didn't know what it was, my fiance' thought it was a satellite, but i did not think they could move like that. it looked like it was coming in a north to south direction and right when it got to one side of the moon, it looked like it blinked on and off a few times and then disappeared. then about 2 minutes later it was up near the top left side of the moon, then blinked on and off again. by the next time it had appeared, it had dropped way down below the moon, but still on the left hand side, then it blinked on and off a few more times, then it was gone again. about five minutes later it reappeared and was north in the sky again (to the right hand side of the moon)the way it came from. it was still blinking from time to time. the other strange thing was that a few military planes were flying in a formation overhead, but they weren't flying too fast, so maybe it was just a coincidence? a few nights ago i saw some strange blinking at night. i would like to know if anyone else has been seeing this? it was very cool, i wish it would have been closer so i could have seen it better. it was exciting to see it disappear and then reappear pretty far away.","distance":"Over One
