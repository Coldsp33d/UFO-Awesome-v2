south ,south east.\r\nno aircraft were visible or heard,as i remarked to family how peacefull the evening was.\r\nthe moon was up and clear and i decided to take a couple of shots on my digital camera from my upstairs window.\r\nthe camera is a minolta dimage g400 with 4 megapixal,and optical zoom.\r\n\r\nnothing untoward was visible in the sky.\r\n\r\non downloading the photos to my pc , i noticed a violet and red coloured object at near top of picture.\r\nin windows i zoomed in on the object to see it has three lights which appear to be inside it,the object being allmost see through,\r\nthere also seems to be several structures within but the zoom loses its clarity to such an extent that these can only be seen as blurs.\r\nthe object on inspection appears red on top,red underneath,violet in the middle with slight yellow toward the underneath rear.\r\nthe object appears to be surrounded by a plasma or gaseous bubble which trails behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\ni transferred a copy of the photograph to windows paint,where i inverted the colours.\r\nthis image on zooming in shows the object has a peculiar trail intimating its decent and high speed.\r\ni deduced the \"high speed\"as the object was not visible in the three other photos,and was not visible in real time as i looked toward the sky.\r\ni also have noted on the previous and post photographs that there are no stars visible in that area.\r\nthe object also shows the three internal lights as black dots which i would assume confirms there presence.\r\nmy neighbours house becomes visible in this format.\r\n\r\ncopy the photograph to windows picture viewer and zoom in ,also then look at it in inverted colour mode.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:01","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12208,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":50.726682,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-08252008-0004","longitude":-3.530639,"occurred":1207206000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Egg","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1207206000000,"summary":"Photographing

Beach","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was sitting outside on my deck in hermosa beach and something in the sky caught my eye.  i was sitting in a chair facing west and this object was south - over the town of redondo beach, which is the next town over from me and starts a few blocks away from me. it was circular shaped like a frisbee and had the brightest white lights around the outer edge and it also had a few red lights as well. it was hovering over the same area in the sky (for as long as i saw it, which was about 20-25 minutes). there was a marine layer or fog, and it was flying directly below that. it was much lower than any commercial airline flies. even though multiple times, it went up a little higher and part of it was lost in the fog, i was still always able to see at least the other part of it that was not in the fog - part of it, if not all of it, was visible during the 20-25 minutes that i was watching it.  \r\n\r\nmost of the time, i could see the bottom of this object (the circular shape) but at times it would manuever and turn on its side and twirl around.  it stayed in one spot for a while, moved to the side, moved up, moved down, moved closer to me and then away from me, at times it appeared to be floating in one spot (not moving), and it also zig-zaged over to the side, twirl around and dart back towards the other side. it was the most unbelievable thing i have ever seen in my life.  a total rush!!  \r\n\r\nafter staring at it in amazement for a few minutes, it took me a few minutes to realize what it was.  it was the last thing i would ever imagine i would see.  it hit me like a ton of bricks that this was not something normal, and once i realized that, i thought \"oh my goodness, i need to film this because i am the only one out here that sees this\".  i kept staring at it thinking it would disappear, but it didn't, and it stayed in the same spot.  i was afraid to take my eyes off it and have it disappear, but after many minutes of it staying in the same area of the sky, i decided to chance running inside to document this moment.  so, i ran inside my house to grab a camera (which only took less than a minute) and when i came back outside, it was still in the same spot.  i filmed it with my camera and after a short time, the memory card filled up.  i had to run inside again to grab a spare memory card and when i came back outside, it was still there in the same spot.  \r\n\r\ni called my roommate who was out with friends.  i was able to get ahold of her while i was filming and told her to go outside.  she was down the street from me and was able to see it as well, but from an angle that was not as good as mine.  i called my other friend and he told me to point a flash light up into the sky to attempt to get their attention.  he also told me to call the local police station to report it.  i ran inside to grab the flashlight. the batteries in my flashlight were almost dead, so the light on my flashlight was yellowish and not bright at all.  at the same time i turned on my flashlight and pointed it up into the sky, with my other hand, i called the hermosa beach police department's non-urgent phone number (my local police station) to report this sighting and right then, the ufo disappeared.  the woman on the phone told me she had already received another call minutes before from someone else in my area reporting the sighting.  \r\n\r\nit was the craziest experience - i will never forget this experience and will always have that image in my mind.  the best part is that is stayed in the sky for longer than i could have ever imagined.\r\n\r\nunfortunately the camera zoom was not good at all.  the image appeared small, as a white dot via my camera video but by my eyes, it was so much larger.  i extended my arm as far as i could up above me head to try to get the best video, but because the zoom wasn't good, i was watching it through my eyes because it was so much better, bigger, i could see sooo much more detail, and i could watch it move around in greater detail. its unfortunate that those images i saw didn't come through on my camera.  although if you can zoom, you might see more and be able to view what i was able to see.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

there was what appeared to be a black crescent shaped object, heading south. at first i didn't think anything of it, i initially assumed it was a large hawk riding and gliding on high air thermals. i continued to watch it out of curiosity. i noticed that the movement was at a steady pace and there was no flapping of wings if it was a bird. i would estimate the height of the object to be about 30k, the same altitude as a lot of the jetliners that fly over. i listened for any noise from the object but didn't hear anything. i tried to get my girlfriend's attention and point out the object. just then a low flying cessna type aircraft came flying over and diverted my attention. when i looked again i couldn't see it anymore. i told her what i saw but was unable to locate it again. \r\n\r\nas she scanned the sky she saw the same type object at our 10 o'clock position, traveling the same direction and at the same height. we watched this one closely. it was crescent shaped and black,

tail section, it kind of reminded me of a flying wing, except the curve of the crescent was slight.  15 minutes later, two jetliners flew over at the same height and we could distinctly hear the faint

went to\r\nthe kitchen to turn off the t.V.. and noticed the time as 1:05 a.M.  i\r\nthought i would go outside to do a sky check.  when i stepped outside\r\ni immediately saw 4 white lighted circles \"dancing\" about in a circular\r\npattern in the east/southeast portion of the sky almost, but not quite\r\ndirectly above our house, but more above our neighbor's house to our\r\neast.  the lights would each make about a 1/4 circle then move to the middle where they \"hit\" each other and bounced outward. i was very excited and went to wake my husband to come see the phenomenon.  when we went back outside, the circles of light continued in the same pattern as before. sometimes they would extend further out from each other, but always making a 1/4 circle sweep, then inward where they would \"hit\" and bounce away from each other.  this we viewed from our porch, and driveway, and road that runs in front of our house.  most of the time we viewed them from our driveway looking between a large maple tree in the front east yard and the front north of the house.  we observed the lights for 45 minutes.  the sky at this time was overcast and the lights seemed to be in or above the clouds. the lights were white (occasionally i noticed a faint yellowish cast to them).  the lights were circular and lit up the cloud as they moved about. . . only the circle of light was lit up, not the surrounding cloud.  the apparent size of each of the lights was about the  size of a full moon, perhaps a little larger. each of the lights appeared to be same size as the others.  the pattern remained the same throughout the event.  the lights did not seem to ascend or decend.  also, we noticed that when the sky had a clear patch, the light could not be seen when it passed into the cleared area of sky.  it was as if the cloud itself made it possible to see the lights.  the lights were east-southeast in the sky at the ceiling cloud level.  as the clouds dissipated, the lights were no longer visible.  i do not know if the lights were trying to communicate anything.  my thought was that perhaps they were trying to indicate a location to something else.  these were not strobe lights.  there was no sound, smell, or emission.  there were no other aircraft of any kind during the event. except for the sky being overcast, it was a warm quiet summer evening (early morning).The lights did not have any beam coming off them or extending downward.  the lights seemed to make a \"glowing\" circle in the cloud as they moved about.  the pattern seemed to indicate an intelligence about or something else was controlling them.  they did not seem threatening, however it was\r\na little unnerving to see something which clearly was not of this\r\nworld/dimension. we have a schnauzer dog and a cat, but they did not\r\nshow any indication of awareness of the event.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,

apologize for not having accurate dates, we didnt think to document the information. i know, of all people right?  all i can tell you is that it was around 11pm, and i was the driver of the vehicle. it was during the summer, about five years ago. we were about ten miles from where 281 and 290 west tbone. i happened to look up to my right, way far in the distance and saw blinking lights. it seemed small and i naturally thought it was a plane. the problem was, it was going diagonally toward the left,heading down, at a abnormal speed. at that point i looked at my partner and said, \"is that plane crashing\"? at this point all of us are staring at what we think is a plane about to take its last breath. just as it got about tree level, but about ten miles ahead of us, it abruptly stops in mid air and blows up into three enormous white lights. there was no having to explain to one another what we were staring at. so of course we have all this equipment so we are frantically looking for a shoulder to pull over. at this moment we hit a grove of trees. later we went back going the same speed and it took aproximately 3 seconds to pass the trees. within that three seconds, it somehow had totally vanished. we got no chance to take pics, video, anything. because of the distance away from us, all i can say was it was hovering around the 290/281 tbone up ahead of us. the interesting thing is, is if you take that right at 281 and keep going you run right smack into stephensville. of course this was a couple of years earlier, but it was a strange coincidence. all participants in this will tell the same story to a t. now, this is where it gets stranger, and as much as i feel crazy for even saying it, i feel i must tell you the whole story. first, this isnt the first ufo run in ive had, that was the second. the first was in the country outside of irving texas. just an fyi, because it seems alittle odd that twice i have seen something so incredible up close and personal. what are the chances, one in thousands, millions? anyway, a year and a half ago or so, ive decided to take my sister in law to fredericksburg texas where my father lives. now you have to realize, that i have been traveling back and forth from austin to fred for about 15 years. i instinctively know where i am at any given moment and can tell by my inner clock how long it will be till my next land mark. now, in order to get to fred from austin, you travel down 290 west going through dripping springs, then there is nothing till you get to the tbone of 281/290. im explaining to her as we drive through dripping this is where my uncle lives bla bla. so, from that point, you would go the exact same way as we were headed the night of the 2nd ufo sighting. from dripping springs the next town is johnson city. you drive all the way till the tbone at 281, take a right, and johnson city is about 7 miles or so. takes only moments to get there. right when i took a right on 281 my husband called and asked me if i was in fredericksburg yet, i replyed that we were almost in johnson city. from that point we were maybe 3 minutes from johnson, maybe alittle more but not much. three, four, five, ten minutes goes by and my internal clock started going off. something wasnt right. more and more i realized i had no idea where i was. i started really tripping out because after 15 years you pretty much would have to have had a total brain blooper to get lost in five minutes. so i look at nikki and tell her i have no idea where johnson city was, or where we were. im sure she was thinking i was pulling her chain at this point. she had never been to fredericksburg so all she knew was that we were supposed to hit some city called jc. at this point i have no idea of how long we were driving but it felt like about 20 minutes. in the distance i saw a yellow blinking light and a convenience store. about a minute after that i saw a sign that said fredericksburg one mile. my jaw dropped, i was speachless. thats about 45 miles in what seemed like about 15 to 20 minutes. now you have to understand, there is no other way to get to fredericksburg without going through jc, its impossible because you have to take a left in jc, drive 30 through downtown, and then on to fredericksburg. how could both of us have forgotten about driving through a town that only five minutes before i told my sister in law that we were fixing to hit jc. so we forgot in less than five minutes? a whole town filled with lights, stores still open, a flashing roadrunner sighn for a hotel you cant miss coming in to jc, you name it, and you cant miss it. by the time i got to my dads i was grabbing a road atlas and there was absolutely no other way to get to fredericksburg. i purposefully took her back through when we left at night. i knew if she had spaced the whole town seeing it again would jog her memory. she has no memory of going through jc, hye, or stonewall and neither do i. it wasnt until i drew a map of the location to show a friend that i stood speachless looking at the map realizing my \"missed time\"was in the same place as the ufo sighting a couple of years earlier. now i dont get rattled easily, i mean, im a paranormal researcher who thrives on the hopes of seeing a spirit up close and personal. this, has me totally freaked out. on top of that, i have had recurring nightmares of alien invasion for a few years now. in the dreams i never see them, but its always the same type of scenario. they show up in ships and take over yet i never see any fighting with our military and their ships. its just people running and hiding because they are completely defenseless. i dont want to tell too many people about this  because i always get that look. the your full of s*** look. i really feel like one of those paranoid weirdos spounting that they had been abducted with probes in the you know whats and so on. i actually would love a better idea than the one i came up with because if its the truth then something happened to me that no one is gonna believe even with the plethera of witnesses, 5 all together with all three times combined.  i know that four out of the five for sure will be more than happy to verify my story. unfortunately the first ufo i saw was with my boyfriend at the time and i was 19 and am now almost 37 so i wouldnt even know how to find him sadly. it scared me, honestly, and it gets more scary the more research i do. i would love some help on this and im sure you guys would love to do whatever you can to help. im a interesting case anyway, because this isnt the first thing that has happened to me that is quite amazing indeed. mostly dealing with the paranormal world. oh, by the way, i dont know if this means anything to you, so bare with me. it may mean nothing at all. when i was about maybe 5 or 6, my mother had me over at a friends house. i remember when she put me to bed, that it was a twin bed that sat up against a large window to the right of my head. i remember her tucking me in, then leaving. it seems it was in moments only after she left that i looked out the window and see this huge five pointed star right outside my window. i \"think\" it was a two story but i dont feel comfortable telling you something im notpositive of.  if you have ever seen a star saphire, it looked exactly like it only huge. i looked at it, thought nothing of it, and drifted off to sleep. all growing up i never thought it was a dream until i got way older and started to question myself. has there ever been a sighting of anything like that because i have no idea. its probably nothing, i try to be as skeptical as possible in these matters, but i just felt the sudden urge to add that story in as well. its alot of times easier to first reach me by email because i dont answer numbers i dont recognize but you can also leave a message and i will be happy to call you back. i truly hope im just crazy lol, i can handle ghosts, poltergeists, you name it ive been through it and been fine. but with all of the information i just gave you, im sure you can understand that im kinda freaked out. oh, just one more thing, im not trying to write a book, or get noticed because im already in a feild that gets alot of grief from skeptics. i have a good reputation in the community, have spoken at paranormal conferences, and am (as far as i know lol) considered to be extreemly even keeled and analytical about these things. i dont jump to conclusions or go half cocked making outrageous claims like some others in my feild have done in the past. so, trust me when i say i dont want to end up on the news sounding like a lunatic or write some stupid book most ppl will say is fraudulent anyway. so there it is, i am willing to do whatever to get to the bottom of it even if it turns out i really did drive through johnson city and somehow totally forgot right along with hye and stonewall. check it out on the map, you will see what i mean. thank you so much for hearing my story, i hope i didnt throw too much at you at once ;) katrina\r\nps~ i just thought of something. after we got to the location we were investigating after 3nd ufo incident, we also noticed an hour or so later of a meteor shower. we might be able to track the date if its even necessary. oh, and something else which might not be involved with it, but when you get to the road that turns left towards blanco which is where we were initially headed. that turn was only a couple of miles after the sighting. now we are in no mans land, closest town is blanco 10 miles away. this is all nothing but hill country. as i get to the road to turn i notice all these flashing red and blue lights from police and fire trucks. at least four or five cop cars, firetrucks ect. all parked just sitting there. it could have been something totally different, but i do know that it is likely that these officers saw this thing just like we did. maybe they thought it was a plane going down like we did at first. but when it blew up into three huge white lights it was just impossible due to the size of the thing. besides, what crashing plane can stop short and hover?   it came in so fast,without a heads up the blanco police  could have never gotten there that fast.    blanco is ten or so miles away. sorry i just want to tell you as much as i can remember so we can figure this thing out once and for all! oh and i wil give you all the numbers to contact the witnesses after i make sure its ok with them first which im sure it will be fine.","distance":"Over

of place, but it was unusual to me, so i continued to stare.\r\n\r\n then what caught me eye next is something even more remarkable.  in the \r\ntop upper left hand side of the cloud was a perfectly\r\nshaped cube.  i say cube because it looked as if a cube had punched through it leaving a square on the bottom and a square on the top.  i could\r\nsee three sides of the cube in the middle and another parcial side which exposed blue sky.\r\n \r\n it looked as if something had gone from the ground up because there where \r\ntiny wisps of the cloud coming from the sides of the flat surfaces of the \r\ncube and they where caught in an upward draft.  this\r\nis when i began to inspect it more closely and entirely. inside the cloud was a dark mass, but the mass was a perfect triangle!  i began to become excited.  i knocked on the door to show my mother whom i had just woken but she didn't answer, so i knocked on her bedroom window. later we realized that she was passing through the door to use the restroom and i had just missed her at both places.\r\n\r\n the cloud was drifting, so i had to crane my neck to see it and when i \r\ndid, the tip exposed itself.  it was black in color and was a perfectly shaped triangle.  i tried to follow it but it passed over my neighbor's house and into the trees.  i did get to see it for about 10 seconds and since the cloud had a silver lining from the sun and it was a good distance ( approx. 30 -35 feet from the silver lining.) i definitely could tell it wasn't part of the cloud.\r\n\r\n since i no longer could see that, i turned my attention back to the cube, \r\nbbut it was beginning to break up.  so i focused on the dark shape inside \r\nthe cloud.  that's when part of the cloud opened up and i saw the back of what was in the cloud! what i saw was the tail end of a craft of some sort. it was enormous!  \r\n \r\n i couldn't see the entire tail end of what was in the craft, but i did see multiple rows of rectangles not all the same in size and length, but \r\nperfect in shape laying horizontally.  they weren't all the same in color \r\nand size, but where all perfectly shaped.  they were earthy tones like \r\ncopper, khaki, beige and light browns.\r\n\r\n after watching this for a moment as the cloud began to envelope the back \r\nend, a pod of 8 or 9 purple martins floated into the scene.  i've grown up \r\nwith these birds and they weren't acting normal in nature.  they almost \r\nlooked metallic in color.  i instantly felt the feeling as if something \r\nwas trying to sway my attention.  the birds where riding a thermal, but none of them flapped their wings, which is unusual for\r\n8 or 9 martins to not be doing.  my mother later pointed out that maybe\r\nthey where riding the thermal of this craft and/or what punched through\r\nthe cloud.  but i beg to differ, but do consider.\r\n\r\n i could no longer see the darkness in the cloud when returning my \r\nattention back to it.  \"they succeeded,\" i told myself.  i finally \r\nreturned my attention to the door and wanted to tell my mother of this \r\nexperience.  she was very upset that see didn't get to see it, but if i turned my head away then it would have darted off.\r\n\r\n i got on the road and went to work.  on my way, i was looking at other \r\nclouds trying to find it or find something else. \r\nthere where other dark masses in the clouds, but none like what i had just\r\nwitnessed and what a perfect way to cloak itself.\r\n\r\n i went to work twice yesterday.  once in the morning and again at 10:30pm\r\ncentral time. because i was looking for it in the day, i was on my way to work and not coming home.  she tells it as if i where on my way home and not on the way to work.\r\n\r\n she and my grandmother both complained to me of having a terrible headache when i returned home from work around 4:30 pm.  but i can't get her to understand that how could i be looking for a cloud with sun on it and dark shapes in them if i'm at home and not driving? she remembers me telling her that i would tell grandmother about it over coffee on sunday morning (june, 29, 2008) because i wanted to take a nap before returning to work that evening.\r\n\r\n i thought i had it explained to her, but she refuses to believe me.  as i \r\ntype this, she's telling me that i'm still wrong. interesting footnote, last night i dreamed of fibers being pulled from my head.  but i know i was looking for it in the day because i saw it during the day while it was day light and how i could look for a cloud with sun on it at 10:30pm?\r\n\r\n this was a most unusual experience and the fourth experience at witnessing something in the sky out of the ordinary and only 200 or 250 feet above me hanging at a low rate of speed hiding in a cloud and\r\nwith so many other unusual characteristics attributed to it and all without a sound.\r\n\r\ni'm a believer, have been a believer and now i know why i'm a believer.  another guy i work with has been seeing objects over his house and i've been reading reports of objects being seen all over the houston area.  keep looking up folks.  they're up there!\r\n","distance":"101-500

high above the water of the pond. i pulled over to view and got out of my car after seeing that they did not disappear right away. one of them either flew away very quickly or disappeared while the other came closer to me it appeared to be a rainbow of very bright lights around a disk. it blinded me as if i stared into headlights then by the time i regained my sight it had vanished. i had observed it for about 5 minutes before it left. the next night i returned with my friend and a high quality video camera and again at exactly 10:00 it returned this time by its self. this time it was a little farther from the shore. the object zig zagged right, left up and down very quickly changing directions. my camera was set to night vision on a tripod with a slower shutter speed. i captured it both in night vision and in normal capture mode. the camera with its slow shutter was unable to capture its very fast jerky style movement that was visible by the naked eye but some was seen on tape. it disappeared only to reappear in the same spot about 15 minutes later. each time it would stay for about 5-8 minutes. it would hover in the same exact area each time.  at least once it appeared to shoot a quick  beam of light almost appearing like lighting in sky and light up the ground around it. i have seen this object in the large field in back of my house ( miles away from the pond) for the past couple weeks now. at the pond down the road is where the closest sightings happened on 2 occasions. you can tell its not a normal airplane. there is no noise, the light is very intense and it changes direction at a very fast rate. there is no blinking lights like you see on the wings of an airplane. there also appeared to be at least one or two smaller craft that came out of the larger one and after exiting they flew in opposite directions of each other. we also have audio that appears to sound like some other creature speaking but we are not sure it could be some animal. we herd the voices and captured it on video after the ship had passed over us. i have very good video of the incident however the camera did not capture the rainbow light but instead captured a very bright whitish\\blueish color. \r\n\r\nthe reason i am reporting it to you is i did a google search and found your ct mutual ufo network just now and the picture of the rainbow lights that was also taken in ct. it is the same ship that we saw!! i have a feeling this ufo can be further captured at around the same time if you wish to visit the area soon with higher quality video equipment. i live in the country, i am a 26 year old male. my friend was also witness with me on the second night when we came prepared with a camera. the object appears over a pond and the light is close enough to reflect off the water. it hovers between the pond and a large set of woods. please let me know if you can help to capture this object as it is seem all the time in the hours between 9 and 11:30. sometimes there are a couple of them and they appear about 20 feet apart. i am going to try and upload some of the video soon.\r\n\r\nporterzcustomz@comcast.Net\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12184,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.7788301,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08232008-0007","longitude":-72.5131609,"occurred":1219129200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Connecticut","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1219129200000,"summary":"I

was cooking rice for sushi. i suddenly, as i leaned forward, felt a sharp pain in my stomach. i thought i must have burnt myself but the top wasn't on fire or damaged, just my stomach, so i decided to finish the rice. it was strange though that it was already finished (it takes about an hour for me to cook because i'm fussy) and starchy water had spilt out onto the stovetop.\r\n\r\nlater when i looked carefully, worried i'd damaged my top, i found that there was a scar in the dead centre of my stomach. not an open cut, not a burn, but a scar.  about three centremetres from my navel.\r\n-half an inch long.\r\n-5 millimetres wide.\r\n-irratated skin around edges\r\n-tender.\r\n\r\nit was strange but i didn't really know what to do about it or what it'd be. my work clothes hadn't been burnt and as strange as it seems, that was what bothered me more at the time. but there was no blood, nothing sharp around the stove. i continued to cook with the rice and didn't think on it further, it was dark and i didn't want to think about anything scaryish.\r\n\r\nit's been almost a week later and it hasn't changed. it hasn't healed, or got worse, and i realized that there was something odd about it. it resembled my surgical scars from old keyhole surgery, after the surgery, and the stomach above the cut was really itchy, like that 'healing itch' itchy that wounds get. it is still like that. wound is still pink around edges, whiteish in centre, shrunk a bit but still exactly the same as before. \r\ni have a lapband around my uppar stomach. (hense the keyhole surgery scars.) a few days ago the stomach swelled very badly, very very badly, and there was an area to the left of the stomach that really badly hurt to the point of being unable to sleep. i was tempted to wake my room mate to take me to the hospital, i was pacing up and down outside her room concidering it at 2am, but for some reason i changed my mind and went to bed. \r\n\r\ni'm sorry, i can't get good photos. but it's the second weird scar i've gotten.\r\n\r\nthe other weird wound was about an inch and a half below the bellybutton, to the right. it was a perfect circle, raised up (like a donut) on the edges and a perfect dent/circle wound in the middle. i seriously mean a perfect circle, i checked it. still trying to heal. it happened about two weeks ago. i noticed it during the day. \r\n\r\ni have photos of both but i need to get them off my phone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot first weird events. i had a possible abduction when i was four, other possible abductions between 5 and 10, one during a school camp when i was 13.

same weird light keeps appearing in the same spot at the same time. i told everyone in north vegas to look west over the mountains between 7:50 and 7:58pm. well 7:50 rolls around and the object appears. \r\n\r\n                  i was on lone mountain ave near simmons ave, looking west. i had my binoculars and sony cybershot 7.2 mega pixel camera ready in case it showed up for the third night in a row, it did.   in the exact same spot a bright light suddenly appears like a very bright star (no stars are out yet) it was two finger widths (held at arm length) above the mountain tops (see 1st picture). it then hovered and descended very very slowly. it seemed to not move in a perfectly straight way. it went almost straight down, but moved slightly left and right,  slightly favoring the right as it went down. it took 5 minutes to go one finger width down towards the mountain (no plane fly���s that slow). it took another five minutes to go the other finger width and disappear behind the mountain. i looked with my binoculars and it looked definitely disc shaped and bright shiny white like a very, very bright star. it had no strobe light and i looked at it for the whole ten minutes, except for the time i took to take some photos.\r\n\r\n                   my camera is not designed for this kind of shooting, i turned the flash off, (iso mode), and tried to keep the bright nearby lights out of the frame and took three shots. it shows up good in one , bad in another and not at all in the third. the photo were you can see the object pretty good (1stphoto) you cant see the mountains very good, so i also attached the not so good one because you can see the mountains better and you can still see the object (although its fuzzy and hard to see). i know it won���t convince a skeptic but it will at least show where it was in relation to the mountain. it looks kind of like a star with a tail, i did not see the tail, it only showed in the picture. this picture was taken within the first minute of it appearing. my binoculars are (16x32) and i had to steady them on a wall but i could see it very well and am sure it���s not an airplane or helicopter.\r\n\r\n                    it has showed up in the same place 3 nights in a row. aug 20, 21, 22 at 7:55, 7:53, 7:50pm respectively. if it follows the obvious pattern it will show up tomorrow (aug 23) at 7:47pm. please if anyone in the vegas area reads this go look at it. anywhere in north las vegas that can see the mountains to the west could see it very easily. use binoculars for the full effect and if you see what i���m talking about post your sighting.\r\n","distance":"Over One
