the tree and head back out to the east. it made no noise and it was all lit up and looked white/red/gold. moments after that it was odd because a huge commerical jet liner flew right over the house very, very low like 600 feet. it shook the house. not usual flight pattern either, planes were flying out over the home.\r\n\r\nthen around 9:20pm i was out on the back patio and saw again this very

glanced up at the sky, it was a fairly clear night and i was looking at the stars when i noticed what appeared to be a star with a slight wobble. as we started walking home i asked my freinds if they thought that anything was strange about the star and it now appeared to be shaking quite vigourously. as we watched we realised that it was much too close to be a star and was a bright white light, it stopped shaking and seemed to be coming in our direction. it now seemed to slow down and moved like a balloon in a slight breeze bobbing gently around. it remained completly silent and though it is difficult to judge the distance accuratly it seemed to be very close maybe 200 metres away when it stopped dead still and remained still for approx 30 secs no real shape could be made out it just looked like a star.I was still wondering what it was and one of my freinds became nervous and suggested we head for home when it began to slowly move off to our right. it appeared to be gently bobbing around as it did so it then stopped perfectly still and remained still for approx 10 secounds. it then moved off again but it seemed surreal because it did not seem to accelerate but went from dead still to moving at a fairly quick constant pace in an instant. it was not bobbing now but moving in a straight line. as it got further away though still clearly visable it stopped still for a few secounds and what looked like a white light/beam shot out of the bottom left side of the object causing a small white flash in the sky a short distance from the object. the object then moved off and upward at a very fast speed and was gone from sight in a few secounds all three of us where amazed by what we saw and the object made no sound at all.","distance":"101-500

to our sighting and wanted the witness there to be sure to see our video. originally reported to ufocasebook.Com:\r\n\r\ni was awakened this morning about 5:40 am here in west houston by my 17 year old daughter who was up early for school. she was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. she said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. they said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights).\r\nthat's when they woke me. i ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. at an arm's length i'd say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut. fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape. the lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise.\r\n\r\ni went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if i could zero in on it. while i was trying to sight it, the one i was watching reduced size, turned orange and began to move to my right. i followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind some homes.\r\n\r\nthe other light was gone when i looked back.\r\n\r\nmy daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused. however, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through.\r\n\r\nwe have been watching news and internet but have seen no other reports, except in researching, i came across a description of a sighting the same day, 12 hours later in british columbia.\r\n\r\nwe don't know, of course, what it was, but the two objects i saw were silent.\r\n\r\nabout twenty minutes later, i went back outside and saw an aircraft approaching from a different part of the horizon and could clearly hear that it was a helicopter. so i use that in contrast to the silence of the first sighting.\r\n\r\nupdate-03-09-08-the gentleman who took the video below has sent additional information about the video:\r\n\r\nanyway, the two lower lights are normal. the white light is a porch light on someone���s home a few hundred yards away and the yellow light is a street lamp. the two upper, out of focus, but changing color, orbs are the sightings. again, these were each made up of several lights in a kind of x pattern. we could clearly see them but when she was filming she didn���t realize that the leaves of a palm were throwing off the focus of the camera.\r\n\r\nwe are kicking ourselves we didn���t take more shots outside. in the moment we were mesmerized and didn���t want to take our eyes off them. they were incredible! and i know that there is lots of air traffic in this area, but i���ve never ever seen anything like these lights before...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500

we left the house we saw what appeared to be a plane but brighter above eel river road.  as we started to turn right onto 600, off of eel river road, we noticed the the light was not moving.  jessica was driving and i was in the back seat with my grandson.  she slowed the vehicle down in order to get a better look at the object that was just above tree-line.  the object then came closer to our vehicle (around 700 feet from us).  jessica stopped the vhicle and as she did the object also stopped.  we were very excited and decided to go back home to get my son so that he could video tape it.  as we turned the vehicle around and started back on eel river rd., the object changed from a bright light to a triangular shaped object with two moving things attached to the back.  these things looked like the part on the back of an oil rig and moved in similiar fashion.  as we drove toward our home the ojbect moved off with us and stayed just above tree-line but followed us back to our house.  as we turned onto our road the object sped up faster than i have ever seen any plane go (there was no noise or other planes around during this) and disappeared behind my neighbor's home.  we ran in and told my son and his friend about what we witnessed.  they got the video camera and went outside.  my grandson was teething and needed tylenol so jessica and i got back into the vehicle and once again headed to the truck stop.  we decided to go down eel river rd and turn towards 31 on mexico rd.  as we approached 31, we again saw the same object hovering on our left right beside 31.  i told jessica to flash the vehicle lights.  as she did, the object appeared to responded and moved slightly as if to say (oh, there they are!) neither jessica or i remember going across the first two lanes of 31 but the next thing we knew we were in the intersection and there were cars coming at us from all directions.  we were almost hit in the front and in the back of our vehicle.  we turne left on 31 and continued to the truck stop.  the object was still hovering in the field beside 31 and as we proceeded in 31 it continued to stay with us.  if jessica slowed the vehicle the object got brighter and also slowed down.  during the time it was following beside us, it changed shapes many times.  at one point it became an oval shaped object and moved up in the sky a bit and we were able to see under it. directly in the center, underneath the object, it was very bright and looked like electrical currents or small lighting bolts.  the ojbect stayed with us until we got to the traffic light to turn left at the truck stop.  as we stopped at the light, the object slowed down and moved in front of us about 700 or 800 feet away and then another light appeared next to it.  when our light turned green and we turned into the truck stop both objects disappeared.  during the sighting we were not afraid.  we felt as though whatever this thing was, it was trying to communicate with us in some way.  we also felt confused and disoriented even on the trip home.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"01:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome,

appeared right where i was looking. it was about two finger widths (held at arms length) above the mountaintops. it then moved so slowly it was hard to perceive that it was moving but for the relative position of the mountains. it took 9 minutes to go two finger widths and behind the mountains. it did not take a straight path; it descended towards the mountains almost straight down but beared just a little to the right. then it went to the right along the top of the mountains then behind the mountain  (the distance it traveled to the right along the top of the mountain was about as big as your fingernail is wide held at arms length) it moved very very slowly. it seemed to move at a constant speed. it did appear to brighten and dim a little but stayed pretty much the same brightness the whole time. i stepped out my front door and looked at it with my binoculars and it looked like a bright white disc shaped object that had no strobe. there are a lot of planes around here but i would

beads, just a glow).   but, my research on the f-117 tells me that the engines would not be visible!  since it is stealth, the engines are ducted.  and, the f-117 is not a perfect triangle from the bottom, although it looks that way as it approaches you.  these were triangular. also, the f-117 is designed for speed, not slow flying over populated areas.  and, as if that weren't enough, as it was leaving i remember seeing two vertical tail fins, around the engines - the f-117s are slanted from the middle.  so, it looked more like what an \"aurora\" is supposed to.  but they fly fast!\r\n\r\nwhy would three f-117's fly over the upper west side of santa cruz at 5am, under radar, and at extremely slow speeds?  this was around the time of the gulf war, but i don't know why they would be scrambled in california either.\r\n\r\ni am still looking for answers...","distance":"101-500

was very low  flying.\r\nand make absolutely no sound.. i have a very good video of this. it had first 2 lights on each side and 1 flashing and one strobe , as it got directly over head of us the

too the high school. while i was trying too get my celphone from the cracks in between my console and drivers seat. i had too stop at the stop sign and turn right.  the ufo was huge it started too

from fridge.  peered out the window adjacent to the fridge looking in a westerly direction when i noticed what appeared to be a distant star.  i live just outside of town and have five acres but it gets very dark out here.  i regularly look at the stars and look for shooting stars, constellations, or just the beauty of the night sky.  i am constantly watching for coons getting in my garbage and for deer which tend to come up in the yard.  anyway, as i looked out the window i noticed this \"star\".  it seemed to be lower than the rest.  after a short second i realized that it was changing colors.  i stared for a few moments then decided i would just step outside and take a look.  i went to my patio and watched this for several minutes.  it didn't appear to be moving just hanging there in the sky.  i was in my underwear (lol) so i decided to go back inside.  after only a minute or two my curiosity got the better of me so i put on my pjs and went back out.  there it was still hanging there changing obviously from bright red to teal to gold to green just all these different colors.  to make sure i wasn't crazy i proceeded to stare at all the other stars i could see to make sure they didn't have the same appearance.  they did not.  after several more minutes i looked around to see if there was anything else odd in the sky and couldn't see anything.  but i noticed the light had moved slightly because i had to move to a different spot on the patio to keep it in view.  i was looking over the top of a tree line adjacent to my property and had to view through a gap in the tree tops.  since it didn't seem to be going away i decided to try to get my video camera and catch a glimpse on it before something happened.  the batteries weren't charged.  i was afraid to stop looking for fear i would miss something that would dispell or prove my suspicions that this thing was out of the ordinary.  so i hurried up and went back out.  i thought i missed it but once i moved to the top of my deck in the front yard i regained sight of the light.  i watched it get dim and then bright again but not much else seemed to happen(colors were still changing).  i lit a smoke and had time to finish it probably lasted five minutes or so and the light was still there.  then it seemed to get brighter like maybe it was coming closer towards my direction.  i watched so hard i don't think i could blink.  all of the sudden, the light just seem to fizzle out and dissappear.  i am aware of the airport that is nearbye.  i have lived here the majority of my life.  when i was little i wanted to be a fighter pilot.  i know what airplanes look like.  i know about the red and green strobes at either end of the wingspan and the white light they also carry.  this wasn't a plane.  it didn't circle or cut across the sky.  i observe jets and such all the time in the night sky.  i am confident this was out of the ordinary.  although it was only about twice the size of any star in the sky the colors were unreal.  they weren't blinking or changing like one off one on.  the light almost seem to swirl or blend or whatever.  don't really know what to compare it to.  i was so excited i wanted to wake my wife but didn't want to piss her off.  i wish i had camcorded the whole thing.  i almost took a picture but i didn't think it would look like anything unless you could see the changing of the colors.  just want to know if anyone else in the springfield il area spotted the strange light.

the light of the setting sun. our living room couch is situated against a long wall and the evening light frequently causes us to lower the blinds a bit to prevent being totally unable to see out. the time was approximately 7:20pm. i happened to glance over and noticed something odd in the sky, falling between the high tension wires of a pole out on the back road, in the direction of northwest. it appeared to be an elongated trail of smoke. i wear glasses. at the distance i calculated the phenomenon to be i did not wish to trust merely to my eye sight alone. my wife became alerted to my agitated demeanor and she secured our binoculars (wide angle 7 x,35, a very good pair)whereupon we both went out onto the deck. the glaring sunset caused no difficulty as the object was below the line of setting and i was able to see it clearly without the sun light glaring into the lenses themselves. \r\nwhat i then saw was tear shaped, with a tail of white smoke that stretched out behind it. now i must reiterate the distance was great enough that even if i had (hypothetically) leapt into my car and driven as fast as i possibly could have to where i estimated this was happening i would have never reached the spot before the incident was over. nevertheless the binoculars revealed, what appeared to me to be, a spot of flames at the center of the tear drop. the object was in steady descent(we could easily gauge it's travel by the distance between the tension wires), with jerking movments to either side. there was a fleeting instant wherein i thought i saw mass within the flaming center- however i would be reluctant to testify to that. the tail of smoke disappeared rapidly as this object descended and finally dipped below the line of trees closest to my home. i should mention that there is farm land across the road and the sighting descended below the tree break line between the fields. \r\ni was very excited. i wanted to call someone, but didn't know who. at this juncture it was approximately 7:30. i paced the living room, glancing outside frequently, when suddenly there appeared to be either another object- same description- or an entirely new one. this second appearance seemed to be lower than when i observed the first and i initially thought that it might be the same object and that it had somehow risen up again in a calculated u flight pattern. this notion seemed rather absurd, so i filed it away and kept watching. once again the object was into a descent. \r\nthen, it simply disappeared, vanished. i mean the tail of smoke, the object itself and all visible traces of it's having been there, completely gone in the blink of an eye (i loathe cliches but there it is nonetheless)as i watched it occur. at this juncture the time was very nearly 8pm. the setting sun made any further observation impossible, however i would go on record as stating that the object and the sunset were initially far enough distant from one another on the horizon that there was no possibility of the two becoming one and the same and so all merely my imagination (of which i freely admit i have ample). i am relatively sure that i saw flames. i am almost positive that i saw something within the entire tear dropped smoke. \r\ni am 52 years old, highly intelligent and a veteran of both the marines and army. i am not prone to hysteria. i have lived here for 9 years and in the lehigh valley for 19. we see planes out here constantly as we are within the flight patterns of lvi airport. this was no plane, unless it were on fire. at one point during the second appearance there also appeared to be a plane moving fast towards the phenomenon, coming from the west. i am certain it was a plane despite the distance because of its shape in my lenses. that too simply vanished. i am more than willing to concede the debatable distance from occurence to my deck, however that was dramatically lessened by the binoculars. the occurence was visible with the naked eye (the plane wasn't), which is what first alerted me to it. however we both saw something unexplainable without further factual input (which i would greatly appreciate to be forthcoming). although we had a very decent digital camera handy, all attempts to zoom in and take photos were thwarted by the sun set glare. we even thought it might be space junk coming down, or even a small meteor, that is until we saw what we believed to be the second object (or the same one rising up and falling all over again). i would dearly appreciate some reconciliation of these sightings at your leisure. i am home all day and relatively easy to get hold of. \r\n                                    sincerely,\r\n                                christopher a. lay\r\n                                 deborah l.
