bound on the indiana 80/90tollway from illinois tristate 294 to a small town in michigan not far from the indiana border. at first i noticed a small white light the size of a beach ball off in the distance low near a water tower. i kept watching it and thought it may be a helicopter or some sort of pole light. i kept wathcing it and it was moving slowly very low. i saw no sudden movements, faa lights, markings, windows, structure. as we got closer to the light i saw it was even with us in the vehicle and i saw the light just slowly move in front of this water tower not far from the tollbooths. as i watched it slowly just disappeared. i did not think more of it. then as we drove and a few several minutes passed i saw a white light low to the ground in the field next to me. i then saw this light move to the tree. again, this object was so low to the ground i could not be an aircraft. again there was no faa lights, markings, structure, noise. i watched and the light just disappeared again. then we were driving through alot of trees as we got out of the heavy trees i saw the full moon with a white light right in front of it on an angle very close to the ground. this light almost looked like it was suntanning itself in front of the moon. both were the same bright white color. please note there also was a planet(venus?) to the right of the moon throughout this whole drive and was basically the same color. but it never moved because it was a planet. this light was a pure pearl white and it was not an advertising light. this time i took pictures with my digital camera of what i could in this moving van. then several minutes later i saw what i can only describe as a bright almost firey orange/red orb that kind of looked bell shaped moving slowly out of nowhere over on the side of the road. i watched and waited for flashing faa lights, noise, structure, sudden movements. again nothing happened except that this light just slowly hovered and went down into the side of the road tree lines. again, i took a picture with my digital camera. then we we somewhere near south bend or mishwaka, mile marker 77 or so. whatever this area it is very residential and commerical. when i looked over the rooftops of the houses from the road i saw what i can only saw what looked like a huge boomerang or triangle type craft hovering right over the rooftops. it seemed to have some sort of tubular metallic structure with several lights of red, green, blue, yellow, orange. this craft was not whole like a commercial airplane, it seemed to be in parts almost like a kids jungle gym. when i saw this i freaked out because it was so low and our car was almost above it on the tollway. it was also so close to us that it thought this cant be unless this plane was crashing. in my mind i think this and then there is another smaller craft next to it about half the size. again, this was too close for another plane to be probably 500 feet and low over the rooftops.It had a similar structure with lights as well. no noise, no flashers, blinkers, windows, markings.I dont remember if i got pictures of this because it happened so suddenly. then as we drove again i saw a firey orange/red bell shaped orb start out of nowhere over from the other side of the road from the traffic on the other side. this orb slowly made its way to my side of the road and then slowly continued to move towards us. then it slowly started to discend into the trees at about mile marker 85. please note pictures were taken by me. the family is used to me taking picture anywhere and anytime so not alot of fuss was made about it. also because we had a handicapped child with us on this trip and could not bring the real attention to the matter except to one other family member who confided in me seeing something as well.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12142,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.3231343,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08202008-0002","longitude":-85.6005643,"occurred":1218856500000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Boomerang,

was in a back room of my house at dusk when i went to the window to draw the curtains, looked up and saw an object hovering, (approximately 40-50 metres) above and behind the house.\r\nthere were children playing outside in the lane and i heard their voices but they were called inside.\r\n immediately i could see this was no normal earthly type of aircraft and that it was an unidentifiable aerial object. it was stationery and silent. it was orange with fire, but it was not on fire as the fire was within it.  the shape was asymmetrical appearing roughly like the side of a van with its side open. i could see movement, possibly figures of about human height, behind the flames. towards the 'back', low down there was a row of deep red lights which moved forward and back repetitively.\r\ni was very excited. i considered going outside but decided not to.\r\n\r\nafter some minutes the object began to move forward (south) for a very short distance then did a right turn, (west). when it turned i was looking at the back and could no longer see the flames. there were coloured lights on the back and i watched it travel slowly across the undulating country. \r\nas it travelled i rang my brother, still watching it, to advise him that it was going towards the town where he lived,  25kms distant.\r\n\r\na wide band of dense cloud had come up from the western horizon and the object went behind this cloud disappearing from view.  \r\n\r\ni made diagrams and a painting of the object. cannot yet discuss the other possible witnesses who were children.\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

every evening at her house and asked if i would be interested in coming over to see for myself. a few days later, i arrived at her home just before dusk as she had told me this event usually occured as it was beginning to get dark. the house had a large yard which was surrounded by woods -- there were no neighbors for quite some distance -- typical in those days for rural ohio. we went outside as it started to get dark -- watching the woods to the right of the house. it was not quite dark (you could still see the outlines of the trees against the sky) when through the woods came a procession of white cigar shaped craft. there were 3 of them -- one behind the other. each was 50-70 feet long and had red, white and blue lights. they were completely silent and had no wings or fins. the angle at which they emerged would suggest that they were coming from a position on or underground. we watched as they slowly flew over the field across from her house and disappeared into the

this is what i got ,,now i did some cut and paste to get a lot of the different shapes colors and sizes on one picture and the only other thing i did was to lighten the pictures and enhance the color that was already there ,,i have all the original pictures and these are all on one and enhanced for easer viewing,,i am long winded ,,sorry anyway i would love to know what you think these might be ,,i have seen the ghost busting shows and there 'orbs' are always white and small these are pretty big and i have never seen an orb other than white .Could these be ufos ,,if so i got a real show for

my mother and her husband walked us out to the car and helped us get our kids in the car seats. we continued to talk in there driveway. my mother and my wife were facing north talking about what ever they were talking about and my mothers husband and i were talking about whatever and him and i were facing south. there is a road that runs east to west right next to thier house. next to that road is a small cornfield. up that road looking west there is a tree line with some woods that runs into the cornfield. i and my mothers husband see a large round bright light slowly hovering west to east over the tree line, over the corn field and stops about 2 stories high right in front of us over the cornfeild. it sat there for at least 45 seconds, made no noise, no sound and all i could see was a round ball of light. it then traveled over the tree line of the corn feild towards town heading south at about 45 miles per hour. this object made no sound. in our town, you do not see planes unless they are real high in the sky. this object ball of light was right in frony of us 20 feet away about 2 stories high.\r\n\r\ni did not see metal, just a bright light. i and 3 other witnesses seen this object, however my wife does not believe in ufo's, however she can not explain what she saw. this area where my mother lives is like the sticks, there is not alot of houses and it was getting late. i never did ask around. i had no idea there was a place to report ufo's or i would have done it 3 years ago right after it happened.\r\n\r\ni felt excited and a little scared, mostly excited. this bright light did not rotate as far as i could see, it reminded me of the size of the sun, but right in front of you. if i was to guess the size of the object if there was an object under that bright light, the light size would be like 3 times smaller than the big ball at epcot, walt disney world.\r\n\r\ni hope this helps. dubuque iowa is not a milatary town, i think we have a reserve national guardd center and you never see helicopters or planes.\r\n\r\nthis was the weirdest thing i ever saw and hope i see it again and hope to take photos next time now that i have at least a cell phone now with a camera.","distance":"20 Feet or Less","duration":"00:01:05","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None,  Unknown","flightPath":"Hovering then path,Path with directional

this is a revised, more detailed version of a sighting i submitted some time ago.\r\n\r\ni once wrote about wanting to see a ufo ���if only to know they existed.��� after what happened some time later, i���ve been wondering if ���they��� heard me.\r\n\r\ni remember that day clearly. it was on july 23, 2008 ��� a beautiful day with a clear blue sky. it was late afternoon and still light outside. i was in the kitchen making dinner and standing over the stove next to the large kitchen window. my husband was in the living room sitting at his computer.\r\n\r\ni glanced out the window and saw a round disk flying slowly over the rooftops of the other apartment buildings. it moved very smoothly and was completely silent -- no engine noise -- nothing. it was made of some kind of white metallic substance that glistened like ice. i���ve never seen that type of metal before. i couldn���t see any windows or who was piloting it. i was surprised but not really afraid. i don���t know why. i just stared at it. there was a soft blue light underneath it that glowed. the blue light shimmered and seemed stronger toward the front of the craft. it passed right above my kitchen window heading in a southern direction. as it passed i saw it join another craft exactly like it. the second one was some distance away at a higher altitude. the first craft joined it and they silently flew side by side in a perfect formation. i watched them until they were far away and disappeared into the horizon. \r\n\r\ni stood in the kitchen for a long time after that. i���m not sure how long. i think i was still in shock. but i wasn't afraid. i don���t know why. after some time (not sure how long) i went into the dining room. i didn���t know how to tell my husband about what i���d just seen. i thought he wouldn���t believe me. i finally did tell him about it. i think he wanted to believe me, but he���s not quite sure what to think. i don���t blame him. i also couldn���t believe it happened.\r\n\r\ni feel i���ve changed since then. i never thought much about life beyond my daily experience, especially not anything about space or ets. that was the stuff of movies. i started reading a lot about other people���s experiences with ufos and about other sightings in different places around the world. i needed information, and some answers. i read that other people have also had similar experiences, and that many of them are also trying to come to terms with it. sometimes when i think back to that day, i can���t believe it. but it was real ��� not a movie. \r\n\r\ni feel more people will begin to see and report ufo sightings. they will continue to increase. it���s as if a global shift is happening. maybe i���m imagining it, but some days i can sense them in my thoughts. i sometimes see fleeting images of them in my head. it���s not a negative feeling. it���s more like thinking about someone you vaguely know. i tend to look up at the sky more often like i���m waiting for something to happen, but i don���t know what. \r\n\r\ni���ve read about people who���ve had experiences similar to mine. they���ve also seen ets but are reluctant to report it or talk about it. i feel their contact with our planet will continue to increase. there���s more discussion about ets now than ever before. it���s as if we���re gradually being prepared to make a quantum leap in our perception of the universe.\r\n\r\n","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"Straight-line

two clouds where one was bigger than the other on top of this lime plant close to pleasant gap.  i really did not think nothing about it.  i thought maybe it was lightening but i noticed it did not move.  on top of it not moving, it also started to shoot colorful lights from it like a boomerang shape.  so i do not know the shape of it because it was hiding behind the 2 clouds but it went back and forth from the shaping of the lights coming out of the clouds.  i did not know what happened to the lights because i was traveling in a main highway.  i was at least on the highway for at least 5 minutes.  these light in the clouds would show for 20 seconds and then vanish then reapear a minute later.  i lost sight of it when i got off the bellefonte 2nd exit. \r\ni thought it was crazy

husband to come ouy with me which he does but this time i told him he didn't have to but like a good husband he came out.We went out to the back yard i looked up didn't see anything so i went out further and then a plane went by and we heard that, then this bright light the size of a plane but no wings went over closer than the plane no noise then as we were looking it just got so bright like when a star shines it just went bigger with the bright light and was so bright then it went back to just a bright light no extra colors was long it headed north and then it disapeared as it went north.It was faster than a plane not like a jet nor a helicopter cause we see these all the time cause we live close to the airport.I thought at first it was a plane but no colored lights my husband told me that all this time he thought i was crazy going out to look up but now he believes we saw a ufo. we have seen the spacestation, this was closer much closer. what made us think it was a ufo was because when it went brighter it stopped and just stayed there for a few seconds maybe a minute.We are just so shocked and thrilled at the same time.I was hoping that it would come back so stayed outside for awhile then went in and went to bed.I hope other people saw it. it was strange it happened at 9:45pm august 18 2008.Please check this out as my husband said i should report it to the police but i was kinda stupid saying i would wait for someone else to report it first.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

the record, i wasn't even \"ufo hunting\".  i'm not even sure of the photo i have...\r\n\r\n  it was hot, very hot that morning and colleagues of mine were conducting a training exercise for some us army national guard, us marines, and republic of georgia military forces at a range nearby to vasiani airbase, republic of georgia.  i was in fact focused on the training at hand and was using my camera as a training aid to point out potential strengths and weaknesses of any particular units maneuver techniques.\r\n  this all goes very well and i end up with roughly 200 photos or so over the course of a week and a half. (yes, this was just prior to the little spat between georgia and russia - we were complete with training only 3 days prior to the whole fanfare...)\r\n  these photos fly home with me to germany where i am stationed and i think little of them, planning to discard the photos that didn't turn out so well and toss the rest in a folder on a hardrive for historical records.\r\n  while reviewing the photos, i come across one in particular with what appears to be a blemish on the lens (it may yet turn out to be that, but read on...)  thinking that the lens must have had a dirt smudge or something on it, i scan through to the next few photos in that set and find nothing out of the ordinary.  so i go back to this blemished photo and begin to analyze what i am seeing.\r\n  the picture was taken from a canon powershot sd1000, 7.1 mpix. at maximum resolution (i have a 2gb storage card, so who cares how big the photos are...I like the detail).  this allowed me to zoom in and at least try to see if any more detail could be revealed.  of course, i was disappointed to see nothing but a gray cigar shaped blob with a samll roundish bulb above and below its shape.\r\n  zooming out from the photo, you will se that the foreground is clear and in focus but this object is still fuzzy.  i swear to myself that it must have been a bug or something crossing the fov, but wouldn't it be a little clearer in focus?\r\n  or maybe it is in the background but moving so fast that it is out of focus?  i'm not sure.  i will rule out low and slow aircraft because the area you see in the picture is a \"live fire range\" (shooting range) and forthe army, firing live ammo is not allowed when the potential to harm is evident.  so this area has been given a green light be the powers that be for us to conduct training with live ammunition.  this means...You guessed it...Nothing downrange (that we know of).\r\n  anyway, you have a look at it, disseminate it, spread it around.\r\na few questions come to mind when i look at this:  if it is far enough away to be blurry, just how big is it?  if it isn't far away, why then is it blurry?  it looks close, but there is no shadow cast.  i've lived in a desert for nearly 7 years and i understand how distances can be deceptive - but if this thing is maybe 5-10 miles (my somewhat educated guess) it has to be huge and moving very swiftly (and silently) for no one to take any particular notice.\r\n  i try to be a skeptic about photos, but as i took this one myself, i have trouble believing what i am seeing.  let better minds than mine come up with an explanation.  i want to think \"spacecraft\", but the little voice is saying \"bird\"...\r\n\r\n\r\nincluded are photos of area taken seconds apart (all three are part of the set)\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nglen currier\r\nsfc\r\nus army","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:00:10","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12115,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":41.712591,"location":null,"logNumber":"GE-08182008-0005","longitude":44.799628,"occurred":1216139400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Tbilisi","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1216139400000,"summary":"There was no \"event\"","tags":["none"],"timeZone":"Europe/Budapest","timeZoneName":"Europe/Budapest","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12115_submitter_file1__IR08Range720080715-Objectinskybackgroundandsubsequentphotos.JPG","http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/12115_submitter_file2__IR08Range720080715-Objectinskybackgroundandsubsequentphotos(2).JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Tbilisi, Tbilisi","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:344023"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Waukegan","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"My brother rick reported sightings at night (large transparent and dark)and during the daytime (silver spheres)over waukegan.  you will have to contact him for specifics.
