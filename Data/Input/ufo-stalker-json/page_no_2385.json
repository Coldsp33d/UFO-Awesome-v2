the back patio to smoke.  i was looking at the stars and a very strange looking one got my attention.  i pointed at it and asked my girlfriend to tell me if there was anything strange about it she could see.  we both agreed that it was flashing green, red, blue and yellow.  we took a few pictures but can't see much because of the shakiness of our hands.  after about ten minutes of watching i walked to my brothers house to borrow a pair of binoculars.  he agreed that the star did seem peculiar and that it indeed seemed to flash different colors.  on the walk back to my girlfriends house i noticed that not only in the western sky but also in the south there was another of the same flashing stars.  with the same colors.  once i returned (gone aprox. 5 minutes)  we decided to sit on a hill next to our apartment building and watch for a while.  after aprox 10 minutes of nothing special happening. 2 jets flying too close to be civilian (in my opinion) flew east to west.  10 minutes after that a medium sized triangular (solid) object with 2 red lights on the back 2 corners (flashing) and a green flashing light in front flew east to southwest.  along with the previous lights mentioned.  i looked through the binoculars and could see that the interior of the craft was illuminated with a yellow light and that on top was a pole with a very very bright blueish/white flashing strobe.  the object flew at a moderate pace and made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  the triangle was in sight appoximately 1 1/2 - 2 minutes until we lost sight of it as it flew over the treeline.  5 minutes later as we were about to call it a night (one of the flashing starlike objects had disapeared over the treeline, however there was the original remaining)  we both seen a bright yellowish flash that was about the size of an aspirin.  as i told my g/f to take a picture it quickly dimmed and became very very small.  almost a pin-point sized yellow light and began floating to the right (east/north?)  after this a couple minutes later another jet just like the previous 2 flew east to west leaving a visible contrail.  5 minutes later we went inside and i recorded everything i had seen in writing.  that is all that i have to tell about it at the moment.  i dont believe i have left anything out but if something important does come to mind i will contact you.  i have no problems giving you a statement or anything that you may need.  i want to know the truth of whats going on with these crafts!  thank you for giving me a place to tell my story.\r\nsincerely,\r\nkevin","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

between old sauk rd. & greenway blvd. exits. the object piqued our curiosity enough to track it down. we drove through the nearby neighborhoods to locate a \"source\" on the ground and came upon a small neighborhood park (wexford park, madison, wi) where we parked almost directly beneath the object. we parked past the turn-around on the corner of n. westfield rd. & sawmill road facing north/northwest. the object was metallic in color, totally stationary and silent. it's metallic surface was darker in color and kind of shiny with the setting sun reflecting off on some parts. we looked around the general area where there were a few kids on bikes that rode by and seemed to not notice anything out of the ordinary. we thought it had to be some kind of kite or balloon but could not see any strings. after taking several photographs and with the lack of any attention we decided to leave.\r\n\r\nwe hadn't thought much of the sighting since until recently after sharing photographs with family. this evening we were then directed to view a similar object from sweden via a youtube video (http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=khyrgnp_uvk) which exhibits the exact same stationary behavior (the vehicle and video camera move but the object remains completely stationary), no visible source above, below or to the sides of the object.\r\n\r\nwe have a total of 19 photos of the object. the photographs show some slight angle differences which is due to moving the vehicle or to shifting inside of the passenger seat of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nwe're now kicking ourselves after seeing the sweden video since we left the object and didn't return to take video or use a better camera  to document (we used the iphone built-in camera).","distance":"21-100

vacationing in northern minnesota.\r\n\r\nwe had started our day getting our 27��� rv readied for the trip; we were first going to spend a couple days at a friend���s cabin in the isabella, mn. area and then i was intent on taking her to a spot i had camped in for years spending several days there just enjoying the remote calmness of the great northwoods.\r\nas per usual, we found ourselves leaving much later in the day than we should have  and knowing we had to get to our first destination before nightfall as the area was more familiar to me during the day and i wanted to avoid driving around up there after dark.\r\nwe made it close to our destination as it was getting on towards dusk  and i decided to take a ���shortcut��� i had vaguely remembered in an effort to save time, i have only used this route a couple of times and only during the day. needless to say, we missed a turn and got semi ��� lost. having no map readily available, i decided to head back for the hiway and take my original route.\r\nwe finally got back to the highway about 45 minutes later and found our way back to our original route. by this time it was almost completely dark, only the last bit of orange sunlight left on the horizon which was rapidly giving way to a beautiful starry night that is one of the draws for me to the northwoods.\r\nunfortunately i didn���t document the event as it was happening so i���m not too sure of the exact area we are in at the time. \r\nthe event started as i was driving along guessing we had about 45 minutes to go before we got to the cabin. i noticed a round yellow / orange light to my left out the driver���s side window of our class ���c��� motor home, for those who don���t know the difference, a class ���a��� motor home looks like a box and a class ���c��� has a front end like a truck or van with a sleeper above the cab or drivers compartment.  \r\nthe light i was observing while trying to drive was larger than a star and about half the size that the full moon would generally appear on a night with no rain in site. i didn���t really think a lot of what i was looking at until i started making a gradual right turn to follow the road we were on. normally when you are looking at something out the left window and you start turning to the right the object in the window will move out of your view and behind you but in this case the object itself seemed to vanish before i completed the direction change and reappeared in front of us viewable through the upper right portion of the windscreen at a distance of approximately 500 ft.\r\nmy wife had taken notice of the object at the same time as i was pointing it out to her and she actually had a better view of it than i did as i was still trying to pay attention to the road and pull over and shut off the motor to better observe it.\r\nat first after pulling over i watched for a few seconds to half a minute and decided that what i was watching was fireworks, just the plain yellow type like a mortar since the object seemed to be moving upwards towards an apex before descending. the object moved fairly slowly in its climb and then started a descent making a zigzag pattern leaving a brilliant trail of light in its wake. by this time i seriously doubted that i was watching fireworks and instead thought it might be a helicopter but quickly ruled that out since we were several miles from any kind of real civilization and with the windows down we literally heard no sound other than the usual sounds you would hear such as crickets.\r\nthe object continued to stay in its general location referenced by the windscreen as we sat quietly watching it make several moves to the right, left, up and down.  after about 10 minutes of this the object rose slowly and gracefully for a bit and what seemed to resemble sparks shot out of the top of the object and reconnect with it, then it started to move away but also seemed to vanish before it would have moved out of view, this seemed to be the end of the show  and we started up and slowly pulled away from our spot on the side of the road and out of the bottom right corner of the windscreen i observed a very small light closer to dark orange or red in color shoot off  towards the top left of the windscreen at a very high rate of speed  i guess it would have resembled a tracer round and moved as fast. i also remember getting a feeling that it was gone.\r\nthis was the last we saw of the object and we proceeded to enjoy a wonderful week in the northwoods without further incident. it was kind of funny, during the entire episode all i was thinking in my head was ���i don���t have time for this��� we only had a short time to be there and i didn���t want to spend it dealing with something like an abduction or missing time. also, i���m not sure what kept me from actually getting out of the motor home and getting a better look but i was compelled to stay right where i was. i had a camera but i didn���t think of it at the time plus i was too busy staring at the object and my adrenaline was flowing.\r\nmy wife has always been a skeptic and i was glad she had an opportunity to see this. i���m not sure if she���s a total convert or not but she got a better show than i did and seems to now believe.\r\nwe have since relocated to the general area of the sighting and have been fortunate enough to have a few other sightings but nothing like this.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,

of east providence, rhode island.  i was completing a lap around the track, when i noticed a black sphere approaching from the south west and traveling in a north easterly direction.\r\n\r\ni stopped walking and paused to see what type of bird, plane, rocket or ballon. as i was looking at this thing i was trying to figure out what it could be.  it took me about 10 seconds to rule out an eagle or hawk, and another 15 seconds to rule out a ballon, and as the sphere go closer it was obvious that it wasn't a helicopter, there was no thumphing sound or loud turbine sound, the object did make a sound but it wasn't a sound that i can reference to anything i have heard before.\r\n\r\nthe sphere was travelling at a speed around 250 miles per hour and it was travelling in a horizontal linear path.  the black metallic sphere was traveling below cloud cover and at an attitude that i have commonly seen commercial airplanes taking when they pass over east providence and heading to green air port in warwick rhode island.  \r\n\r\nas i \r\nas the sphere was approaching it appeared to pass over the adjacent ball fields of providence country day school, as such the sphere had to pass over the pawtucket ave and waterman ave intersection, pawtucket ave is a north to south ave and waterman ave intersects pawtucket ave in an east to west  direction.\r\n\r\nafter the black metallic sphere passed over the providence country day fields in passed directly over the east providence base ball field which is situated immediately south of the foot ball field and track.  as i was standing on the track i could clearly see the object as a solid metallic sphere that appeared to be black, could have been dark grey.\r\n\r\nthe metallic sphere appeared to be travelling under intelligent control.\r\nthe metallic sphere travelled in a linear path, it didn't veer left or right.  there was no vapor trail behind the object, and there were no wings  or anything projecting from the sphere.\r\n\r\nin terms of size the metallic sphere was a little bigger than a drum on a cement truck, for example the cylinder on a cement truck that is the container for  cement/concrete.\r\n\r\nthe metallic sphere passed high over the trees on the first base side of the east providence base ball field, as it did you could see the sun reflect off the top of the sphere and the top of the sphere reflected the sun light with a mirror type of reflection, the sun rerlecting off of the metallic sphere last a few seconds.\r\n\r\nthe sphere continued travelling in a north eastern direction over commerical way and headed in the direction of taunton ave (rte 44).\r\n\r\ni proceeded to walk around the track and comptemplating what i just saw and was considering the possibilities.  after 15 minutes had elapsed since the metallic sphere passed over head, a commerical airliner was passing over head in and heading in a south westerly trek, basically flying pass the same area that the metallic sphere had been seen give or take 200-300 yards or so.  the commerical airliner was silver in color and had a  red color horzontial stripe running the lenght the the plane, this appeared to be a 747.\r\n\r\nwould say that the airliner passed over the school grounds between 1:30-1:40. \r\n\r\nthere is a national guard branch that is situated adjacet to green air port in warwick rhode island.  maybe the metallic sphere is some sort of national guard drone performing some kind of surveilance mission? i would like to know what this could have been.  certaintly someone else should have seen this sphere, there were plenty of cars on the road when i left the high school parking lot it was a beautiful saturday and people were no doubt around and about.

couch and i went ahead upstairs to let our 2 dogs out. there was what seemed to be a full moon, although it may have acutally been the full moon the night before. either way, it was very bright out. it was a clear and cool morning in licking county (newark, oh) and i was looking, as i usually do when i let the dogs out before bed, out into the night sky. i usually scan the sky and star gaze while waiting for the dogs to return. because of the clear and cool weather i stood with the door open. \r\n\r\nour property has an unobstructed view of the sky except for a row of pine trees on the east that separates us and our neighbors. through the opening in the trees i notice a bright light. it was so bright it caught my eye and i looked towards it. at first, i thought it was a plane and took a double take to see which way it was headed, yet it didn't move. i thought it looked to bright to be a star, and it was then i stepped out to investigate further. upon stepping onto the back patio, i moved to where the pine tree line was no longer interfering in the line of sight. \r\n\r\nat this point a bright flash came off the object and i could see very clearly red, white and blue lights rotating on what seemed to be a disc like object. unable to believe what i was seeing, i ran back in and shouted down to my husband to come up. i told him to look up in the sky and tell me what he saw. about 20 minutes had elapsed at this point and the object was spinning and flashing, but it didn't move until my husband appeared. at this point, approximately 1 am, the object began quickly zig zagging back and forth in the sky and it would then stop briefly and hover. my husband when inside to get a camera and a telephoto lense to see if we could see it closer. during the 3 minutes or so while he was away, there were three streaks of light. two streaks of light seemed to \"drip\" off the object. there was about ten seconds between each drip. they fell straight down and then about 5 seconds after the second drip straight down, another shot off the right side of the object.\r\n\r\ni shouted for my husband to hurry back. he came running out and held the telephoto lense up on the camera for us to look through--but he couldn't get the full charged camera to work. the lenns did make the shape of the object and the colors even clearer. i was stunned at what i was seeing. i am definately a skeptic. i've always believed there is something perhaps we can't explain and thought there may very well be someplace in the vastness of this universe or another that something may exist. but never ever in my wildest dreams did i think i'd bare witness to it! my husband on the other hand was thrilled, as he is quite a believer in ufos. i honestly was sure when i originally called him up that he was going to tell me it was a plane or have some other logical explaination because i just couldn't believe what i was seeing was real. \r\nwe both quickly realized there was no other explaination. \r\n\r\nhe tried to take photos of the object while i continued to watch it. until approximately 1:30am, this object stayed relatively stationary apart from the odd zig zag pattern. then about 1:40 am there was a point of light travelling out from behind our neighbors to the north's tree line--approximately 1000 feet from where we were standing. it moved upwards and sideways to the northeast towards the first object we'd seen. it took approximately 30-40 minutes to reach the first object. the second object we dicovered up looking through the lens was also flashing red white and blue. once it got within what seemed like a fingers width (from where we were orientated) there was a bright flash and they were both gone.\r\n\r\ni watched stunned and shocked at what i'd just seen and how long it lasted. with being a skeptic, i wasn't sure if what i'd just seen was a normal sighting or something quite extraordinary since it lasted so long. either way, for me personally, it was extraordinary, because i would have never thought such a thing would happen to me. i definately didn't feel scared. i was more curious and like i said, shocked, to believe this was actually what i thought it was.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with

area, at close to 6:00pm. as i got to the parking lot exit, i was facing north. that is when my attention was brought to what appeared at first to be a meteor, exploded plane, missile, or some such thing falling from the sky, about 45 degrees to my left, being northeast of my position. initially, it was quite alarming to me because of the all the possibilities of what it might be, none of them good.\r\n\r\na cold winter storm had just passed through, and low, dark, broken clouds from the tail end of the storm were present. clouds were low and broken, but air was very clear.\r\n\r\nas i watched, it deduced from the path, speed, and size that the object would almost certainly hit the ground, in a heavily poulated urban area. i first saw the object come down at a steep angle well above the clouds, and expected to see it punch through the clouds and hit the ground. my mind went through the short list of things it could be. i hoped it was not a ballistic missile, as it might be the last thing i would ever see. i hoped it was not a plane that had exploded, or a large meteorite. the object entered the top of some cold, thick, dark scud clouds, but instead of punching through and continuing on to hit the ground, it instantaneously stopped cold, just at or below the bottoms of the clouds. at that point i knew i was definitely not seeing a meteor, plane, or missile. nothing moving that fast, falling from the sky stops on a dime and just hovers like that.\r\n\r\nas i watched, the object began to appear larger, perhaps hundreds of feet across, and glow brilliantly with a most pure light. it appeared huge, because it was miles away, appearing in the northeast, approximately over the hills north of fullerton, or over brea. almost instantly, what i thought was one object, appeared to become two. it seems like the second one very quickly joined the first, but i do not recall seeing but one object falling, trailing what appeared to be flames, or glowing plasma.\r\n\r\nas i watched in amazement, an airplane and a helicopter quickly converged on the objects. the speed at which they did this was uncanny, almost like they knew it was coming. but maybe they just happened to be right there, as the skies in this area are always quite busy. the airplane then arrived on the scene and circled the two objects very closely, while the hleicopter stood off a bit further away, bobbing and weaving about, also investigating. i would think that both the plane and the helicopter pilots must have gotten very good, up-close looks at these objects, and probably photos and/or video. i was amazed by how tight the circles were that the airplane was able to execute, and how much larger the objects appeared to be than the plane. i estimate that the objects were at least 5 times bigger, or more, than the wingspan of the plane.\r\n\r\nthe whole bizarre affair, the two brilliant, large, hovering objects, the circling plane, and the inquisitive helicopter all started moving slowly to the northeast, against prevailing winds, and moved below my sightline until they were obscured by buildings and trees in my location. i decided then to give chase, zig zag my way across town, and try to keep the objects in view for as long as possible. i got onto tustin ave, headed north, went left on la palma, west, to miller, where i went right, north, to orangethorpe, and headed west again a mile or two. i estimate my travel at 3 miles. i managed to keep them in view most of the time, but had to stop at a traffic light on orangethorpe.\r\n\r\nstopped at the light with my head and shoulders sticking out of the window of my car, looking over the roof, i watched the objects simply blink out, like someone turning off a light switch. the impression i had was that they had actually left the scene at incredible speed, making them appear to simply blink out and literally disappear. \r\n\r\nthe plane that was circling them did one or two more circles, but there was nothing there anymore to see, so it, and the helicopter both broke off their investigations. the plane headed southeast, and by chance, flew directly over me at a fairly low altitude. it appeared to be a medium sized twin engine jet. it was low enough for it's underside to be dimly illuminated by the glow from the city lights. it may have been military, but i cannot say with any certainty.\r\n\r\ni said nothing to anyone for 3-4 day, until i saw a large number of reports of the same exact incident being posted online, on brian vike's website. i then posted my initial report there. i was amazed at how consistent al lthe reports were, and how they all described exactly what i witnessed. brian vike contacted me and we have spoken on two occassions since. i have not spoken and have never met any of the other witnesses.\r\n\r\ni would thinlk that it would be of paramount importance to get the radar data and flight plans of any aircraft in the area to determine exactly who was flying the plane and the helicopter that were involved in this sighting, and to verify the plane circling the objects, if not the objects themselves. it would be great to identify and interview the pilots, and see if they have any photos or video. i am not aware of any pilots filing any reports, so whoever they are, to my knowledge, they have yet to come forward and tell what they saw, up close and personal.\r\n\r\na foia for the radar data and all flight plans putting aircraft in that area at that time are in order. the plane and helicopter should have had transponders, because of the heavy air traffic in the area and proximity to fullerton and the main approach to john wayne airports.","distance":"Over One

88th avenue.  i stopped at stop light and noticed a round, silver metallic vehicle which was sitting in a cemetary (bethania or ressurection, not sure of name).  it appeared to be approzimately 25 feet or so in diameter and about 7 feet tall.  it had a middle section which was flat and raised and had probably a dozen white lights about 1 ft. in diameter which appeared to be pulsing constantly.  as there were no other vehicles on the road which i noticed at the time, i was alarmed by what i saw and didn't stop again when the street light turned green.  i left the scene and continued another few miles to my residence in burbank, il.  i did pay attention the next day when i went to work and saw that the grassy area where i saw the vehicle parked appeared to have a black, oily or charred appearance as if the area was burned up.  the shape of the area was definitely round and for at least another dozen years the grass never changed appearance which has led me to think that the area must have been chemically altered in some fashion.  i always look at the spot whenever i happen to be in the area and since the event, i believe it has been paved.  i will always be sorry because i never attempted to call the cemetary's management to relate these details to them.  i would like to say that in this small area of the cemetary, i have never seen any gravesites as it is in the northeast corner of the highway.  i also need to elaborate on the fact that the vehicle was within 100 feet of me so i could see it very plainly even though it was about 3 am and fairly dimly lit.  my belief has always been that it was probably in that exact spot because of possible examination of recently deceased humans.","distance":"21-100

grass), i felt an urge to look up, and when i did, i saw a very large triangular object hovering motionless immediately overhead.  there were no lights on the object, it was gray in color, the bottom surface appeared to cover a maze of  pipes or something, and it made a ocellateing sound, something similar to an electric motor. i immediately thought of something that was other worldly. it was not a plane or helicopter, it was the largest thing i have ever seen in the sky, other than moons or planets. it scared me and when i spoke of it to the lady i was with, she said with a calmness that upsets me now when i think of it, \"don't get excited.\"  those words chilled me, and i sat back down and looked up again immediately, and the object just flew away without making another sound, and it was gone in an instant.  what is even more disturbing, is the fact that my lady friend and i never spoke of the incident, not to this day.  in fact we hardly spoke at all that night, not during the

onto my imac computer using garageband when i looked out to see an airplane going in a south to north track.  we live about ten miles from detroit metro airport, so this is not unusual.  what was unusual was i saw two metallic silver balls circling the aircraft at about one thousand feet from it.  the airplane was roughly three thousand feet in the sky, and the two silver craft were looping around it in a smooth, effortless oval/circular pattern. i could not tell the size of the craft.  all of the sudden, the two silver metallic crafts stopped moving and hovered completely still for about thirty seconds.  i called my fiance jessica from my cell phone that was on my desk because i needed to know if she had the digital camera on her.  she did, and was shopping about three miles away from our house.  i did not take my eyes off of the crafts.  she said that she had it with her, and my blackberry 8830 worldphone does not have a camera built in. we hung up and she headed home home. i walked outside of my house into the backyard and they were still stationary.\r\n\r\nthe sky was clear blue with no clouds in i, and the two silver craft started to move slowly toward the detroit river, which is east from the first location i saw them.  one of the crafts started to circle the other craft at a medium rate of speed, taking about twenty seconds to complete one revolution.  after about a minute of this, the moving crafts speed increased until it took about five seconds to complete the rotation.  it did three more rotations, and they merged into one object.  a second object, a white cylinder appeared and was flying sideways toward it.  it then increased in speed and then shot away in less than one second.\r\n\r\ni felt warmth and heard a high pitched hum in my body, like i was being scanned.  i have felt this before on my second sighting about twenty years ago.  it is not a comfortable feeling at all.\r\n\r\nthe silver craft hovered motionless for about thirty more seconds, and started to move in a south easterly path. there were some birds that flew over, and justified that what i was looking at was not a bird.  the craft started to pick up speed, and slowly headed south over the wyandotte shores golf course, and vanished.  my fiance returned home about thirty seconds later, and we looked for them for a few minutes, to no avail.\r\n\r\nthese craft looked like the craft that jose escamilla showed in his film \"the greatest story ever denied\", when he was demonstrating how today's cameras can see ufo's using a simple night shot on during the daytime.\r\n\r\nthis was my fifth sighting in my life.  the first in 1978 here in wyandotte at the same location.  the second was in 1989 in coldwater michigan over coldwater lake, michigan where multiple people saw an orange cylinder hovering over the lake at 1:00am. the third was in 2003 in australia when i was on the live aboard dive boat \"mike ball's spoilsport\" where multiple people saw a green horseshoe shaped craft come out of the water at a very high rate of speed and shot up into space. the fourth sighting happened in october of 2007 again at my coldwater lake cottage where my friend bill, my fiance jessica, and myself witnessed an orange teardrop shaped object split into as many as four parts, and then merged back together, and disappeared after twenty minutes into the distance.\r\n\r\n","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":12096,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.2199764,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08162008-0009","longitude":-83.1403739,"occurred":1218913560000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Michigan","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cylinder,

bright object appeared seemingly out of nowhere like a flash bulb that didn't turn off.  in a matter of seconds it seemed to accelerate??? climbing a few degrees higher and vanished ( no joke, i���m a skeptic and show me the evidence science kind of guy, but think sci-fi movie where object appears in and out of warp speed as it jumps, sorry, only sane way i can even describe it).  this object was twice if not three times the size and brightness off the scale of any planet or star we've ever observed in the idaho night sky.  wife has a slightly different interpretation seeing it a fraction of a second before i did and said it seemed to pulse in spurts then accelerate and vanish.  no noise, no afterburner, if landing lights from a plane, object was moving in the opposite direction (seen landing lights come into and out of view, a much slower event).  no red or green nav lights, just incredibly bright white orb that seemed to come out of nowhere. a plane flew over the house a minute later confirming the extreme difference with what we had just witnessed.  we stared dumb founded and afterwards looked at each other in disbelief.  we have seen both military (gowen field, mountain home air base) and commercial (boise) aircraft fly over the house for many years and this was like nothing we'd ever seen before.  read recent reports before filing this.  i was struck by a few that were very similar particularly with��� 2008-08-11 bright round white light flashed only once among the stars. mn, us���.  i don���t know what we saw, but it was no aircraft i���ve ever seen nor was it

move in the zig-zag like movement in the same direction, and came to a stop after 2 minutes. the object was stationary for about 5 minutes, then it started moving in a straight line in a westward direction. after the initial movement again, is proceeded to make a 180 degree turn in the opposite direction in a semi circular like fashion and proceeded to continue in a east direction for 2 in a half minutes, almost to where it initially was to begin with. at this time, the pump trucks had arrived and my star gazing was interrupted, as i had to continue on with my work day. i wanted to write
