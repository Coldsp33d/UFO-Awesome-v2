left the town of perrysburg heading east on rte. 795 when i happened to glance up at the sky, as it was a full moon out and a storm had just passed. i was checking to see if there were any more dark clouds when all of a sudden, off in the direction of the northeast, i saw what i originally thought was a cluster of three stars, placed close together in a straight line. this had piqued my curiosity because i had never seen anything like that before. i continued to drive, periodically glancing up at the sky and noticing that the object did not move. it remained in my field of vision for about 6 miles until i turned off the highway onto an exit ramp. i continued to look at the object through the rearview mirror as i was now heading south down a country road. as i pulled into the subdivision that i lived in, i happened to look back to the northeast- but instead of the three star-like objects, there appeared a large object, shaped almost like a blimp, with five or six white lights making the outline of the object and three red lights in the center of the white ones. i followed the object as it moved east to west at what i would guess to say would be about 50 miles per hour had it been traveling on the ground. i lost sight of the object as it passed over the nearby train yard on the other side of the road, as my view of the sky to the west is obscured by the trains and a grove of trees nearby.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:05:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Straight-line

looking.... then plain as day a perfectly round flat looking object flew directly overhead quickly, followed by two more of the same looking objects. they were low enough to clearly see that they were not birds or even an owl. they appeared to be a light tan color with no lights and made no sound, the strangest thing of all was the in which they were moving, its a little hard to explain but it

like lemmings, millions of them will die following each other to their doom. the question is, will you read this book or follow the lemmings? \r\n\r\nusing irrefutable logic author--commercial fisherman captain, henry kroll was the first to plot our sun's course through space from orion to hercules to discover when and how we got captured by the sirius and procyon star cluster that is over a billion years older than our sun. our close proximity to these giant stars imparted additional light and heat to earth taking it out of a billion-year-long ice age. \r\n\r\nit took the power of a white dwarf star putting out hundreds of times more ultraviolet light than our sun to break through early earth's 1,450 pound per square-inch atmosphere which was 33% carbon dioxide and start the plant plankton growing on the surface of the oceans. \"and the spirit of god moved upon on the face of the waters.\" seven-hundred-million years of photosynthesis took earth's atmosphere down to 14.5 pounds per square inch giving us free oxygen, coal, oil and limestone. \r\n\r\nglobal warming is about the government forcing you to have fewer children, live in a smaller house, drive a smaller car, restrict your diet and travel to keep you burning oil forever. global warming is about your enslavement! it has nothing to do with the environment. we may be doing the wrong thing by restricting carbon emissions! the carbon dioxide content of our atmosphere was taken down from 33% to .033%. without carbon dioxide plants won't grow and all life on earth will die! earth is loosing its atmosphere. you got to buy this book!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthor biographical note250 words:\r\n\r\n\r\nhenry kroll is a boat captain, navigator, lecturer, aviator, gold miner, commercial fisherman, engineer, entrepreneur, concert pianist, writer and founder of the center higher consciousness. his irrefutable logic and comprehensive research produced many original ideas that will fund major universities with grant proposals into the next century. his books offer viable solutions to altering societal evolution into a more benign direction by raising human consciousness. instead of killing off six billion people to re-wild the planet as some academics suggest henry says we should be getting off the planet to colonize life in other star systems. this book promotes the awareness of cosmic events that could exterminate us and offers viable solutions.\r\n\r\n\"people ask me how i am able compute stellar orbits when our best scientists on earth can't figure it out. our best scientists haven't navigated at night in rough seas in near zero visibility for twenty years using radar, compass bearings and loran c to locate strings of king crab pots.\"\r\n\r\nmost scientists refuse to look outside our solar system for other sources of light and heat and they don't think about the other light spectrums.\" the authors discovered that it took the power of a white dwarf to pierce early earth's 1450 pounds per square inch atmosphere to start plant growth in the oceans.\r\n\r\nbrad guth is one of the smartest men on the planet-so smart that ordinary mortals can not carry on a conversation with him. anything you say will sound like childish gibberish to him. most of brad's ideas are so outrageously true that nobody can refute them. brad is self employed designing and rebuilding electronic circuitry for boats and aircraft.\r\n\r\nif only ten percent of this book is true then a hundred-thousand scientists and engineers around the world will have to revise all their books and papers. we furnish original material for graduate students to write their doctorial thesis and fund major universities into the next century. \r\n\r\nin order to become conscious humankind needs to know who they are, where they are going and where they are coming from. this book explains and outlines a plan for taking control of our destiny. if we wait for the government-funded scientists to do it, it will never happen. this book is a logical progression of understanding and we encourage people to do the math along with us so that they know we are correct.\r\n\r\nthe authors discovered that global warming propaganda is about the government forcing you to have fewer children, live in a smaller house (tent or yurt), drive a smaller car, restricting your diet and keep you burning coal, oil and gas until there is no oxygen left. we need to start using more hydroelectric, wind, geothermal and solar power that doesn't consume oxygen. carbon dioxide is plant food. without it everything dies! global warming is about your enslavement! \r\n\r\nyou can't drive a car without a neutron star!\r\n\r\nphilosopher's stone\r\n\r\na technology so advanced it is indistinguishable from magic.\r\n\r\nthe philosopher's stone, also known as orme gold or hebrew mfkzt powder may be the most important discovery of the human race since fire!\r\n\r\nten years ago i wrote a book on the philosopher's stone which has the power to raise our intelligence hundreds of iq points and enable you to live hundreds of years. since then i have revised the book by adding the recipes which show how to make it. i took four years to write it and another two years to decide to put the recipes in the book. i was concerned with what mankind would do with this sacred information. \r\n\r\nthis white-powder-of-gold material was recently discovered to be in the air we breathe and the water we drink. it is a state of matter that is a room temperature superconductor and has inter-dimensional and antigravity properties. it is known as ���orme' gold (orbitally rearranged monatomic elements). currently teams of scientists around the world in china, japan, united states and germany are studying this material to get a jump-start on the technology. ormes increases the efficiency of fuel cells, solar cells and is necessary for cell division in all living things. half of the periodic table of elements can exist in the orme state. it will be a few more years before they discover the incredible information and communication capability of orme atoms.\r\n\r\nafter i wrote philosophers stone sir laurance gardner and william henry went to egypt and made more discoveries about the ark of the covenant. according to drawings in the temple at abadose there was a pillar or antenna-like device attached to the top of the ark. when the orme material inside was activated, instead of the shikanna glory appearing the antenna focused a beam of inter-dimensional power strait up creating a wormhole in space. anyone standing near the device was transported to wherever the anunnaki had another such device set up-most likely on their home planet in the sirius star system or possibly even the pleiades. a picture of this device can be seen on william henry's web site at http://www.Williamhenry.Net/.\r\n\r\nking solomon owned a front-porch twenty stories high that housed a pillar to drill holes in space. the men who used this device were the homo christos or homo angelis. the ancient illuminate (el-beings of light) could travel back and forth between worlds and transport whole populations of people, sheep, cattle and other livestock with this simple device. ea and enki started the first mystery schools. \r\n\r\nwilliam henry says that at the time of jesus there were many god men or light men all over egypt. jesus learned many of his skills from them. he also spent many years in india learning the secrets of the mystery schools. there are many more books about jesus in india than any place else. their goal was to bring forth the message encoded in your dna.\r\n\r\nin the temple at abadose the egyptian god set is portrayed as bringing osirus back from the dead using a wand or rod. the wand is a branch from the tree of life (some kind of remote control device) which energizes your dna.\r\n\r\nrecent research into the white-powder-of-gold show that there is a considerable quantity of it in the air we breathe. the ozone generator air-filters that you plug into your home, which collect dirt and pollen also collect gray-white, goo. when you touch it, it disappears because it responds to the electric charge of your finger. since there is so much of it in the air maybe it offers an explanation of why athletes can lift more after taking a breath and holding it. oxygen from air takes several minutes to get into the blood stream so it isn't oxygen. are orme atoms being absorbed by the olfactory nerves directly? \r\n\r\nit is used to increase the electrical output of fuel cells. it increases the output of solar cells. it is used by the cells of both plants and animals to super-conduct electricity during cell division. if you mix it with water and pour it on your plants in increases their growth. it cures all disease by correcting dna. eating it rebuilds your dna to that of a twenty-year-old. it can extend increase you intelligence hundreds of iq points and your life span hundreds of years. it exists in ratios as high as 10,000 to 1. \r\n\r\ni believe there is tons of it in cook inlet mud. there is also a lot of it in water from certain underground wells. \r\n\r\nthis stuff has incredible uses that are only limited by your intelligence and it has the power to increase your intelligence a thousand fold so there is no limit.\r\n\r\nsee my book, philosophers stone) at: www.Alaskpublishing.Com\r\n\r\n\"the bible says that moses told the hebrew people that they had not kept the covenant, so the manna was to be taken away from them, but will come back in the end times when we would be a nation of high priests, not an elect high priesthood. this is the food; this is the light you take into your body. in fact if you ask a rabbi if he ever heard of the white-powder-of-gold, he says: \"yes, we know of the white-powder-of-gold, but to our knowledge no one knows how to make it since the destruction of the first temple, the temple of solomon.\" this knowledge was not completely lost, the high priest who left the temple when it was destroyed went out into the desert and organized the community known as qumrun, and they were the essenes. in the copies of the dead sea scrolls uncovered, translated by eiseman and wise, this was known as golden tear from the eye of horus. it was the white powder of gold mixed in water. it was called that which issues from the father in heaven.\r\n\r\n\"you have to understand the symbolism, the understanding of; prepare yourself for the coming of the father in heaven. to be inseminated by this father in heaven in the bridal chamber, to totally be regenerated, to be purified, to be cleansed. every cell in your body will be taken beck to the state it is supposed to be, when you were a teenager or a child. it perfects the dna, and closes the light within the body until you literally reach a point where the light body exceeds the physical body. you literally light up a room when you walk in. the gifts that go with this are perfect telepathy, you can know good and evil when it is in the room with you, you can project your thoughts into someone else's mind, you can levitate, you can walk on water, because it is flowing so much light in you, you literally don't attract to gravity.\r\n\r\n\"when you understand that your body can now exclude all magnetic and other fields, including gravity, you are no longer of this space-time, you become a fifth dimensional being. you literally can think where you'd like to be and you can go there and disappear from here. the ancient texts specify the appearance of other attributes such as healing with the laying on of hands, they claim you can resurrect the dead within two or three days after they die. instead of using electrical paddles you embrace their people and bring energy and life back into them. most groups don't receive this very well. it works.\r\n\r\n\"christ said to his disciples, \"don't touch me, i don't have on my earthly garments.\" they said, when will we see you again? christ replied, \"when you have prepared the proper food and when you have on your proper garments.\" what is the proper food? it is the food of the angels, the food of the gods, the manna, the ���what is it'? the proper garment is your garment of glory, your rainbow garment, your meissner field is what science calls it, and literally it's about 1000 times what you have now.\r\n\r\n\"the amazing thing about superconductors they don't have to touch for current to flow. electricity has to touch for current to flow but superconductors can sit at a distance from each other, and as long as they are resonant to each other they are as one. they function as one. when you have your perfect superconducting body you are no longer of this

weekend near hooper, co.  camping in my parked car facing east towards the sand dunes, i was awake between about 4:30 am and 5:00 am on 3 separate nights in succession.  studying the stars and constellations rising in the early morning hours just before dawn i happened to see out of the corner of my eye (facing south) through the open window of my car - a bright orange star-like object i initially took to be the planet mars, only somewhat brighter.  after a few minutes a curious thing happened - this stationary object i thought was planet mars started to gradually fade out and disappear!  this took about 20 seconds to go from full brightness to a full disappearence.  that in itself was not too unusual, as it could have been some object at a high altitude that was reflecting early morning sunlight (before sunrise).  i dismissed that sighting as an unexplained anomaly but not too remarkable.  but what grabbed my attention was the fact that the same sighting occured the very next night at about the same time (bright mars-like object) that disappeared gradually. (a repeat of the night before).  watching for it again on the third night, this time (again in a clear sky) it did not appear at all- so i was left wondering and have concluded it was a sighting of an unexplained event.  not very dramatic as ufo's go in general, but still very curious because the two successive sightings did not fit any known object i could relate it to.  it may have been reflected sunlight off of a metallic skin craft at very high altitude that had the ability to disappear (in place) without moving, since any craft moving out of the sun's rays would be easily detected.  it was definitely not covered by clouds, an earth satellite, an irridium flare, a meteor, a helicopter or any known craft that i can think of.  if anyone knows more about what this could have been, please respond.  thank you\r\n ","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":12059,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":37.7487575,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08132008-0016","longitude":-105.8715387,"occurred":1218265200000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Colorado","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1218265200000,"summary":"Appeared like planet mars but faded out of sight in a clear sky - 2 separate nights in succession.","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Hooper, Colorado","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:347449"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Fort Lauderdale","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This hazy august evening a friend of mine and i were walking the dog and my friend looked up at the moon and said,\"what is that object by the moon?\" i looked up to the moon in the eastern dusk sky and we both identified a black triangular object traveling northeast, about an inch below, at arm's lenght, beneath the moon.  there was another unidentifiable black object about 45 degrees in front and above the triangle, traveling in the same northeast direction.  the triangular object was rotating clockwise while travelling forward.  the animation of the july 28th sighting in jacksonville, fl, which is on skyscan, is exactly what the larger, triangular object looked like.\r\n\r\nthe objects were moving slowly and not at any type of speed for ascending or descending aircraft normally found in the area. there were no sounds.  there were no planes in the sky leaving ft lauderdale int'l airport, nor could it have been a plane in the distance going to/from miami international, because these objects were within naked eyesight and before the haze diminished visibility.\r\n\r\nwondering if anyone else saw and if mufon or skyscan wants to contact, please feel free to do so.  this is our second ft lauderdale sighting of different objects in the sky sine novemeber 2007.
