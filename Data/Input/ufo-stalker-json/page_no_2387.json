view of the very tail end of dusk with a cloudy sky. had just finished watching a plane headed east fly over. probably took about 2-3 minutes from first seeing it till it passed out of sight. the plane was high above and to the right of the passenger side window, which was open. the plane was below the clouds. i could clearly see the flashing red and green wing lights and the white 'headlights'. \r\n\r\nwas enjoying viewing the rest of the sky, when a sudden bright white/yellowish light caught my eye. to me, it was around the same height as the plane i had just viewed. certainly not tower lights located on the ground. there was a tower with red lights and a tower just to the right of that with white lights straight ahead of us on the horizon. this first 'ufo' light (and 5 more), i viewed out the front windshield, above and to the left of the tower lights on the ground. anyway...The light in the sky was larger than any of the stars...Maybe the size of this 'o'. just imagine it in the sky. it quickly faded out. i wasn't sure at first what it was. wondering if it was another plane that disappeared in clouds, but then thinking it was brighter than the plane i had just viewed, and that it was already in front of the clouds. just as i was thinking that, another similar light quickly appeared in a different spot, but same area of the sky. i said, \"huh?\" i quickly looked at the surrounding stars and the tower lights for comparison. then this light also faded out. as soon as it was out, another light appeared in different spot, same area, and faded as well. i made a gesture towards the area and was like, \"whaaaaat the f**k?\" to my boyfriend. as both of us this time were looking, two lights suddenly appeared then faded away. the timing of the fading was slightly off. they didn't fade at the exact same time. ....Funny....When he first noticed me staring out the windshield, he asked if i was looking at ufos.... the spacing of the two that appeared together was like this>      o   o\r\n\r\nno other lights then appeared at this moment. i was intently scanning the sky to see if there were anymore. \r\n\r\nthen i noticed small red/yellow lights outside the driver's side window. my boyfriend tried to glimpse them, but was busy keeping the car on the road. these lights were approximately the size of this period> . not sure if it was two or more, but it almost looked like they were playing leap frog, occasionally going backwards. they weren't continuous lights shining, but were appearing/disappearing/appearing. i don't want to say flashing because they weren't. then they totally disappeared. \r\n\r\ni once again scanned the sky, even unbuckling my seatbelt so i could move and see more. i was crushed up against the front dash peering at the sky above the car when again i saw two lights appear and fade together.\r\n\r\nno more strange lights appeared (that i could see) after that. a couple seconds passed then i saw plane lights coming from the west, heading east outside my passenger window. it had to have been a jet because it was moving very fast. once it was behind us in the sky, it made a turn and headed quickly back west. as i was watching this plane, i also noticed another plane farther away and closer to the horizon, out my passenger side window. i could still make out its flashing lights. there were some other flashing lights that were really far away in other areas of the sky. i am going to assume these were planes as well. especially since yuma does have a somewhat large airport and we were headed in that direction.\r\n\r\nin all of my almost 34 years on earth, i have never seen lights like these in the sky. i have seen some strange things, but not even close to what i witnessed tonight. although the clouds with lightning but no thunder was pretty weird....\r\n\r\nand that is the end of what i saw of the 'ufos'.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":12049,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.0515981,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08132008-0006","longitude":-111.0846211,"occurred":1218600900000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Circle,

ed and i witnessed something in the sky that neither of us have been  able to fully explain. our home sits at just below the 2000 ft elevation and our front yard faces towards true north. our home sits upon a rise putting our home higher than the other homes in our immediate area. most all of the houses in this area have about 5-10 acre lots. there is a home directly north and below our yard and then a country road that runs east-west that is even lower. once across that road there is a valley that i would estimate to be about 4 miles wide and 14 miles long. directly north of this valley is the first major mountain ridge that begins to make up the sierra mountains. there is a highway that cuts up the lower 1/3 of this ridge that leads to shaver lake and beyond. this ridge rises from 2000 ft to about 4500 ft. there is a smaller ridge that juts out towards the southwest from the main ridgeline that is called razorback mountain. from our front yard we have very good visibility of all of the skyline above both of these ridges.\r\n\r\non the evening mentioned ed and i were sitting at a table in our front yard enjoying the cool evening air when ed brought to my attention a very bright light that was moving around razorback���s ridge and starting to proceed east along the major ridgeline. at first i didn���t thing anything of what i was seeing except for wonder of what it could be due to its brightness and intensity of light. the light at first registered as a possible spotlight from a plane or helicopter but then i realized that there was not a beam coming out from the light source.\r\n\r\nas this object came around the first ridge and moved more easterly i was began to run through my mind what i���ve come to know over the 21 years we lived here of other objects we have seen in the sky. i looked for blinking lights, none - colored lights, none - change in appearance as the object changed its position in relation to use in the sky, none,  change in intensity of the light, none - sound, none - shape, none other than a bright true white light with rays emiting from it. it reminded me of the bright halogen light that we have in our home.\r\n\r\nas this object traveled along it did not flicker or move up or down in elevation, it just seemed to float at a constant level. as mentioned earlier, it also moved silently. due to this i felt that it was moving slowly, ed on the other hand said that it seemed to be moving very quickly.\r\n\r\na few moments after our first sight of the object ed got up from his seat and moved away from the table and positioned himself about 10 feet southeast of where i was sitting. he was still able to talk to me but had a slightly different point of view as he could see towards the east without any obstruction. i stayed seated at the table and continued to observe the object as it went behind some shrubbery. due to the brightness of the object i never really lost site of the object as it moved along. once the object got about 8 miles down the ridgeline it began to become smaller although it continued to retain its intensity of light, it went from its original size down to a pin-point and then gone in less than a minutes time.\r\n\r\nwhen the object vanished i said to myself out loud, ���oh my god, its gone���. ed immediately said to me, ���you saw that���? it was an immediate confirmation for him that i had seen exactly what he saw.\r\n\r\nafter the incident was over we stayed outside for quit sometime to see whether there were any other appearances in the sky. as we sat there we started to discuss we saw, we tried to determine how high it might have been. we discussed the size of the object. we believe it was mars that was in the southeastern sky, the object appeared to be at least twice its size. i know from watching other objects in the sky it is very hard to determine size and how high they are.\r\n\r\nhusband's account\r\nbig, bright brilliant white ���light���, (object?) at least 3 times the size of mars in the sky. the white light was so bright it appeared to have light shafts emulating from it, not flickering or changing, they were constant shafts.\r\n\r\ni noticed a unusually bright light north and a little west moving south in my direction, coming around razorback mountain. i���m at about the 2,000 foot elevation.\r\n\r\nthis light moved?���very slowly���but quickly and followed the ridgeline towards the east. as it followed the ridgeline, its path paralleled our valley in tollhouse, giving us a perfect view and several minutes to observe it.\r\n\r\nour view was, first, it coming towards us and slightly above, second, it turned giving us a ���side��� angle view and third, a rear quarter and rear view. i am saying front, side and rear only to describe our perspective, not the object seen. there was no object - not a helicopter, plane, air balloon, ultra light, hang glider, comet, star, falling star, bird, etc. it did not turn, it just began to move along a different line. \r\n\r\nthe light was seen shortly after dusk. we have a great view and can easily see green and red navigational lights. our area also has natural acoustics. we can often hear planes and helicopters from many, many miles away. during the sighting we could see several plane lights and silhouettes in other areas of the sky.\r\n\r\nas the light approached us i pointed it out to my wife. i stood up and moved about 15 feet from her to a better spot, giving us slightly different angles of view.\r\n\r\nthis light was silent, i tried to gauge speed, it seemed to just float on a level, soft, calm, tranquil line, but then i would lower my eyes to take in the ridgeline, it made it seem to be moving at a good rate.\r\n\r\nits path���s distance:\r\ncoming towards us view - about 10 miles\r\nturning, arch about view - 5 miles\r\nacross the ridgeline/over the valley - 15 miles\r\n\r\nall through the sighting we are discussing the light, shape, size, perspective, height, speed, sound, other objects in the distance. as the light gets even with us the light���s intensity stays the same level in brilliance but the size begins to get smaller, slowly going down to a brilliant point of light and then���its gone���it vanished right in front of us. there was no tell tale signs, nothing, gone. there is just open sky where it was.\r\n\r\nafter talking about the sighting was were able to determine the following:\r\n\r\nbrilliant light with no visible shape\r\nconstant non-flickering ray bursts shooting out from light\r\nsilent running\r\nno navigational lights\r\nit did not turn in a flight maneuver, it just moved off on a different course\r\nthe size of the light changed but not the intensity of the light\r\n\r\nwhat bothered me the most was we saw something, an object or light that went from something to nothing in a very good observational setting with no source left behind to account for the light in a clear twilight sky.\r\n\r\nboth my wife and i are highly trained in observational skills and we have been in this home for over 20 years. from our observations we are sure what we did see but most importantly what we did not see nor hear.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  they flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  i couldn't tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely huge.  each light was about the size of a dime if i put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  they came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight.\r\n\r\nthe date is approximate but definitely during the week of november 6.  i remember the time exactly because i was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at davis-monthan afb waiting for my shift to start.  i was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early.  when i saw the lights go by, i froze, didn't want to blink or even breath.  the lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway.  i had been in the air force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and i never saw anything like this.  after the lights went by, i looked around the parking lot to see if anyone else saw it, but no one was around.  that in itself was odd.  there should have been several people in the parking lot by that time.\r\n\r\nwhen lunchtime came, i went back to my unit to report it to the soc desk.  i asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  the guy at the soc desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like \"ha ha, sgt e saw a ufo, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can i have some of that too?\"  i kind of expected that since he was an assclown so i let him joke around for a minute and then i asked him, ok can we get serious now?  just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  next he just ignored me so i pressed him a little harder.  then one of the ados came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if i have somewhere i need to be and told me to get going.\r\n\r\ni've never seen anything like it since but if i ever do, i'll certainly never report through air force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  there's simply no one who takes such reports.  report it through your chain of command and they won't give a crap.  report it to any other air force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  the \"that's not my job\" philosophy definitely applies here.\r\n\r\nsince i just found this site and a couple others like it, i figured i'd check to see if anyone else ever saw what i saw, but i don't see any that match this particular sighting.  so for what it's worth, here's my one and only sighting.  if i see any more, i'll let you know.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

stacy minnesota. it was the fall of 1979 and i was with a friend of mine. we were southbound on interstate 35 and just approaching forest lake. i observed several cars pulled to the shoulder of the freeway which is not common. i observed several of the occupants of those vehicles pointing toward the sky (north and eastward). my friend and i pulled in behind the other vehicles and off the roadway. we heard many people questioning what it was they were looking at. what i saw will be engraved in my memory forever. i looked up and observed a round sphere changing color. the sphere was approximately 400 feet in the air and made absolutely no sound. i watched it for several minutes trying to explain to my mind what i was seeing. helicopters make noise, aircraft can't maneuver like this. it made several very quick maneuvers which i would describe as moving from one location to 20 miles in another direction and then back again. it did this several times and then shot straight out into space leaving all who were standing there wondering what had taken place. i got into my vehicle and drove away more stunned than ever.\r\n\r\ni have no reason to make this up and it appears that the town of forest lake was a hot bed of activity for several weeks after that. car loads of people who attended local church meetings described what they had observed. the local papers did stories on

glowing brighter than all of the others that was flashing white and then red and called my attention to it.  he mentioned that it looked exactly like the light in the sky that he had seen previously as we continued to look on in amazement.  he sent me inside to look up the number for mufon on the website and after finding it i returned with my cell phone for him to call.  he waited through the automated messages and then ended up haning up after he couldn't get anyone on the line.  after a few minutes of staring we realized that the object was slowly moving by using the power lines as reference points.  when we first began watching the object looked as though it was centered between two power cables that were close to the house--that was our only way of measuring movement as the object was pretty far off--after a while we noticed it moving slowly to the right and then left all the while still blinking white and then red.  around that time i asked my boyfriend to grab my camera from inside of the house so that we could try to get pictures.  when i tried my camera i couldn't capture an images because the object was so far off that all i really got a picture of was the complete blackness of the sky so after a few useless shots i abandoned the camera and continued to look on with my boyfriend.  \r\n     as we were staring up at the sky a guy came walking down the road presumably on his way to a friend's house and my boyfriend stopped him and asked him to look up in the sky at the object.  the stranger (found out his name was steven)looked for a moment and confirmed that he saw it too and stood around for a minute or two looking up at the sky with us before he was on his way again. after that my boyfriend returned to his original position beside me on the porch and we began to notice that the object had began to move up and away (it had become obscured by the topmost powercable that we used as our reference point).  it had moved unlike an airplane in that it sort of hovered and seemed to move in an almost zig-zag pattern in the sky and also unlike a helicopter since it wasn't moving all that fast and that there was no sound. it was then that i looked at my cell phone again and noticed that it was 12:30 which was surprising given that we didn't think we had been outside nearly that long.  while we continued wathing the object my boyfriend commented that it looked as though the object had started out over the local nuclear power plant which is a no-fly zone. we watched for a little longer and then decided to try and follow this thing in the sky.  we got into the car at about 1:06 am and drove around the neighborhood with both of us sticking our heads out of the windows at random and searching the sky.  we spotted it one last time as we drove around but that was it, it looked like it had gone out too far for us to easily see. \r\n     over the course of the next few days my boyfriend noticed a lot of military planes and air crafts flying over and near the same area we'd spotted our ufo.  also we recived a call back from one of the mufon directors asking us about what we had seen.  we were directed to the director of investigations for our area and we reported what we'd seen to her as well.  she asked us to find out if sirius was in view (after looking up some information on it i noticed that the sirius star could look very much like what we saw only without the movement) so i emailed my old astronomy professor and found out that sirius was in view that day however it was only in view at about 6:30 am on aug. 3 very briefly.  so it was sirius but was definately something that we have no explanation for and a night we aren't likely to forget.","distance":"Over One

had a close sighting last year on july 24th at about 10:30pm.  i was working on my well pump with my sons and my oldest saw something and acted like he wanted to run but hesitated until i saw what he did.  i looked aorund from a tree that was blocking my view and realized i was looking at an object at least 60 foot long almost a marquie diamond shape with three white lights.  it was just sitting there suspended over my property line no more than 100 feet from the ground.  i stood amazed trying to make out a familiar shape but realized there was no sound.  i looked at the time.  it must have stayed suspended for three minutes before slowly moving towards the orange groves.  i had a roll of orange electrical tape in my hand when i saw this object and when i turned to get the kids in the car, the tape was gone and looked at the time and realized that we lost ten minutes.  we persued this object about three minutes and tried to beat it to the highway to get a closer look, and with incredible speed it moved in to another town twenty minutes away effortlessly.  since this has happened i am convinced that there is higher intelligence than man.  i've never seen anything like this during my tour of duty in the armed forces.  i spoke with my neighbor who flys for the sherriffs dept. and he said he didn't fly around our properties that night but was in the air.  since this i've kept an eye opened at night when i'm outside, on the phone or just watching i see a few falling stars and very distant lights that move appears to be stars at first then can move half across the horizon, stop, then change course in a 90 degree angle, it's amazing to watch.  the most i've seen in a three hour period has been about eight.  if any reports or investigators fron my area have been made i would appreciate knowing.  thank you so much.

we stopped we shut off the car and opened the sun roof and began to look at the stars. after a bit we saw a few shooting stars after about the 7 or 8th i saw just above the pine trees maybe a few more feet above them a very big disk the back end gloved blue and the front had a strange color i would say at 1 point looked closet to purple . it moved slow at first and seemed to had shut off its lights but still moved above me as a dark mass over head it then moved over to the next set of trees and had gotten a real bright red and it just vanished right as it turned purple again. now as i saw at first i said to my girlfriend lyzz hey lyzz look at that, but she didn't reply i don't know why she had just seen a shooting star seconds before that and now she was just lost in her own little word i guess i can put it seconds after it was gone she finely stopped staring out into the sky and said \"what was that you were saying something about the energy in the sky?\" i said nothing about the energy until after i had begun to notice a lot of it every were almost like heat waves coming out of the trees and going toward were this ship was just at. so i said nothing else of it to her. but i had decided for some reason to close my eyes and just say hello, right away i got in a almost loving way a and happy way and energetic way \" and to you a  good day\" after that i had just received a lot of information  i didn't really posses until after getting home and thinking back to it. this voice had carried a image to me as well it would sound crazy but it looked just like light a being made of pure light but almost looked like a human at the same time. it told me over all because i had opened my mind to things such as its self i was free to speak with it and lyzz couldn't she was just lost in the moment. this is the biggest thing that's happened to me in a whole week of strange sitings that only me and my friends had seen of other strange ships like that but seeing them for seconds and then gone in a flash. this time it stayed put long enough for me to really take a good look at it. i had ben getting into channeling of things from other worlds and that's why i had begun to notice the other things around me such as them the being had said to me, they are here all the time watching over us and they are not to be feared. its because so many pepole fear and don't truly understand them, they don't have such open contact with us the voice had told me but within the next 9 years things will have changed a lot . its up to us on how fast things will change on terms of open contact with others. an that is all i have learned and experienced from that one encounter.

of all, my apologies for writing so much text, but i need to tell all the events and the details as i remember them.\r\n\r\nthis happened sometime between 1993 and 1995 in autumn, i can't remember precisely the date.\r\nat this time i was working on a small airport named le bourget in the suburbs of paris. it is the small airport reserved for business, diplomatical, and other non-conventional flights (humanitarian, personalities, weapon deals, whatever needs discretion).\r\nit was approximately 7h30 pm and i was about to leave the office to go back home. my office had a row of large windows through which i could watch one of the runways (the auxiliary, rarely used one) approximately 150 meters away and behind it, the military zone, another 150 meters away. strangely, i was just thinking about ufos at this very moment , then watching through the window i noticed a strange and very bright light hovering about 20 meters above the military zone.\r\nmy first thought was a helicopter, but then i realized that helicopters fly very rarely at night in that area and at that altitude, i had actually never noticed one doing that. then i noticed that the parkings and hangars at the military zone were all shut off, completely black ,and noone could be seen outside (this particular military installation was almost never used at night). this was very odd. if an helicopter had taken off from this area, there should be at least lighting on the parking area.\r\nthere was also no reason for the helicopter to hover in the same place as it did for several dozen minutes.\r\ni kept watching it for approx. half an hour. unfortunately i was working alone and i didn't have the idea to call the airport controller to have any confirmation on the aircraft.\r\nbut i had never seen an helicopter hover or even take off in this area, especially in total darkness, and why so long?\r\nthere was also no other light than this very bright yellow spot that seemd to be pointed in my direction. no flashing red lights as helicopter seem to carry often('warnings' as we called them). no sound either (i think i would have heard an helicopter 300 meters away)\r\ni tried to look at it with binoculars but i could see nothing more than the light (the area was very dark around it) almost as if there was nothing else, just the light.\r\nthen after several long minutes, i noticed the light was vibrating very strongly and losing intensity and i understood that it was probably zooming away from me at a very high speed. i estimated a very high speed because of the strength of the oscillations, i can't explain precisely why but the way it was vibrating made me think it was moving very fast through the air. i would say at least 150-200 kms per hour (or much more as it was very difficult to acertain anything in that darkness).\r\nwhat is strange is that the light just seemed to zoom out, without any previous manoeuver (an helicopter would probably have needed some sort of rotation before moving away). and the direction seemed to be exactly in the axis of my observation, as if it was running away from me.\r\nin one minute it had completely disappeared that way. no other trajectory than a zoom away from me.\r\n\r\nif i had to compare it to a \"conventional\" aircraft it could only be an helicopter. definitely not an aeroplane or any other aerodynamic vehicle (so that rules out winged drones). definitely not a blimp as i can't imagine a blimp flying so low and then zooming out so fast.\r\nall the events also took place at very low altitude, in a very urbanized area with all the inherent hazards (such as electrical lines and buildings) that make me think it was not a normal behaviour for an helicopter, especially in such a darkness.\r\n\r\ni know that sometimes, when aircrafts are in the final approach pattern, the landing lights, if observed directly in the axis of movement, can looks as if they are just hovering in place and not moving. \r\nbut i am familiar with this illusion and it was definitely not the case here. first there is no approach pattern in the direction i was watching, secondly it never lasts for so long, and third it never happens in outbound direction (as it happened in the last part of my observation).\r\n\r\n\r\ni don't want to speculate on the nature of my observation, but it was definitely not something ordinary, all i can say is that it seemed to be \"spying\" or monitoring something.\r\n\r\ni didn't have any particular feelings related to this observation, except curosity.\r\n\r\nunfortunately, there is nothing more to say, i understand this might be something normal and not out of this world, but on the other hand it could help other researchers in their study of ufo behaviours. \r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet -

with no clouding at all. i was visiting my sister in the town of santa cruz for a few months. i was sitting in my bedroom in a chair with short legs. i was gazing out the large picture window which was facing north. the only object that i could see through the window besides blue sky was the top third of the telephone poll and the wires in front of the house.\r\nafter sitting and soaking up the saturday sun for several minutes my eyes locked on to a very tiny flicker of light in the sky. with the naked eyes all i could see was the sun light reflecting of this tiny dot. after looking at it for several minutes i came to the conclusion that it must be a plane. but, this small reflection did not move but stayed stationary in one spot. \r\nthat made me curious so i went to the window and focused my better then perfect eye sight on the spot where i could see the reflecting. \r\nonce my eyes were locked on it and my mind was clear and in the moment i was able to see a shape. it was not any type of plane. i could see that the light was just the sun bouncing off an object. i then used the pole as a reference point to find the object because my eyes kept tearing up due to looking at the bright blue sky. \r\nafter about five minutes i ran into the living room and grabbed my sisters binoculars. when i returned to the window the object was still in the same spot. i now determined that the object had to be at least 20,000 to 40,000 feet in the air. i was looking north by north east from the west side of santa cruz. once i got the object in my sight through the binoculars i focused in on it. instantly, i knew what i was seeing. it was a ufo! it was a metallic disc with no windows. but, it had different colored lights around the edge that were in groups of three. the disc hovered in one spot while spinning at a rate that was easy to see. the lights spun around as the disc stayed in one spot reflecting the sun. every few seconds i could see the disc wobble as a result of air turbulence. i tried to determine how big the disc was and how far up and away it was.\r\nto me, the disc seemed to be hovering directly over the silicon valley region about 20,000 to 40,000 feet. the disc must have been at least the size of the infield of a baseball diamond. i estimate that i watched the disc for about 20 minutes before my eyes could no longer focus. i rested for a few minutes and tried to find any neighbors that would look but no one was around. when i went back to watch again i could no longer find it.\r\n\r\n
