picture of the sky. although not visible when the shot was taken, the same rectangular object i shot last summer again appeared in the photo along with some odd light manifestations. the dark rectangle is visible hanging under the \"lightning bolt\" and hole that also was not visible when the shot was taken. as a control i used a different camera from the shot taken last year.  i also used a camera that i know picks up infra-red (a simple test you can perform by pointing your tv remote at the camera and snapping a picture when a button is depressed. if you see the light coming from the remote, it has no filter for infra-red, as many cheaper digitals don't). i have again included a shot from turkey taken last year over istanbul where the same ufo is visible. in this shot the clouds infringe into the shape so it is obviously not a camera artifact. this plus another shot that brian vike supplied me, demonstrates that this same ufo has now been caught in four shots-2 from ny here on the lake, one in the uk and one from istanbul turkey which i have attached-all over water. the turkey photo still was taken from a video posted on youtube <http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=w5bteyb0ddy>. interestingly, in the forbidden city of china-a city built to mimic the \"palace\" of the gods- a statue shows the emporer wearing a hat with the exact

easter sunday. i was not exhausted, everyone went to bed and i laid on my sofa and fell asleep. i know i was lying on my back with my left arm toward the back of the couch. during the night i felt a sting of what i can think of as an injection, it semi-woke me and on impulse, pushed it away,it was a continuos series of at least 6-7 times, with me doing the same thing, pushing it away. the injections were so sharp, like that of a tetnus shot, but i was still in such a sleep, but not in dream like state. the next morning i went to get up to make breakfast and when i stood i was so dizzy, i thought i had a stroke (i just turned 50 this mar.) i could not stand vertically and was only comfortable in a horizontal postion, so i laid in bed most of the day watching tv. it wasn't untill hours later that my arm started throbbing and everything from the middle of the night came back to me. and a very \"strong\" intuitive voice said \"aliens\". the thing about it is that it does not \"bother\" me, mentally, physically, yes, every day. i can stand or walk by a radio or cd player that is not operating and will get a buzzing sound, a broken up buzzing, like a telgraph sound and when that happens the energy from the radio will act in the same way within my arm. my husband believes me (a mechanical engineer) and sees how i re-act when the buzzing sounds, others i have told also see how i react and hear the buzzing(?) sound. it hurts! i have tried to make contact with other sites and even some guys that my friend (a well-known psychic) i had written to and no answers. so i left it and live with it. until recently...My arm is so sore and is in a constant throb, exactly where the site is on my arm. my arm is so heavy, which is not good for a hair stylist and yoga instructor. this past sat. aug.2, was the worst day with this...It just hurt so bad and throbbed and throbbed, just one small area. when i woke sunday morning and was reading the newspaper out on my patio i felt sooo tired immediately and went over to my yard swing and fell asleep for 2 1/2 hours, got up went to bed for another 2 hours...I was out of it for 2 days, and the site on my arm is still quite noticable, more than usual for the past two years. i have no clue what is going on. the only person i talked to outside my immediate family and friends was my chiropractor, thinking he could have it x-rayed, well that did not pan out...Lol..He left town. \r\ni did look on your homepage for people that can help, but no one is near me. \r\nalso while reading your web-page (mostly all of it) there is a part on medical(?). i do not know if this story pertains to anything, i just find it odd that 3 people had said the same thing. twenty-five yrs ago,after my fourth son, i had a tubal ligation after delivery. last september i woke at 3 in the morning with such pangs in my lower abdomin that i went to the emergency room. there they gave me an internal scan of everything and the tech asked me when i had a hysterectomy, and i said i never had one, she dismissed it with ovaries being hidden. so with much \"new\" health issues i went to all new dr.S and my ob-gyn during exam had asked me when i had a hysterectomy, again, i said i never had one...She just went oh, and left it at that. with me being on the holistic side i went to an iridologist and the first thing she asked my after examining my eyes...Is..When did you have a hysterectomy?  wow...Three different people in three weeks.\r\ni do and am taking this so serious and am wondering if you can lead me in any directions to resolve this mystery. like i said, i am not frightened, curious, oh yes! my site is throbbing as i write. \r\nthank you for anything you can do and for your time.\r\nlee","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:03:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11977,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.8884268,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08082008-0003","longitude":-78.8745389,"occurred":1145271600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"New

about ten minutes of smelling this odor i had realized that it was almost a mix of decarbonated orange soda and vaseline. the odor disapearred mysteriously after i exited my shower. the day went normal from there until about 11ish. i was walking home from the town fair (which is a very rural area) and in the middle of a farmed field i smelt the odor again. i shrugged it off believing it to be air pollution. as i started walking thru a thicket full of raspberry's and willows and whatnot. the odor became very strong and intense all of the sudden. i then fell over sickened by its overwhelming power. my legs felt as if they were being pricked by needles. but the weirdest feeling was in all of my joints, i felt an intense pressure. almost as if ballons were expanding in my kneecaps. after about 45 seconds of this it abrubtly stopped. then a very deep rumbling sound came thru, almost shaking the very strong rooted ponderosa pines around me. i used my remaining strength to look up at a 45 degree angle and see a very large cigar shaped object flash with green lights. but then it flickeed and all of the sudden it wasn't there. almost as it had turned on an invisibility cloak. the sound slowly faded, but as i continued to look up i could still see flashes of light once in awhile being distorted by the invisibilty cloak. it took another 45 minutes till i was able to gather strength to walk to my house. it was almost like the ship had paralyzed me until it was far far away out of any danger. i experienced no later effects from the incident. \r\n\r\n\r\np.S. just a note

storm has pass through a couple of hours previous and the sky was broken clouds with between cloud lighting occurring. there was no wind during the sighting event. the lighting flashes in the sky lit up the disk when they occurred. red rectangular lights on the bottom portion of the craft rotated from right to left and reflected off the pond surface. the bottom of craft appeared to be a metallic blue with a shimmer to it. water in the pond below the craft appeared to ripple. the dome on the craft was unlit. \r\n","distance":"21-100

goes. we live right in the middle of town. me and my daughter were outside practicing catch. it was her first year playing t-ball. we had been playing for about 30 minutes. i stopped to look up too see if there were any clouds. i was a very clear day, not a single cloud anywhere to be seen. and it just so happened that when i looked up, and slightly to the north, i noticed what at first glance was an airplanes lights. the red and blue lights on the wings. as i was about to dismiss it as an airplane i took a longer look. and asked my daughter if she could see it also. (which of course she couldnt). what i saw was very high in the sky, it was somewhat difficult to see, unless you knew just where to look.What i noticed was not a commercial airliner at all. there was the red and blue lights. but there was also a green colored light as well. i say that the object was triangular because of this. it appeared like a red blue and green  light bunched together. as this object moved from the north to the south very slowly, it rotated in a  clockwise motion slowly ,but noticably. i watche the object for about 4 minutes then i decided to get the camera to try to snap a few pictures of it.  i went into the house for about 1 minute and when i came out it was still in the sky. it hadnt moved much at all.  i was unable to get any photos, because i could not locate the objet through the sights of my camera. so i just sat there watching this thing until it was out of my sifght. i watched for about 13 to 15  minutes. the only thing that i thought that it might be was maybe some kind of satalite or something. this object was very high in the sky, in fact had there been clouds i would not have seen it at all. after the sighting, i went inside the house and called 2 of the television stations just to see if they had anything on radar. i didnt report it as a u.F.O. i was just asking if there anything in our particular area. one of the stations blew me off, and one of them actually said that they would look into it. they got my address and phone number. but of course i never heard fom them. \r\n\r\n     i know that i saw something. i do not know what it was, but there was something up there just cruising along. i believe that i was not a terrestrial aircraft because of the way that it was slowly rotating. and it was moving to slow to be some kind of airplane. and it was very high. i know that i saw this object, i cant explain it, i just wish that someone else had witnessed it with me.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

9:49pm\r\nreporter ���  ��� commercial pilot asel amel cfi\r\n\r\nafter a long night at oshkosh as a exhibitor for an unnamed company, the 4 workers and myself sat down around 9:30 after putting out our tents and started discussing the day and aviation in general. we were watching shooting stars and watching the sky as many of us find as an enjoyment before going to sleep. right at 9:49, an bright light appeared in the southern sky (looked like landing lights at first), note the airport is closed to all operations after 8pm local time. all of our group was very surprised by this and thought it to be an aircraft in distress. as the object approached the airfield, it was traveling directly north, at an estimated 2,000 ft (aprox only, we cannot verify this), and crossed just to the west of the airfield, paralleling runway 18/36. as it got closer many of the group members took snap shots and video, which many are blurry etc but it was there. as the object came within viewing distance, the only visible part was a large flame. this flame was twice the size of jupiter in the southern sky. it was moving fairly slow, less that 100kts as it moved over the airfield, and it resembled the flame of a hot air balloon, but was silent. we had the knowledge that hot air balloons do not fly at night and that they are easily heard from the ground, and also the flame never went out, like many times happens in a hot air balloon. this object moved to the north of the airfield, we aprox. over top of the north 40 area, and it made a left 45 degree turn, and rapidly departed the area, not only gaining altitude, but it increased its lateral distance from us at a tremendous rate. all of the members of the group fly for a profession; (commercial and private pilots) were all in stun having never seen this before. this object lasted 3-4 minutes of duration as it moved over the area. we immediately notified the chicago artcc for a possible aircraft in distress (they notified cap) also, we contacted the ufo reporting hotline as this was a ufo (could be hot air balloon but it is not likely) there for we classified it as a ufo. chicago artcc said they had nothing on radar and we also confirmed this with flightaware.Com. this report is to reflect the phone call to the ufo reporting hotline, and shall supplement that. if any clarification is needed please contact me.

light approaching and then it started to blink. it slowly came west and i thought it would go down neighbors yard like most do. i could tell it was watching me, because it drifted past the telephone pole on my side of the road, and i knew it was going to check me out. it came within 100 feet? and was above my creek maybe 75 feet hovered. i was scared and watched it through viewfinder of camera. i watched as it turn on light to show a seperation of windows and then it turned on a whole light that was contained within. i kept my other eye closed, because i was so focused on trying to get steady shot, and was terrified at first. i then felt like it just wanted me to know that he was taking my picture too and a feeling of love overtook my fear. it drifted down my creek and went behind my sycamore tree and i lost him for awhile.  can you see where it shows a division of lights before it turns to solid light? my first instinct is, it was a disc. i really don't know. i just felt love emitting, after the fear subsided. this is not the first time it visited me. it appeared as a amber ball that circled my pine tree and got so excited that it scared me and i mentally told him to back off. \r\n\r\nthe blinking light was all i could see for awhile. if i was to guess, i would say 25 to 30 diameter. not really sure. i may be late answering questions till week-end.  another issue i had was, i was thinking it was possible this thing changed while observing me. my ears were popping and plugged feeling like when barometric pressure changes. my hair was static feeling. the first time i saw it, my camera got static while filming and i had lines in looking through viewfiner. i don't think it showed up on film.My low battery signal came on but i was on ac, my setting of infinity changed. it might have been coincidence.
