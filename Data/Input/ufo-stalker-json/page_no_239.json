two super bright stars over the lake...Then i thought, wait...It's raining...And there are clouds everywhere, and i can't see any other stars...So, what are these two bright objects hanging over the lake....They were very low...Below the clouds, so they couldn't be stars. i could tell this because there seemed to be a plane flying in circles overhead, above the two shining objects. so the objects must have been huge. but my perception was that i could not actually see the objects only the light they were emitting. they looked exactly likes stars, like when you look at a star in the sky and it makes that star shape....Only much much closer, and out over the lake (ontario). i watched them along the whole stretch by charles daley beach, the beacon, burned out pirate ship etc...After going behind one of the sound walls, i lost sight of them, and when it came back into sight, i could no longer see the objects- though i  could still see the plane i perceived to have been circling overhead, still flying around up there. the whole thing probably lasted about a minute for me...I felt they had disappeared by the time i came back around, but they were already there before they came into view for me...So i have no idea how long they were actually up there....Seemingly long enough for a plane to fly around them to investigate. it made me curious...I waited a couple days and

32.4098 longitude -96.8454) i noticed a glider shaped object flying approximately 50 feet over my head. its wingspan fully covered the two-car driveway i was walking on, and then some. i was walking directly north towards my house after checking on my kids who were attending a birthday party at another one of the town homes in my complex. \r\n\r\ni noticed something just above my line of vision. at first i thought it was a cloud forming, as it had the consistency of a fine, mist type cloud. as it continued to move forward i realized that the object had a solid outline and a consistent shape, like a hang glider (somewhat boomerang shaped). at that point, i thought perhaps it was a hang glider, but considering that this was texas, and there are no hills or mountains for a hundred miles or more, this made no sense at all. then i thought it might have been a flock of birds, but the object had a solid form and a consistent shape as it flew by. it continued to fly, or glide, at a consistent rate of approximately 8-10 mph in a straight, direct path heading directly north, until i could no longer see it.\r\n\r\nthe object was completely silent. there were no lights on the object. the object almost blended into the starry background of the sky. it had a somewhat mottled color of white and possibly dark, navy blue, grey or black. the event lasted approximately 25-30 seconds before the object either evaporated, disappeared, or merely faded into the skyline ahead of it (the lights of the city were glowing over the homes that it was flying over). it was a beautiful clear night. there were no clouds at all in sight and no birds flying in the sky. i was outside taking photographs of the moon about an hour before this event and was admiring the sky, the stars, the moon, etc.\r\n\r\nthe object was flying very low and appeared to be only 30 feet above the roof line of the houses it was flying over. the object was not moving very fast and if i had started running very quickly i might have been able to keep up with it. i did not witness any entities or missing time, and i had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. i was all alone when i saw the object. the only physical effect i experienced was feeling sick to my stomach about 30 minutes after seeing the object and that feeling lasted about 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nat first my logical brain was trying to determine what i was looking at. i was in complete shock and awe. by the time my brain registered that this was possibly an ufo i had a split-second thought to grab my cell phone and record it, but by then it was gone. i was not in fear of the object at the time, because i was trying to determine what it was, and the possibility of it being an ufo was the furthest thing from my mind, until it vanished.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"00:00:30","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Patterned Surface","flightPath":"Straight-line

our photos, we wanted to share them. we knew the risk of being scrutinized and decided to keep it to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nthurs, may 4 2017\r\nalbuquerque, nm usa\r\n5:00am\r\n\r\n     exactly one week later, i was getting ready for work and we noticed that same star-like ball of light, but this time it seemed farther away. again the cameras came out, and we observed it going through it's formations over the sandia mountains before the sun came up. later that day we did notice an increased presence of unmarked helicopters.\r\ni asked some of my coworkers if they had noticed anything on that morning and at least one told he had seen something similar on sunday 4-30-17. he told me he observed it before dawn and described in the exact same way: slow moving, star-like, doing formations, over the mountains before sun came up. after hearing about his sighting, i felt convinced we had something worth sharing and investigating.\r\n\r\n     ever since then we have been actively watching the skies with scopes, hoping to witness this again. even though this happened during a time of heightened national security alerts, we do not fear this object. it did not threaten or harm us.  it was a fancy light show for those who were aware of it. we have never doubted the possibility of alien technology or beings. we feel that what we photographed is highly intelligent and not anything we have seen from this world. \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I have not seen a ufo.  i want to report that entities have been walking through my walls and talking to me (and i think, researching on me) especially during the past 5 years.  i do not know what i am experiencing.  i have been posting some of my experiences on reddit in the psychosis forum (i can give you my reddit username if you want it).  i do not know if i am in contact with aliens or having psychotic hallucinations or if these are the spirits of dead people.  i need to stay anonymous because my extremely religious family members would be angry with me for even talking about the subject of \"aliens.\"  i used to be extremely religious too but the experiences i've had have completely changed what i know about the world.  now, i don't know what to think.  i belive in the aliens now.  \r\n\r\nthese events usually happen every 2 to 3 months.  i am in the midst of a long stretch of not having \"contact,\" which is good and unusual.  what happens is i will be sleeping.  i then will awaken into paralysis.  then sometimes people will appear as though they've walked through my walls.  they will usually stand or sit beside my bedroom walls or beside my bed.  most of them don't look like aliens.  they look like people- beautiful people, even.  there is an aura about them that is overwhelmingly evil and terrifying.  there have been both men and women.  there have been teenagers and adults. these beings do not feel like a dream or a hallucination.  they feel as real as if i were encountering a regular person.  usually they will start speaking to me or about me.  one middle aged blonde woman appeared suddenly one night and went on a verbal rampage, saying things like \"you're so evil.\"  when the two teenage girls appeared, they spoke to each other about me (specifically, about my habits such as the fact that i usually take a nap at that time of day).  they had a long dagger and held it over my belly and were about to stab me.  i was able to break free when i was able to use all my strength to barely move 2 of my fingers.  i was fighting for my life.  there's no way to describe how scared i was. there have been other horrific experiences like this.  and i met one called pharoah, who i actually sort of liked.  he looked regal and did not speak to me or try to hurt me.  he seemed only interested in watching me.\r\n\r\nthe only one that i have encountered who doesn't look like a person is janus. she looks like a woman combined with a scorpion and a machine.  her presence radiates the worst terror that i have ever felt.  she paralyzes me with fear.  she has been present at my house about 4 times that i can remember.  unlike the others, she does not walk upright.  she crawls.  she is like a crawling woman with a lot of mechanical spider legs.  she has never been allowed to directly touch me, which means somebody must have power over her- or i think she'd have killed me and my whole family by now. she has been in very close proximity to me though, crawling around my bed.\r\n\r\nthere is so much more that i could tell you.  i am suffering from the trauma of what these beings have done to me and the fear that they will come back to hurt me- and worse, to go after my family. i believe these \"people\" have been researching and experimenting on me for years.  when i am sleeping, sometimes i feel like i am being experimented on.  i have painfully felt things inserted into my rectum and vagina.  one moring i woke up and felt like tissue had been removed from my vagina.  also, once, i felt something like an exacto knife pushed into the bottom of my foot.  when the two teenage girls held the knife over me, it seemed that there intention was to cut something out of my belly.\r\n\r\nthe thing is- i've suffered from severe undiagnosed illness for the past 15 years.  i started having severe gynecological complaints followed by agonizing chronic diarrhea (with profound rectal burning) and stomach upset.  i also have problems with my brain.  i have a constant brain fog and strong feeling of discomfort inside my brain.  i have an extensive medical record, including undergoing exploratory surgery out of desperation.  everything always comes back as normal, but i continue to suffer daily from these overwhelming symptoms.  i am starting to believe that these entities have done this to me, and that they are somehow able to hide it from my doctors.  i can't find any other explanation. how do i cope with the fact that i think supernatural entities have been rearranging my body parts?  if a person did this, i'd call the police.  but a person is not doing this.  if an alien is doing it, then there's nothing i can do to save myself.  \r\n\r\nduring the past 10 years or so, my dreams changed.  they became more vivid and very violent.  this is suprising because i am extremely afraid of violence and its not something i think about.  i don't tend to play violent video games or watch violent movies.  i started having traumatic nightmares almost every night.  these nightmares involve being tortured in experiments.  being part of a group that is forced to have our organs harvested.  being part of a group that is forced to fight against other groups (kind of like the hunger games).  in one dream i was with a group of other doomed people and i asked \"how much longer will we be here?\" and a man said \"6 years.\"  in another dream, i saw myself evacuated in a space craft with a group of others like me.

(~40k ft) and was heard after it passed over. \r\n\r\nonce passed, the front, center, front-facing red-green lights were not visible, but has a distinct diamond shape, from the rear; with 3 solid white lights visible (none on bottom corner of 'diamond'). the diamond shape was not visible without binoculars and appeared in the same place a vertical stabilizer would be. \r\n\r\nit was close enough to see the lights of the vehicle reflect of it's surface but no discerned structural features could be seen; general shape akin to an equilateral arrowhead; progressively thicker along the center line; fore to aft. \r\n\r\nnotable comments:\r\nthe 'diamond' shape was the most striking feature of craft. \r\nalso noted mentally the light configuration was \"a good trick\" for potentially deceiving any onlookers as it moved so slowly so as to be almost stationary; and lighting made it appear like a normal aircraft or star, depending on orientation. \r\nalso noted at the time was how it made literally no sound.\r\n\r\npictures:\r\nthe pictures attached were sketched immediately after, and updated the following day after using ios app: \"spyglass\" to get the relative headings and angle of ascent. the sketches are the cardinal direction and degrees above horizon. \r\n\r\nfiles:\r\nimg_3747.Png : #1 -
