i sat and smoked a couple of cigarettes and watched as the lights went down in the house which meant everyone had gone to bed.  i then got into my sleeping bag and was trying to get to sleep, when a mosquito came calling, and wouldn't leave me alone.  i probably layed there for a half hour trying to ignore this bug, and intermittently slapping at it before i finally got up out of the cot, grabbed a shirt and started slinging it all around the inside of the camper to rid myself of the irritation.  after a bit of that, i stopped and listened to see if i could hear the mosquito buzzing any more, facing the house (west) on my knees, when a bright light caught my attention, from the right side (north).  i turned to look and saw a pea or dime-sized glowing sparkly sphere of light above the trees toward the hills to the south.  for three seconds it moved to the right (easterly) and downwards, went behind some tree branches, then appeared again for another three seconds or so, continuing downwards and then disappeared behind more tree branches.  it's flight was jagged, or cork-screwing slightly, not completely smoothe and it was not going fast, but just drifting along somewhat erratically.  it's outline was not distinct, but the glow was circular in form, and the sparkly appearance might be better described as an internal fire exuding streaks or sparks of light.  when i first saw it i thought for a second that it could have been the kids' headlights up on the hill coming home from the dance, but it was way too early for them to be coming home (they didn't come in until the wee hours), and this light was going the wrong direction (they would have been traveling westwardly) and it was no headlight!  i sat and waited for the thing to come back or appear again, but to no avail.  i didn't even think at the time that i could have driven up there to see more; i think i decided that it was long gone and there was no point in searching it out.  after fifteen minutes or so of watching for it to come back, i got back in bed and fell fast asleep. \r\n\r\nweather conditions were extremely hazy and smokey from the california wildfires this summer, but stars were out that night, and so was the moon (full or almost full, i think).  we had had a small amount of rain earlier in the evening (the squall that blew down my tent) but the weather had cleared and i did not observe any clouds in the part of the sky that i could see.\r\n\r\nthe only other thing that might be pertinent is that there is a power line that runs partway along the \"driveway\" to the house along the top of the hills to the north.  the hills there are sagebrush prairie with no trees, but neither the power lines or the hills were visible from my vantage point which was down in the trees near the house.\r\n\r\ni've been spending my summers there for the last seven years, and we have seen some strange things while out star-gazing, but this was the closest (as in, nearest) encounter i have had with any of these strange sightings.\r\n\r\n ","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Other","formattedAddress":null,"id":11920,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":44.1701333,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-08042008-0020","longitude":-107.2209626,"occurred":1215239400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wyoming","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1215239400000,"summary":"A sparkly sphere floated downward behind trees","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Tensleep, Wyoming","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:351893"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (under cloudcover)","city":"Marietta","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Standing outside the carport of our home and taking pictures of sudden fierce storm clouds during an unusual power outage.  when we uploaded the pics and enlarged them we saw the 5 objects shown in the pictures (picture 5). picture 6 has one object still in the frame and picture 4 shows the funnel effect originally.  we did not know there were going to be objects in photographs when they were originally taken.

\r\nat 9:40pm in northern michigan it is still light out side. \r\n\r\nthe size & elevation are hard to estimate. if were a plan or \r\nhelicopter, we would have heard the noise due to the size of the

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"Since i moved to the u.S from puerto rico in 1988, my family and i have been experiencing some abnormal activities at our household in towson, md.  every year we see blue lights in our back yard that illuminates everything in the backyard, even below tall heavy leafed trees.  we can't see where the lights are coming from.  we just see everything and next morning, no one saw a thing.  \r\n\r\na few times we called the police and confirmed that they were not out by helicopter nor on the ground scoping out our backyards with flood lights, possibly looking for a suspect.  the police we called to investigate found nothing.  we never called 911 for something like this again.  it was part of our life here in towson now.  trees around the area have been dying off.  many trees are partially dead.  it wasn't until recently that we concluded and suspect radiation from some craft were the cause to illness to our trees around here.  \r\n\r\nusually, blue light sightings happen any time after 10pm, but most often after 4am at any time of the week.  there has been different experiences at my house.  from time to time my aunt who sleeps in the other room with opened curtains would see lights coming in and out of her bedroom window. white light beams that bend from one window out the other. she also saw lights dancing around her electric light switch.  like chistmas lights shaping around the light switch in different colors going around and around it for about 20 seconds.  my older brother moved out of the house in 1994 to join the army after he had an encounter with entities once, which is why he signed up to go into the army just to get away.  his never been home since, except to visit.  he never talked about it in detail.\r\n\r\nin addition, just recently, my friend steve experienced a sighting one night after i had a visit during my sleep.  for the first time in my life, i heard a strange sound in my sleep and was very relaxed.  i dreamt something weird in which i will not go into simply b/c it was just a senseless dream- a hypnotic kind of dream; i was at ocean city md, while a throbbing like sound clunked within my head; it went \"clumk(pause) clunk, \"pause\", clunk, clunk, clunk... and then repeats for a long time while i slept.  nevertheless, i awoke in panic and the throbbing clunk sound went away.  \r\n\r\ni must of been hearing it for 30 minutes to an hour or more, it didn't seem that long.  i am not sure, but darn, i was so relaxed and then at some point i freaked and woke up.  was i abducted?  i asked myself. i suspect it.  several weeks after that, the same thing.  i have just gone to bed at about 3am, and about 4:30am, i heard that same sound and again, i paid no mind to it and was thinking, wow, here is the same sound...  but i thought this in my sleep.  then, i can tell you that my dogs barked to wake me \"clunk\" \"clunk\" \"clunk.\"  they were alarmed and were barking hard and scared.  something was out there.  i woke up and checked out what was going on and everything seemed to have come to normal.  next day, i had a feeling my friend knew something.  i called him and talked normally without raising the issue to the point where i asked him if he happened to see any blue lights last night.  he is an all nighter.  \r\n\r\nhe said, \"as a matter of fact i did.\"  his father who happens to have lung cancer and still smokes like a chimney saw the lights flooding out from underneath his son's bedroom door.  he told steve to \"shut that thing off\" and steve replied, \"it is coming from outside.\" his father went on to the bathroom to do his business while steve looked out the window to see what was shining so hard and bright.  he said that the blue light was so intense that he felt the heat on his face while looking out from his bedroom window.  it got to the point that he knew he had to step away because it was hurting his eyes.  he got dressed, his father said that it was a helicopter to go back to bed.  steve said \"no, there is no helicopter noise, i am going outside and check it out.\"  as soon as he stepped outside the door, the light stopped and whatever was projecting the light went away.  the next day, a whole tree in his backyard was dead and another was partially dried out.\r\n\r\nthen we get his other friend involved.  steve asked him if he saw anything and he said yes!  let's call steve's friend \"al\" who i also know.  al said that he had encountered strange things that night as well and he lives about 2 miles away from where we live.  he said that he saw the craft and even drew it for us.  that at his second floor window he saw what looked like a floating van, but double wide and double the length and had a dark straight rectangular cabin that came around to a fold to around the side.  it was silver in color and at the bottom of the craft had a round like metal thing that looked like it was the thing keeping it a float, but yielded a lot of blue light and that it had the same thing in the rear and it made no sound.  he said that the craft came close to his second floor bedroom window at his building, he heard a cling, cling on his back yard concrete floor and then it went away. \r\n\r\nal thought he was dreaming and went back to sleep.  next morning, al went to his back yard and found this metal piece with writing on it.  it is a semi heavy piece of stainless steel cleanly cut and shaped like an octagon.  it has measured about  8 inches round with\r\nsymbols carved on 3 corners.\r\n\r\nthe symbols look like an upside down i, and then a square next to it, and then next to it is a two sided triangle (without a line in between) with a dot on the upper left, then this... oo  , then e l's but with a gap at the bottom, nit like an l of our alphabet.  it followed with a period in the center and then another square, a line with a groove at the bottom side of the line, a small square with two dots below it and a dot above it, a diamond shape with two sideways goose eggs inside of it (forming like an 8), a full diamond triangle with a square with a dot underneath of it, and other triangles in different sizes with a big circle above it with a line in between it and a a small circle around the upper part of the inner line and a small box next to it with two dots underneath it and above it.\r\n\r\nlook at included pic.  you may have to magnify or zoom in on it.  the piece was scanned.  you can see the symbols and scratches from being dropped on concrete.\r\n\r\nhe wants nothing to do with it and gave it to me in exchange that i fix his laptop.  so now, i have it in my posession.  i don't know what it does or what it symbolizes, but all i know it is not from this world. \r\n\r\nsteve and i have been looking up at the night sky while walking my dogs and often do see a lot of activity in which normally no one would see because no one is constantly looking up as we have been for the past months.  we see stuff all of the time.  \r\n\r\nif anyone looks up at the night sky for at least an hour every night, i guarantee you will see some strange stuff.  moving stars, duck formation perfect moving air crafts with no noise and no blinking lights, almost camuflaged with the night ski flying faster than jets would.  the lights from the tennis courts help aid the visual of these that occurred 3 different times with 3 different fleets.    i am a believer because i have seen more than once and steve has also seen other stuff as well.   we don't have the right equipment to film this stuff every time we go out at night, so we have no footage.  we've tried, but it is too dark for our cheap cameras to pick up, sorry.\r\n\r\nnevertheless, in continuation of the experience, i sometimes come to steve's house late at night.  i would knock on his window to not wake his parents with a code knock.  well, one night it wasn't me.  he said that he heard knocking without my code at the glass door window at his bedroom.  steve freaked, he turns on the flood light for his backyard, grabs a toy gun (looks real), points it between the curtains to the glass door, opens the curtains and sees a creature with huge black eyes standing close to his glass door staring at him.   he freaked, dropped the toy gun and ran to his parents and alerted them.  of course the entity went away.\r\n\r\nthe week after, steve's father went for his cancer check up/treatment and doctors found that he has been cured from lung cancer!  and yes, he is still smokes like a chimney.\r\n\r\nnow that i am writing this, i am begining to realize that it is very evident that most likely, yes! i have been abducted.  for the reason that i had a feeling that steve knew something and asked him if he happened to see blue lights.  he said yes and how did i know to ask such question?  \r\n\r\nit is possible that i was in the craft while steve was looking up from his bedroom window that same night.  they also knew that i knock on his bedroom window when i visit late at night to not wake his parents.  evidently, i didn't reveal the secret knock.  this is how steve saw the entity sometime after/ \"it\" knew where steve's room was.  i am so freaked out! i don't remember the abduction, but all this is coming together now.  most likely even told them that his father had cancer and they probably helped cure him as well after having a little fun with steve.  \r\n\r\ni really believe that these particular visitors are harmless and were defenately friendly.  all i know is that i don't remember anything but that i was asleep with that smoothing clunk sound in my head and awoke at the first sign of panic, which was very minimal.\r\n\r\nby placing my experience and my friend's experiences, i can put those pieces together and can tell you we've got visited and i got abducted.  and to top it off, we got a present and i ended up with it.  very bizzar stuff.","distance":"21-100 Feet","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Window(s),  Patterned Surface,

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"This wasn���t the first sighting of a ufo, in 1964 a friend and i watched many strange light traverse the heavens and with assurance we could say they were not satellites. satellites cannot perform maneuvers of a triangle from horizon to horizon in less than 10 seconds. part of this is important to the latter part of this saga because it is of a bizarre parallel event. my friend joined the navy but while he was gone there were more ufo sightings near and around bartlesville.\r\n\r\ni had seen many lights in the far distant stop in flight and descend where there had been reports made by other people. but on one particular afternoon i happened to look to the n.E. and see a saturn type of ufo. it was a mirror like sphere with a disconnected ring about the middle. this i thought could only be an hallucination as there was as there was a helical cork screw of fire coming from the bottom that was distended from the sphere and rotating in a clockwise manor. the only thought i can recall of this is that all of this goes against the laws of physics.\r\n\r\nthis encounter i remember happened sometime before i was married in 1966 and that was in may, i remember that it was warm and the grass was just turning green. that was an important factor as when i first saw this object i thought it might be a crop dusting craft. well actually the first thought was that it was one of those aluminum sided trucks in the distance as the reflection from the metal from time to time was blinding me as i drove down highway 75 from bartlesville to tulsa to see my future wife.\r\n\r\nmy background to this sighting is that at this time i was a confused 18-year-old teenager with anger management problems that had tossed a job as a photojournalist out the window because of psychological reasons.\r\n\r\nthe total length of this event may have been as long as 20 minutes. it all began as a trip to see my girlfriend which was a 30 or so minute drive along highway 75. at first there was this annoying flash of bright sunlight in the distance on the road in front of me. it was much like the reflection of sunlight from the rear of a polished metal van and it was becoming irritating that truckers had vans like this just because they looked cool when parked.\r\n\r\nafter about 5 min of this irritation this turned to the e. on what i thought to be a road in the far distance. but to my amazement this luminous object did a rapid turnaround and was traveling w. i thought this to be very curious because a big rig doesn���t have the capabilities to rapidly change directions; then again it changed directions so i thought maybe this was an aerial crop duster. i was thinking that it must be a bell helicopter with the sun reflecting off the bubble canopy they have. also at that time it was a widely used helicopter for crop dusting. in high school i was in the civil air patrol and became very good at identifying aircraft.\r\n\r\nan older friend of the family was a crop duster in arizona so i thought i might stop a while and watch him work as it appeared that it was working his was toward me. the craft made two or three east to west and west to east passes then began a low lever flight northward about 200 meters parallel to the highway much like a crop duster would do. the distance was still over a half mile away but i could tell that it was something hovering over the ground at about 10 meters or less.\r\n\r\nas it traveled toward me the first thing i noticed was the silence of this craft, it was still about a half mile away but there was no sound and that was a very curious thing to me, conventional aircraft make noise at miles away. i think one of my early impressions was that if this is a helicopter traveling that close to the ground why wasn���t there any noise or dust being thrown up by the downdraft?\r\n\r\nthis object kept traveling northward in my direction until i recognized that it was nothing like anything of this world. it was a perfect sphere like that of a mirror, reflecting all that is around it. on it���s surface i could see the ground the sky and the sun beaming back at me. the sun was low on the horizon just minutes before dusk now and the orange orb reflecting from this orb was tolerable enough to be mesmerized by the beauty of a 20 meter mirror sphere with all the world reflecting from it. it was like the sphere in  1984 movie the starman.\r\n\r\nwhen i stopped my vehicle i did stop in the shadow of a surrounding hill and by chance gave me an opportunity to witness something i haven���t heard of anyone else mention in all these years of reading ufo reports. there could be i just haven���t read about it yet. the oddity was that when this spherical object crossed the line of sunlight into the shadow it was like dissolving of the sphere and out came the flying disk.\r\n\r\nat this point the hair on the back of my neck must have been standing straight out because the hair on my head was beginning to tingle. in fact my whole body was beginning to vibrate almost out of control. the object had changed course and was coming straight at me. the adrenalin was pumping so hard my heart went past my throat and felt like it was pounding somewhere in my brain. as it approached a red portal appeared and rotated to my direction, within that portal i saw a being shadowed with barely enough frontal light to distinguish that it was a humanoid face and it was looking directly at me.\r\n\r\ni have never been that terrified in my life because as it approached it had to rise in the air to clear the power lines to fly directly overhead. i don���t remember exactly what i thought at that moment but as that moment went i remember looking for my camera and thinking about temporal distortions.\r\n\r\ni sat there looking out all windows of my vehicle waiting to see where it was going but it never passed overhead. it was like that scene where the girl has to open the door even though she knows there is a boogieman out there. so i���m setting there wondering where this craft is and i know it is straight overhead. finally i get the courage to open the car door and look up. \r\n\r\nthe sky was clear and the sun had gone passed the horizon and it was one of those picture perfect spring afternoons. there is nothing that could have prepared me for this experience. it truly changes all religious views and your prospective on government information.\r\n\r\nlater in years i reunited with my high school chum and on comparing life notes it seems that he too had a ufo experience while on board of a frigate escort ship. from his recounting of his tale it would seem that we had our experiences around the same period except that he exclaimed that his ufo was much larger and followed the uss joulet for a number of days. he was a fire control technician and said that it never showed up on his radar and for something that was about half the size of a frigate destroyer is an accomplishment. said he had pictures but when they came back they were in quarantine and locked down. also told that things would happen to them if they ever told anyone about this encounter. \r\n\r\ni have no idea if his encounter was real or not but then how would anyone ever know if mine was real.\r\n","distance":"20

(either on or about july 18 or 25) i was out after dark in tumwater, wa, which is just south of the state capitol of olympia. i looked up in the sky and saw three steady points of light in the shape of an equilateral triangle heading southwest. the back two lights were white. the front was sort of a peachy amber. the triangle appeared to be passing a star-like object, which i assumed was jupiter. the lights seemed to be on a somewhat twisty path until i realized that this was an illusion caused by the fact that \"jupiter\" was  quite visibly heading east���a coincidence i am not happy to report this as it makes my story considerably more unbelievable without really getting anything in return. it was way too large to be a satellite but, since it was well past the angle where the landing lights of a conventional aircraft would be expected to disappear and be replaced by colored blinkers, i wondered if maybe my memory might be strangely off. to make this story even more needlessly unbelievable, at that exact moment i saw a faint point of light���that is what i would presume to be an actual satellite���cross  \"jupiter���s\" path heading north as if presenting itself for purposes of comparison. how do you like them coincidental apples? after the two unkowns were out of site i checked the clock of my truck which read 10:22 pm. about three hours later at exactly 1:30 am i saw another white light, this one smaller than jupiter but still way too large to be a satellite, heading southeast across the night sky at about the clip of a jet airplane. this time i had the presence of mind to pull out my binoculars. as far as i could tell the light was steady and alone without any blinkers or other colored lights. \r\n\r\nsince then i've seen two more solid night lights, most recently last night (aug. 2nd) when i saw a satellite-sized pinpoint of light heading north at high speed. unlike the others which simply kept moving until behind trees or over the top of a hill, this one dimmed out and vanished. i forgot to get the time but there was some vestigial daylight glimmering past the horizon.  \r\n\r\ni've been working outside at night for a year-and-a-half. i am used to seeing all kinds of aircraft heading out of pdx and the olympia airport. these babies are new to me. they haven't suddenly stopped or changed course or suddenly zoomed off at impossibly
