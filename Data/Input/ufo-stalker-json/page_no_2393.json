keep a lookout on the turnpike (famous sighting at carteret in 2001 , may be repeated, i thought)  saw object one half size of thumbnail at arm's length, dark gray, tortoise shell shaped, 45 degrees from horizon, no movement. i thought it might be plane (near airport), but no wings visible and i watched to see if it was advancing or retreating (changing in size) or if it would catch the sun (shiny like plane) or turn to reveal wings.  it remained gray, same size, no wings.  i was on turnpike, thus kept losing object as the car turned, but reacquired it each time.  it was still there when i unloaded my luggage at airport, and was seen by limo driver as well.  i did not see it disappear, but saw driver still watching it as i went into airport.\r\n\r\nno tether (clear line to horizon visible), at about 45 degrees.  not shiny like aircraft departing and arriving at airport.  no wings.  saw from several different angles as car's position kept changing.  size did not vary.\r\n\r\nnot an airplane, nor a balloon (no movement on breezy day)...Could possibly have been a blimp, but no writing or movement. i only lost sight when i entered the terminal to catch plane.  i was intrigued, but not afraid...I am convinced that any visitors we are having are not belligerent, or we would have known by now.","distance":"Over One

to dropping him off at work.  i was admiring how blue and clear the sky was, thinking about how hot the weather would be today and if i could see any clouds in the sky anywhere.  there were only high thin clouds in the very far south of the sky.  i saw an object that i at first thought may be a small singular flat cloud in the southwest, but as i stared at it, i then thought it was a commercial aircraft as it looked silvery metalic with the sun slightly reflecting off the top of it, but it was at a great distance and height in the sky. i saw the object straight out the front windshield of the car. we were facing southwest and were about to approach the turn in to the parking lot.  i spoke outloud, \"what is that thing?\". my son inquired as to where i was looking as we were approaching the parking lot entrance.  he looked where i was pointing and saw it briefly and said he thought it was an airplane, but he only got to look for about 5 or 6 seconds.  as we were making the right turn, i said \"but it isn't moving\" and crouched down in the car to see up and out the left windows.  he tried to look at it with me out the left side window, and he said he could still see it as we drove very slow into the parking lot. but i instructed him to pull in to a parking spot out in the open because there were many people around and he is just learning to drive.  i then looked away to instruct him where to park so that we would have a clear view of that area of sky away from trees.  we parked and quickly stepped out of the car, searching the same area of sky, but the object was gone. i looked and instructed my son to look, in the surrounding area of the sky as if it were a jet and had traveled in the several seconds that we were parking the car. after approximately 30 seconds of searching in the sky and finding nothing, my son walked in to work and i got in to my car and looked at the clock to see it was 11:34am.  heading back home, i pulled in to a school parking lot on a small hill a few blocks away from where i left my son. i sat and looked around the southern and western skies for about 5 minutes. i couldn't find anything in the south or west, not even any commercial aircraft.  as i type this, i now find it odd that i didn't see any commercial aircraft either.\r\n\r\ni have been trying to run through my mind what other possiblities it could be, but nothing else makes sense.  i sincerely feel that is was not an aircraft such as a commercial passenger jet that we frequently see as we are approximately 10 miles from dfw airport. this object was stationary. i truely believe there would have been obvious movement across the sky, and how close it would have to be for even the largest commercial jet airplane to be that length. besides, the length to thickness ratio was not proportionate to any of the commercial aircraft that i have seen. this was cigar shaped from our angle, or possibly some other flat shape and we were just viewing along its edge.  the lack of clarity of the metalic surface, even though it did appear like the silver skin of a commercial jet, makes me believe it was very far away, making it very, very large in size. i thought about the possiblity that it was a reflection of some sort inside the car onto the inside windshield, however, i continued to see the object in the same spot in the sky as we were turning. \r\n\r\ni do have a great interest in ufo phenonenom. i have only had one other sighting experience about 5 years ago, but i have never submitted any kind of report before.  this particular experience left such a feeling that i know i saw something that didn't make sense.  i felt i had to report this, and hope that others saw what i did and will report it as well.\r\n\r\nthank

up from the coutch and with the ideia of playing with the cat, as i got near the windows, a bright orange light caught my attention. it was over the ocean and it was very bright and big. at first i thought it looked like a meteor fireball, but unlike these, it wasn't moving. since i'm an amateur astronomeur and a aviation ethusiast i knew that the object was something else, i called my wife who also saw the object.\r\n i stood there a few seconds looking at it, then grabed the binocolous and run outside the house, as i got out the light wasen't there anymore, and apparently nothing was in it last known position, i called for my wife asking if she still had visual contact and she told me that in a few seconds that she looked away the object disapeared.\r\n then, from the object's previous location a small and bright white light came on, and it was moving, i looked at it for several minutes until it came near enough for an identification. the white light i saw was actually the landing lights of an aircraft, but even as it crossed the sky and it got near me it's light and size wasn't comparable to the orange sphere.\r\n my guess, that aircraft and some interaction with the object and only a few seconds after the object went away it was able to turn it's lights. notice that although aircraft usually pass by the path of yesterday's aircraft, i never saw one turn it's lights before, and for a few seconds, it had no lights on.\r\n as for my fellings during the event, as soon as excluded that the orange sphere was something natural or man made, i just wish it got near so i could shoot it with my shotgun.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

sitting in the back of our pick up truck looking for falling stars. it was about 2:am and there was a full moon so the sky and surroundings were lit up like daytime. it wasn���t the best situation for viewing a meteor shower but we had nothing better to do at the time. and although we didnt see any falling stars we did see something else that has been etched in my mind ever since and something that i think about quite often.\r\n\r\nwe found a dirt road that was just off of the main highway. we were several miles outside of town and there was another man there with his two kids, they were parked maybe 100-200 feet away from us and i can.Remember being able to see everything they were doing as if it was the middle of the day. they had a big telescope setup in the back of there pickup truck and apparently had the same idea that we did.\r\n\r\nalthough it was very bright out because of the moon, the horizon was black except for the glow coming from a town that was maybe 10-20 miles away. i remember looking at the sky in the direction of the town when i noticed the entire horizon started to slowly turn pitch black, even blacker than before. i remember thinking to myself why are the lights from the town disappearing from the ground up. the ���blackness��� kept getting larger (taller) and eventually completely blocked out the glow of the town in the distance. i remember asking my wife several times \"what is it\". i thought that it might have been a storm front moving in. i remember looking around the sky for other clouds and there wasn���t s single cloud in the sky. the sky was so bright that i could have seen a small bird flying hundreds of feet over my head. after 5 minutes or so i could see the lights from the town starting to appear again from the ground up. i could also still see what now looked like a black band stretching all the way across the sky. \r\n\r\ni stood there staring at this band as it moved towards us for at least 20 minutes, the closer it got the larger it appeared, and eventually it moved directly over us. when it \"rolled\" or gently \"glided\" overtop of us it was a perfect cylinder shape that stretched all the way across the sky to my left and to my right. the one thing that keeps popping into my head two decades later is that i remember saying to my wife even as this thing was right over top of us is \"what is it\". i could clearly see it, it directly overhead but i could figure out what i was looking it.\r\n\r\nwhen directly overhead the color appeared to be a dark gray color. it has no markings, lights, sounds or anything that suggested that it was \"man\" made other than the perfect shape and uniformity of this thing which instantly convinced me that it was not a naturally occurring object.  i also remember thinking that it has a \"soft\" appearance to it, maybe because it was tubular in shape and lighter than the black background of the sky. it gave me the impression of a pipe gently rolling across a perfectly smooth surface as it moved across the sky.\r\n\r\nive only told some close family members about it and ive always told them that if this thing was 1000 feet over my head that it would have to had been 200 feet in circumference, and so long that i couldnt see the ends of it, and if it was much higher than that, then the size would have been even larger.\r\n\r\nwell that���s my story. it is true and i just wish that i could not only convey what i saw but also share the feelings that were/are connected to the experience. i can say with 100% certainty that what i saw was not a naturally occurring phenomena or even remotely similar to anything that ive ever seen before or since.  but what i cant say with any certainty is whether or not it was military related\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile,

he was an e7 sargent in the army \"aircraft mechanic and teacher\". the object was flying very eratic, not in direction but speed, from extremly fast to almst a stand still. i was 13 years old a the time and had been on army bases all my life and going to the airplane hangers and seeing just about everything that flew at that time i knew it was not a plane or helicopter. up to the point of seeing the object that night my past experiance with being around aircraft was pretty extensive, i saw the first concord sst being tested for cold weather in fairbanks alaska , my father was stationed at fort waynewrite at the time to going out to white sands nm watching what ever he was working on, i whitnesd drone planes towed by an airplane being shot down with some type of lasser light emited from a large flate panel that looked like a solar panel mouted on an apc.\r\ni saw the green/blue object a least 4 times after the first time and then something very odd happened a few weeks \"aprox\"

about the duty. i was listining to them because my father was his boss and my bedroom window faced the carport. my father was a very abusive father and had a very bad temper so naturaly when i saw him talking to that man i got scared. fort bliss had seemed to be more uptight or uneasy over the next few weeks for some reason, the guards at the gates looked and checked everyone just a little harder, i know this not only from comeing and going from the bass but i live a half block from the north gate and used to watch the guards. i asked my dad much to my insecurity about what was going on around the base and much to my surprise he told me there was something being guarded in a hanger on base that no one was aloud to talk about, he did say it was on what i knew at the time as a tank hauler truck. he never taled about it again, we got transfered 3 mounths latter, the last month he put me on restriction for something  did and i could not go anywhere until we moved. he was in the army 21 years, his last mos was in our home town, tampa fl. , he worked out on mcdill airforce base. i am now 47 years old and my health is not good due to carbon monoxide poisoning,i as my father wasa mechanic. i wanted to tell my story just incase i'm not around much longer. i would like to add that during my adult life i have always been fasinated with military aircraft, theoligy, how everything and anything works, i have studied for years and years about aircraft and if i dont know about something i find out. i consider myself a knowledgeble , logical and enquiering person. my grandfather was a babtist preacher so my knowledge of religion is deep and yet i still have this want and passtion about the univerce and the strong feeling that we can't be all there is. something did happen in 1974 on fort bliss, i just don't know what. i have watched every show, documentary on ufo's , i am even a mufon member and yet i never told anyone about fort bliss and what i saw and heard but in hindsite my fathers stint in the army and his scary , eratic abusive behavior just don't add up. my father was in viet nam in hue during the tet offensive, he was working alongside the cia with the ov-1 mohawk testing the flear radar, to what extent i dont know. i apologias for my miss spelling and jumping around, its just for so any years i have tried to connect the dot's.  \r\nsincerely,

same direction and not one broke formation and they all faded into cload at the same time .There was no wind at the time and no rain but after they passed it started to rain heavy as the last large orb went out of sight to the east in the direction of loughborough leicestershire ,i found this sighting very strange as there was no noise and each orb was moving at a set speed and was not floating because they all seemed to keep perfect time and did not seem at the mearsy of the elements . this was all recorded on video and on looking at the recording on close up the orbs seemed like golf balls with flatened tops. \r\n\r\ni dont beleve in little green men but this i have never seen before and was told that it was chinese latterns with i dont beleave as the direction they came is wooded and i have never seen laterns in mountsorrel in 30 years nor has my parents ,i dont have a answer i just know this was no aircraft i know and thought you might be interested as it fit the pattern of resent sighting around the uk.\r\n\r\nthanks for lisening< pete harrison  (my brother has footed that i will obtain and send to u

object then started moving at a fairly fast pace (like an aeroplanes speed) from west to east over cardiff. as we watched it we discussed what it could be. it wasn't a balloon as it was moving to fast, and was traveling along a horizontal plane. we thought it couldn't be a plane or something on fire as it it wasn't losing any height . we watched the object for about 5 minutes as it disappeared into cloud to the east. all the time it flared bright orange, like it was on fire, and kept a constant speed(about that of a commercial airliner)and trajectory until it disappeared into cloud

stephenville, texas. this light would sometimes dim down somewhat and then become very bright. attempted to \"signal\"  this light with an 18 v flashlight and it seemed to get brighter in response. it made my son nervous and he asked me to stop. \r\ntook two photographs with standard lens and what was surprising is that it photographed out green instead of white and changed it's shape drastically. photos were 15 seconds apart. it appeared to be about 3 to 5 miles away, but very difficult to determine distance. it was low over the hills and i am sure it was not picked up on radar as no planes intercepted it. the first photo showed a green ball shaped object. however, the second photo showed it to be flat. as this was extrodinary, it was nothing compared to the second sighting one month later on about the same date, may 10th 2008. this light was in same location the second time. i used a 4 power zoom lens. what i saw made me fall out of my chair. this object seemed to be a combination of a \"thing\" and a machine. some sort of exploratory craft. however, the position of it's head was 180 deg. away from me but the second photo showed that it had moved much closer towards me and was \"looking? at me. this second photo was shot about 10 seconds later. when i look at these photos it makes my skin crawl. i tried to drive up to where i thought it might be, but turned around and came back with some sense of dread. \r\n\r\ni showed these last two photos to three engineers in my professsion behind closed doors in their conference room and they were at a complete loss to explain it. \r\nthey asked that i not release them on the web and to further investigate on my own with a video showing the changes. i am very reluctant to show them to anyone at this time as it may be posssible that i will go up there on august 11th or so and maybe get better photos. i son't want this area to be overrun with a bunch of ufo nuts. although i don't see how they could be better except for video. \r\n\r\ni may release them later, but am not sure at this time. i do not want any recognition or any thing else for them. i just want to know what it is.\r\n\r\ni discussed this sighting with a law enforcement officer and he informed me that that was a very desolate area.\r\n\r\ni am not using my real name. just call me bart.","distance":"Over One

chicago with two circular orange lights chasing it from behind. i pointed it out to my friend and he claimed it was fireworks, but fireworks cannot reach that high and chase planes. the lights were making the plane look small, and the color of these lights looked like a sunset. they were not blinking, and they were off angle one from another. in a slant position. as the plane maintained it easterly course, the lights dimmed out and changed directions to the south. i prayed for it to come back so i could recorded it, i went and got my digital camera and waited for it to return. about 20 minutes later what appeared to be another ufo appeared in the sky almost directly above my position. this one seemed alot smaller and more distant then the first.\r\n\r\nthe lights were blinking in a pattern i have never seen before on any plane. it appeared to have no noticeable wings and was moving very slow and silent. i recorded 1 minute and 16 seconds of this ufo. i would share it with the world but i am embarrassed of the way i was talking while recording the phenomenon. i was to excited and got carried away with my language. ever since these two sitings, everytime i step outside my house on the balcony or through my front door. i am always looking for it and hoping it returns for me. i believe so much that it was a ufo that i purchased a camcorder equipped with nightvision and 25 times optical zoom so i can get a real good close up of the object next time it comes. if it ever comes back. i really hope it does. i am a true believer now that i have seen it with my own eyes, i always believed they existed, but now...I seen it with my own eyes. i truly hope it comes back. if anyone at this contact center wants to see this footage that i have please contact me directly. i left my information available. thank you in advance.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering then

noticed it right below the big dipper. the one thing that caught my attention was that i noticed the object was heading away in a northwest direction, but the lights were pointed in my directions. i do not think that airplane lights are lit backwards?????? 1 minute after the object faded, a plane was heading west around the same area and the lights were completely recognizable for being a plane, but the object red and green lights were nothing i had ever seen before. if i was to guess the distance of the object from my position, the closest i would have to say was around 50 miles in a
