object flying relatively low in the sky. it appeared completely flat, no tail, no wings and possibly a silver color. as i was driving i continued to watch it; it stayed ahead of me at somewhat an even speed, but faster than i was driving. i would also add it was approximately 1/2 mile to 1 mile in distance from me, but with no obstructions - sw oklahoma is very flat, so i could see it very plainly.\r\ni actually pulled over to the shoulder to continue to watch the object, and then saw it just stop (hovered), right in the sky, for approximately 4-5 seconds, and then shot up in a 90 degree angle, so fast it was gone. this was not crop duster, no helicopter, and i did ask a relative who is an air force retiree, still an active pilot, if he knew of anything that could just stop and \"hover\", and then fly straight up so fast, then be gone. to his knowledge he knew of nothing. \r\nmy feelings and reactions were only of awe and surprise. i've never seen anything just stop mid-air, shoot up, and then disappear. i was also interested in the shape - no tail, no wings, etc. \r\nthough this happened several years ago, i still wonder about it; have meant to report it several times, and still wonder what it might have been.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path,Path with directional

saw a bright point of orange/white light at approx. 30/45 degrees above the horizon, more or less eye level for a driver.  i sat there and looked at it, believing it to be an aircraft reflecting the light of the setting sun behind me in the west, or a glare on the windshield, but i easily ruled out glare simply because the sun had set behind the horizion and the parkinglot lights had not yet turned on.  i thought that it had to be a plane or a helicopter.\r\n\r\nit initially began as a single exceptionally bright point of light, perhaps half as large as a dime held at arms length and very bright orange/white, much like an incandecent lightbulb.  i saw that it was moving in an east to west direction directly towards me.  thinking it was a plane i left my vehicle and prepared to head into work, though after retriving several items from the cab of my truck i again looked at the object and saw that it was still moving east to west, now much closer -60 to 70 degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nthe formerly bright light had dimmed considerably, it's size decreasing to half what i had initially seen it.  i thought this odd since a plane heading into the sun would have continued to maintain a constant or increasing glare/reflection, rather than decreasing.  i stopped and watched the object at this unusual development.  i cannot honestly say when the object changed from a brignt point, i was looking around the parking lot to see if anyone else was observing it.  i looked back up and the object was almost directly overhead, the single point of light was now a clearly defined set of four, much like a triangle, with the upper point being the direction of travel, and two lights set on either side joining the point.  the sky was overcast, and i cannot be sure just what the altitude was, but i could not decern any mass within the lights, and the formation's size was about the same as a quarter held at arm's length.\r\n\r\ni looked at my watch and around me once again to see if anyone else was looking, and when i returned my gaze to the sky, the object had vanished.  i could not see anything that may have caused a reflection, such as an aircraft flying in a westerly course.  i have seen many planes flying over this area, this object did not exibit any similarity to the craft i have normaly seen.  and i can say with absolute certainty that there was nothing visible within the area bracketed by the four lights.  i observed the object for apporximately fifteen minutes and it did not vary it's course or speed in any way during that time.  i cannot say that i felt any kind of confusion or overwhelming emotion when i saw this, for the most part until i saw the four lights in place of the single sphere i considered it to be a plane.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:15:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line

started to look around the sky for a couple of minutes but couldn't see anything, the sound disappeared, approximately 30 seconds after it disappeared it started again. now i could still not see anything that was making this noise. i was facing the back tree in my garden when at a 2 oclock angle from my tree a light shot by quite high up in the sky about 2 inches and disappear, the sound stopped. now usually when i see a light pass by in the sky at that speed i think shooting star. but this was way too big i would say roughly the size of a one pence piece if held arm-stretch away towards the sky. the fact that the sound disappeared shortly afterwards is also a little bit too coincidental in my books.\r\n\r\ni came back outside a couple of times for a few minutes after 2am to

while driving home(initial sighting) from work on state road 25 (south towards rochester), and about 4-5 miles out of warsaw and just past the devil's backbone (section of road with numerous s curves) caught a glimpse of several orange colored spheres (three of them) in no organized formation to the south of my location, roughly about 25 degree elevation above the horizon. observed no actual movement except that the spheres were lazily drifting about and in view roughly 10 - 20 seconds then as if someone turned off a switch they were gone. continue to observe the sky line while driving and about 5 miles down the road again observed again three orange spheres (close to the town of mentone)again as if someone turned on a switch. location this time to my orientation again about 25 degrees elevation but more to the south-west and again lasting about 20 seconds and then vanished. the second observation noted that 2 of the spheres were side to side of each other with the 3rd elevated above the other 2 at about 35 degrees elevation from horizon with a slow movement to the west then again vanished. after passing through mentone and about 3 mile from the intersection of sr 25 and sr 110 again observed the three orange spheres directly to west of my location in a single file formation again about 25 degrees elevation from the horizon but with a noticeable movement to the north. at this point lost sight of the spheres due to heavy tree line and change in driving orientation. these spheres were noted again the next four nights while driving home on the same road and about the same time for each of the following nights usually noted direction to the south - south west. distance from my point of view to the spheres, in a linear direction, guessed to be about 10 - 15 miles off. total time spheres observed was over a 20 minute time period for each of the five nights.\r\n\r\non all five nights that the spheres were noted, the weather was clear and no clouds noted in the sky, the sun was still noted just about setting to the west. also noted that there were stars just starting to come into view at the time of observing the spheres. (note these spheres were not stars or planets of any type or size as they were well defined spheres and had no wink effect as a star or planet would have viewing through the atmosphere). also made note that they were no other aircraft observed to be in the air at the time, because i made an attempt to recognize and look for any form of the typical red/green running lights that aircraft have their wings and noted no bright white light that would be on the tail of an aircraft either. also observed no contrail, exhaust or wake near or around the spheres.\r\n\r\nat first thought the lights might of been flares set off by a military aircraft(the type of flares used when heat seeking missiles are fire at them, to try to divert the missile, plus the location to the south is grissom afb)but these flares are of a very bright white in color and last for a duration as these were orange (like a pale colored pumpkin)and then just winked out and not just fade out like a flare would. unable to note any noise or sound from any form of propulsion as i was inside my car driving. these spheres were very similar to ones that i had noted about 3 years while out star gazing with my telescope except for that episode noted that there were four spheres in a formation, that of a trapazoid again noted to the south - south west and moving to west at about 3 - 5 mph.\r\n\r\nmy feelings at the time of the first sighting july 21, was exhilarating to see another ufo as i have seen many in the past. also brought back things that i had learned in a couple of night courses that i had taken at vincennes university 67 - 77 presented by j. sievers and k. tevorbough, and tried to follow the procedures that they discussed to document these type of sightings.\r\n","distance":"Over One

to maintain the clearest account for reference, but am unable to find it in your report database.]\r\n\r\non saturday, 2/17/07, i exited the golf course where i play just after sunset. at that time of year, it would have been close to 5pm. as i drove out the exit road, i noted, when the road made a turn to nw, a strange silhouette approaching at speed from the southwest. i at first thougt it some type of raptor, like a red-tailed hawk, but the shape was not right and the course was too straight. it was unusual enough to continue to engage my full attention. i stopped the car and dropped the window while i continued to watch this strange-looking airborne object still in silhouette. i then quickly made a turn to the west at the intersection to improve my angle and stopped the car again to watch this object continue to approach from the sw. the object exhibited no strobe lights at all which are customary on domestic aircraft, and now at this new angle the object was no longer in silhouette and was much nearer now. \r\ni am not an engineer, but i know enough to recognize that the known laws of physics say this aircraft should not have been in the air. there was nothing aerodynamic about its shape at all. two metallic spheres were placed opposite the other behind the mid-point of the central section of the craft that i can only call the \"fuselage\". the spheres were a burnished copper color, with a black line running around their equators. from my viewing angle, the rear of craft was obscured by the spheres. the \"fuselage\" itself, as much as i could see of it, was shaped like a shuttlecraft as featured on the \"star trek\" series, with a downard sloping nose. i can only guess the altitude of it, not knowing its actual size, but i would estimate it at not more than 1500 feet. and it was totally silent as it passed just to the south of my vantage point...It made no noise at all, not even the rush of air being split. it then appeared to bank a little left, and disappeared out of sight over the hills and pines to the north behind me. the total time it engaged me was 2 to 3 minutes.\r\ni have never seen anything like it, before or since. i was breathlessly stunned and awed. i hurried home to call the pd and the newspaper to see if any reports witnessing this had been made, as the course the object was on would have taken it right over the

couple of days ago, the sky seemed to have more plane and helicopter traffic it looked like either a small plane or helicopter was getting closer to get a look at it and suddenly the plane veered off to the right, my guess that they saw what i've been seeing.  then the triangle shaped one disappeared, or turned off the lights, then when the planes went away about 30 minutes later the red, green & white lights came back on and it was in the same spot.  some nights there are 3, same one on the left, disc shape white circle lights all around, then one little one farther center, then the triangle shaped one on the right.

just white lights, and one with red, green & white lights. no one seems too concerned about this, people wrote to the local newspaper but that's about it.  i didn't think levittown, pa had anything that interesting to be watching.  if they want people to see them why can't they be seen in the day time.  they don't seem to be hiding at night.  don't know if i would want them to come any closer

caught in on film (see photo if i was sucessful in uploading to you). object thrown out looked like a sphere not brightly lit. also something smaller or further away?? to the west and a shooting, very fast object just below polaris stopped abruptly to the north - 3 objects total but one in south more significant than the others. wife and son saw all of this as well - got them out in the yard. have been trying to debunk - no shuttle, no iss in my area during these sightings according to my research - have at least 40 photos most not very good. used a sony cyber shot with a 10x zoom - tried

and about 50 to 80 feet vertical altitude ) but when i  got closer  to the object  then  i realized that it was not a helicopter (at that moment i was about 70 feet horizontal distance and 50 feet to 80 feet vertical altitude) then the ufo starting  to move to my left side (90 degrees from driver seat) at the point i was thinking that it was a small airplane because i did not set the rotors but the object was moving to slow, about 10 mph, and did not have beacon lights, nor red or green lights like airplanes , it did not have the shape of an airplane nor the sound, it was silence because i rolled down my window and i heard only the engine of my car ,  it had triangular delta shape 3 white lights one in each corner of the triangle shape(underneath), color was metallic gray the borders

years removed, the event is just as clear and vivid to me today as if it just happened. my eyesight is excellent and is confirmed at 20/12. upon furlther analysis of that day the \"silver object\" was less than a 1/4 mile away and ~ 200 ft. above the trees. i relive this event in my mind every time i walk out on my dock...\r\n\r\nit was late afternoon and as i was putting the cover on my boat i looked up into the sky and i noticed an extremely shiny (silver/metallic) cigar-shaped object traveling in an east to west direction. the object traveled at a very slow rate of speed and at a constant velocity. there was absolutely no sound that emanated from the object. there was no con-trail, no wings, no windows, no lights or anything of discernible nature that would suggest that this was an aircraft or balloon. the object seemed to reflect the bright sun off the surface, but then i noticed that a vertical band of light started to appear from the front of the object and traveled slowly to the back of the object. this band of light appeared every 15 seconds or so and traveled over the surface of the object (from the front to rear). the object did not change speed, hover or change direction at all. i observed the object for about 2 minutes and tracked it until it went out of sight over the tree line. the weather conditions at the time of the sighting was absolutely clear. my impression is that the object was relatively small, maybe the size of a small plane, and that the altitude of the object was ~1000ft. i truly have never seen anything like it in my life... i hope that someone else had seen this object, taken video or pictures and can confirm this sighting... i am truly blown-away at what i saw and can't stop thinking about the event...\r\n\r\nupdate:\r\n\r\nadditional recalled observations that eventful afternoon: \r\n\r\nps. also, when i viewed the object, the rear hemi-spherical end was \"out of focus\" the appearance was like as if you could take a picture of the cigar-shaped object in sharp resolution, but the back portion (and probably the front) was simply \"blurred\" . my instinct is telling me that this object has a tremendous gravitational field running thru the axis of the object and that reflected light is being bent... only a guess... also, as the vertical band of light traveled over the surface of the object (imagine the light emanating on a perpendicular line from the surface of the object) as the light traveled to the back of the object (on the curved rear surface) all of a sudden i saw a prism of multi-colored light hit me (similar as if you accidentally glanced into one of the laser scanners in a food store). finally, the surface of the object was shiny but not polished. again, similar to a semi-gloss (silver colored) ceramic substance... sorry for not conveying this information the first time, but since i still constantly think about this event, i wanted to put down everything i saw that eventful afternoon... \r\n\r\none of my repeating fascinations with this event was seeing with my own eyes the \"out of focus\" hemi-spherical ends of the object. if i was actually viewing \"gravitational lensing\" in a near field environment, this might give a clue as to a kind of propulsion system certain types of crafts like these possess. another observation that i failed to report was that the large band of white light that appeared on the surface of the craft had a smaller band of white that trailed the larger one. (there was no \"mirror image\" of the smaller white light band on both sides of the larger light band, only that the smaller light band trailed the larger band and was smaller in width...\r\n\r\nquestion: \" has others reported similar observations of \"out of focus\" sections of craft/objects???\" \r\n\r\nto answer the mufon questions:\r\n\r\n1)  something (in my mind) told me to turn around and look up into the sky.  i actually started to walk up the stairs to my cabin, but i stopped dead in my tracks and turned around to see this incredible object!\r\n\r\n2)the object was in clear sight and the afternoon was perfectly clear and still (minimal wind (if any)).  everything was extremely still, but i did hear the sound of crickets.\r\n\r\n***  the very interesting thing i recall now was that there was nobody on the lake (not anybody in screaming distance to call to) to observe the object.  this alone is somewhat unique in that at that time of day usually there are numerous fishermen, boats, swimmers, people on their docks.  i purposely looked around all the docks on our small bay and i was alone with that 'object'.\r\n\r\n3)i immediately thought the object was a ufo and that i was observing something that was not of this planet.\r\n\r\n4)my first reaction was to run up the stairs and get my wife to observe, but i felt that if this was going to be my only time in life to observe a craft like this i would \"turn on\" all my observational skills and intently take it all in (in real time).  i purposely turned away from the 'object' for a few seconds and then looked back at the craft to see if i was not dreaming and every time the 'object' had moved to the position i thought it would be in...  just further along its vector trajectory path.\r\n\r\n5) to say i was excited would be an understatement as you can imagine, but the event was so \"incredible\" i have relived it thousands of times over and over in my mind.  i can't stop thinking about this event for some reason...\r\n\r\ni have tried to convey everything that occured those 2 minutes in my life and i hope that some individuals can relate to the profound impact that an event like this has on a persons life...","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11808,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":45.9323901,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292008-0012","longitude":-89.2616085,"occurred":1054796400000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Wisconsin","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,  Cylinder","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1054796400000,"summary":"Daylight observation of cigar shaped (pill) - wisc.

really don't remember which year.  i was travelling with my then husband in a pick-up truck ging south to key west.  he was driving, i was the passenger.  it was daylight, a clear day, about 1 pm.  as we were coming off one of the numerous bridge spans in the keys, to my right, above a residence on a key, on the gulf side, bordering the gulf, half on top of the house and half on top of the water, i could not help but notice a huge metallic object hanging there in the sky, very close to the house and water, just hovering, probably 3/4 of it enshrouded in clouds.  the part i could see below the cloud cover looked like the bottom part of a missile, or the tail of a blimp, but it was upright.  this is the only part i could see.  it was huge. stationary. i rolled down my window to get a better look.  there was absolutely no sound to it,and i was close enough that i should have been able to hear something of that size if it was generating any noise.  lots of people were pulled over on the side of the road looking up at it, pointing, but my husband was terrified, and despite my begging, he would not pull over and just floored it away from there.  i was so excited, something i'd never seen before, i thought it was a ufo.  i looked back as we were driving away, and it just vanished.  i remember checking all the papers on the rest of our trip, but never could find any report about it.  i never reported it.  but all i know is that the rest of the trip i only looked toward the skies.  in recent years, i've checked on the computer to see if i could find a reporting of this, but i've had no luck.","distance":"21-100

sightings were very close to each other. the first one i was resting out very late at night, close to an old school i knew from childhood. i lay my head up against a mound of dirt and grass, the playground to my right. looking up at the sky littered with stars i saw an object that was moving. this object was small and moving in many different directions as if it were a living being. it changed shape, became elongated wove in and out of clouds. this could have easily been something explainable i suppose...A meteor or comet entering the earths protective layer...Or maybe just my eyes playing tricks, but they usually don't. the next sighting i saw while i was sitting outside of my house. there i sat in a white lawn chair, looking up at the sky i saw an object move and stop move and stop, also lights beneath and to the sides and bottom of the object were noticable but strangely so. what i'm trying to say is that there were very faint things like blurbs of light going on beside the object. were these sightings not from this earth? i don't know, i find it unlikely though that human beings having been on this earth for such a long time that now all of a sudden we're starting to provoke a greater frequency of sightings. or perhaps it's something the government is doing...Yes i believe that is more likely. sorry no photos digital cameras are too expensive

formation directly over my house. they made two passes, and after they flew by the second time, i happened to see at the top of the cloud, the cigar shaped object. it was the same color as the cloud top- an ivory white color,and was devoid of any wings or tail control surfaces. i couldn't see any portholes, but it clearly was not a commercial airliiner. it was moving due south, and i lost sight of it as it went back into the clouds. i called several tv news stations, and channel 10 said that they had received numerous calls about the fighters, but i was the only one who saw the object. channel 10 was also told the the jets were conducting \"training excercises\". i asked the person if he really thought that the air force would be conducting training excercises in commercial airspace like that. the obvious answer is no- the usaf was scrambled up there!! also, i guess it just a matter of time until  i saw the \"mother ship\", as there have been numerous personal sightings of

think they fly that high and that fast or in a very straight line.  next thought was an aircraft but the distance and speed between the flashes appeared too fast and too far apart for any airplane that may be in the area.  (no more fighter jets at the air guard base in sioux city.)  also, there was no noise associated with the flashes of light.  finally, i thought maybe a shooting star.  do shooting stars flash multiple times?  not sure.  do shooting stars appear under cloud cover?  probably.  i did see a shooting star earlier in the week, but it was a clear night and the shooting star was a nice bright streak that fragmented at the end.  what i saw last night was two flashes that appeared quickly in a straight line.  i lost sight of whatever it was as it went over my house.\r\ni know this doesn't seem like much of a sighting, but it did get me thinking.  what was the air traffic like in the area at that time?  why wasn't there any noise?  how fast was it going?  was it truly a ufo or something mundane?\r\ni would like to know if anyone else saw this as well.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11798,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":42.588324,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292008-0002","longitude":-95.9675165,"occurred":1217306700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Iowa","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Flash,  Star-like","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1217306700000,"summary":"Two rapid flashes in a row in a straight line going wnw.","tags":["ufo"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":["http://www.mufoncms.com/files_jeud8334j/11798_submitter_file1__003.JPG"],"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Kingsley, Iowa","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:352099"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Over 500 Feet (no cloudcover)","city":"Prescott","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was outside on my front porch having a cigarette when i looked up and saw a dome shaped object with green and red flashing lights hovering and moving slightly side-to-side in the far distance of the lower southern sky.  i grabbed my binoculars and took a better look... and it was definitely something not of this earth.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Dome","flightPath":"Hovering then path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11797,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":34.5469142,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07292008-0001","longitude":-112.4640525,"occurred":1217313000000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Arizona","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1217313000000,"summary":"Dome shaped with green and red flashing lights...","tags":["hovering","lights"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Prescott, Arizona","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:352100"}],"last":false,"totalElements":82760,"totalPages":2759,"sort":[{"direction":"DESC","property":"_id","ignoreCase":false,"nullHandling":"NATIVE","ascending":false}],"first":false,"numberOfElements":30,"size":30,"number":2394}
