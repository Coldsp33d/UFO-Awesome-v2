couch.  it shook the house and sounded like something had exploded.  i immediately went outside but could hear no sirens only the faint sound a plane's engine.  having experienced many sonic booms i was shaken by this boom.  it was definitley different.  when i went to work the following morning (wednesday),in kokomo, no one had heard anything the previous night.  i  went back home that evening and did not hear anything on wednesday night.  however, upon returning to work on thrursday, everyone one in kokomo was talking about the boom on wednesday evening!  i was very intrigued by this.  when i returned home from work that night there was definitey increased plane activity in the sky.  these were jets, f-16's not the everyday plane you hear crossing the sky.  as it got dark, i was talking on the phone to my mother who lives in kokomo.  i was shocked when she began to become very excited about orange lights she was seeing in the sky.  i immediately went outside and looked to the southwest sky.  through the trees i saw a single orange sphere.  it was larger than a star and was not constantly lit.  i had been looking through a large open area of the tree and this orange light slowly came on, achieved it brightness and then dimmed again.  i only saw one light, it was stationary and unlike anything i had ever seen.  my mother saw 10-12 of the same type of lights that i saw.  i felt then and still feel that i saw something unexplained.  i wondered if there could be a connection between the booms heard in logansport and in kokomo and was very curious about the increase in plane activity that night.","distance":"Over One

repeated itself two nights.\r\n\r\nbright light low over israel - original footage july 27th 2007\r\n\r\n\r\njuly 26th, 2:15 canadian pacific time, i browsed to israel's biggest newspaper \"yediot ahronot\"'s website, called \"ynet\".\r\n\r\nin their main page was a link to reports of bright lights seen over israel. the report included a multitude of witnesses seeing two bright lights hovering over israel, being seen from the center of israel all the way to the south, a distance of roughly 150 km.\r\n\r\nthe article included viewer comments and can be found, in hebrew, here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Ynet.Co.Il/articles/0,7340,l-3573410,00.Html\r\n\r\nhere is the geographical location of the reports:\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/reportsarea.Jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe viewer comments included a heated debate whether these are military flares or not. such military flares are very common in israel. some \"experts\" claimed these are not flares while other \"experts\" claimed these are. many a religious commenter claimed these are signs from god and many other claimed meteors.\r\nsome claimed ufo's. the flares and meteor claims were problematic because people saw the things in the same place for two hours.\r\n\r\nsome reports said the ufo's were over beer sheva, in the south (city of biblical abraham for your religious crowd).\r\n\r\nso i called my father (12:30am beer sheva time), woke him and wife. i wish for all of you to have a father (thanks, dr. t) that you can call in the middle of the night from over the ocean and tell him to open the window and scan for ufos!!!\r\n\r\ninstead of hanging the phone on me as expected, he told me he would call back. after 15 minutes he calls me and tells me that he is seeing a big bright light from his 7th floor balcony and filming it. the light is north by northeast roughly 2-3 degrees above the horizon. and far, very far (couldn't tell me how far. many kms).\r\n\r\nhere is the filming geographical location:\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/loc1.Jpg\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/loc2.Jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter he ran out of battery(8 minutes of raw footage) , i told him to start taking pictures with all the cameras in the house \r\n\r\nuntil all of them have full memory cards and then swap to reserve memory cards and continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nhe did, and called me in the morning.\r\n\r\nthe results are as follows: many digital stills which show a bright dot 2-3 arc degress over the horizon. the stills are very dark and just show where the dot is.\r\n\r\nthe footage is better. in full zoom it is quite overexposed but we can clearly see the relative brightness of the light compared to the city street lights. the object was observed for ~15 minutes before it dissapeared.\r\n\r\nstills (there are many more, all same quality):\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/still1.Jpg\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/still2.Jpg\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/stillzoom.Jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand here is the movie, unedited:\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/beershevalight.Wmv\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/beershevalight2.Wmv\r\n\r\n\r\ni also checked the star and planet location for israel at the time, jupiter was in the south, no other bright stars visible to the north, as you can see here:\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/israelsky_nbyne_july27th12_30am.Jpg\r\n\r\n\r\na compilation of all the ynet comments into a map.\r\ncenter is close to betlehem.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.Bemecollective.Com/pics/loc4.Jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nso i analyzed the video and found the following.\r\nthere is some sort of 'light beam' emitting downward straight vertical from the light.\r\nluckily the light is positioned exactly near a side of a tall building, so we can see that the 'beam' is parallell to the dark building.\r\nthe camera itself is not horizontal, so the 'beam', and the building are 5-6 degrees off vertical.\r\nthe 'beam' shoots only down, nothing sideways or up. \r\nfor comparison to a camera glare, see the pic called beershevalight1_0004_nobeamfromstreetlights.Jpg where we can see both the main light with beam and the street lights without.\r\n\r\nthe first four picture where clarified:\r\n\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/beershevalight1_0001.Jpg\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/beershevalight1_0002.Jpg\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/beershevalight1_0003.Jpg\r\nwww.Bemecollective.Com/pics/beershevalight1_0004_nobeamfromstreetlights.Jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nthe

it's not a glare:\r\n\r\n1. it's only in one direction, true down.\r\n2. it doesn't happen with the street lights.\r\n3. it is the only other detail seen in the emboss.\r\n\r\nbut i cannot be sure. it could be a glare. for you to decide. i'll post more info when i have it.\r\n\r\nstrange or what?\r\n\r\n\r\nbest

(200-450 ft.) the object appeared to be 6-8 meters in diameter (18-25 ft.)\r\n\r\nconclusions\r\n\r\nas the object moved at a 45��� angle to my position, i was able to observe it from different perspectives, and as such i can to state that it didn't looked like any type or aircraft known to me, and i'm pretty savvy about such things. the absence of position lights, sound and features (wings or rotor blades) would also indicate that it was no civilian aircraft. i can also eliminate the hypothesis that it was a blimp or balloon due to the speed it moved at, with no wind to speak of. the clouds weren't moving either, which eliminates the possibility of wind at higher altitudes. there was silent enough for the sound of an engine to be heard, but there wasn't any. there were no other aircraft nearby and its trajectory followed none of the streets, which eliminates for me the eventuality that is was pulled from the air or from the ground. there was also no such things as a rope to be seen. the visibility was excellent, as the clouds were very bright with no sun to impede direct observation.\r\n\r\nat this point, it's an unidentified flying object for me. i'd be very glad and interested to hear another opinion(s). i'm also glad to answer any question you might have regarding this incident. as english isn't my first language, i'd be also happy to clarify any questions which may arise due to the poor wording, if applicable.\r\n\r\nanswering additional questions\r\n\r\nthere was a second witness which will remain anonymous.\r\n1. swimming in a pool outside our city of munich, in a small town 50 km to the east - bad aibling.\r\n2. the second witness spotted the object on the sky, just by incidentally looking in that direction\r\n3. the object looked strange enough for us both to ask \"hey, what's that?!\" it looked in the first second like a spheric helicopter heading directly towards me, but i very quickly realised that it can't be the cockpit of such an aircraft, and it's not heading towards me. it took me under one second to realise.\r\n4. the object was described, and it just followed a straight path.\r\n5. we merely observed the object with interest. we moved a bit around to minimise the time it was hidden by the tree. no special feelings other than i had no idea what am i looking at. we discussed the incident after we lost sight of the object.\r\n6. the object disappeared in the distance, hidden by buildings as it flew its path.

fliped on the light trying to reassure me that there was nothing in the room. i dont know what this all means but but the faces of the smaller ones were thoose alien faces we have all seen many times over the years, and i was shocked beyond belief, they appeared to be observing the bigger interdimensional one,i cannot get this experience out my head, is there any one that can help me. i am

this bizzare incident happened. in this area of upstate ny there are alot of low mountains and valleys, its a low populated area so there is not alot of light polution. it was a clear night. we were sitting there on the porch when suddenly my friend said look up there! what is that?? i looked up and could not beleive my eyes it was a large spacecraft flying slowly at about 10 mph and about 50 feet above us it was flying through the valley and not above the mountains (possibly to avoid radar)?\r\nthere was absolutely no sound what so ever, it was so silent you could even hear the ambeint sounds of the woods behind us crickets and whatnot. but i felt other than fear exitement, a strange electrifying sensation throughout my body, my friends also felt the same. the size of the craft was astronomical! i know the exact width of the valley and the hight of the 2 mountains im a geologist by trade. valley width 450 meters mountain hight a 118m mountain b 172 meters . the crafts tips must of came within 10 meters of touching the 2 mountains! so it was about 420 meters wide. you must think im crazy by now. it was atleast 3x longer than its width. the craft itself was a different color than the night sky a deep almost royal purple there was sets of slow pulsing orange lights on the back possibly propultion engines or something of that manner there were windows on the side of the craft or veiwports were i could see the inside of the craft very clearly there were humanoid forms in the windows standing there gazing out i presume looking at us. we were all very frightened after the incident my freinds decided to leave but i couldnot sleep was too frightend by the whole experience and spent the night sitting on the porch with my 12 gauge shotgun loaded and ready just incase. despite my effort to stay awake and after a hard days work i fell asleep on the porch, now you would imagine that i would wake up there on the porch in the morning right? simple logic yes? fall asleep in one place and wake up there a few hours you dont need to be a rocket scientist to understand that concept. wrong! i \"woke up\" a couple of days later august the  12th 930am according to my watch. in the forrest not dressed in my own clothes a few miles away luckilly for me i was able to find a road and flag down the state police. unfortunatly for me  they pressumed i was an insane homeless man and brought me in for phyciatric evaluation but there tests proved that i was sane. they didnt beleive my story im fearfull of contacting the government or telling anyone  else. this has left me tramaticly scarred for the rest of my life. i now live and will most likely die in nyc i feel more comfertable there surrounded by millions of people. and will never go into the countryside

exclaimed they just rose from the distance into the sky (like a firework), but then they took a straight left direction, which fireworks do not do!!! it was around 11.15pm. in the distance, high up, the first bright light moved across the sky in a straight line, it was not flashing but it was bright - it was bright orange/ytellow and had no ditinct shape to it, like a fuzzy outline i suppose you could say circular. at first i thought 'plane' but then i saw the other one and was like, ok thats definatly not a plane, with no flashing lights it just wasn't possible. what was strange is and determined suspicions that what we were witnessing was not natural not man made (i.E aircraft) was that the first one stopped dead and didn't move, as the second object got closer it was practically next to it, when they were together as a pair they started to disappear, it was like it was waiting for the second object to join it. it looked as though they were flying so high into the sky that they disapearred they got fainter and fainter. more beculiar was that the third light followed the same path and when it got to the same spot it did exactly as the other 2 did. i was so intrigued, i could not explain it. me and my partner were not the only witnesses as there was a couple who saw them and i heard them say how weird it was, then minutes later another group of people walked by and they said 'how is it possible two aircrafts could be that close together with no sound being heard either'. i could not sleep for the rest of the night i was constantly at the window with my camera and camcorder hoping i could see them again, but they were long gone, it was weird. i felt scared that these could be real, i have never thought about alians or strange beings as i think sometimes

connection in time from the beginning of the start of the universe to a reconnection at the end of the dark epoch. so all of time is connected beginning to end and back and that is how structures are formed in time although the tyranny of distance still applies.\r\n\r\n1. check points yes it was dark in my room but i was most certainly awake and sort of separate to the actual lift although i rose upwards and the collapse of the bubble of one reality to this about eight to ten seconds from hearing voice.2. hard not to notice. 3. forgive a nine year old i answered are you sure you got the right one? then it was gone. 4. not visible just a lifting and the voice then the bubble but i figure the changes were caused by something further back in time because the buildings and curriculum seemed to have been around and not new. 5. surprise, relief and i didn't move but i could if i wanted to but i didn't go looking for it.\r\n\r\nsince then other sightings but just distant high altitude so i can't be sure may have been a meteor flash and one time a cloud of ball lightening. now i am pretty sure about the connection in time forming from the beginning of the universe and reconnecting in the dark epoch. matter experienced at a node or dimension right angle is still matter so it all works the same way gravity and the forces but the connections in real space are there. the shape is like connecting two klein bottles together each can be the single side of either a circle or torus and in the case of a torus connect gives an hourglass connecting atomic symmetry.\r\n\r\ni hope this helps.","distance":"20 Feet or

is around my house i was playing ds light outside in front of my house then when was 10:00 pm i got into my house again because my dog dalila was scratching the door so i can let her out because she is scare to the dark, but i stayed inside of my house then around 11:57 or 58 i felt like a presence  like someone watching me outside my window so i got out to check but nothing! ,i always like to se the sky and stars so i looked up to the sky ,there was like a light bright like yelloish,red and blue it was changing colors so i got impresed so i had my celphone with me so i took the exact time , i was going to record it but is that i couldnt move because of the impresion , the lights started to get a little away so i moved to the center of the street to get a better view , then the lights stated to flow in circules and form diferent patterns i knew that wasnt a common star , the light started to move vertical then dissapears and i was like what!!! where it go! and i looked all over the sky but nothing ,then like in 4 seconds a star that passes like a shooting star super fast but 4 me it wasnt i think it was the ufo that dissapeard seconds ago.After the sighing of that strange lights i run to my parents to say to them mom dad i was outside and something was moving very fast in the sky but they dint believed me they told me that was probbably a jet but i know that wasnt a jet it was moving to fast and dissappeard like in 2 seconds a jet dosent dissapears and it dosent goes too fast! and yeah! im 13 years old but the things is that if you stare at the stars on the night you can totally see them moving so that so not stars the ufos can totally camoflage through the stars so be careful sometimes they are not stars! i say this because last year i was in my houses pool and i always see like around 9:45 stars moving but you have to take time to look at them because the really small ones are the ones that moves i've been experiencing this thing since i was a little girl when i had 6 years old on october 31, i know we are not alone in the universe!

north. at first i just assumed it was a plane, with its' landing lights on, heading into either patrick afb or merrit island airport.\r\n\r\nas i have been a practicing amateur astronomer for 50 years (and still remain very active at a high level of observing programs and technology...In fact, i have the second- largest privately owned telescope in the state),i knew immediately that this apparition was not astronomical in nature.\r\n\r\nfor one thing, it was too low and either stationary or barely moving. i could see the first deck of low clouds behind the object.\r\n\r\nagain, this could still have been a slow-moving airplane flying directly towards me so that i would not notice any apparent motion. but it just wasn't getting anywhere!\r\n\r\nnow i'm thinking it's a helicopter, hovering above i-95...Maybe a medevac unit. by bow it is extremely bright (estimate magnitude -4)and i realize it is not one light source, but two...Apparently connected by a truss or some sort of shaft or construct. the two main lights are yellowish-white and are so intense that they are causing retinal flaring.\r\nhalfway between the two brightest lights is a much fainter one that is blinking red very rapidly.\r\n\r\nas it still shows no apparent motion i speed up to over 90mph to try and get to it before it an go away. as i get closer, the angle begins to go vertical so i know i about to get under it. one last (head out the window) look tells me it is directly overhead, so i jam the brakes, stop the car and jump out ready to either id it visually or by sound.\r\n\r\ni should add that i am also a pilot and my love-affair with aviation goes back as far as my love for astronomy.\r\n\r\ni mean no arrogance when i say that i can readily identify anything that flies (at least that we've been told about). my wife and i both are avid \"plane-spotters\" (she worked with the airlines for many years).\r\nwhen e live in california in the 80's, we'd take \"expeditions\" up near edwards afb just to see if anything \"new\" was in the air. we saw both the f-117 stealth fighter and the b-2 stealth bomber several years before they were announced to the public. we certainly did not experience any sense of the unknown at that time as we new perfectly well they were the long anticipated stealth planes.\r\n\r\ni'm fairly certain i also observed the \"aurora: hypersonic craft in a nighttime pass over the antelope valley. that was all fun. this is not!\r\n\r\nback to the chase: i shut off the car, opened the door, jumped out, and the object was gone! it had been directly over me less than 5 seconds earlier! i futiley searched the sky for just normal aircraft navigation lights, thinking in had been a pland and the high intesity lights had been shut off. nothing. then it hit me - there was also no sound.\r\nhad there been a plane (especially a helicopter)that was now flying off i would have clearly heard it. just 5 seconds from \"now you see it\" to \"now you don't\".\r\n\r\nin the aforementioned 50 years of serious astronomy i have seen comets,\r\nmeteors, space junk re-entry into the atmosphere, i know the 100 brightest stars by their proper names and i can tell you almost without thinking where every planet visible to the naked eye is!\r\n\r\ni can also identify any airplane known to man by sight\r\nand somejust by hearing their sound (yes even jet engines sound differently and the wind rushing through the various orifices and around the wings and fuselage also makes a sound all its' own)\r\n\r\nthis is the very first time (out of thousands of hours spent 'under the stars')that i have seen something that i cannot explain.\r\n\r\ni make no claim that this was an \"alien craft\".\r\nunfortunately the term ufo has become synonymous with \"flying saucer\", but\r\nwhat i saw was truly just an unidentified flying object.\r\n\r\ni plotted where i was (and it was) on google earth. when i was directly under it, i was 13 miles from the kennedy launch complex to the ne and 13 miles to patrick afb to the se.\r\n\r\nit's almost 7am...I've been up all night puzzling over this.\r\nif there is any correalation with additional reports you may receive, i would

driving in a north west direction.\r\n\r\nobservers: self (driving car); partner(passenger)\r\n\r\nweather:\tbright daylight; occasional high banks of cloud; no wind; no rain. visibility excellent.\r\n\r\nfeelings:\tamazement at their sudden appearance, at the number of planes, their unfamiliar shapes and how low and slowly they were flying. i used to work in an aircraft factory for british aerospace, and i am familiar with jet planes and jet aircraft engines at very close quarters. \r\n\r\nother witnesses:\r\n1) witness a, at work in ellesmere: \"\"probably on their way to shawbury airfield.\"  n.B. raf shawbury is about 14 miles to the south east of ellesmere. no public spectator events were scheduled for this week on the station calendar. low flying helicopter and fixed wing training is carried out in this area; air traffic controllers are trained here. see http://www.Raf.Mod.Uk/rafshawbury/flyinginfo/lowflying.Cfm\r\n\r\n2) witness n, at work in ellesmere: \"\"i saw 5, then 4, then two single planes. someone said they were lightning jets, but i don't know how he would know.\" n.B the planes we saw bore absolutely no resemblance to lightnings - see http://www.Lightningusa.Org/index.Html\"\r\n\r\nplanes\r\n\t\r\nformations:\t 11 off planes, grouped in 2 off arrowheads, followed by 2 singles - 5 + 4 + 1 + 1. last plane manouvering to join the tail of the formation.\r\n\r\nshape /appearance: square, long box-shaped fuselage, open at rear; narrow, swept back wings -more like narrow fins than wings, with little surface area to provide lift; heavy, rugged all-metal construction, resembling worn sheet aluminium; old-looking technology, not aerodynamic nor streamlined; no tail; no external engines; no ailerons; no cockpit; no markings; no armaments; no aerials or external appendages; no wheels or sign of wheel bays . me: \"i've no recollection of shape of nose - can't think why not.\" partner: \"i think the nose was slightly rounded, thunderbirds style.\" neither of us can remember seeing a cockpit, pilot, escape canopy, probe, radar cone etc on the front.\r\n\r\ncolour:\tgunmetal grey / black, looking well used and not new. not painted.\r\n\r\ndirection:\theading south east, towards the centre of ellesmere town, just a few hundred yards away.\r\n\r\nsound:\theard above car's diesel engine - passenger window open.\r\nloud roar, but not  sufficiently ear-splitting for 11 jet engines a few hundred feet away.\r\n\r\nsmell:\tno smell of avtur or fumes etc, despite their close proximity and that our journey continued under their approach path.\r\n\r\nexhaust:\tno flames, vapour or sign of air turbulence from open rear of box fuselage. \r\n\r\nheight:\tflying say 150 ft to 300 ft above ground level. very low, and approaching the built-up area of ellesmere town. \r\n\r\nspeed:\tflying at say 100mph maximum - probably slower as they were in our sight for a few seconds, despite our view being restricted to a few hundred yards to front and rear because of adjacent trees.\r\n\r\nsize:\tsmall. say less than half the size of a harrier jet.\r\n\r\nseparation:\tvery close. say 20 ft between planes.\r\n\r\nuk major

pinkish light. looking at the clouds above my house to the northeast, i saw a black circle or sphere moving across the sky from east to west. i could see the circular shape very clearly but could not see any depth to say for sure if it was a sphere. it passed almost directly overhead, and i remember it was more like looking up into the blackness of the lens of a camera rather than at a spherical object. it was solid and not billowy like a balloon. my impression was of a surveillance device rather than a vehicle. i could not judge its size or elevation without any reference point, although it was below the clouds. it followed a curving path rather than a straight path, as if it were compensating for flying into the wind. it passed quickly out of view in just a few seconds. shortly after i lost sight of it a couple of birds flew along a similar path, giving me the impression it was about the same height and scale as the birds. if i had to estimate it i'd say it was more on the scale of a beach ball and in the 200 foot elevation and not a blimp-sized object at thousands of feet. right after that some menacing dark clouds moved in very quickly from the north and it started raining.","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:15","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional
