than usual and i caught a glimpse of it and it appeared to be a jet and it was low in the horizon. we did not see much of it but i was assuming it was a military jet because they will buzz through  now and then. maybe every once in a blue moon, but there is an airport about 30 minutes away.\r\n\r\n10 minutes later, my wife was driving back from her family reunion in dearborn and she called me on the phone as my son and i were walking back in the house. she was trying to explain to me that she is looking at three intense spots in the sky that is multi-colored lights.  almost like a transparent smudge but it's appears to be long oval spots.\r\n\r\nshe told me i should go on top of the house and see if i can see it. i did just that and could not see past the large trees.  so, my wife came home and drove me towards the main road so i can see what she was talking about.  right then, we only says this faint yellowish, read, light greenish light.\r\n\r\ni managed to take a picture of it. this elongated oval light seem to just hover in the misty clouds.  just one, not three.  the light just eventually seemed to dematerialized or should i say it look like it slowly winked out.\r\n\r\ni have two pictures of it i managed to take before it did wink out, the sun was to the right of this picture, but the sun is not in the picture.  this was looking wnw from us23 and exit 41.\r\n\r\nnot sure if this was a ufo or some type of light anomaly we've never seem before. never the less, it was strange.  no sudden movements from what i saw.\r\n\r\ni don't have a fancy camera, it's just a

an extremely fine tracery of capillaries and it exuded a small amount of a somewhat sticky and clear fluid.  cutting through that revealed a central 'core' of a brilliant orange, three fingered

lake on the nw side of indianapolis located in marion county. most of the people were gone as we sat on the restaurants outdoor patio with my wife and two other friends finishing up our dinner conversation. my seat was facing north at the table when i noticed a bright light in the northern sky. we are close to a local airport and also the indianapolis international airport and love to watch planes as we sail around on the lake. i thought it was a plane coming in for landing. i then noticed another bright light appear very close in fact what looked like too close for two planes to be on an evening approach. suddenly the lights disappeared, i said nothing to my wife or guests and kept looking in the same direction. then they reappeared again first one light then two with a third light appearing just to the east, i told my wife and guests to look into the sky and tell me if they are seeing what i am seeing. we watched as the lights disappeared and i told them to keep watching and that they might reappear. we watched and sure enough they did reappear only this time there were 4 of them coming on one at a time. the two central lights appeared again and in the same location as before, then the eastern or port side light came on then the western or starboard side light came on forming what looked like a very large triangle shape. if i were to guess distance i would say about a mile across from the port to starboard light. we heard no noise, and the lights did not appear to be moving only coming on and going off. after they went out this time they did not reappear but we all had a fun time watching and trying to figure out what it could be? weather conditions were good, skies were clear at this time of night with many stars visible and in sight. \r\n

summertime about 7pm. we were driving north on bumby ave. just past grant st. when i looked out the passenger window to the east (for no reason) and above the small orange groove (now a subdivision) i show an object hovering just above the trees. i slowed down and calmly asked my nephew of 11 years to look out his passenger window and describe what he saw. he immediately turned back to me with a scared look on his face (jaw dropped). i said please look again and tell me what you see so i can make sure i am not seeing things. he described the same object i saw. we only saw a side view of the object. the body was cigar shaped and appeared metallic, there was a clear see through bubble on top center, there were lights along the midsection of the main cigar shaped body and there was no noise coming from it. i knew this was not a helicopter or airplane. it was in a location where jets normally use (glide path) to land at orlando international airport. the object was not moving in anyway. just stayed hovering above the trees. i never stopped the car. when i got to the next intersection bumby st and kaley, i made a quick u-turn to go back and get a better look. my nephew kept asking me to just keeping heading home but i said i must see what this thing was. but it was gone and no evidence it was ever there. i was never scared, more curious than anything. strangely there were no other cars or people around. i honestly do not remember the drive home. at the time i lived with my parents at meridale st. and illinois ave. orlando, fl. 32803. from where the sighting was to home should have only taken 15-20 minutes but we did not get home until approximately 9pm. as soon as my mother saw us she knew we were upset by something. we told my mother what happened. i think my mother believed us because of how unnerved we were. i have not told many people about this for fear they will think i was some crazy person. to this day my nephew refuses to speak about it. unfortunately i

belive but not one of them ran out to try to see it they where scarred of course they where saying it could have been a plane, the goodyear blimp, the only problem with that is that we whould have

july 3rd 2008, i and my daughter (an adult) were returning home.  the sky was very clear and stary, and my daughter just happened to look up while i was unlocking the front door. she remarked \"ma, is it my imagination, or is that star moving?\"  i looked up to where she was looking and sure enough it was moving.  this could not have been any plane, because it was obviously near or in the outer atmosphere due to the extreme height of the object.  it appeared to look like the rest of the stars.  the object moved in a straight line and \"parked next to what i think was venus since it was a very bright star (sorry, but i'm not an astrologer) and the object seemed to fade in and out then it suddenly took off in another direction with such a speed it was unbeleivable.  at that time the object disapeared, but about seven more suddnenly appeared and were moving around each other and then split apart into different directions, also traveling at unbeleivable speeds.  then, about ten more objects joined the first objects and they alternated \"flying\" around and moving in various directions (including at sudden right angles) for about two hours. we sat on the porch and watched this activity until they all suddenly shot off in a cluster toward an eastern direction and disappeared.  while we were watching these objects manuver, they too were fading in and out at times. i wish to add that the rates of speed were so fantastic, and i know this because, it it a great deal of distance from one point to another in the sky, and it took the objects a fraction of a second to cover these distances. i want to stress that these absolutely were not planes, as we live in flight paths for both commercial and military aircraft, and both kinds were flying over, and despite how high the planes were they were no where near the distance that the objects were, nor do they act in anyway the same; and they definately were not stars.","distance":"Over 1 Mile,

watching it i pointed it out to my wife and daughter and looked for a place to safely pull over. i stopped at a wide spot on the eastbound onramp from 4th street to i-10. i got out and saw a dirigible shaped ufo moving from behind the peak of a mountain at a distance of about 13 miles. i am a military and commercial pilot with over 25 years of experience. the object was so huge it was impossible for me to see what i was observing from as it was approximately 1/2 mile (3000 ft) in length and 400 to 450 feet in diameter. this is incredible to see something so huge in the air) the ends were hemispherical in shape and ever-so-slightly eliptical in shape. the surface was as shiny as a milar balloon. the visibilty, this morning, was between 50-70 miles minimum as i could clearly see the peaks of mt san jacinto and mt. san gregornio, to the east, and there were no clouds a all from horizon to horizon. in miltary terms it was severe-clear. i could see in the reflection, of the surface of the object, movement of terrain below the object. i could see the terrain with roads or gullies and other objects reflected. the strange thing is that the ground reflections were being superimposed on the upper surfaces of the object and the sky was being reflected on the lower surfaces of the object. this would be exactly opposite for any reflective surface to do and had to be projected by technology, unknown at the time, on the opposite sides of the craft. the curved ends of the surface distorted the images as any curved surface would but the reflections were clear, as if in a mirror, not a polished metalic/aluminum skin. the craft was flying level and quite slow - perhaps 30-35 mph and did not maneuver from a straight course. we watched the object move left to right until the rear end cleared the peak on the left and then traveled the distance between the two major peaks where it started to disappear behind the right-hand peak. we watched it until it completely disappeared behind the peak on the east. \r\n\r\nwe were enroute to my wife's mother's home for mother's day and i advised them of the sightings and saw their reaction of wonder. i was reluctant to discuss it with anyone else, at the time, due to the incredulity of the enormous size of the object and probability of becoming ridiculed. i am a retired army officer with 21 years service. i am a trained observer, as an officer and a pilot, and i know what i saw was absolutely not man- made. it had no apparent means of propulsion, left no sign it had passed, and did not appear again to me. recently i witnessed video footage of a sighting over colorado of a similarly shaped object. the size of the object was approximately a ratio of seven to one as to length and width. the surface was perfectly smooth - without distortion - and cylindrical in shape except for the ends. the difference between this one and the colorado video is that the one i saw was mirror-surfaced and the one in the colorado sighting appeared white against a blue sky. the ratio was so similar in both that i felt compelled to report this to you as it might fit into other sightings of the time and provide a new impression. i have since been back to the spot and have taken gps readings at the place we observed it from and a magnetic azimuth of the direction to the object which i have recorded. \r\n\r\ni have only had one other sighting of a ufo, in my life, as a boy scout in idaho in oct. 1956 and that sighting was documented by the goc (civil ground observer corps)and us air force operations i was working for as a volunteer. i would be happy to discuss this one also if interested. it was declared a ufo by the af observers on duty and f-89 aircraft were scrambled from fairchild afb to attempt an intercept with it, over washington state, a few minutes following our sighting in boise.","distance":"Over One

was odd because the jets do not usually approch from that direction.  the light was  a circle, with a red and white cast to it. i did not pay much attention to it untill i noticed that it flickerd off then on again brighter.  then  few seconds later a scecond one appeared as the first one flicker off.  they were right beside one another. then one, two and three spehers appeared in a diaganle formation from left to right, the first appeared flickering on, then off, then the second one flickerd on the off, and so on.  i really can't explain the way they turned on and off, but to say they flickerd. then  later on they would appear indivually turning on and off.  then i got my bonoculers, to look and the spears appeard very small and red in color and almost diamond shape. one light would sperate into two and then a third one would appear sperate from the other two, that just had sperated. after that i stayed outside for approx 1 hour after i saw the last one and they never appeared again.  i got a compass to see what direction i was looking and it was right on north then i log the time. just has a side note, i saw these lights last year at the approx time, date and

just thinking that this is quite a great day when movement in the sky caught my attention. i saw an object flying due east and level. there was no sound and i saw neither props nor jet engines on it. it reflected the sun off its surface and appeared roundish or disc shaped. it then started flying in a tight circle-i've never seen a plane that was capable of doing such a thing. then, from the north, it was  joined by a second like object. the two circled each other for about a minute and then just disappeared from sight in the same instant still circling each other. i think they were discs

we were close to it, until we left.  then mountain creek lake quite hilly and wooded with winding roads and had very private areas, yet it had and elec power plant on or next to the lake, where swimming is prohibited.  we were riding around the hilly wooded roads as teenagers did then and a car drove fast and crazily past us leaving.  it was so nerve racking on that narrow hilly road that it caused me to pull right into where obviously they had pulled out which was the power plant parking lot.  it was empty and i cannot forget it had amber parking lot lights. it was obviously a nice clear evening or i would not have been out driving at almost 17 yrs old.  immediately we saw it.  you couldn't miss it if you tried.  do not always look up to the skies for ufo's.  i'm telling you it was just there above the lake water. that lake water was at least on one side of the plant, and there this ufo 3 ft above the water between the parking lot where we were and the plant. it was approx 3 ft above the water hovering, if there was a sound it was a low hum only, but it was running because we saw lights.  those strobing or pulsating on this huge craft are mostly what scared us about it. we couldn't understand how something so big could be so still and so close to the water, without plunging below. never in our lives had we seen anything like this.  we stayed concerned as to what could be looking at us behind those lights.  were there windows behind the lights?  i think the lights were around the bottom, but i'd have to be hypnotized to know for sure now, and there could have been port hole windows behind those lights. imagine a house size dull color steel cake cover.  that was how it's body looked and the craft had no visible window, no door, no emblems, letters or number markings from our view. that alarmed me. i wondered out loud how they got in and out of it.  i think it was through the bottom which we could not see because it was so close to the water.  it could be described as a saucer because it was round, but it had great heigth, at least 2 stories high. i remember the plant had a 2nd or 3rd floor big window, and i wondered does anybody in there see it too?  it looked like maybe the staff had gone home but left some lights on inside the plant. i saw no one looking out that window. for a couple of teenagers that had never even discussed ufo's we figured out that it most definitely was a ufo and quickly, and somehow we both just knew it was fueling from the energy currants under the water and able to do this without under.  it could have been communicated through a telepathic message, but that's what we both thought it was doing.  nothing about it's appearance was scary other than what was behind those strobing lights that eerie evening in the vacant amber lit parking lot. this was just a matter of minutes and we got so frightened we left and fast too and i suspect it was for the same reason the that car before us did.  this is absolutely a true story.  this is 2008 and i'm 50.
