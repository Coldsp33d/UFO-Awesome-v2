 therefore, i am submitting these events purely for the sake of your collection of data. i apologize for putting three stories into this one report, but i'd just rather do it that way. i hope it's ok.\r\n\r\nexperience 1 of 3\r\nit was in 1967. i was 12 years old living on a farm in kansas.  i was on the second floor in my bed about midnight or after, not sure.  i awoke to see flashing lights, like an ambulance, coming across the corn field hovering just above the corn. it came into the farm yard and hovered making all sorts of loud noises like sirens.  a bright light lit up everywhere and that was the last i remembered till the next morning when i ask everyone at breakfast, ���what was that big light and all those sirens?��� nobody new what i was talking about and it was accounted to a dream.  of course to me i felt i was not dreaming at all, however, it did stop after the bright light peaked. so i concluded maybe it was a dream, but really didn���t buy it.  i let it go nonetheless. \r\n\r\nthe interesting thing about this experience is what happened 25 years later. for some reason it started to bug me that i never resolved that experience i had at 12.  i had insurance and wondered if i could get hypnotherapy  to recall what really happened.  to my surprised i was able to see a license hypno-therapist.  it became legit because the therapist said it was most likely some trauma that caused the experience and i suppressed it to this particular memory. \r\n\r\nhe put me under hypnosis and regressed me back to that night.  i recalled the story as it unfolded while in my regressed state.  the story was very similar to the memory i had except that i was able to see more of what happened in the farm yard.  i was up out of bed and looking out the window.   i saw two lights whirl around in a gyroscope fashion.  they kept doubling until there was nothing but a ball of light and then the white out happened.  when the session was over i ask the doctor what he thought about it. he said, ���i have no idea, perhaps a dream (?), but i don���t really no for sure.��� he did say there was no sign of trauma.\r\n\r\none further note, after this session i found i had a very difficult time talking about it. i even wondered if the doctor, while having me under, put a notion in me to not talk about it.  because every time i tried, i���d wind up saying, ���forget it, i can���t talk about it.���  i would even get like a lump in my throat and words just wouldn���t come out.  that was 14 years ago, it���s only been in the last 5 years or so i���ve been able to discuss it as before. \r\n\r\nexperience 2\r\nin 1975 i was traveling with a friend in my car returning home from a day trip.  we were just coming to the west end of our town.  we both saw at the same time a green object with a sort of florescent light with a red light on the bottom. it zoomed across the sky going at least several thousand mile per hour.  it went across the eastern sky, about the altitude of a jet, at about 45 degrees in about 2 seconds.  it left a green florescent trail behind it that faded quickly but stretched pretty far.  i stopped immediately in the middle of the highway (two lane road really, hwy 56 in kansas).  we got out and could see nothing.  both of saw and described the exact same thing.\r\n\r\nexperience 3\r\nthis was january 1, 1997.  i was backpacking in the mark twain forest of missouri.  it was about 11pm.  i was sitting on a rock in the middle of a clearing watching the sky and saw 4 lights.  if they had been motionless they would not have been detected because they looked exactly like just another group of stars.  they formed a perfect box shape at first. they moved exactly together.  making squares, diagonals, all sorts of movements in all directions and most of the time staying in this box formation, but varying it a little. i watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. they were very clearly there.  then all at once they stopped and about a half a second later, they broke formation and all spun out in weird spiraling ways in the opposite direction until they were gone out of sight which only took about another half a second.

(i confirmed later the next day that these lights were in fact our local sky dive chicago divers group performing a night jump called the \"ufo jump\".  the divers had worn white flares on their outfits.  there were two series of jumps that night, both with the white flares.) when i turned to look at the lights a different, stationary set of dirty orange colored lights, much higher in the sky than the falling white lights, caught my eye.  jupiter was se of where we were standing and it was positioned about 50 degrees above of the horizon.  just underneath (about 10 degrees below jupiter) and to the left of jupiter there were 2 dirty orange colored glowing orb-like lights.  (see lights1.Jpg) they were situated one above the other with a bit of room in between.  they didn't move, they just seemed to hover.  i pointed them out to my cousin who agreed that what i was seeing couldn't be the same as the falling lights.  i spun my telescope around to see if i could see what they were, lined up my site to the top \"orb\" then looked through the eye piece.  what i saw was a bright red light where the \"orb\" was, spaced evenly behind the red light yet a little to the side on top and bottom were two much smaller white lights.  then spaced evenly behind the white lights in alignment with them were two more white lights (one on top one on bottom).  in straight alignment with the red light but behind the two white lights was another small white light.

cousin pointed directly left of where the lights were just at and we saw one single dirty orange orb.  it hovered in one spot for approximately 5-10 seconds then started to move to the left.  it stopped and looked like it was hovering and rocking back and forth from side to side.  then it slowly moved back to the right..Back to where we just saw it moments ago.  it sat there for about 5 seconds.  then it began to flicker white, red, blue, all different colors.  then it turned extremely bright red, started to move to the right again slowly..Picked up speed and took off south towards ottawa.  it disappeared from view within a matter of 2 or 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nafter seeing that we were watching the sky looking for the orb to come back into view.  about 10-15 minutes later we were looking east, about 20 degrees above the horizon and saw what appeared to be the orb again.  it appeared to be moving south, only this time it would move then stop, move then stop, move then stop.  it did this for about 2 minutes then just disappeared.  there were no color changes this time and we did not see it move away from us when it disappeared, it just simply blinked out of existence.\r\n\r\nwe kept watching the sky for about an hour or so after this and never saw it again.  we saw the normal air traffic of jets and some planes here and there but didn't see the weird dirty orange orbs again.","distance":"Over One Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then path,Path with directional

90-degrees.   at the very top was a pulsating white light (not flashing).  below that were two blue lights.  much further below (50 to 100 feet) the blue lights was a single red light. as i followed it moving away, it seemed to be a shape like a vertical cigar.\r\n\r\nit caught my attention and i tried to keep it in view.  i but it disappeared behind some taller buildings in the city to the north.  i then drove around another mile to the church street exit (exit 7).  while exiting the thruway, i saw the same light pattern over my left shoulder.  this time, it was much larger and the light pattern was now 30-degrees from horizontal.  the craft was heading southeast towards lake erie and was travelling without making any detectable noise.  if it were a commercial jet, it would definitely have been very audible at the low altitude it appeared to be flying.\r\n\r\nthe exit i was on is off of an elevated section of the thruway so i quickly descended to a point where my view of

be found.\r\n\r\nin the close up view (2nd sighting), the red light was bright and not flashing.  the blue lights now appeared to be more of a blue glow like from some type of propulsion system.  i would compare it to the blue lights on the rear of the starship destroyer in the movie star wars. the white light was now on the far right side of the craft.

googled it, found james bouck the state director in schenectady, ny and called him.  i told him to look in the southern sky and that if it was still there in 10 minutes i'd call him back. so i went

i went outside, but the object had moved somewhat toward the southwest.  i wondered if maybe this wasn't something identifiable like the space station or something.  \r\n\r\nin any event, it looked like the planet venus in the morning, except three or four of them fused one atop the other as a single object and hanging motionless in the night sky about 35 or so degrees above the horizon.  the brightest thing, by far, in the sky. i'm not certain i would call it cylindrical, mnore like a \"rod\" of light that seemed to have thin, crooked \"arms\" of light attatched to it.  i kept looking at

is important to me. \r\n\r\nmy friend and i were out at dove springs it���s an ohv park designed for off highway vehicles near edwards afb in mojave ca off the 14. can���t recall the date but either fall or spring of 06. i do know mars was visible. we just got back from a long ride as the sun set, i had set up a spotlight i had just gotten (15 million candle watts ) and aimed it in the sky. with all the dust flying around you could see the beam of light, it looked something like the luxor light. about 40 minutes after we got back my friend had said that mars was out and we were searching the sky. out there in the desert it is truly amazing the amount of stars that are visible. he found mars and it was like an off red orange color. we were still looking at the stars and i saw a star that was red red and i pointed it out saying that it was probably mars. we were comparing them and he had told me that his was mars (from location) and he was unsure what the other red star was. i thought he was wrong because of the strong color difference and told him that his star was orange and mine was red. these were somewhat opposite of each other as we had to turn to look between the stars. he once again assured me that his star was mars and as we turned and were looking at the predominantly red star it moved slightly and before i could finish the word (satellite) in this sentence ��� oh, i think it���s a satellite��� . boom, this massive airship appears now totally guessing here 1000 feet away and 1000 ft above the ground. completely silent, no approach, we were staring right at it and it just appeared. the first visual was the side view. truly amazing, probably 15 to 30 stories tall and the length of a football field (no joke). it wasn���t hard to process what i was looking at but was blown away of the size, massiveness of this craft. it appeared to be black with thousands of lights on the side, very organized rows. the lights actually appeared to be windows, imagine a huge apartment building on its side flying in the sky. there were no wings. it was moving at about 100-150 mph and then we got to see the back of the craft. the rear of the craft was 3 massive red lights. they covered the entire back of the craft, from top to bottom, side to side. you could probably put 7 airplanes in just one of these lights. they did not blink at the same time they would alternate in a steady pace, they were bright red blinking one at a time. during this we were talking to each other, freaking out discussing how this thing just appeared in front of us, the size of it, no wings, the 3 massive lights on the back and we started to run through the desert after it. it was off in the distance now just slowly cruising away but the 3 red alternating lights still very visible and then all the sudden this bright white light detaches and goes shooting out of the side visible to us , and flew across the sky( extremely fast, some sort of plane). the size difference was incredible 1/1000 of this craft. about 3 minutes later we hear jets screaming through the sky about 6-8 fighter planes flying one after the other looking for this craft, they were loud, afterburners on and searching. this thing was huge, i live 5 blocks away from an airport in los angeles and see planes all day all night. that is exactly what i saw, that red star we were looking at had teleported in a split second to being right in front of us, no wings, dead silent, bigger that a football field, hundreds of windows , 3 massive red lights, a ship detach and the military searching. this is exactly what i saw but i can���t draw to well. i thought it was rectangular and my friend thought it was triangular.\r\n\r\n\r\nplease respond with any info. distance may be closer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n

tv. a moving light outside the west facing window caught my eye. it very nearly resembled the full moon. it was about 15 to 20 degrees west of zenith, moving from south to north (left to right) about one degree per second.\r\n\r\ni went to the north door and into the dark backyard about 30 seconds later but saw nothing unusual. other people were in the room but were not near a west facing window; thus no other witnesses. i discussed it with the others and tried to convince them that i saw it. i was excited by the experience but did not feel fear nor any other negative reaction. i was wide awake at the time and can still remember the event. (but, i can't remember the year. i feel that it was october or november but that's only a gut feeling. i was about 15 or 16 years old: thus it was before i started drinking or trying any recreational '60's drugs.\r\n\r\naround 1993 i had a terrifying nightmare that involved being in that town at night and looking up at a full moon about 30 degrees east of the zenith. when i awoke and recalled the dream i could not recall anything unusual about the moon's appearance nor any frightful occurances. (i have chronic depression and occasional anxiety, for which i've taken meds since, coincidentally, 1993. other than that, i've never hallucinated nor have i suffered from any other psychological symptoms.)","distance":"Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11711,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":38.6283838,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242008-0018","longitude":-91.0576449,"occurred":-286732800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Missouri","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc,  Sphere","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":-286732800000,"summary":"Light resembling full moon passed south to north past window facing west.","tags":["disc"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"0","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Marthasville, Missouri","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:354793"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Levittown","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"A small group of friends and i were watching a movie on july 23, 2008 when a close friend asked for a ride home.  the two of us then walked out onto my porch, as soon as we walked outside a huge red flash alluminated a small portion of the sky.  we looked at one another, at which point another large flash occured.  there was five flashes seperated by a period of about 10 seconds. at this point, we both ran into the middle of the street and were staring over a large tree across the street at the flashes. around the third of fourth flash we could see a dark area in the area of the flash. we were not certain that it was an object but it was illuminated by the flashes. after the fifth flash subsided, there was nothing to be seen in the sky, besides dark clouds. both of our reactions to this object were the same, complete shock. it was unlike anything else we had ever seen. my friends name is shakir green.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:02:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"","flightPath":"","formattedAddress":null,"id":11710,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":40.1617496,"location":null,"logNumber":"US-07242008-0017","longitude":-74.8195747,"occurred":1216839600000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Pennsylvania","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Other","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1216839600000,"summary":"Bright red and orange flashes in sky, followed by a dark object instantly disappearing","tags":["none"],"timeZone":null,"timeZoneName":"","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Levittown, Pennsylvania","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:354794"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Landed, Treetop","city":"","country":"Canada","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"\r\n\r\n\r\n     this close encounter happen outside a very small municipality of bellefeuille situated near the city of saint-j���rome, approximated 5 miles north-est of the international airport of mirabel. for the first time, i go alone there at the back of a very small camping, to see friends and my arrival was in the afternoon saturday the 16 june 1978 and i was suppose to came back in montr���al the sunday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n     i decide to go to sleep in the back seat of my old ambassador!!! at 02h30 a.M. but before that, i decide to smoke a last cigarette in front of my wheel. at my arrival at the camping, i park my car in front of a m���tal chain who block the access for tractor, genre john deer , to a on way road dirt of 7 feets wide to farmers or some kind of 3 tires bikes, and this one track road have tree both sides and this small road has also an angle of 30 degrees upscale, on a distance of about 75 feets where you see part of the sky, and you arrive to a kind of a upscale plateau who was in fact a sand carri���rre of 100 feets large by 150 feets deep and in less than 10 secondes by foot, you have the access of this plateau but i did not go there or heard about it since my arrival at the camping.\r\n\r\n\r\n     i was strangely thinking about this sp���cific place was an excellent one to see a u.F.O. ( remember the film of spielberg close encounter have a big impact the summer before ) by it's location and the fact it was my first time there. i said to myself to stop to think about to see u.F.O. because when it will happening, i will know it !!! and less than one second !!! , a white flash appear in the rigth corner of my windshield !!!.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     after each three or four seconds an another flash, and so forth and each is very white, the brigthiest i ever seen in my life ( genre halogene with very high density ) and the white flash is bigger than what we can see today on planes. first,i think it was an h���lico who was going very low from the north to the south, so i get out and run quickly upstairs on this plateau realising i hear no noise !!!.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     on the plateau i was surprise to see the flash of the invisible object was coming back to the north in a pendullum kind of descent ( like a leaf who fall from a tree )and the pendullum movement go back in forth north and south for 3 or 4 minutes in this beautiful summer nigth without clouds but i don't remember see the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     i most tell i was fascinated and happy and the absence of any noise  remarquable !!!. during the descent of the u.F.O. i look to my rigth and the small road was gone up 5 feets in a no specific direction because i never move until the object revealed itself when arrive near the the trees on the horizon, approximitely 250 feets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     reveale itself because when after it seem 3 minutes of the pendulling descent and the ligth will surely disapear at this rate in less than 30 seconds, i said to myself what i will do after the invisible object will be lower than the top of the trees, the flash became a crescent of a multitude of colours, grenn - bleu - red - orange - violet, and others without now any flassing !!! it was beautiful but i start to get scare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     after one minute to seeing this small crescent ( if i put my hand in extension it was half an inch large and the distance according to the line of trees in the horizon could be around half a mile while the pendullum descent start probably 1000 feets high, the u.F.O. was already low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     after roughly one minute, i decide then to go \" in the woods without any kind of spotligth and i make a couple of walking steps and the visitor of the darkness automatiquely get bigger 150% ( like one inch in a half with my fingers in extension !!! ) so it was an object very big, probably more than 100 feets wide and 10 feets high and than i became very unconfortable facing alone !!!!! the unknown and the u.F.O. continue his descent after i retreat 5 feets backwards and 30 seconds later it was no luminescence of the presence of the ship behind the trees so i decide to go to my car and ask my friend michel to came with me find it-them but his fiancee said you will be hijacked and disapear for ever so i decide to go in the morning there because michel said to me one of his friend go on the plateau a couple weeks before and he take the small road who go in the woods and in les then 5 minutes you arrive to an hydro - qu���bec electricity line and around 9ha.M. i go there alone and ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     if i decide to make public for the first time, it's because since 2008 i start to listen georges lowry coast to coast a.M. and he give informations last nigth about the san - jos��� 39e m.U.F.U.N.Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n    ","distance":"501 Feet - 1

and it was a saturday. we were traveling west on 300 s. about 3 miles from the intersection of state road 19 and 300 s. i stopped to view two sphere shaped lights sitting completely still in the night sky. they were about a 500 feet in the sky well above the trees and powerlines. i sat and watched in amazement with my girlfriend for a period of maybe 45 seconds these lights setting still all the while saying, \"do you see this to her.\" she did. it was like the lights noticed us there and began to play. by \"play\" i mean they chased one another around in a circle for over a minute. it was not scary because it was like watching a dog chase it's tail, but i can't help feeling they were doing it for our entertainment. then the spheres stopped and the sky went black again , but only for a moment. they reappeared in an arc formation turning on one at a time till there was 5 and when all 5 were lit they vanished in the same order they came on. the later events happened very quickly and was similar to the movement of a rock skipping across a pond. after all this happened we called each of our parents and told them and questioned if they had heard from the t.V. of any sightings or strange things happening. we were told by her mom to call the sheriffs department. which we did to report it and to find out any information if there was any, which there was no other reports. i live 30 minutes from grissom airbase and see planes, jets and heliocopters often at night as well as in the day. this was no aircraft known to me based on the way it moved and the fact that it seemed to notice and interact with us. though i am not on speaking terms with the girl in the car that night i know from statements made by her mom to mine that she is still puzzled by what it was we saw that night. i have looked for similar videos and pictures to what i experienced on the internet and have yet to find any.
