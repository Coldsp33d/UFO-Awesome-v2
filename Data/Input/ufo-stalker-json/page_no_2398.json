turned right on priest drive heading south bound.  while i was driving in the left lane at the posted speed limit, with my window down, i saw a very bright white star-like sphere on my left (east) at approximately 1,000 feet above ground level. the object itself was moving in a direction from southeast to the northwest very slowly. the light was constant and there was no strobe visible. the light did not appear to be landing lamps, and there was no visible red navigation light that should have been visible on an aircraft flying in the direction of the object. the object was also flying in an area i would consider dangerous. my reason for this statement is because sky harbor traffic was departing the runways to the east at this time. i believe it was not transitioning class bravo airspace because it was flying too low. ..... now to continue my sighting. while continuing to view the object, several trees came between me and the object. when this happened, the object was taken out of my view for approximately 2 seconds.  right after the trees had passed, the object was gone.  i slowed the vehicle and continued to look constantly for the next several minutes; ever after i turned left on university to head east toward rural.  this was the first time i have ever observed an object like this. flying and aviation is something that is second nature to me.  i am a licensed private

11 year old and i went outside on the 5th to see the area fireworks going off again .We noticed a really bright star to the north and we were admiring it for a few minutes when it suddenly began to move. my daughter and i quickly looked at each other to question its movement. it came completely over top of us as slow as could be and made absolutely no sound. we started asking each other if we saw airplane lights on anything resembling a plane...It was nothing like a plane with no blinking lights or sound. we noticed 4 red lights(kinda in a square formation)underneath. after it passed over our house, it took off to the east very quickly and it was low enough to see a red-like fire glow in the back center.  it vanished. not even 5 seconds later,it re-appeared in the north instantly...We were both in shock and wondering how the heck did it just take off to the east and re-appear in the north even closer to us again. it stayed in place maybe 30 seconds and then took off once again to the north never to be seen again. i ran in to get the video camera hoping it would come back but was quite disappointed. what i did notice when planes flew over that clear night,it was easy to see the planes(no matter how high in the sky) and heard the sounds as well. what my daughter and i saw that evening was something that \"hyper-spaced\" away and was very distinctive. i'm prepared with a

i sat in the rocking chair on my back patio to smoke. the chair was facing out to the left of my house and i noticed a bright flashing light moving at a medium speed in a strait line. the night was realy clear and you can see all the stars, at first i was sure it was just a plane but there was nothing else going on so i continued to watch it. and to my suprize as it was going in a strait line it then stoped and started moving back and forth along the same line while strobing bright bright white then it stalled out stopped strobing and changed color into bright red. then it just vannashed, i was so shocked at what i saw i knocked on my bedroom window from the out side and called my wife outside to explain what i saw. i was pointing up in the sky explaining it to her and then it apeared again but this time was green/blue. it moved back and forth and then up and down and even diaganal. it continued changing color and dissapearing and reapearing for about 40 min then it just vanished. my wife just told me to calm down and not to get all worked up. she convinced me to let it go and to come back inside. but it consumed me the following day and when i went outside the next night at the same time it apeared agian on the 23rd of july but this time for not as long. \r\n\r\ni have served 7 years in the military and i have been living here in killeen for the last 4 years right

iraq. i must add that i do have a video camera and i did go get it to try to film but the batery was dead so i tried to use my cell camera and it didnt come out good and you cant make anything out. i talked to people the next day about it but no one that i know was up or outside at that time so they did not see it. i felt copelled to share and it is my hope that someone out there saw the same thing or if not can explain what i did see.","distance":"Over 1 Mile, Unknown","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Stationary,Hovering then

reflecting off it was slightly different the the light coming through the clean parts of the glass, so i was getting used to it looking weird. as soon as it got to the darkest part of the highway, i kept seeing this sparkle-like light. out of the corner of my eye it was like blue red and white-is lights flashing for a split second then nothing. i tought it wasw a plane or something at first so i ignored it. then it kept happening at different spots in the sky. so i thought it was my eyes. i couldnt trust my windshield anymore so i pulled over on the side of the road and got out to get a better look see. sure enough, i wasnt hallucinating. it was almost like a firecracker as in almost like sparkling but different colors. at one point it stopped flashing and changed to a constant white light. faint at first, it got brighter and brighter for about 5 seconds then disappeared. it did that 2 or 3 times before changing back to the sparkles and flew off until i couldnt see it over houses anymore. i know what airplanes and helicopters look like at night. their lights have a constant pattern and the flight path is in a constant straight path or turning slowly and easily.  but this had random light flashes and a very zig zag-like, almost violent flight path with no real direction. i also know what planets and stars look like at night and this was a starless night with airplanes in the air to compare this thing to. the only other lights in the sky was the moon and a couple red and blue stationary bright lights around the object i saw. i eventually got home and couldnt see anything anymore. i told everyone immediately and got laughed at because i was alone. but i swear im not making this up. i even looked it up that night and even today( the following day) and nothing.

(this was the best view that i had seen thus far. i would describe it as a very large, long, cigar shaped object, approximately several hundred meters in length, with white lights on each end and a glowing green and red center). of the other two, the one to the right continued north, and the one two the left continued south. all three departed in a sequenced, organized pattern of flight and melted into the black of night.\r\nin conclusion, i don't know what they were, but they certainly did not exhibit conventional flight maneuvers. as a student pilot myself, i did not recognize any traditional movements. they could choose to hover, or turn 180 without incident. additionally, they made no sound whatsoever! \r\nto quote the great movie contact, \"whatever it is...It ain't

the thing for about two minutes. it then departed in the northerly direction and took between one and two minutes to completely disappear. i did not have my camera with me (although i do now carry a throwaway 35 mm in my car). later, i returned to the area and took a photo of the exact scene as i saw it. i have superimposed a ufo in the position that it was then located. this photo now represents exactly what i saw on that date (june 17 or 18, 2008). according to a local map, the craft was approximately 2460 feet from my location. from my perspective it was about the size of a quarter. it was the most incredible thing that i have ever seen. previous to this sighting i never really gave ufos much thought. i didn't necessarily believe in them or disbelieve them. i had no opinion but i certainly do now. most of the people that i have related this story to think that i'm crazy . . .Who knows, maybe i am but i know what i saw is what i saw. i  have been totally unable to find another

and due to being rushed it was rather poorly written.  i also realized it was sunday the 6th rather then the 13th that the event took place.\r\n\r\non  sunday the 6th of july around 6pm i was driving  from a restaurant in westland towards my home in livonia (michigan).   i turned off of wayne rd onto ann arbor trail (heading towards farmington rd) when off to my left i noticed what at first i thought might be a plane.  i quickly realized that i couldn���t see any wings or a tail so i started viewing it more intently.  it was close enough that i should have been able to notice if it had wings or a tail but because it was very similar in size to a 747 i assumed maybe it was just an optical illusion because of the angle i was viewing it at or whatnot.  i then noticed that it was going strangely slow for a plane though.  by this time i went behind some trees and i assumed it would be gone by the time i came to the clearing near the trafic light at ann arbor trail and hines drive but to my surprise it was still in the sky close to the same area i saw it in before my view was blocked by the trees.   i thought for a second that it might have been a blimp due its slow speed but  it seemed too thin to be a blimp.  i still couldn���t make out any wings or a tail at this point when i had an even better view of it.  when it speed up fairly rapidly and disappeared from view i knew it defintly wasn't a blimp however.\r\n\r\nwhen i made it home i told my mom about this and to my surprise she said she just heard someone on the radio mention a cigar shaped craft.  i still didn���t make a report at this point because it was only one other person who said they had seen something and i thought maybe i was just being fooled by a strange optical trick or angle of flight and maybe it was a plane.  it was definitely out of the ordinary enough to make the hairs stand up on my arm and i really wanted to pull over to get a better look but with the traffic and everything i didn���t do it.   later however there was a whole rash of sightings of cigar shaped aircraft here in michigan in the past few weeks so it made me think i should make a report.\r\n\r\non a detroit tv news channel (forgot which channel) a few days ago (two  i believe) i head them speaking about  sightings of a cigar shaped craft at night that had red and orange lights and moved in a puzzling manner.  it was viewed by a large number of people and the police were called to the scene. according to news the police stated that there were no helicopters in the area ( i guess because of it's movement some people thought it could be helicopter).  the day after that i was listening to the drew and mike program and they had people calling in discussing the ufo sightings and one person  stated that he and all the people at a local children���s baseball game also noticed a cigar shaped craft with red and orange lights at an earlier date as well.  none of these sightings were in livonia or westland though but they were close by.\r\n\r\ni will take some pictures of the area i witnessed the (whatever it was i saw) at.  maybe someone else has seen this as well?  \r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1

draco while maintaining a red appearance. it would then start blinking white again before moving back the other way, still in a straight line, while having a blue-green appearance. the light continued this pattern (pause, blink, move) for around 45 minuets before taking off towards the city of killeen, simply vanishing at one point before reappearing to blink while seeming to hover before disappearing all together. \r\n\r\nthere was another star like light, hovering over the housing area that seemed to strobe through a series of color while not moving. this light stayed like this for the duration of the event, before traveling away from post to simply disappear from sight. it moved in a straight line, contrary to the movement of the night sky, and even the airplane that passed directly over it at one point. \r\n\r\nthere were a quite a few other lights exhibiting the same behaviors as the ones listed above (primarily the star like one), and it was rather overwhelming. my

about 2 oclock in the morining i took a walk away from the fire when i looked to the ske by a lake we have and saw a round object flashing multiple colors i called the people with me to look at it after this we stayed watching it it was so amazing to see how it moved it was moving in circle type of way but it was ammitting differnt light beams from it it almost looked as if it was scanning the surface of the woods i got an idea to shine the light at it and when i did it reacted to it i would shine it to differnt points in the air and it would fallow the light i was shining almost in the exact time i would change direction this is when it seemed to get closer and make even crazier manuvers in the sky when it started getting closer another one apeared behind it a little ways but this one seemed smaller then the first they were keeping a good distance away from each other and i decided to shine the flash light directly up from were we were and keep it pointed there once i positiond the flash light the first one looked like it was drawing closer then the unbelievable happend a really bright one came from the right of were we could see the sky and was moving real quik it passed by the first one we saw and jus kept goin to the trees to the left were we could not see it anymore this is when we counted about 5 more little ones coming in our direction not fast but steady this is when i felt real uncomfterable the were still reacting to the flash light but it got to scary so we went back to the fire i noticed the first 2 we saw stayed in the same location we left them at but i could see alot more in the skyes right above us but a good distance away then the scariest moment in my life happend i felt as if we were bieng watched i could see light in the trees in the distance and it looked like there were 3 differnt lights at differnt spots and the looked like the were scanning like the others but this time they were on the ground i got reaally nervos and then i heard the strangest sound ever it may sound weird but it sounded like the bugle from the things that were on war of the worlds no joke at this time it would have been around 3 thirty am and we tried to take our minds off it and jus sat around the camp fire the lights were still there but were not moving closer finnally around 5:30 am and it was getting light out we could still see some of the ufos still out but they made it look like they were jus fading out into space but the ship we saw on the ground with the strange light was still landed and still emmiting beams we could see it in the trees but it was hard cus there were so many to look through we decided to walk up to it and get a better look it had about four lights accross in a horizantle line and the ship its self look invisable exept for the loghts around it we tried to get closer and when we did it looked like it was moving towards us it shot a neon blue light right above our heads and we took off back to the camp sight it made a strang winding sound like a turbine or somthing but i know for a fact this was not of this world when it started to get more light we lost track of it in the distance of the trees but this was not the first time i have seen these around here i would spot them when i would be in town but when i would show people they would just say they were satalites and i knew they were not they didnt move as much as when we saw them in the woods but you would look at them one time and the next the would be in a differnt spot in the sky and would glow with some type of eternal lights there is alot of military up here and i dont know why they have alot of choppers and it makes me wonder why but after the night we saw them and were almost like communicating with them i can see them every night now just not as close this was real and i really do think people should have the right to know what is really going on  ","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1 Mile,

wathing the sky. frequent f-16 activity has kept me interested in sky-watching, as well as unexplainable satellite-like lights which move contrary to common satelites. looking to the northern skyline, i immediately saw a light which was partially obscured by a low cieling which was developed at around 2.5-3 thousand feet. the light source proved to be 4 white lights in a tight group appearing in an elongated diamond formation which i estimate to have been .5 to .75 miles distant. i estimate the object to have been between 50 and 75 feet from the front light to the rear light. viewed from directly below, i postulate that the light pattern might have appeared square. i am of the opinion that the lights were connected to one object, although i could not discern an object- only the lights and their direction, speed and relative configuration. the lights moved slowly (under 50mph) covering only a few degrees of sky before dissapearing in the low cieling. only five minutes later, as i finished filling the last of three 6-gallon water jugs, the sky cleared from the east (the lights' direction of travel) and nothing was to be seen. however, note that at their low altitude and my angle of view, they would have travelled beyond my sight by this time. again, the night was silent. there were not yet even leaves to rustle in the trees, and the light breeze did not produce a whisper in the needles of the red pines above my head; wind speed at ground level was ~5mph and aloft appeared ~20-25mph. the object, while i observed it, appeared to maintain a constant, straight and level trajectory against the wind. although the lights performed no extreme or even conventional maneuvers, it clearly was not a conventional aircraft and was clearly beyond the capabilities of any aircraft of which i am familiar. i felt no fear nor did i feel as if the object or its occupants were aware of me. i do feel as if it were definitly not natural phenomena and, further, that it was a powered craft under intelligent guidance. i am a former enlisted (e-4 sergeant) usaf security policeman (1983-1989) and have seen every type of aircraft in day, night and all-weather operations and have never observed an object before which so obviously defied all conventional. did any other observers report anything similar in my area during this time? i am curious to know if anything more could be added.

something i couldn't comprehend then, nor can i now.  there was a huge circular \"ship\" over the street  hovering.  i couldn't speak, yet i found myself saying aloud \"oh. god\"!  it hovered there.  i don't know how long.  it was as large as a house, maybe larger.  it was circular and had rectangular windows, where i felt that someone was watching me.  i swear to god, i saw \"them\".  i don't know how long it was there, but the next thing i heard my friend say was, \"it's alright, they're gone.\"  i have never ever reported this.  i don't want anyone to think i'm \"nuts.\"  i don't want to

was a full moon and the sky was clear. me and my 2 daughters were sitting outside at 1:16am talking and we looked up at the moon and we saw a very bright light that was moving very fast and then just disappeared (this was not a shooting star). as we continued to look up at the sky we saw more unexplainable bright lights one after another they happened within 10-15 minutes of each other. the bight lights would just appear for about 5 seconds then split in half then disappear there was no reasonable explanation for what had happened we had never seen anything like it before. the last one that me and my 2 daughters saw was around 3am and it flew right over us from north west to south east over the house and past the trees then we could not see it anymore. this time the light didn't disappear after 5 seconds it just continued to fly across the sky very fast. my daughter noticed that the object had 3 points that lit up like a triangle. you could not hear a sound/noise coming from the object it was very quiet. over the 2 hour span of time we saw about 7-8 bright bright lights that would appear out of no where flying very fast in the sky then split in half after 5 seconds then disappear. both my daughters went back inside to go to bed and i was out side drinking a coffee and smoking a cigarette and around 4am it was starting to get light out there was no stars in the sky and i was outside alone loading my boat on to my truck to go fishing with my son and i saw another bright light in the sky then it split in half then
