white/gold color light going west to east and it looked like a star. it did not look like any normal plane and my house is under the greater pitt landing route and there are several fly over routes over my house and it did not resemble normal high altitude planes. i ran in the house and my wife and i watched the light disappear from our back deck. this all took about a minute for it to go horizon to horizon. this passed over the house at 9:52 pm and shortly there after i watched an arriving flight fly over my house which would have been i guess flight 5732 or 1794. it was about twice the size and brightness of saturn. my impression was it was flying in the 30000 foot range based on the fly over plane routes over my house are about 35000 feet this was only my impression of it's height. i have seen the spacelab and military planes pass over the house and it did not resemble any of these. i also have seen a fireball and many shooting stars and it did not resemble these. it had a straight smooth flight path with no normal lighting a plane would have. a plane flying a fly over route over my house takes about 4 or 5 minutes once spotted on the horizon to go out of site on the

having a cigarette. it was warm and humid, and there was farily thick but broken cloud coverage. there was very little air movement or breeze. we were both looking at the sky, as that is what we normally do while out smoking. i was looking in one direction,(southeast) and my husband was looking in another (north), when my husband shouted \"look!\" and pointed to the sky. i turned quickly and immediately saw what he was pointing at. \r\n\r\nwe witnessed an object flying well underneath the clouds, though neither my husband or i are able to give even a rough altitude. although it appeared as though it might have been at a rough altitude of where private small propellor planes often fly, while circling to land at the near-by air strip. \r\n\r\nthe object was grey or light grey against the cloudy background. it had no lights or reflectors of any kind, and we were also unable to determine exactly what kind of shape the object was. my husband, who saw the object a few seconds longer than me, says that at least the back-side of the object was almost rectangular in shape. i was unable to decide on any shape, personally, though it was clearly a solid shape. \r\n\r\nit was moving in a northwest direction at a very quick speed, but was moving perfectly smooth and steady in a very straight line. if i were to compare the speed of the object we saw to the speed of an aircraft, it would be similiar to the speed of a fighter jet, (i.E. f-15, not 737.) we witnessed the object only for a few seconds, and then lost sight of it past our neighbor's roof.\r\n\r\nguelph, ontario, is roughly 75km from toronto, which has a large airport. guelph also has it's own very small air strip. due to this we see alot of activitiy in the air on a daily basis. (also, i grew up in duluth minnesota, where there is an airport and air force base, so i have spent my entire life seeing aircraft of all sorts in the skies.) \r\n\r\nmy husband and i do not feel what we saw last night was a plane or jet of any kind. i felt 100% certain of that even while i was looking at the object in the sky. no lights, or distinct airplane shape (wings) and the biggest, no sound. \r\n\r\nguelph also has quite a few industrial buildings, so there is continuous background noise, however it was very quiet last night due to it being a sunday, and the near-by plants do not run on the weekends. even with the normal industrial hum always in the background, we are able to hear passenger planes high above the clouds coming and going from the toronto airport, and often have small private planes flying over our house coming to and from the small air strip just outside of town. so, this object we witnessed last night being completely silent really sticks out in our minds.\r\n\r\nwe also do not believe the object was a bird of any kind. birds flying have distinct characteristics, such as gliding with or against the wind, flapping wings, and variations in speed. the object we saw did not have any of those characteristics, as it moved with one, quick, speed and remained in a perfectly straight and smooth line for the entire duration of our witnessing it.\r\n\r\ni have been interested in the ufo phenomena for some time, (which is why i always keep my eyes to the sky when i'm outside), and have never seen anything unexplainable, until last night. my husband has never seen anything unexplainable either, though he does not generally look as much as i do, until last night. i never really put alot of thought into how i would react in the case i actually did see what i was looking for. i could not tell you what my initial thoughts were, but it did make my heart skip a beat, and interestingly brought a tear to my eye. my husband was not quite as \"touched\", as his first thoughts were \"wow, a ufo\".\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other,  Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line path","formattedAddress":null,"id":11666,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":43.539102,"location":null,"logNumber":"CA-07212008-0011","longitude":-80.247622,"occurred":1216618800000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"Ontario","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Cigar,  Egg,  Square,  Rectagular,  Teardrop,  Unknown","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1216618800000,"summary":"Grey object,  moving quickly, silently, and smoothly, no lights or reflectors, ","tags":["lights"],"timeZone":"EST","timeZoneName":"EST","tweeted":0,"urls":null,"weather":null,"zipcode":"","daysBetweenOccurrenceAndSubmission":-1,"locationName":"Guelph, Ontario","triangle":false,"type":"UFO Sighting","$$hashKey":"object:355739"},{"address":null,"addressResolution":null,"altitude":"Unknown","city":"Salem","country":"United States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"I was laying on a lawn chair in the backyard in windham nh. it was a beautiful day, the sky was a deep blue and the clouds were few and far between. i was staring up in the sky specifically looking for any odd craft like objects which i have done many times before. i could see typical airplanes fly by periodically. all of a sudden my eyes caught the object, it was like a small silver ball bearing, it wasnt moving. it was very high in the sky, further than any of the planes that i saw. it must of been several miles up. it didnt move at all. i looked around to see if there were any stars out but it was the middle of tha day, there were no stars. i could see regular airplanes and they were moving, this object was not. maybe it was a satelite?

straight down, like a vtol does.\r\nabout a half mile from my house is a pg&e sub=station, then a bare field of 5-6 acres, then an orchard.  there is a house in the trees, but between what would be my line of sight and the house is another bldg. so i doubt i could see those lights.  there is a light from a service station at the corner that i see all the time, but this new light was several hundred ft. north of that light.  i could see both lights.\r\ni watchd this for 30-45 min. during which time it dimmed several times, and once blinked out completely.\r\nthis morning i dared to drive down the

string of lights were blinking in sequence.  after maybe 10 minutes i went back to my computer.  maybe 45 min. later i went back to take a peek and the light was now a bare quarter mile away, hanging ove the pasture area, at an elevation of (as a guess) 10-20,000 ft.  there was no soound that i could hear.\r\nnow i could clearly see that the lights were 'running' around the center of whatever was there.  after about 5 min. the lights stopped and just two steady lights, like auto headlights appeared.  they remained for 3-4 seconds, then the 'running lights' appeared again.  i opened the door for a clearer view and watched for nearly an hour while the running lights alternated with the auto headlight sequence.  all this time the light did not move across the sky as a star or plane or satellite would.  it was still doing it's thing when i decided to go on to bed if it wasn't going to put on any new antics.\r\ncould hese two incidences be related in some way.\r\n","distance":"501

dragging advertisements fly up and down the coast pretty frequently and i always stop and watch as they fly by - just for fun.\r\n\r\nwhen i first saw the craft i figured it was a helicopter, but as

straight without any noticeable change in speed or elevation.\r\n\r\nthe part of it hanging down ( which i thought would be strings ) was thicker than string would be and was pointing directly downward, and not back toward the south like i would have expected if the balloons were being pushed by the wind.  \r\n\r\n it didn't make any noticeable noise.  there was a bit of wind, but not enough to drown out the voices of the kids playing about 50 yards down-wind from me.\r\n\r\nalso, as far as witnesses go: there were at least 20-30 people on the beach that i could see and i watched

north of 12 mile when i saw an object moving west to east that was rectangular and greyish looked like it was wider at one point than another.  i could see wisps of clouds moving by the object but i did not see anything in front of this object. the object looked at least 80 fot long perhaps over 150ft long.  my daughter was in the car as well but saw the object at a more oblique angle and only for an instant.  the object appeared to be moving about 100mph perhaps more, but it was hard to tell.  the object was about 3/4 the size of a crayon held at arms length, a little bit fatter though, and more angular and no sharp point.  it was early afternoon and there were lots of people driving about.  someone else had to see this better than we.\r\n\r\nmy first thought was that this was a plane pulling an aerial banner, that was greyish, and the pilot thought he would be sneaky and fly his plane just inside the cloud cover, towing the banner behind him hanging under the clouds, so that it looked like the banner was floating in mid-air.  i checked out aerial advertising companies and many had a clause of bad weather, or bad flight days, and how they would not fly a banner on those days and waste the advertising dollars. it looked like the ufo had a three dimensional quality to it though, like it wasnt a banner.  on the otherhand, the object was slightly tilted up.  planes that tow banners are above and of course in front of the object, so if the plane was in the clouds the banner might look like it was moving under its own power.  i did not see any cables and since i was in my car i could not tell if it made any noise. if this was an aerial banner and i was the advertiser, i would be upset that my banner was flown quite low and pretty much in the clouds.\r\n\r\nmaybe some crack mufon investigator could find out whether this was an aerial banner or not, because if it wasnt being towed by an airplane, we have nothing in civilian or military aircraft that look ever remotely like this object.  it looked the size a flying grey duplex apartment building.  this one might be easy to solve or perplexing if no aerial banners were flown on that day.  it would take some phone calls to figure out what this was, and i would feel wierd about calling a company asking them for info they might not want to divulge, especially to some civilian who thought he saw a ufo.  if anyone else saw this on the day and hour in question, report what you saw!","distance":"Over One

that i have seen in my lifetime of 67 years, b) i haven't been able to locate any other references to it having been seen by others, and c) it has continued to perplex me for years. \r\n\r\nmy wife and i were outside our home at dusk (not dark) in thorntown, indiana in august of, i believe 1968, when we saw an orange, glowing object in the distance northeast of us (toward kokomo).  as we watched, the object started zigzagging across the sky at extremely rapid speeds.  it was obvious that the object was at a considerable distance from us, and the rapid changes in direction and the speed of transit were incredibly and incomprehensibly fast.  \r\n\r\nwe watched for several minutes as the object got closer to us, and, remarkably, went almost directly overhead at a low altitude as might be expected of a light plane.  as the object moved over us, its color shifted from orange to a yellowish-orange and the appearance changed from a glowing object to a noticeably larger circle which could best be described as \"looking into a jet engine exhaust\" at relatively close range.  up to that point the object had been noiseless, but some seconds after it had passed overhead, a sound comparable to that of a jet engine was heard.  the object subsequently disappeared rather quickly into the distance.  at no point was there any object definition.  although i would trust that the description above would reveal this, any speculation that this was some sort of light phenomenon would be completely inconsistent with what was seen.\r\n\r\nas i recall, there was either no, or minimal, mention of this in the newspapers at the time.  i recall reporting this to either bunker hill afb or blue book (it's been a while), but no-one ever followed up with me.  i'm a scientist and would expect there to be a logical explanation of this phenomenon (if not \"perfectly\" logical). i have described this phenomenon to a few people who appear to accept it as objective fact, but, at the same time, it's obvious that it is difficult to appreciate the remarkable nature of this incident unless you were there.  i've looked for similar reports, but i haven't really found any.\r\n\r\n","distance":"101-500 Feet, Over 1 Mile","duration":"","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Path with directional

colorado.It was somewhat misty outside and a bit chilly.I was currently going to a private school for boys at the emily griffith center for children and young adults.Everyday before a meal,my peers and i would have to walk in strict line transitions to the cafeteria from our lodge.One morning,as we stood in line in front of the cafeteria,i decided to look up at the misty sky and saw a shiny silver egg shaped thing about 100 to 200 feet above us.It was floating completely still and made no niose at all.I stood there mystified and wondered what it could be.I watched this thing for a good 5 or 7 minutes when it suddenly zipped away into the sky,like a bullet.I say bullet because that is the only way that i can describe the speed in wich it shot away.When that happened i started to tell my peers,but nobody saw what i saw.Seeing this thing totally shocked and excited me.I couldnt stop talking about it all through breakfast.I had a gut feeling right away that this was a ufo,once it had zipped away into the atmosphere.About 2 hours later,during our field activity,i was even more wierded out,when black helocopters circled over our campus for a good 30 to 45 minutes.I was somewhat skeptical about these sort of things until this happened,but not anymore.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"03:00:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Hovering
