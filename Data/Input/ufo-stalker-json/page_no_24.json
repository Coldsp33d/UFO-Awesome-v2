event happened the week before two police officers chased a ufo down the m53 motorway on the wirral, merseyside.\r\nat this particular time i was working at lucas girling in bromborough. i was a cnc machinist. we made braking systems for the french sncf high speed train amongst others.\r\nthat afternoon i was working a 3pm to 11pm shift.\r\ni finished work at 11pm and left the factory at approx 11:15pm. i was giving a colleague of mine a lift home because he lived in the same street as me.\r\ni was driving down allport road, bromborough at approx 11:20pm. it was a dark night but cloud free, i could see the stars in the sky but as we travelled down allport road i noticed that there seemed to be a huge blackness in the sky blocking out surrounding stars. i stopped the car and both my colleague and i got out to observe this.\r\nbasically it was a huge black disc blocking out the starlight but the edge of the disc was edged with lights. it wasn't a plane coming into land at liverpool airport because this thing was almost stationary but it just seemed to be creeping along.\r\ni felt the hair rise on the back of my neck. rod and i jumped back in my car and sped off home asap.\r\nwe both knew what we had seen but i think it was also a case of denial.\r\nwho would believe us.\r\npeople would think we are a pair of idiots.\r\nwe didn't even discuss it between ourselves.\r\n\r\nbut as the years have passed i firmly believe we are not alone. i think we are being observed, studied.\r\nworst case scenario is that in the scheme of things we could be like a small amount of bacteria in a petri dish.","distance":"Unknown","duration":"00:04:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Other","flightPath":"Stationary","formattedAddress":null,"id":90559,"landingOccurred":false,"latitude":53.44105784266857,"location":null,"logNumber":"GB-03042018-0016","longitude":-2.893551163163863,"occurred":261443700000,"potentialRelations":[],"rating":"Unrated","region":"England","reportedWeather":null,"shape":"Disc","source":"MUFON","status":null,"submitted":1520173686000,"summary":"Life

particularly crisp or something, so i pulled the curtain back and went to take a breath of fresh air. when i looked up, i noticed a large, bright goldish light that appeared to be glistening brightly. immediately, of course, my brain went to “it’s a meteor, i’m about to die” mode, so i rushed into my room and grabbed my binoculars. i tried looking at it, but it was so bright that i really couldn’t make sense of it. i thought it might be helpful to take a photo, so i rushed to get my phone. when i came back, the spot was now much more dim than before, but still bright, and after a few seconds, it began moving south in a straight line over what appeared to be a second, hovering light in the sky that i had not noticed before. i was pretty terrified at this point, not gonna lie. i think i may have looked down to try and get a video, but when i looked out the window again, the first light was gone and it seemed the second, lower one was now heading furher west, away from me. it’s been about an hour since i saw, whatever i saw, and i’ve been feeling really *off*. my head is pounding, and something isn’t setting right in my gut. i’m also hearing some peculiar beeps and hums that seem to be

pass over. heard what i thought to be a snow plow coming around the corner from the south east ( no snow on ground ) mom then called out jets based on the sounds. grabbed camera next to me and got to the door barefoot in seconds sound intensifying as two a-10s flew over house headed north west followed by sounds faded fast. ran out the door down the steps and half the driveway for a clear shot without trees blocking line of sight. got one photo in with the wrong setting nothing but white, changed settings to auto adjust then got a series of photos focusing on the a-10s using the viewfinder to watch them before they got to far for the camera to capture clearly. then i watched for a few seconds by eye clearly seeing two planes but a third object ahead of them darker and smaller didn't seem to be a third plane. trees and horizon blocked my sight as they flew over to the north. came back inside and starting looking to magnify the photos and noticed the dark object they were following in the photos to blurry for me to really see anything marking or even basic shape. i showed these photos to family they weren't to sure what the third object was either.\r\n\r\n for years the a-10s have had training flights right over my house every at least once or twice a year, this was the first i've seen this year. there has always seemed to be just two a-10s that i've seen flying in formation using the farms and silos as targets, they usually branch out over both roads after crossing over my house. the sounds just seemed different this time to me. if needed i will search for the past photos of a-10s flying over head.\r\n\r\nthis time you can see in the photos they are both heading the same way after a dark object. one planes appears to be changing course to follow object. i hope the photos can be of help because it just looks to blurry for me and therefore less credible. i have the white photo but didn't attach for the sake of file space you allow, i also attached the nef file versions in case they are better info for you.\r\n\r\nstill feeling very sure of how i recalled and wrote this all. during the event i was calm but had energy to move fast to get the position to take the photo. i got a little perked up when i saw the third object that i couldn't make out before i even looked at the photos. as for now i'm still a little unsure that i should be making this all out like mountains out of ant hills.\r\n\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:00:11","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"Unknown","flightPath":"Straight-line

out to others, but no house lights were on,no cars passed and\r\nfoot trafiic was non existant. i was excited i now knew somethings out there.I had no cellphone for a picture,and no net to catch it,i thought i\r\ncould jump right on it, but will i die.The fact i cant prove it rots me.The incident changed me,i felt freaked out for at least 3 months after.It was slightly traumatic,im so happy it happened cause now i know,things are out there.Now the question of what the hell is it,will never leave me,and i await full ufo disclosure,with even more anticipation then ever.Now i want answers for

together again. we began to face south west as we talked when the object suddenly turned its light. it looked like a bright purple globe. it seemed to have been hovering at 1500 feet or more, then turned on its light and flew about two miles north at lightening speed. we wondered if it had been there spying on us. i felt a bit of an ache in my eyes and in my head as i stared at it.  i am not sure why. the object was spherical and had a bright purple glow. as soon as it's light turned on and became visible, it flew at lightning speed about 2 miles from south to north and then it shut its light off and vanished. it seemed to curl as if making a turn to go back south or go west, but once the lights were completely off we could not see if it was still there hovering. we were feeling shocked but not scared by what we saw and began to laugh a bit nervously. i asked my friend \"did you see that?\" she said \"yes, i was going to ask you if it was a shooting star.\" i answered \"it was purple. the stars are white, and it was bigger than the stars and faster than a plane or helicopter. i think we saw a ufo.\" she said, \"that's what i saw too.\" i said to her, \"i am glad you saw it or i would have thought i was loosing my mind had i been alone.\" we knew it was not a shooting star, nor a plane or helicopter, because it moved a long distance at speed we'd never seen air crafts fly in the air before. i live near jfk airport and know the speed of a planes as they fly over our house.
