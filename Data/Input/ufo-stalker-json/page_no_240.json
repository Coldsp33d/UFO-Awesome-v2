i don't recall anything about that night, but this did co-inside with my dog acting very strangely that wed evening (a lot of dog in the neighborhood barking that evening) it wasn't until i pulled my camera images last night (5/5/17) that i put two and two together.\r\n\r\nmy hunting dog is part coonhound and nothing usually phases her, with the exception of coyotes! \r\nthe things i believe:\r\n1. not the moon - wrong place, wrong phase.\r\n2. not a plane - no other lights, can't hover. no sound.\r\n3. not a drone - 2am, dark and flying through trees, no-one has that skill.\r\n4. helicopter - would have to be the front light, which meant it was flying backwards, and no other lights, no sound.\r\n5. close enough to activate the sensor on the camera over a 43 min

flying towards me from the west. at first i thought it was an eagle or something like that so i looked up to watch it go by. it was coming directly at the house and as it got closer i realized that it was not a living creature. it was sort of shaped like a coffin, having either 5 or 7 sides and was fairly flat and it was black with orange trim. my guesstimate is that it was low enough that a person could conceivably have thrown something at it and hit it, perhaps about 30 feet high at the time it stopped in front of my house. when it reached the front of my house it veered off abruptly at a 90* angle heading north and flew away. i tried to go to a different window to see it but by the time i got to the other side of the house it was gone. i would guess that it was probably moving somewhere about 50mph, and size-wise i'm going to guess probably somewhere around 2 feet by 3 feet, though possible a little larger, and it was quite flat appearing. i could not see the top of it so it may have been taller or thicker than it appeared from underneath. i have searched online for every conceivable type of drone and remote control contraption that a person could buy. there are a couple that are similar but i have found nothing that looks like what i saw. i could see no form of propulsion, and if it was a drone it must have had something up on the top of it where i couldn't see, but it was flat enough that this seems unlikely.\r\ni see a lot of weird things in the sky around here, and i have seen military drones, and this was not like anything i have ever seen.\r\nit simply looked like a black, thin, coffin shaped solid object that could move quickly and maneuver with great agility, and i take into account that i was inside, but i heard nothing. no sound of propellers or a motor.

in the corps, i worked on a-6s and f-18s, so i am very aware of the normal behavior of aircraft and what they look like in the sky at night and during the day. as far as the object i am reporting seeing, i have seen the object on three different occasions in the sky, about a northeastern position, in a 5 day period. it was in the exact same position in the sky each time i saw it because of it's position between two pine trees. the first time was the 3rd of may, 2017 at around 10:15 pm while i was taking my dogs out for the last time of the evening. it was fully dark at this point and i was in my back yard which is fenced in but is bordered in the back of my property with a couple of very tall pine trees about 30ft apart, that is where i first spotted the light, in between the large gap of two pine trees. it was weird to me because i love watching at the night sky and this was a new light to me. at that time of night, you might find a jet or two flying very high up because i am about 80 miles northwest of jacksonville, florida but not on these nights. it was very quiet each time i spotted the light. i watched the light for about 15 minutes and it was very bright and did not move at all. during that time, it would slowly flicker out then it would flicker back on again. i was not sure what i was seeing on the first night so i dismissed it. on the next night around about the same time, i saw the light again. this is when i kind of freaked out because it was in the exact same spot in the sky. the reason i can tell you that is because i was using the pine trees as my reference. i didn't see it on the 5th of may because by this time, every time i would go out at night i would look for the light. the third time i saw it in the exact same position in the sky as the other evenings and it was very early in the morning, around 5:14 am on the 6th of may. this time i ran back into my house and got my cell phone and videoed the light. i only videoed about 5 minutes of the light before it flicked out and didn't come back on but this time was a little different. when i take my dogs out in the dark, i have a very powerful flashlight with me and when i saw the light, it wasn't very bright when i first got out in the yard. so i started shining the flashlight at the light in the sky; that is when it started to get very bright and slowly glow then flicker out then repeat the process. the other thing that was very weird to me is the light was very quiet. why i am saying this is because normally when there are an aircraft in the sky over my house i can hear them before i see them, either their strobe lights at night or sighting an aircraft silhouette during the day. i would say it was less than an eighth of a mile from where i was standing. when it was at it's brightest, it looked as if it was an upside down cone at the top of it and a very bright round light at the bottom. on the cone area there seem to be a red strip at the point. i live way out in the country so there was not a lot of other light sources out there to be a problem for me to see this light.","distance":"501 Feet - 1

to my grandmother she was actually the nicest person ever but one night she was rly mad at her boyfriend and she sat there popping some bubble wrap saying how she wished it was her bf brains and sure enough she was called into a hospital that night (this was before cell phones) bc her boyfriend truly had a random brain aneurysm so ever since it was always joked about. growing up i caught myself reading people minds here and there bc they'd tell me and i just figured it was bc i read there body language rly well etc.  well years go by and i always had these intense dreams again i didn't think much about them until when i was about 6 months pregnant and i had yet to find out if i was having a boy or girl and i had this dream (at least i think it was) where i was in this really bright lighted room or area and out comes this little boy probably seemed to be about 6 ish yrs old and without hesitation comes right up to me hugs me saying \"hi mama\" and i kinda laugh nervously and \"say who are you?\" and he says \"silly mom i'm (says his name) and i'm your son\" he was so certain and i start to look around and realize i can't really make out who's all standing around and that's all i remember. i awoke from that dream with a certainty that i was having a boy and that this is what his name was i was so confident i wouldn't even consider a girls name and the dream was right. fast forward years and years the boy i saw in that dream was my son he looks exactly like the dream i had. the older he got though the more often we were reading each other's mind without realizing it so much so the game i spy became boring to him fast. also the older he got the more his birthmark came in and darkened at first i didn't think much of it until he saw my birthmark and said out loud what i myself was trying not to really say or acknowledge that our birthmarks are exactly alike only difference is his is on his arm and mine is on my leg other than that they are exact both look like a hand drawn star. for years it's been this way and probably will always be this way we read each other's mind daily like most people tell time you have to look at a clock to know and for us we just have to be close or think about it and that's it. there's been times where we've even mentally helped the other with sharing physical pain one might be having we've even had to learn how to not read each other or accidentally take the pain unintentionally. are we hybrids? are we mutants? or are we a lab project? i don't know but i strongly feel our birthmarks are more like tags for some thing ..... farmers tag thier livestock for a reason and it freaks me out what ours could mean.

horizontal lights in the distance when we were around the rest area outside laredo on 59. the lights were in a straight line and not offset slightly in relation to each other. the object was traveling due east towards us. i told my son to look at it as it had no red or white flashing lights that would indicate some type of aircraft. i told him it looked like a ufo. as we passed the firing range on the outskirts of laredo it appeared to be fixing to fly over us. it was very large and i thought i was going to get a good look at it. i told my son to video tape it. he started video taping the object. it made a turn towards the north and flew over the highway as it descended towards the lake and passed over a fair ground off the highway. as it turned to the north you would expect the lights to pivot as the object changed direction, but the lights remained in a horizontal line and did not change position as the object changed direction. we lost sight of it after it descended out of sight over the buildings and trees about 8:25pm. there is an airport in laredo about 2 to 3 miles to the west of where we spotted the object, but it was too low to be making an approach or circling around towards the airport and none of the runways line up with an approach from this direction. the 3 white lights never flashed and were almost blinding they were so bright. they were as bright as a light plant on a well sight. we did not hear any sound whatsoever. we were both convinced we had seen a ufo. my girlfriend's brother has lived in laredo all his life and worked at the airport before. we showed the video to him, and he stated that he had never seen anything like that before around the area. he stated that it was not an airplane or helicopter. i tried matching up the light pattern with known aircraft both commercial and military and couldn't find a match.","distance":"101-500 Feet, 501 Feet - 1 Mile, Over 1

sounded very low and powerful, so i figured it had to be military, and i-being a total nerd-had to run out to the parking lot to get a look.\r\n\r\nby the time i was out my door and in the parking lot, i had just enough time to watch a small orange ball of light being chased by what i assume to be a blackhawk helicopter (because of size and sound) disappear behind the rooftops of the buildings east of me.  this struck me as bizarre because i saw something similar some months ago in the same general area (skies south of lawrence, i live on the south side of town, not far from baker wetlands).  the light was small and orange in color and was about 50-100 yards ahead of the helicopter.  it made no erratic movements but was travelling at a fair clip as the helicopter was tracking it at almost the exact speed and it was moving pretty quickly.  as such, i have my doubts that this could've been a paper lantern (though the color and intensity of the light were similar to one) and the distance ahead of the helicopter rules out a refueling boom.  i'd give the altitude of the two objects to be between 500-1000 ft agl and the speed of both to be about 100 kts at the time i saw them.\r\n\r\nalso of note, i saw another object in the sky in the general area at the same time, though it may not have been connected.  this object seemed to be an aircraft judging by the red and white lights it had on it, but it hovered in place for a moment until the lights slowly faded out with no apparent change in location.  the direction i was looking toward would be about a straight line to kci, so i wasn't immediately suspicious, but--having seen plenty of air traffic heading to and from kci on that flight path--this didn't look like anything i'd seen before (no landing lights).  i mention this because it was odd and because the previous sighting of a few months earlier of the same kind of event had 2 helicopters chasing the light instead of just one.  maybe this was the second.\r\n","distance":"501 Feet - 1 Mile","duration":"00:01:00","entityEncountered":false,"favorited":0,"features":"None","flightPath":"Path with directional

States","county":null,"created":null,"deleted":false,"description":"","detailedDescription":"It was the 2017 laughlin river run, bike week(motorcycles). we pulled into the riverside rv camp, across from the riverside casino, on the night of april 25 at approx 1:00am. we stayed in area 6 over night and got to the office early to be assigned our camp spot for the 5 days we would be staying. they assigned us area 2 space# 100 right. wwe moved our rig, set up the camper with the door facing the river and casino's. we spent our 1st. day riding about arizona and nevada. we returned to camp towards the end of the day, set up our chairs and a table, sat back to enjoy the night.The casino lights from the riverside and the aquarius shined bright in the sky above casino's. from where i sat in my chair, i could see several types of aircraft in the sky. first was the aircraft from the bullhead city airport, large passenger planes, second was the smaller cessna airplane that circled the area. two of them, and the occasional helicopter, most likely flown by law enforcement, or private helicopter. while watching the night, i noticed a group of craft flying from my right, to the left. i could make out very little at first, but as they neared the casinos, the light brought them into a better view. they flew the light of the casino's and then out of sight. i told my wife what i had seen. 5 to 6 craft flying in a v shape formation, no sound. she said it was probably a small flock of birds. i didn't think i saw any wings flapping, but let it go. i continued to sit back and watch the night. after a short while, i spotted the same formation again, this time coming from right to left. i pointed it out to my wife, look look, there it is again, she saw it. again 5 to 6 craft flying in formation, as they went by i could see one of the craft fall out of formation, just for a bit then hurry back to catch the others. then they were gone. we turned in and went to bed just wondering.\r\n\r\non the second day, we drove to oatman arizona. had a good day on the motorcycles, and again ended up back at camp setting up the chairs and table, to watch the night. again the same air traffic as the night before. we did see a drone over in the riverside parking lot, it flew up, circled around, had red and green lights, then landed back at the riverside. right about then i noticed, high above the aquarius, several small red lights. there was 5 of them that i could see. they were flying in an area very small above the casino, i thought at first it was more drone activity, but as i watched them i could see that they were performing rolls, turns, dives, chasing each other in the sky. mind you it dark, very high up, and 5 craft in a small area, and flying longer than any drone i ever saw. after a while the small red lights moved off and were gone. then all of a sudden, from right to left flew in the same set of craft. flying the river path. as before, as they approached the casino's i could see there belly brighten up. they flew by then out of view. my wife witnessed this all. i continued to watch threw the night. after a while, again, from right to left. a short time later again, this time from left to right, and as they flew by i could see that the formation was more in a straight line instead of a v shape. as they went by i could see that the two craft at the ends would drift farther out of formation and then return to formation. then they were gone. i went to bed again wondering, where is area 51? i saw the formation 3 times and the red lights high above the aquarius once. on the third day friday, again we did the motorcycle thing, stayed late walking the strip, shopping the vendor booths and returning to camp later than before approx. 10:00 p.M. set up my chairs and table, and waited. on friday night i saw the same formations flying from right to left..Left to right 4 times, and saw the same red lights again..Still flying in the same area of the sky as they did before, twice.\r\nsaturday was to be the big night. i had come to the conclusion by this time that the red lights and the v shape formation were connected. once i lost track of the red lights, i would soon see the v shape formation fly by. so as i set up my chairs and table to watch the night in laughlin nevada, i sat back and not knowing how many sightings i would see. it was the busiest night in laughlin nevada that night, you could here the strip rev up. and it seemed  as tho the two were connected. i first saw the flybys shortly after returning from the strip. again about 10:30 p.Pm i saw formation, here it came, same craft straight formation. 5 craft thru the sky, no sound, no lights just reflective light from the casino's. as before the end craft would tend to drift out and then back into close formation with the others, and then out of sight. there were times i could get out of my chair continue to watch as it flew across the strip. the light from the casinos really lit them up. and from a ways out. i really made an effort this time to get up see as much as i could. shortly, the red lights reappear'ed over the aquarius, first just one caught my attention, but then as i watched a second, then a third 4,5,doing upward climbs with rotational turns, then at the top of the climb it would roll horizontal and then as if it were on a roller coaster, slid downward as it rolled counterclockwise,380 degrees, while other craft seem to chase each other in what i would call play dogfight. the event would last for a while, and i would loose track of them. after a brief scan of the sky, from my left to right, came the formation, v shape, tight this time, and the strip got louder i would see the craft. it was as if they were there watching the whole thing, as if a tourist, but from above. in all i saw the craft formation at least 10 times that night. i saw and watched the red lights high in the sky, over the casino most of the time in or near the same play box in the sky 4 times. after that point a feeling of real fear or tension within my self over came me, not knowing what these things are , where they come from, who's flying them. i went to bed. we were to stay another night but, the wife thought we should leave early, the wind had been blowing 2 of the 4 days we were there, and it was calm. so we packed up and rolled of to california. i'm home now, i look at my night sky from time to time and wonder, is there an answer to the question, what did i see?","distance":"501 Feet - 1
